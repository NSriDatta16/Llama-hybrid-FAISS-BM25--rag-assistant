I'm a little late in responding but I can give you some anecdotal experience. We had some matrix multiplication routines that were originally coded in C# using pointers and unsafe code. This proved to be a bottleneck in our application and we then used pinning+P/Invoke to call into a C++ version of the Matrix multiplication routine and got a factor of 2 improvement. This was a while ago with .NET 1.1, so things might be better now. As others point out, this proves nothing, but it was an interesting exercise. I also agree with thAAAnos, if you algorithm really has to be "as fast as possible" leverage IPL or, if you must, consider a GPU implementation.
