Why are ("non-parametric") Gaussian Processes a good fit for Bayesian Optimization

I understand why Gaussian Processes are considered "non-parametric" , but why do most authors use non-parametric models for Bayesian Optimization? What's the benefit of using such models as opposed to parametric approaches? (GLM, etc.)
