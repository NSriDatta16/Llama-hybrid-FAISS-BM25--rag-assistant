Your interpretation of the corners is not correct. You'd have three squares *, formed from the corners $(x_1,x_1)$, $(x_2,x_2)$ and $(x_3,x_3)$ taken in pairs. Each square is red, so the net sum of coloured areas must be red. * quite literally the variance is a scaled version of this "sum of squares", since it corresponds to the average-sum-of-squared-pairwise-differences version of the variance formula.
