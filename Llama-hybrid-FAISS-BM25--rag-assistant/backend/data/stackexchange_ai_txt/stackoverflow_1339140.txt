This appears to be a bug in .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/971052 I fixed it by: Clearing the .NET Online Cache from a command prompt: “rundll32 dfshim CleanOnlineAppCache” Deinstall all .NET-applications that could have a reference to the same problematic assembly. Install all applications again.
