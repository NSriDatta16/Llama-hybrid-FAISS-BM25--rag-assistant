Equality of means between groups when variances within the same group is not constant

Suppose I have 50 different brands. I am recording Variable1, Variable2,Variable3,Variable4,....,Variable10 for 50 different brands. I observed each brand 6 times. So my data will look like the following: Brand name on the first column, Variable1 on the second and so on. I have total of 300 observations. Goal: 1. My goal is to test if there is a difference in Variable1 between brands. I could simply use ANOVA but assumption of constant variance is not satisfied. What should I do? I should perform goal#1 for all the variables (Variable2,....,Variable10). What I did was I created a matrix of sample standard deviation by brand. Then I ran PCA on the matrix of sample standard deviation. I also created a matrix of sample mean by brand. After that I used cluster analysis (kmeans) on the matrix of sample mean and grouped the brands based on cluster. Now the brands falling in the same cluster will hopefully have common variance. Now I need to test if there is difference in Variable1 between the clusters(groups)? I also need to test if there is difference in Variable2 between the clusters. I need to do this upto Variable10.
