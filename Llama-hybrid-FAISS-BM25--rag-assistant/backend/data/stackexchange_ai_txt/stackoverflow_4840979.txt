how can I make the elements in a jQuery UI sortable container be freely draggable?

Basically, I want to be able to freely drag items in a container and leave them at whatever position I desire.. However, if there are two items touching each other, dragging the one on the right towards the one on the left should cause the two to swap positions (hence sortability)... However, if I do: container.sortable({axis: 'x'}); item_1.draggable({axis: 'x'}); item_2.draggable({axis: 'x'}); container.append(item_1); container.append(item_2); then they are not sortable, just draggable... How can I accomplish this?
