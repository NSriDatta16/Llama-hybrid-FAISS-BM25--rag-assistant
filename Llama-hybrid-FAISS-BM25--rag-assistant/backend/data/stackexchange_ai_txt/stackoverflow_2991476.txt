You can use a (doubly) linked list and still keep your memory contiguous. Allocate a big block of memory to hold all your nodes and keep track of which nodes you have allocated for data storage. You have several options for managing your preallocated memory. One method is to use a queue or stack of available nodes, you can take a free node out, write your data and add it the linked list. When you are done with a node remove it from the linked list and put it back into the queue/stack. Depending on your stack/queue implementation, this could amount to maintaining two linked lists. A little thought should yeild a design that is efficient and parsimonious with data structures and underlying code.
