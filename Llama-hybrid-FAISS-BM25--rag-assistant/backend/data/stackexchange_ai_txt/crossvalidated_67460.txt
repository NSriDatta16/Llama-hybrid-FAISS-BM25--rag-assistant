Confidence interval for predicted probabilities

I fitted the following multinomial regression: library(car) p1 The output is a table of the predicted probabilities for every coefficient. I can also order the results for the confidence interval of the coefficents with: confint(test) My question is: is it possible to get the results for the confidence interval for the predicted probabilities? It means for every amount in the "pre" output! PS: I found a similar question here in ["plotting confidence intervals"][1] Plotting confidence intervals for the predicted probabilities from a logistic regression The main answer is perfect for my question, but I do not know how to combine with multinomial regression. I hope you understand my bad english :) Thank you for your help
