25 tables with 3-4k rows in each is not what I'd call "small" for xml; in particular, it isn't easy to jump to just the right data in xml... Have you considered a database, such as SQL Server Express Edition. Free, and more than up to this job. Re storage; if you are using the inbuilt serialization a DataSet , this should just work automatically. Of course, the xml will then be specific to DataSet ... I honestly don't recommend the DataSet /xml approach.
