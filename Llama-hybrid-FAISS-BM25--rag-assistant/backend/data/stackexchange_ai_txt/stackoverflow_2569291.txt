Content-Length seems to be 12, not 20. http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.4 : When a Content-Length is given in a message where a message-body is allowed, its field value MUST exactly match the number of OCTETs in the message-body. HTTP/1.1 user agents MUST notify the user when an invalid length is received and detected Doesn't that mean FF violates specs? (Well, you are using HTTP/1.0, so maybe not.)
