Logit coefficients greater than 1?

I am attempting to work out probability of sale (binary variable) via a logistic regression to deal with perfect predictors (separation). I am using a firthlogit command in Stata. When I run the command many of my coefficients are greater than 1, how can this be? Some example coefficients would be: (coefficent, s.e) WEEKEND | -2.034167 1.231037 PRIME | -1.268926 1.233 FSQ1 | 6.531973 3.790429
