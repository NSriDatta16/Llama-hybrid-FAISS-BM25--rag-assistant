The C++03 standard added wording to make it clear that vector elements must be contiguous. C++03 23.2.4 Paragraph 1 contains the following language which is not in the C++98 standard document: The elements of a vector are stored contiguously, meaning that if v is a vector where T is some type other than bool , then it obeys the identity &v[n] == &v[0] + n for all 0 . Herb Sutter talks about this change in one of his blog entries, Cringe not: Vectors are guaranteed to be contiguous : ... contiguity is in fact part of the vector abstraction. It’s so important, in fact, that when it was discovered that the C++98 standard didn’t completely guarantee contiguity, the C++03 standard was amended to explicitly add the guarantee.
