ADO.Net EF4 Inheritance Problem. Create Child object from Base object

I have a simple EF4 Entity model in which i have a base Entity User and a child entity Tutor . The application demands that any new entry is by default of type User (base class) which later can be upgraded to a Tutor . So basically i wish to convert a pre existing User object into a Tutor object. I think i can do it by creating a new Tutor object with data from existing User, add extra fields, delete the old user object and try inserting the new Tutor object with same Id. Is there any elegant way to achieve this.
