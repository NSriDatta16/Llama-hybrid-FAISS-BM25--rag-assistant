Alternatives to Vector Autoregression

If you have multivariate (ie n time series) and you want to predict one of these time series using data from every column, you could use a VAR model (Vector Autoregression). What I dont understand is why I havent seen VAR model with moving averages taken into account, like with univariate ARMA models. Do they exist or why dont they? What are the alternatives to this for predicting one time series, using data from n time series? See 1.2 in here https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/09/multivariate-time-series-guide-forecasting-modeling-python-codes/
