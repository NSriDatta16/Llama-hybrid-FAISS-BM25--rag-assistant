Sending a TAB control character in Java

I am using the Ganymede ssh library ( http://www.ganymed.ethz.ch/ssh2/ ) to connect to a ssh server (obviously ;)). Normally, when using the bash, when a user presses the TAB key on the keyboard a list of possible command completions appears. I want to achieve the same behaviour, but send the tab character manually. Unfortunately I am not aware how to do this. Sending "\t" does not work. Edit: The solution must be a generic which does not only work in bash, but also in other programs, like octave (open source matlab implementation with command line, just an example where bash commands cannot be applied).
