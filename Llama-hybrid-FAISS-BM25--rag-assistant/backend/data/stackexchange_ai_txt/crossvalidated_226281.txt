What does "performing PCA on a single time series" mean/do?

Yes, I already looked here but that's too high profile for my humble mind (and it's not exactly what I'm looking for). Imagine we have a timecourse with time on the x-axis and some value on the y-axis (e.g. a signal). Now I can sample this timecourse to obtain a vector in a multidimensional vector space. My question: What does it mean if I perform a PCA on this data? What is the PCA of a single vector (such as the timeseries) and how can I interpret the resulting eigenvectors?
