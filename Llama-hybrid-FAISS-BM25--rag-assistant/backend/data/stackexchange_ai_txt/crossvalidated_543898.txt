Should we choose neural network with highest performance (F1/Accuracy) on the validation set, or with lowest validation loss?

I am doing a text classification task through fine-tuning pre-trained language models + classification head. I would like to know whether I should choose the neural network with the highest performance on the validation set, or the network with the lowest loss on the validation loss.
