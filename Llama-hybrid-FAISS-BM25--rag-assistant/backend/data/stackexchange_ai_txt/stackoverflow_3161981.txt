When creating ui1 , drag two basic widgets (i.e. QWidget ) into the UI. Then, in designer, you can right click and choose Promote To ... . Within that dialog specify the "Promoted class name" and the "Header file" that correspond to ui2 and ui3 . You won't be able to see a live preview using this method, but when the header and class name are specified correctly it will compile and work correctly.
