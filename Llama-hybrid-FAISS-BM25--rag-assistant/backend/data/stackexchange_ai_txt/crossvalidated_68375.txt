You should calculate a posterior Credible Interval about your estimate. These are usually calculated from quantiles or using the "Highest Posterior Density (HPD)" region. This is slightly different from the "precision" of the estimate, but I believe you are thinking of this from a frequentist perspective and are sort of missing the forest for the trees. The credible interval is the Bayesian analog to the confidence interval, and I believe it is the quantity you should be interested in.
