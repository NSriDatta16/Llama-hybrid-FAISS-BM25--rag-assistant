Yes. You should be using the Boost smart pointers for most everything if you have them available. Remember this, while you can and from your comments do use pointers effectively, the person/people that come after you may not. Using the smart pointers can and will (hopefully, can't guard against bad code) mitigate some of these issues. I'd also recommend using scoped_ptr inside your classes even if your classes are designed well. It'll help guard against issues the next guy could/might/most likely will introduce when faced with a naked pointer. It'll encourage them to use them too, by example. The last thing you want is to have to track down a memory issue because someone forgot to initialize the pointer to NULL and it's passing the if statement check.
