Execute a python script stored on a web server using beautiful soup

I am trying to create a simple form/script combination that will allow someone to replace the contents of a certain div in an html file with the text they input in an html form on a separate page. The script works fine if everything is local : the script is local, i set the working directory to where my html file is, and i pass the parameter myself when I run the script. When I load everything to my hosted site server, however, it gives me a 500 error. I have been able to execute a simple python script that i stored on my site, and JustHost, my hosting service, has told me that BeuatifulSoup has been added to my server. Here is the script, with the parameter "textcontent" coming from an html form which works fine. My scirpt is rooted under public_html/cgi-bin/ and the html I am trying to read and write resides on the root of public_html. I'm guessing either the html file isn't being found or beautifulsoup isn't actually available on my server...anyway way to test that?? #!/usr/bin/python #import beautifulsoup from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup # Import modules for CGI handling import cgi, cgitb, traceback # Create instance of FieldStorage try: form = cgi.FieldStorage() def text_replace(word): f = open('/public_html/souptest2.html', 'r') soup = BeautifulSoup(f.read()) f.close() text = soup.find('div', attrs={'id': 'sampletext'}).string text.replaceWith(word) deploy_html = open('/public_html/souptest2.html', 'w') deploy_html.write(str(soup)) deploy_html.close() # Get data from fields if form.getvalue('textcontent'): text_content = form.getvalue('textcontent') text_replace(text_content) else: text_content = "Not entered" except: deploy_html = open('../souptest2.html', 'w') traceback.print_exc(deploy_html) deploy_html.close() I have tried to load that as a script and run it from a url and still get a 500 error, with no output on my output page in order to debug using traceback...
