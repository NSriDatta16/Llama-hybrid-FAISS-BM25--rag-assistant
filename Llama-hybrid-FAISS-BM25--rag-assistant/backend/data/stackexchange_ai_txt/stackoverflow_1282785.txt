The most effective way to speed up a large test suite is to run it incrementally, so that only tests that touch code changed since the last test run are re-executed. After all, the fastest tests will always be those which are not executed. 8^) The hard part is actually getting this to work. I am currently working in incremental testing for JUnit 4, which is part of the "JMockit Coverage" tool in the JMockit developer testing toolkit. It's still immature, but I believe it will work well.
