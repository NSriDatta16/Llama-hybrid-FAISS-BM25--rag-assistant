couchdb replication

From what I know, to avoid conflicts, couch will reject saving conflict document in single node, and in other hand, couch will allow conflicts in the middle of replication.see Conflict avoidance However, is it possible to configure couch and reject conflicts when replicate to remote server(i.e. push)? This is very useful in the offline mode, in such case which we have a center repository. This is useful because we have to resolve conflicts in the client and if auto merge fails we need involve end-users. This is more like git behavior and different with Amazon Dynamo(which encourages users to perform conflict resolution on read). Thanks
