How to model noisy time series data? Does non-linear modelling help?

Is it possible to model time series data that fluctuates. The main solution is to take first differences and make it easier to fit conventional models. What if non-linear models are built? Can they solve a noisy time series (e.g stock returns) and make good predictions? Can adding a square term or a trigonometric term or something else non-linear work? Has some researched the topic?
