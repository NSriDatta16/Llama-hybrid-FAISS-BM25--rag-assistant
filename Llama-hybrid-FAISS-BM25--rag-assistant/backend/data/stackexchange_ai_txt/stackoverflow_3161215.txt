The 960 Grid System has a nice robust yet flexible system for generating columns - either fixed or fluid. It really encourages a modular approach to your styling which is my personal preference. I don't usually use what it generates out of the box though, I modify it to suit. http://960.gs/ Here's an example of one with 3 columns: http://www.spry-soft.com/grids/grid/?column_width=300&column_amount=3&gutter_width=20 There are lots of great alternatives to this of course, like the yahoo Grid Builder: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/
