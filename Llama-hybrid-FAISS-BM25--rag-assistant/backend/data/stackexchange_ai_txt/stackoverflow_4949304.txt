Quick question about glColorMask and its work

I want to render depth buffer to do some nice shadow mapping. My drawing code though, consists of many shader switches. If I set glColorMask(0,0,0,0) and leave all shader programs, textures and others as they are, and just render the depth buffer, will it be 'OK' ? I mean, if glColorMask disables the "write of color components" , does it mean that per-fragment shading IS NOT going to be performed ?
