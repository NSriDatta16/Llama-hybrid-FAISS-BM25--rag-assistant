It is not C# code but here is an Delphi example of a way to solve this problem. It uses the IOLEObject to draw whatever is stored instead of trying to read out the raw data. Steps: Read the Access Header in front of the OLE Object Read out the OLE1 stream Convert the OLE1 stream to an OLE2 IStorage Object Use OLELoad to "run" the OLE Ojbect. Call OLEDraw to draw out the image to a canvas of your choice.
