How to execute a Groovy Script from my Grails app?

Well, it seems a simple task but I didn't manage to make it run. I have a groovy script that runs fine under Windows Vista when calling from prompt: > cd MY_GAILS_PROJECT_DIR > groovy cp src/groovy scripts/myscript.groovy Now, I want to execute this script (and passing to it some input arguments) through my my Maintenance Service Class (called from a controller) as below, class MaintenanceService { def executeMyScript() { "groovy cp src/groovy scripts/myscript.groovy".execute() } } It does not work at all! I don't even manage to have the execute() method recognizing any command (like "cd .".execute() ) throwing exception: Error 500: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "cd": CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified 1- How can I execute a groovy script from my grails application? 2- What are the best practices here? For instance, should I use the QuartzPlugin and then the triggerNow method for executing a script? should I use a Gant Task? If yes, how to do it? Thank you.
