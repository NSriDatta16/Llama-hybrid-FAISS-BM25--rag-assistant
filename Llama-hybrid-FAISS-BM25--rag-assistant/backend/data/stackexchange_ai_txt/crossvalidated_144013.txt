Smoothing - when to use it and when not to?

There is quite an old post on William Briggs' blog which looks at the pitfalls of smoothing data and carrying that smoothed data through to analysis. The key argument is namely: If, in a moment of insanity, you do smooth time series data and you do use it as input to other analyses, you dramatically increase the probability of fooling yourself! This is because smoothing induces spurious signalsâ€”signals that look real to other analytical methods. No matter what you will be too certain of your final results! However, I am struggling to find comprehensive discussions as to when to smooth and when not to. Is it only frowned upon to smooth when using that smoothed data as an input to other analysis or are there other situations when smoothing is not advised? Conversely, are there situations where smoothing is advised?
