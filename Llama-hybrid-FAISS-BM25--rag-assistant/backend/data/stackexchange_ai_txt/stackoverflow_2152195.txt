Where can I find a single example expressed in Ivy, Maven, Gant, and Gradle?

I'd like to find a simple, non-trivial Java project that is expressed in terms of Ant + Ivy, Maven, Gant, and Gradle. I'm not interested in each tool's varied sample demos. Where can I find such an example, for reference?
