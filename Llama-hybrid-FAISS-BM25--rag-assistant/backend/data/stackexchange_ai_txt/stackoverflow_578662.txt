Best way to handle LARGE strings of text going into a database?

I have built a number of solutions in the past in which people enter data via a webform, validation checks are applied, regex in some cases and everything gets stored in a database. This data is then used to drive output on other pages. I have a special case here where a user wants to copy/paste HUGE amounts of text (multiple paragraphs with various headers, links and etc throughout) -- what is the best way to handle this before it goes into a database to provide the best output when it needs to come back out? So far the best I have come up with is sticking all the output from these fields in PRE tags and using regex to add links where appropriate. I have a database put together with a list of special keywords that need to be bold or have other styles applied to them which works fine. So I can make this work using these approaches but it just seems to me that there is probably a much more graceful way of doing it. Nicholas
