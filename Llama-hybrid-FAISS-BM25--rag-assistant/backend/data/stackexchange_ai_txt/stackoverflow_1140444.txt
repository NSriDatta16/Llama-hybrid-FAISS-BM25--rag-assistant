How to limit RAM usage in Oracle 9

I've got Oracle database that is used as a storage for web services. Most of the time data are in read-only mode and cached in RAM directly by the service. However during the system startup all data are pulled once from Oracle and the database tries to be smart and keeps the data in RAM (1GB). How can I limit/control the amount of RAM available to the Oracle 9 instance?
