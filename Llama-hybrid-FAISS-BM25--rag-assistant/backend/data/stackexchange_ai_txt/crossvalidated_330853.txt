This is called prediction of the remaining life. There are many methods to do this, parametric and semiparametric. See for instance: Prediction of remaining life of power transformers based on left truncated and right censored lifetime data The idea is to estimate the probability that individual $j$ will fail/die at time $t$ given that it has survived until $t_j$. This is $P(T\leq t\vert T>t_j)$, with $t>t_j$.
