If your target is a public website then the future will be HTML, although not necessarily "traditional" HTML. Frameworks such as JQuery, improved common features of browsers (such as cross domain messaging) and increasing average speed of PCs may lead to richer experiences for the user without resorting to things like Flash or Silverlight. Latest advances standards such as HTML5 and CSS 3 sound promising but I can't see them having the impact they promise in the 3-5 year time scale. Not unless the industry finds a way to convince the majority to move away from IE. Hence for the public current HTML/CSS/Javascript will continue to be the main stay of web development. Intranet will be a whole different ball of wax, Silverlight and its community hasn't yet matured yet but I predict that the SL will become very popular in this arena.
