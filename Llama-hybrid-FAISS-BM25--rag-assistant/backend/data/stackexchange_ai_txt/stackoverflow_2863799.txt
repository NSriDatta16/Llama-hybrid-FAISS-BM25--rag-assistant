How to insert exisitng documents stored on NFTS in sql server filestream's storage

I am doing investigation on filestream (asking on stackoverflow while reading whitepapers and google searching), in my current screnario documents are managed in this way: 1) I have a DB table where I keep the document id and the doc path (like \fileserver\DocumentRepository\file000000001.pdf) 2) I have a document folder (\fileserver\DocumentRepository) where I store the documents Of course I need to change this to a varbinary(max)/filestream storage. What is the best way to perform this task? Is it possible to say "\fileserver\DocumentRepository\file000000001.pdf" is assigned to a varbinary(max) field or I have to explicitly insert it? So somehow tell to the varbinary(max) field: "now you are a pointer to the existing document".
