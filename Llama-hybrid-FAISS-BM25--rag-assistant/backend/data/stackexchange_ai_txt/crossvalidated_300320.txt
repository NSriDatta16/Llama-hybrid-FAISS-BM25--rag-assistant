One general approach is to try oversampling more/undersampling less important data. With respect to weights it will depend on the algorihtm. In Python it seems many algorithms in scikit-learn have it, for example SVMs , Stochastic Gradient Descent classifiers , and Random Forests have it, though unfortunately I can't find general documentation on this parameter.
