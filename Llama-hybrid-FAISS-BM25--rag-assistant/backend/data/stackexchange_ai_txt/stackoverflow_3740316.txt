It's all in the docs: ceilingKey(K key) Returns the least key greater than or equal to the given key, or null if there is no such key. So, findFirstValueGreaterThan(sortedMap, 28d) should be sortedMap.ceilingKey(28d) Pay attention at difference between "greater than" and "greater than or equal to", though.
