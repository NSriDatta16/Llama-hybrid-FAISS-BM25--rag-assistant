Parsing Size and Position Objects from an XmlDocument?

Is there more elegant syntax for reading/parsing Size and Point objects in an Xml document? Source Xml Nodes: {Width=64, Height=64} 20 20 Currently I use: For Size: Dim sizeNode As String = objSize.InnerText Dim sizeText() As String = sizeNode.Split(CChar("=")) Dim width As Integer = XmlConvert.ToInt32(sizeText(1).Split(CChar(","))(0)) Dim height As Integer = XmlConvert.ToInt32(sizeText(2).TrimEnd(CChar("}"))) Dim newSize as New Size(width, height) For Point: Dim newLocation As Point newLocation = New Point(XmlConvert.ToInt32(objNode.InnerText), newLocation.Y) newLocation = New Point(newLocation.X, XmlConvert.ToInt32(objNode.InnerText)) I have a nagging feeling like I am missing something? I have control over both the source nodes and the parsing code... So I am just being too lazy with my XmlNode creation? Regardless is there any benefit to using XmlConvert v.s. using integer.parse (or .tryparse)?
