Jquery, No X-Requested-With=XMLHttpRequest in ajax request header?

SOME TIMES there is no X-Requested-With header, sometimes there is. I checked in firebug and found that, don't know why. So when I use request.is_ajax in django, it fails sometimes. Anyone know how to fix it? OK, now it happened again. I opened the page and then left for supper for a long while , when I came back, it happened again. I recorded request header in firbugs: Request with X-Requested-with: Host localhost:8000 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; zh-CN; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 Accept text/html, / Accept-Language zh-cn,zh;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset GB2312,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 300 Connection keep-alive X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest Referer http://localhost:8000/gallery/ Cookie xxx Request without X-Requested-with: Host localhost:8000 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; zh-CN; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, / ;q=0.8 Accept-Language zh-cn,zh;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset GB2312,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 300 Connection keep-alive Referer http://localhost:8000/gallery/ Cookie xxx
