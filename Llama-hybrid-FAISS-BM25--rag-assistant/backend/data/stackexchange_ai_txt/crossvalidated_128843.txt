How to interpret and translate this statement from a Wikipedia article on PCA?

I have to write a Wikipedia article about Principal Component Analysis in my own language and partially I translate it from the English version, but I don't understand a statement from it, more exactly a part from it. So it goes like this (emphasis added): Mathematically, the transformation is defined by a set of $p$-dimensional vectors of weights or loadings $\mathbf{w}_{(k)}= (w_1, \ldots, w_k)_{(k)}$ that map each row vector $\mathbf{x}_{(i)}$ of $\mathbf{X}$ to a new vector of principal component scores $\mathbf{t}_{(i)}= (t_1,\ldots, t_p)_{(i)}$, given by $\mathbf{t}_{k(i)}=\mathbf{x}_{(i)}\cdot\mathbf{w}_{(k)}$ in such a way that the individual variables of $\mathbf{t}$ considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from $\mathbf{x}$, with each loading vector $\mathbf{w}$ constrained to be a unit vector. I don't quite understand what "considered over the data set" means. I understand the rest of it, but I'm not a native English speaker and I don't understand this expression.
