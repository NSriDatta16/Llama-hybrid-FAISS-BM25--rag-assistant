Do all time series necessarily have a level?

Most articles on time series modeling mention level, seasonality, and trend as components of a time series. A time series need not have seasonality or trend. In one of the courses that I've taken up we were taught that level is a necessary component of a time series. Is this true? If yes, then what exactly would be the level for a time series that only linearly increases with time? Would it simply be a rolling mean?
