Simple Java Query - Getting a Result from a Integer

I have been set an assignment where I must find the average of a list of positive numbers enterd by the user, the amount of numbers entered is unknown. So far I have got the program to add all numbers that have been entered (the entry teminates when a user enters 0). I do not want the answer to this question on here because I am really trying to learn this fast! I am having trouble with the while statement, I wanted to say WHILE ( numberentered = 0 ); ...... but this doesnt seem to work I originally did it like so: while ( numberentered >= 1 ); System.out.print (numbersum); but this still jumps out of the do loop when a negative number is entered. Any idea guys.... If you understand my question but it is still worded very badly... please edit. Thank you.
