I wouldn't recommend it unless you really know what you're doing. Off the top of my head: Entities stored in httpsession would have to be fully serializable, otherwise non-inproc session storage would break. Lazy loading would break unless you explicitly reattach the entity to the new session. If you want to have cross-request conversations check out NHibernate.Burrow which is a framework designed for this specific purpose.
