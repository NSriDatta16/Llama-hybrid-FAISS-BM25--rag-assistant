Since Visual Studio has tools for navigating quickly to methods by name, I prefer to put private member variables and constructors close to the top and group methods by functionality (ie, helper methods are close by to the methods that call them). I also group properties together. If a class becomes substantial, I make use of #region directives to show the organization.
