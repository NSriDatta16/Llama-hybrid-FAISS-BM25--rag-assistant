When estimating a mixed effects model we have to distinguish between marginal (sometimes called "unconditional") and conditional estimates. Conditioning refers to whether these estimates are subject-specific or not. In a way, all models other than conditional GLMMs produce some variation of a marginal estimators. Please note that while I mention "subjects" here, this extends to an arbitrary level on nesting. The practical implications of this distinction is that when we are making estimates about new "unseen" individuals, e.g. subjects $s_{n+1}$ and $s_{n+2}$ , we can only predict their marginal estimates. That is because we assume that any difference between them and our training sample will be due to random variation which is by definition "0" in expectation. (For example in a single-level mixed effects model with $y_{i,j} = X_{ij}\beta + Z_{ij}u_i + \epsilon_{ij}$ , our working assumption for the random effect $u_i$ is that $u_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2 D)$ .) As such having conditional estimates for $s_{n+1}$ and $s_{n+2}$ is inapplicable; if we assume there are any systemic differences between these new subjects and our training sample, those differences will be realised in the fixed effects ("explanatory variables") rather than the random effects ("nuisance parameters") of our model. Two relatively mature reference on the matter are: A Comparison of Cluster-Specific and Population-Averaged Approaches for Analyzing Correlated Binary Data (1991) by Neuhaus et al. and Marginalized multilevel models and likelihood inference (2000) by Heagerty and Zeger; CV.SE has a related thread on Difference between marginal and conditional treatment effect? Relating to regression vs. propensity score methods that will be handy to check too. West et al.'s " Linear Mixed Models: A Practical Guide Using Statistical Software " (see Sect. 2.3.2 on the " The Marginal Model Implied by an LMM " particularly) is also a good and easy-to-follow resource on the matter.
