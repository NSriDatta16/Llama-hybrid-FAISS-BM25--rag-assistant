I just downloaded your test project and here is what I think. You've made your rootviewcontroller in an odd way. It's a specialization of UITableViewController, but you've added your own UITableView as a child view, along with your UIImageView. There is a much easier way. Your RootViewController should simply be regular UITableViewController-derived class, with no changes to the structure in Interface Builder. If you want to define your UIImageView in UInterface Builder then drag a UIImageView into the XIB but not as a child of the UITableView. Make it a top level object. Hook it up to a new IBOutlet you add in code to RootViewController: @interface RootViewController : UITableViewController { IBOutlet UIImageView* _backgroundImageView; } Be sure to set the image in the UIImageView in Interface Builder. In your RootViewController.m file, add the following: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; self.tableView.backgroundView = _backgroundImageView; } I modified your test project and posted it here: http://www.codeveloper.com/TestCustomCellWithViewBackground-TomSwift.zip
