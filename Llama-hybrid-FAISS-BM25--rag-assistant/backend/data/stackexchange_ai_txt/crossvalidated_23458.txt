From how I understand your question, the points in the data are interchangeable and don't come with any ordering, i.e. you have a set of points for each example. This setting is different from the "Missing Value" setting that jb. described. I know about two commonly used methods for this problem, which are actually based on your ideas. A good baseline would probably be to just average all points within one example, but that usually doesn't work well. To aggregate multiple points to a single feature, bag of words (or bag of feature) representations are quite commonly used, for example in computer vision. The idea is to cluster all points in your training set (using for example k-means) and then describe each point by its cluster. For each example you then get a histogram over which clusters occur how often. To use all pairs of points, you can make use of set kernels. This might work best with using SVMs but will probably also work with any learning algorithm that can be kernelized or make use of a compatibility function between inputs. Set kernels are basically a way to compute the similarity of two sets of features, as in your setting.
