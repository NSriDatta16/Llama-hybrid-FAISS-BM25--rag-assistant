How safe is SQLite WAL on power failures?

In the SQLite documentation on the write-ahead-log feature introduced in version 3.7, there are some comments which confused me a bit. The linked page says "syncing the content to the disk is not required, as long as the application is willing to sacrifice durability following a power loss". Then a couple of paragraphs down, it says "Checkpointing does require sync operations in order to avoid the possibility of database corruption following a power loss or hard reboot"". So is my database at greater risk of corruption on power loss if I use WAL?
