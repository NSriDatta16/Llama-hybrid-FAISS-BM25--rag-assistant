Choosing the parameters for an artificial neural network for time-series regression in R

I'm trying to build an artificial neural network (ANN) using the R "neuralnet" package, to predict streamflow from snow albedo (reflectance of the snow; controls the amount of heat absorbed by the snow, and therefore controls its melt), precipitation, air temperature, and a temporal variable, 'day of the year'. All the above variables are time-series with 4383 values each between the years 2002 and 2013, with daily temporal frequency. Simpler statistical models have not worked because of the complex autocorrelated and lagged relationship between the predictor and predictors. I have the following questions about building the ANN: What number of hidden layers should I use when building the model? How does this choice affect the model? Should I change the 'threshold' parameter from the default (0.01)? My flow values fluctuate between 0.5 and 134.82 cubic-foot per second (cfs), with a mean of 8.5 cfs. Ideally, my flow prediction errors should not be greater than 1-2 cfs. Will the choice of algorithm affect the prediction accuracy? Should I change any of the other parameters in neuralnet? Should I include any other variables (lags, temporal variables etc) in my model? Also, would any other machine learning or statistical method be more suitable for this task? My data is highly non-linear, with some seasonality every year, and PACF and CCF plots indicate lags at all lag periods between -30 and +30 days. I would be happy to answer any questions about the data, or about what I've already tried (GAMs, GLMs, Decision Trees and Random Forests). Thank you.
