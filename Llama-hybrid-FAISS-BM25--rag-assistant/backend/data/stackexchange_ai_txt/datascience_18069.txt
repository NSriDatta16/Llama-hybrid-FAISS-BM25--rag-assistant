PCA is a very common technique, so you might want to google around. PCA is awfully common for data visualisation, but it has many other uses. For instance, if you want to fit a linear regression on average income. Now, you have collected 500+ predictors, but lots of them are correlated like: How much the person pays tax last year How much the person pays tax the year before How much the person pays tax three years ago .... Those predictors are highly correlated and might present modelling problems in your linear model. A very common technique is to use PCA to reduce into a set of reduced orthogonal principal components. You can then use those components for building your model. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22665/how-to-use-principal-components-as-predictors-in-glm
