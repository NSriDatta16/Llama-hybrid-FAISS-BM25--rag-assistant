Please enlighten me with Platt's SMO algorithm (for SVM)

From A_Roadmap_to_SVM_SMO.pdf , pg 12. (source: postimg.org ) Assume I am using linear kernel, how will I be able to get both the first and second inner product? My guess, inner product of datapoint with datapoint j labelled class A for the first inner product of the equation and inner product of datapoint j with datapoints labelled class B for second inner product?
