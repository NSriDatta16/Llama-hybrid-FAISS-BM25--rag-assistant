SET SCAN OFF with Thin Driver

I use DbUnit to populate test database with test data before executing tests. Fragment of my ant script: In my test data I have a couple of values with &xx; values. This data does not get inserted as it is interpreted by oracle as variabl. I would like to change session property SET SCAN OFF when connecting to database. I found out that I can pass it in as JVM param using -Dparam=value . I tried -Dscan=off but it didn't work.
