I know if I were using SVN I would just keep my entire " ~/code/ " directory in a large repository, but I understand this is not a good way to do things with Git. Yes it is. But once you have that large repository, you have to distinguish the parts in it which will evolve with their own lifecycle and their own tag. Those would be submodules that will be, as you said, a git repo of their own. So you still get: code .git (main project) python .git (main sub-project for all python-related stuff) project1 .git (first submodule) project2 .git (first submodule) ... scripts .git (one submodules for all your scripts) sandbox .git (sandbox submodule) docs .git (docs submodule) java .git (main sub-project for all java-related stuff) ... (repeat same organization) Note: the chronology of projects creation is still better managed with a naming convention. With that many submodules, you can: actually clone and work on any part of your collection without necessarily get everything or you can re-built the same old organization you had in the first place
