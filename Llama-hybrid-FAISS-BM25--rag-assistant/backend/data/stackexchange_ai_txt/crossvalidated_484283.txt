As appear from the comments the meaning of SEM (Structural Equation Model) is matter of debate among researchers. Sometimes peoples/books speak about SIM (Simultaneous Equation Model) that, algebraically speaking, seems a synonym but it can convey more general ideas. Some confusions can come from conflation between SEM and SIM. Infact the word “structural” was proposed exactly in order to move beyond purely statistical associations. So It seem me that SEM are, or should be, causal by definition while SIM not necessarily. This discussion can help: Difference Between Simultaneous Equation Model and Structural Equation Model Then Can SEM permit to understand the causality ad his direction between the different models and regressors? Yes. SEM was proposed exactly for this reason. However keep attention about the word "understand". Do not forget that causal assumptions needed, and them are in the responsibility of the modeler.
