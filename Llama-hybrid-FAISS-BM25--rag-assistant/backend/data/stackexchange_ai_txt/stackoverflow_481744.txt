The yield keyword is not essential, but it makes things hugely easier when using the CCR. It is required to spawn tasks in a handler method, which can be done by simply using primitives, but not nearly so elegantly. I've never seen any CCR code written in VB.NET, but I suppose there are workarounds to return an IEnumerable object (though I cannot confirm this, as it is has been a long time since I've written any VB.NET). Last time I heard, there was a fair possibility that VB.NET 10 will be getting an equivalent of the yield keyword.
