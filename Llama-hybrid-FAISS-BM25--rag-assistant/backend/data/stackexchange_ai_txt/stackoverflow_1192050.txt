How are the MVC and AJAX concepts related?

I'm currently diving into web development after ten years of desktop development and I'm trying to get a high level grasp on the many concepts I'm learning. The two most recent concepts I've been reading up on are MVC (specifically ASP.NET MVC) and AJAX. I understand MVC is a pattern used to separate logic and data and AJAX is a combination of various web technologies for creating asynchronous and dynamic web pages. How are the two related? Can or should the two be used together? If so, can you give some simple examples? I apologize if these are strange questions and I'm comparing apples to oranges, forgive me as I'm still a huge gigantic noob.
