What I understand from your post is that you are trying to add a supplier to an existing Company record. So you are creating a new Organization record, attaching it with existing Company record and calling saveOrUpdate(). So, when you don't set cascadeType=All, hibernate will of-course complain as you haven't yet saved the new Organization record in the database. When you do use cascadeType=All, hibernate saves the new Organization record in the database which in your case has an id=5, and then updates the existing Company record with this id. Hence, hibernate is functioning properly and doing everything you are ASKING it to do for you. Maybe you should elaborate on your problem and state what you exactly want to do, because whatever you have mentioned in your post is the expected behavior of hibernate.
