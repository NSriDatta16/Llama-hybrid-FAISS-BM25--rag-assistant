I've worked it out and it seems to work perfectly well now. I will post my code later after I have sorted it out. In the meantime, thanks a lot for you assistance! Update Tried the code in Webkit (Safari, Chrome), Mozilla and Opera. Seems to work just fine. Looking forward to any replies. Update 2 I changed the tieExc() method to integrate Anurag's chained function call syntax. Now you can call as many functions as you want upon completion check by passing them as arguments. If you are not inclined to read the code, try it: http://jsfiddle.net/UMuj3/ (btw, JSFiddle is a really neat site!). JS-Code: /**/function meta() { var myMeta = this ; /** **/this.cllFnc = function(tgt,lgt) { //!! first function this.trigger = 0 ; //!! status flag, initially zero var that = this ; //!! required to access parent scope from inside nested function var _tgt = document.getElementById(tgt) ; //!! changes the color of the target div to signalize the function's execution _tgt.style.background = '#66f' ; alert('Calling! ...') ; setTimeout(function() { //!! simulates longer AJAX call, duration 5000ms that.trigger = 1 ; //!! status flag, one upon completion },5000) ; } ; /** **/this.rcvFnc = function(tgt) { //!! second function that should get called upon the first function's completion var _tgt = document.getElementById(tgt) ; //!! changes color of the target div to signalize the function's execution _tgt.style.background = '#f63' ; alert('... Someone picked up!') ; } ; /** **/this.callCheck = function(obj) { return (obj.trigger == 1) ? true : false ; } ; /** **/this.tieExc = function() { var functions = arguments ; var myItv = window.setInterval(function() { document.getElementById('target').innerHTML = new Date() ; //!! displays date in target div to signalize the interval increments var myCallCheck = myMeta.callCheck(functions[0]) ; //!! checks property "trigger" if(myCallCheck == true) { clearInterval(myItv) ; for(var n=1; n HTML : Javascript Phased Execution Test Page Test Div
