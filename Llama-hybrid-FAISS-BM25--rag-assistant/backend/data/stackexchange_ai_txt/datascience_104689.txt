Which AI algorithm is best for chess?

I'm working on my chess bot, and I would like to implement simple artificial intelligence for it. I'm new in it, so I'm unsure how to do it specifically on chess. I heard about Q-learning, Supervised/Unsupervised learning, Genetic algorithm, etc., which probably is not for chess. I wondered how AlphaZero was created? Probably Genetic algorithm, but chess is the game where "if A then B" might not work. It means that Q-learning is also bad for it, and so on. Any suggestions what to use? NOTE: I found dataset , though its also includes low-rated player games, so I'm unsure if it's ok to train bot with this
