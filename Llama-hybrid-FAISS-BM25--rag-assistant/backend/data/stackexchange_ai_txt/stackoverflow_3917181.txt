There are a lot of good NLP-related Perl modules, so you can pick a good set of tools for your task. However, I think there's not a toolkit such as NLTK or OpenNLP in Perl. Let's see if someone else proves me wrong ;) Just an example or an interesting Perl module for NLP: WordNet::Similarity . With respect POS tagging, there is Lingua::EN::Tagger , but I have no idea if it is any good.
