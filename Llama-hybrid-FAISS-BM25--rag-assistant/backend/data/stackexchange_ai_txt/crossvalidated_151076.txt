Your understanding is correct. There is apparently mistake in the notes and the equations should be \begin{array} mm (x) &= E[ f(x) ], \\ k(x,x') &= E[(f(x)-m(x))(f(x')-m(x'))]. \end{array} For reference, see Equation (2.13) in page 13 of C. E. Rasmussen & C. K. I. Williams, Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning, the MIT Press, 2006, available online .
