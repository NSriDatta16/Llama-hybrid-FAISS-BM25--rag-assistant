How to analyse multiple measurements for two dependent variables

I'm having trouble finding the best way to prove a significant relationship between tap pressure (on a screen) and emotion (Valence/Arousal). The research question could be formulated as this in a nutshell: Can tap pressure predict emotion? Test setup: Every participant is shown 60 pictures from which a known emotion response is elicited (i.e. every photo has valence and arousal value, both between 0.0 and 100.0). At every photo, they perform a tap of which pressure is measured. See the picture below for an example of how the data looks. Every row is a seperate photo, columns are valence and arousal values of the photo, the numbered columns are participant results. In the example you see six columns for tap pressure, in reality I have 204 columns for every photo. My question is: What is the best approach/method to discover a significant (or not) relation between tap pressure and valence/arousal values? I already tried to average the pressure of all taps, and use that as single independent variable for every picture (see picture below). This way I could apply multiple linear regression, but I can't help but feel that this is an inadequate approach considering the amount of data I gathered. Is there any other method that allows me to use all collected data rather than averaging it all?
