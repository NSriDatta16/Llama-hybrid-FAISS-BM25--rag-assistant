html formatted text and canvas

I've got a bunch of content which is html formatted, a combination of h1, ul, and p. I'm incorporating this content into a page which now uses canvas to create a gantt chart. Is there a way to include the html within the canvas? As the content currently exists as a blob, the thought of extracting it and putting it into a different format is a bit daunting, and there is little consistency across the content, meaning not each entry has all the same tags and structure. Any suggestions?
