Split plot design with psudo replicates

I am working on a project and need to analyze data that I know is an example of a split plot design but I am having trouble setting the model up correctly. Here's the situation: A bakery is testing cookies. They are interested in how sugar levels and freshness impact taste ratings (on a scale of 1 -10). They bake cookies at three sugar levels (1/2 of what the recipe calls for, the regular amount, and double what the recipe calls for) and hand out 5 cookies to 5 random customers on each of 3 days (the day the cookies are baked - day 1, the following day - day 2, and the following day - day 3). The bakery bakes 9 batches of cookies and each batch is randomly assigned to one of the 3 sugar levels. So we have information on 135 cookie ratings. I know that the 5 cookies per batch are psudoreplicates so I averaged those to come up with 3 average taste ratings per batch - one for each freshness level (day 1, day 2, and day 3). I am trying to analyze this using a mixed model with average taste rating as a response variable, sugar level and freshness as random factors and batch(sugar level) as a covariate. But my model isn't coming out correctly. Thus far I am working in Minitab but I could also use SAS.
