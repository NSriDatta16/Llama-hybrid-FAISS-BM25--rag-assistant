Is there a way to programmatically test for browser GPU acceleration?

I want to include a few "bells and whistles" features on a site I'm currently developing, but I don't want to bog down the entire machine for my users. Is there a way I can test to see if the current browser is GPU accelerated? I could just check against UserAgents, but I've always heard it's not accurate enough to trust. I guess I could build a canvas element, make quite a few drawing calls, and time them? Anything under a certain threshold I could consider good enough for my superfluous extras? Would this be good enough?
