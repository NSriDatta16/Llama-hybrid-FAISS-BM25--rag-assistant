How and when to use paired t-test?

In a study of the effectiveness of weight loss programs, 47 subjects who were overweight, at least 20% participated in a group support program for 10 weeks. The weight of each subject was taken at the beginning of the program and 6 months after the program. The paired t-test was used to assess whether the average weight loss is significant. t (46) = 4.68, p a) Why was the matched statistic appropriate? b) The level of signification: Î± = 0.01. In fact, the results are more significant than what p c) Explain to someone who does not know the statistics but is interested in weight loss what is the practical conclusion. d) Once you have given your explanation in c), how much weight on average can someone expect to lose? Here, I don't know how to apply the paired t-test? Thank you to explain it to me.
