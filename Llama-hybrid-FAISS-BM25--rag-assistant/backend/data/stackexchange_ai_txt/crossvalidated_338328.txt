Restricted Boltzmann Machines vs GAN

Can someone please tell me how RBMs and GANs compare to each other? I know that the community is more excited over GANs than RBMs at the moment. I guess it's because GANs produce better results? My question is this Can RBMs be a replacement for GAN in the sense, for example, can it generate images similar to the photo-realistic(kind of) images created GANs? Are there any advantages to using RBMs over GANs? Maybe less training/generation time? Less memory footprint? How does RBMs compare to GANs in general? Thanks!
