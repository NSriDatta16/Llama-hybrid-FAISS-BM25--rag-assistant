Is my data eligible for PCA?

I have a data set in which each subject answered a subset of questions in response to visual stimuli (picture rating). At the beginning of the experiment, every subject got assigned 2 out of 16 questions, on which a large set of images was rated. I do not have measures of all 16 variables from all subjects. My question now is: Can I do a PCA on the 16 questions even though I only have within subject variation for 2 out of 16?
