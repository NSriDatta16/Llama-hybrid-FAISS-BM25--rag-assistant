i can not use "?username=xx&pw=xxx" to get the html code. Why not? If a user can submit their login creds over HTTP, then you can do the same. You'll probably need to use POST instead of GET to submit those fields, and there may be other fields on the form that you'll need to match. But the web server doesn't (in principle) have any idea what sort of client is submitting login data to it. Now, they might screen out older, non-supported browsers, in which case your USER_AGENT field will need to be fudged to some legal value. There may be some session timeout token in the form that you need to get first and provide in your submitted data. Who knows what else they need back from you to validate the login. But if a web browser can do it, you can do it from the HTTP client methods in your app.
