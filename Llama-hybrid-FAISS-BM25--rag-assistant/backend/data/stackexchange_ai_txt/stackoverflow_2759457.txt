You are asking how to optimize the code however you should also be asking how to optimize the algorithm. There are two things that I immediately see. As "Michael Dorgan" stated generate the tree of moves once. How many broads are you generating in your tree? 362880? Your code appears to be generating redundant entries. For example, with an empty board there are actually three moves not nine moves. All other combinations are the board rotated (which are equal). You can reduce the number of boards that needs to be generated and speed up the generation of the tree. Here are the three first moves(rotate the last two board to generate the other boards) | | |X| | | |X| | | | | X| | | | | |
