Tree based feature transformation

I'm new to data science field and interested in performing prediction using clickstream data. In Practical Lessons from Predicting Clicks on Ads at Facebook paper section 3.1, a method called Decision Tree Feature Transforms confused me a lot. After searching around, there is no website / book / paper describing about this method. Can anyone give me link references describing this method in detail?
