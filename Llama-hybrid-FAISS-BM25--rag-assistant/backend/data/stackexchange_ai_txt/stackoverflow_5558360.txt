you could also do it all in mysql: SELECT AVG(Temperature) As TAverage1 FROM minute WHERE DateTime BETWEEN TIMESTAMP(DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)) AND NOW() this will get the AVG of all record with DateTime between now and an hour ago that way you don't need to build the query with php, and you don't need to use string comparison.
