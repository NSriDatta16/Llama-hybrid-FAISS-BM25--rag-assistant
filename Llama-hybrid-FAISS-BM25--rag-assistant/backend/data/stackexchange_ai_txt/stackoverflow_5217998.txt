Try: SELECT eid FROM entidades e WHERE concelho IN ( SELECT id FROM concelho WHERE concelho_t LIKE '%lisboa%' ) UNION SELECT eid FROM entidades e OR distrito IN ( SELECT id FROM distritos WHERE distrito_t LIKE '%lisboa%' ) But the real problem is lack of Normalisation in the database, the absence of a hierarchy for Country, Territory, county (condado, parroquia), town, suburb. If you had that, then organisation could belong to the structure in the right place, and you would not have "Lisboa" occurring at both council at district levels.
