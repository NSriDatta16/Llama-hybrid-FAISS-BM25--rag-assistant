Advice for embedding a Java scripting language for debugging/remote admin

I have a fairly sophisticated server-side application which frequently requires me to see what is going on with its internals to debug and fix problems. I've therefore embedded a Beanshell instance, which I can telnet into (normally over a ssh tunnel), but I'm wondering if there is a better way. A few limitations: No readline support, which I can get around by using 'rlwrap' on telnet, but its not ideal Tab-completion of variables and methods would be really nice, but I haven't found a way to do this Pre-defining variables (to access stuff I need to access frequently) doesn't seem to work, I have to pre-define functions instead All-in-all its rather clunky, although Beanshell has the nice advantage that its a super-set of Java, so nobody needs to learn another programming language to use it. I'm wondering if others have any experience with facilitating remote debugging/administration via a scripting language (Beanshell or otherwise), perhaps someone has found a better approach.
