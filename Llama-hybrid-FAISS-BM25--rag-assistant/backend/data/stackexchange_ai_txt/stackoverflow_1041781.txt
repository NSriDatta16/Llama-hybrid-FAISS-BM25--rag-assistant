Moving table rows in a particular pattern with jQuery

I have a table with rows basically like this. Normal Row Normal Row Normal Row Summary Row Normal Row Summary Row Normal Row Normal Row Summary Row So basically X "normal rows", which will always be followed by a "summary row". The summary rows display aggregates of the data in the normal rows. I calculate the aggregates at runtime, hence the "summary rows" are naturally placed AFTER the normal rows that they aggregate. All I need to do, is move each "summary row", above the clump of "normal rows" preceding it, at runtime. So I end up with: Summary Row Normal Row Normal Row Normal Row Summary Row Normal Row Summary Row Normal Row Normal Row .. etc. So by giving them appropriate css classes, say class="summary" and class="normal", I'd like a selector query written that matches each "summary row", and effectively moves it above the first "normal row" that precedes it. What is the most elegant jquery way?
