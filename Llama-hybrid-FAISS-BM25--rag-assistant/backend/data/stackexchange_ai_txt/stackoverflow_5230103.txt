It looks to me like your TreeView control is simply too large for its container form. Without any type of docking or anchoring (to automatically resize the control) it will just hang off the edge and not be visible until you resize the form to show the rest of it. The bottom scrollbar is still there, it's just clipped. It's an easy theory to testâ€”try expanding the size of your form vertically, by dragging at the bottom edge of the window (on the dark blue border). This is even more likely if you say that you didn't change any of its default properties (other than the Size , presumably). If you don't tell the control to resize depending on the size of its parent, it's very likely to outgrow the available space. To fix it, open your form in Design View in Visual Studio, select your TreeView control, and set its Dock property to "Fill". That will cause it to fill all available space in your form and automatically resize whenever your form does.
