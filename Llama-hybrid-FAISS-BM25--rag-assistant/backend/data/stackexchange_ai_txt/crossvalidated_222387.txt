I'm trying to estimate the distribution of the number of optical claims per year. From the limited information that you provided, I'd rather think about geometric distribution . It has pmf of form $$ f(x) = (1-p)^x p $$ where $x \ge 0$ and $0 In your case, you can think of $p$ as of probability of having no claims for a whole year and $q = 1-p$ is a probability of a single claim happening. This parameter can be easily estimated from your data using maximum likelihood $$ \hat p = \frac{n}{n + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i} $$ or Bayesian approach $$ \hat p \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha + n, \beta + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i) $$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters of conjugate Beta prior , e.g. $\alpha = \beta = 1$ for uniform, "uninformative" prior.
