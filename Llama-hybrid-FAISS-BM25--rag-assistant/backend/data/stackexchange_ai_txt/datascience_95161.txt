Random Forest is a tree based ensemble algorithm which uses bagging to improve the performance of the algorithm. There are few improved/modified Random Forest algorithms which includes weighted quadratic random forest and weighted class random forest, to name a few. These algorithms are not mainstream algorithms and can be used for very specific purposes - imbalanced target labels. If you are looking for tree based algorithms, look at GBM, LightGBM, XGB and CatBoost.
