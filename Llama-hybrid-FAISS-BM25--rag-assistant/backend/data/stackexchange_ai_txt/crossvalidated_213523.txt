Interpreting high deviance in logistic regression ANOVA output

I'm performing logistic regression. I notice when I introduce one of my variables 'admissions_R,' which is a continuous count of the number of admissions, that the deviance is quite high. However, I'm uncertain as to how to interpret that, and what it means. I'm concerned because my DV is readmissions, so I'm wondering if its flagging a violation?
