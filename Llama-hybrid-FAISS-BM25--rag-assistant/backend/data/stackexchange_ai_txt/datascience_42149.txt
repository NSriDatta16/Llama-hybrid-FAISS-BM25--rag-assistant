Input and output Dimension of LSTM RNN

I am fairly new to RNNs and Im having trouble setting up the desired output from RNN using Keras library. Each datapoint in my dataset consist of a pattern of labels and timestamp of occurrence of each label and based on the pattern of label I want to predict what the next label in the pattern be. I have developed the model which takes series of label as input and outputs the next label in the series but now I want to input labels as well as their timestamp and receive output the next label as well as the timestamp of its occurrence. How can I achieve this with a single model?
