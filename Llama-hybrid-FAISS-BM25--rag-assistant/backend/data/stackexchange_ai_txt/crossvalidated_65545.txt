Measuring forecast accuracy

We're forecasting sales data for one of our clients on a weekly basis. Sales is forecasted for each organizational unit. The sales data is forecasted via different algorithms and/or algorithm parameters. So, for every organizational unit, about 10 different forecasts are generated. Now I want to find the best forecast/algorithm to be chosen as the weekly forecast based on the accuracy of each algorithm of the past 9 weeks. So for each algorithm there is data like: Org Unit Algorithm Date Actual Forecast ----------------------------------------------------------------- OU1 A1 2013-07-25 100 110 OU1 A1 2013-07-24 100 120 OU1 A1 2013-07-23 130 130 OU1 A1 2013-07-22 140 170 OU1 A1 2013-07-21 110 130 OU1 A1 ... ... ... OU1 A2 2013-07-25 100 102 OU1 A2 2013-07-24 100 108 OU1 A2 2013-07-23 130 120 OU1 A2 2013-07-22 140 122 OU1 A2 2013-07-21 110 130 OU1 A2 ... ... ... Based on the sample data shown above I need to decide whether to choose A1 or A2. What would you suggest? Standard deviation on the mean absolute error plus average of MAE? Theil's U? P.S. It does not matter whether the forecast is below or above the actual, only the absolute deviation needs to be considered.
