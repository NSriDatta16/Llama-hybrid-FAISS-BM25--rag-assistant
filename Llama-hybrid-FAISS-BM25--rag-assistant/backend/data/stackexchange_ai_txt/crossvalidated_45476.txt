Causal stats with one event and multiple time series?

I've worked with certain causal/predictive techniques when handling two time series, but this problem is different from what I am used to and I'm not sure how to proceed. I would like to see the causal influence of a single event on multiple time series. For example, an earthquake on a particular day having an influence on future stock prices of different companies. Is there a technique/method that allows me to address this type of question?
