SVM vs RVM, when to use what?

I'm currently working on a project where I'm supposed to compare the efficiency of SVM vs RVM, there seems to be a lot of information to be gathered about RVM whereas I find rather old documents about RVM. It's the first time I use this forum so I hope my question isn't off-topic but my questions are: 1) Which datasets are more suited for the two models and what are the upsides/downsides for each model? 2) As mentioned above, the articles I find about SVM are rather old, I'm currently curious about recent applications of SVM and to what and where they have been implemented. Sources or just standard responses are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance
