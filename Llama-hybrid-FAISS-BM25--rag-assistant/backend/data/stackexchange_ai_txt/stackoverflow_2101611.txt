JavaScript alert() not working in embedded WebView

When embedding WebView in an application and loading html-pages in it, JavaScripts alert() / confirm() /etc. do not work. Looking around in the documentation, there are no related settings in WebPreferences - the only thing that looks related are WebUIDelegate s -(void)webView:runJavaScriptAlertPanelWithMessage:initiatedByFrame: etc ... but implementing these would mean writing custom dialogs for these which seems pretty redundant... I don't need a custom WebUIDelegate and would like to continue just using the default one. Surely there has to be some way to simply enable alert() et al, but how?
