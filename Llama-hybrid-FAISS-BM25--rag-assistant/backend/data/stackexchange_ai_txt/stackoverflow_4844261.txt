1) Since the times are dates be sure to use "Date" class, not "POSIXct" or "POSIXlt" . See R News 4/1 for advice and try this where Lines is defined in the Note at the end. No packages are used here. dm The use of text = Lines is just to keep the example self-contained and in reality it would be replaced with something like "myfile.dat" . (continued after image) 2) Since this is a time series you may wish to use a time series representation giving slightly simpler code: library(zoo) z Depending on what you want the plot to look like it may be sufficient just to use plot(Visits ~ Date, dm) in the first case or plot(z) in the second case suppressing the axis command entirely. It could also be done using xyplot.zoo library(lattice) xyplot(z) or autoplot.zoo: library(ggplot2) autoplot(z) Note: Lines
