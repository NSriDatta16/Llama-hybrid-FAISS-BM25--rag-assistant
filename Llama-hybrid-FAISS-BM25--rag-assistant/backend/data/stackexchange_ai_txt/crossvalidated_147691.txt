If you want to extend the example you link to to a multivariate regression, take the code as it is and: Add one more predictor in the code chunk generating the data Add one more parameter in likelihood, as in pred = a1*x1 + a2*x2 + b Add the additional parameter in the prior specification Adjust the MCMC and plots to deal with 4 instead of 3 parameters
