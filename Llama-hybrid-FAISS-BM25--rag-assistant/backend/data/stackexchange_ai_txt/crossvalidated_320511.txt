Imputation of qualitative variables

I am working on a data set were few qualitative features are having missing values. Qualitative columns having null values(nan): uniques in Gender ['Male' 'Female' nan] uniques in Married ['No' 'Yes' nan] uniques in Dependents ['0' '1' '2' '3+' nan] uniques in Self_Employed ['No' 'Yes' nan] uniques in Credit_History [ 1. 0. nan] I used mode for imputation. Requesting experts: please share some best practices for imputation or resources with practical examples(less theory). I am using pandas for analysis (PS- i am new to data science)
