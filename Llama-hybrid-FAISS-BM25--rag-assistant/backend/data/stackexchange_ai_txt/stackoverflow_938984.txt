How can I remove the original element after doing a draggable event with a 'clone' helper?

I have a list of items which I have made draggable. I am dragging these over to several sortable lists. I have to use the 'clone' helper method while dragging as the other helper methods did not work properly. Unfortunately, I don't want the item to remain in the original list once it has been dropped in the sortable list. How do I remove the original item after a successful drag? (i.e. once it is contained in one of the sortable lists) I thought I might be able to access the original element through the droppable event on the sortable lists but I'm not sure how to achieve this. Thanks Graeme
