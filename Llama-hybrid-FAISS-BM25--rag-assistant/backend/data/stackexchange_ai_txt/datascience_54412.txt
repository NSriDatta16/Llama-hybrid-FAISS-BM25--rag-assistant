How to add a CNN layer on top of BERT?

I am just playing with bert (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer) Research Paper Suppose I want to add any other model or layers like Convolutional Neural Network layers (CNN), Non Linear (NL) layers on top of BERT model. How can I do this? I am not able to figure out where should I change in code of BERT. I am using the pytorch implementation of bert from huggingface. This is what I want to do: Please show steps to implement this using sudo code which will help me in implemention of cnn on top of BERT.
