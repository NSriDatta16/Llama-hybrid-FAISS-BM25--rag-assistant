How to organize my code (methods I create for various uses on my website)

I wrote some code to connect the application to it's database, then I created some code to use the connection code and retrieve, update or add some values to the database, Also I might have some code to deal with other stuff than to deal with the database The code is a little complicated, maybe it's simple but it's not short, for example to write a good piece of code to just retrieve a single value so I could set the controller with this value I used this : SqlConnection sqlconnection= new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["DefConnectionString"].ConnectionString); SqlCommand sqlcommand = new SqlCommand("SELECT name FROM message WHERE id = 3", sqlconnection); try { sqlconnection.Open(); lbl_name.Text = (string)sqlcommand.ExecuteScalar(); Status.Text = "Done"; } catch (Exception ex) { Status.Text = ex.Message; } finally { sqlconnection.Close(); } I might even add some code to store some info in the database about any exception is thrown, I think the code is pretty basic, yet it's not small, given that it's the smallest piece I'll need, some huge code is written for adding or editing new items, and also consider that it's not the only code I'll write in the page, the page has more needs :D! I've provided a detailed case I hope!...So what do you think will be the best way to make my page fast and easy to read and have an organized code I've started placing every code in an appropriate method, but some methods are common so I create them again in every page that needs them like a ConnectionToDataBase Method, and mean while I think I just organized the page so I could mainly look at Page_Load and see what are the called methods and then scroll down to read the definition but It's still a big page and note the best practice I think Sorry for all the big question, I just provide details so I could get a reasonable answer for my question, I hope everyone benefits from it as most questions are pretty basic, newbies like me needs some detailed cases and answers to get a better start...Thanks for your time! EDIT: I know I'm new, So any comments on my code are more than welcome!
