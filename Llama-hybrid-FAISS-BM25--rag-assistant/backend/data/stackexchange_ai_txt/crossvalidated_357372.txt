Matlab Classification Learner App vs. own code: Why is there a difference between Leave-One-Person-Out and 10-fold Crossvalidation?

I am trying to find a good model to explain my dataset. The problem is that I want to do leave-one-person-out cross validation which is not available in the Matlab Classification Learner App . So I trained different models (e.g. Tree , SVM , KNN , LDA ) using functions like fitctee , fitcsvm , fitcknn , and fitcdiscr . Following the leave-one-person-out procedure I have found average classification accuracy of about 70% for the best model. However, when I use the App to model the data using 10-Fold cross validation , it has much better accuracy and TPR and TNR about 98%. This is really confusing that why this is happening! I was wondering if there are some steps I am missing when I do the modeling programmatically. Or is there any way to do what the App does by writing scripts and probably customizing the cross validation scheme to leave-one-person-out ?
