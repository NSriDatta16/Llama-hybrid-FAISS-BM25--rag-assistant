Help evaluating a model in R

I am a newbie in R and I am trying to do my best to create my first model. I am working in a 2- classes random forest project and so far I have programmed the model as follows: library(randomForest) set.seed(2015) RF.fit So far everything seems to be ok with my code but I am not able to calculate neither the OOB nor the prediction porcentage (recall) to evaluate the model. Can someone tell me what I'm missing? Till here everything seems to fine with my code but I am not able to calculate the OOB and the prediction porcentage(recall) to evaluate the model.
