Turning on "Enable GPU acceleration in Out of Browser" isn't enough. That setting works in tandem with .CacheMode property, which must be set on all elements (or a top-level element) whose rendered bitmap will be sent to the GPU. From there, the GPU can hardware accelerate rotations, scalings, opacities, clipping. If your animation does any of that, you'll need to set element.CacheMode = "BitmapCache" on the top level element you are animating. Again, you'll need to turn on the "enable GPU acceleration" for this to work. If either step is missing, you won't get GPU accelerated. A couple of caveats for hardware acceleration: Pixel shaders and perspective transforms are not HW accelerated last I checked. HW acceleration works on XP, but requires that you have a video card from NVidia, ATI, or Intel, and the driver date must be post Nov 2004. Anything less and nothing will be accelerated. I recommend reading MSDN's article on hardware acceleration .
