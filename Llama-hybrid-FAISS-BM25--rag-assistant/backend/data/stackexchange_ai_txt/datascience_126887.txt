Author of the paper believe that he can just sum up three different features into one feature, and it worked because feedforward neural network learned to live with such perturbations in it's input perception. Jokes aside. It is known to everyone, that if you change input order in a simple feedforward neural network, such as home price prediction, where at first input index you have number of bedrooms and at second input index you have age of that estate, you would not get correct output, because FNN's learned that at first index it expects number of bedrooms, not the age of the building. I explained it more in this answer . Indeed, why author left separation token, when there is already segment encoding? Where is ablation studies in all these papers?
