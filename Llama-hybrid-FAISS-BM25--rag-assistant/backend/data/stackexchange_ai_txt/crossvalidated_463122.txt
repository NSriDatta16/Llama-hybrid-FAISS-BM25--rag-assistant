Can we average the coefficients from bootstrapped samples for Logistic Regression with L1 regularization?

I have a model built using logistic regression with L1 regularization ( glmnet package ). I built this model using 1% of total data available to me. To ensure that the variance of my result is small, I am now planning to run bootstrap on my available data. I am just not sure how to "aggregate" the final coefficient that I will be using to make "predict"? Is this a right approach? If not what are some ways to go about this?
