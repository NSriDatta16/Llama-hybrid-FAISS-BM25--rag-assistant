Receiving multipart POST data requests in PHP

I want to receive the following HTTP request in PHP: Content-type: multipart/form-data;boundary=main_boundary --main_boundary Content-type: text/xml Some content goes here --main_boundary Content-type: multipart/mixed;boundary=sub_boundary --sub_boundary Content-type: application/octet-stream File A contents --sub_boundary Content-type: application/octet-stream File B contents --sub_boundary --main_boundary-- (Note: I have indented the sub-parts only to make it more readable for this post.) I'm not very fluent in PHP and would like to get some help/pointers to figure out how to receive this kind of multipart form request in PHP code. I have once written some code where I received a standard HTML form and then I could access the form elements by using their name as index key in the $HTTP_GET_VARS array, but in this case there are no form element names, and the form data parts are not linear (i.e. sub parts = multilevel array). Grateful for any help! /Robert
