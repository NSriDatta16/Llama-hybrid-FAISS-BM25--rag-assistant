If you have a number of variables $\{x_1, x_2, \dots x_N\}$ and you consider a new variable that is a linear combination of the original ones: $$y=\alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \dots + \alpha_N x_N = \sum \alpha_i x_i$$ Then, obviously, all original variables are "used to construct" the new variable (unless some of the coefficients $\alpha_i$ are equal to zero). However, if some coefficients are $\approx 0$, then you can say that the new variable "mostly" depends only on a subset of the original variables --- on those that have large coefficients. When you perform PCA, your e.g. first principal component is a linear combination of the original variables. So what you want to do, is to look at the coefficients $\alpha_i$ and see which ones have large absolute values (and which ones are close to zero). How to actually do it, depends on your software, programming language, etc.
