Using $("*").ready() within $(document).ready() is redundant... you already know using all of the elements are ready! Also, in general using the universal selector $('*') is very inefficient. So, the first two lines of your $(document).ready() can just be: hide_me(); first_bow(); Other than that and a couple of issues with organization and nomenclature you're off to a great start, keep it up!
