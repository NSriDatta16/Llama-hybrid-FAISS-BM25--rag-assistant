a { border-bottom:1px dotted #333; } a img { border:0; } Just override the inherited rule, the native css way. Edit: Wow, I'm really not paying attention. Can you just throw a class to anchors that include images? a.contains-image { border:0; } This would be the only non-scripting solution without relying on CSS3's not selector.
