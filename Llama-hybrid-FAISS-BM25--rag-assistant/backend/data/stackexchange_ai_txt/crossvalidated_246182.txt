I have ten classification models that need to be consolidated into 1

As the title states, I have 10 classification models that I need to consolidate into one, more effective model. They are as follows: Score: 0.922902494331 Score: 0.924522189828 Score: 0.889536767088 Score: 0.924522189828 Score: 0.820213799806 Score: 0.782960803369 Score: 0.782960803369 Score: 0.782960803369 Score: 0.782960803369 Score: 0.782960803369 I've heard of "mixture of experts" but all of the research i've done so far points me to some more complex neural network based approaches which is beyond my comprehension at this point. If you could point me in the right direction, that would be much appreciated.
