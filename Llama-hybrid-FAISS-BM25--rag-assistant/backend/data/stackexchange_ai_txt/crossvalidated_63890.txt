Approximating a Poisson distribution using a partially observed Gaussian

Note that the problem specification has changed since the original posting. Thanks to whuber for helping me better specify the question: in an attempt to make the question general, I had left out several important constraints. Problem : Let $y$ be distributed Poisson with rate parameter $\lambda$: $p(y | \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^y}{y!}e^{-\lambda}$ Let $z^*$ be distributed Gaussian with mean $\mu$ and variance $1$: $p(z^* | \mu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}e^{-\frac{(z^* - \mu)^2}{2}}$ Define $z$ as follows: $z = k$ if $\gamma_{k} \le z^* Let $\mu = \log\lambda$. How do we choose a single sequence of $\gamma_k$ for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, \infty$, that does not depend on $\lambda$, in order to best approximate the distribution of $y$ with the distribution of $z$, across the full range of possible values of $\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. It is not clear to me exactly what the right criterion is here for operationalizing "best approximating" across the full range of $\lambda$. Background : The idea here is to do something similar to the Albert and Chib (1993) approach to Gibbs sampling binary and categorical models. Instead of having a single or small number of cutpoints, here we would have an infinite series of cutpoints. The question is how to choose the cutpoints to best approximate a Poisson distribution. As a practical matter, it is pretty easy to draw doubly-truncated normal random variates (Robert 2009). There is an existing approach to using data augmentation to fit a Poisson regression (Frühwirth-Schnatter and Wagner 2005), but it seems to involve rapidly increasing computation with increasing values of the count variable, which is a very unattractive feature for my application. I am working on a Gibbs sampler for a hierarchical model to be applied to a very large dataset of count data. I have no particular reason to believe that the distribution of counts are particularly close to Poisson, I am mostly interested in computational efficiency and not having a probability distribution for the counts that is very far from a standard distribution.
