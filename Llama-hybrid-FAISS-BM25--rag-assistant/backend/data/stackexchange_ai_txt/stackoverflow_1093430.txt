I use Haxe to develop all my Flash applications, and I love it. I develop on Linux and with Emacs, and I really like how I can make Haxe fit within my preferred development environment. I just use simple Makefiles that look something like: project.swf: Project.hx haxe project.hxml It's really easy to get started in Haxe, and it's very elegant. I've had no problems at all using Haxe as compared to using the Adobe Flash builders, and have developed a bunch of big projects including PanningPedagogy , The Orchive , Cantillion and Audioscapes . I've released the source code to all of these as GPL on SourceForge, check them out at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/panning/ https://sourceforge.net/projects/orcaannotator/ https://sourceforge.net/projects/cantillion/ https://sourceforge.net/projects/margridflash/
