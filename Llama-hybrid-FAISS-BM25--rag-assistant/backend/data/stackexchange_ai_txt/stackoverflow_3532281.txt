Comparing two NSMutableDictionaries

Hello fellow Computer People! I could do this myself, but was just wondering if there was a more efficient way that I haven't though of: I have two NSMutableDictionaries. Let us use these as an example: Dictionary 'Madrid' Bob : 54 Thomas : 32 Frank : 20 Dictionary 'Barcelona' Bob : 1100 Thomas : 32 Ed : 55 Frank : 20 What I want to get from comparing these two is: The fact that the value for Bob is different between the two Dictionaries That Frank has a value in Barcelona, but was not at all in Madrid. This is for monitoring a sort of time series to see if any activity is happening from one iteration to the next. Obviously this should be dealt with in Objective-C. Any opinions on the most efficient way of doing this? Thanks so much!
