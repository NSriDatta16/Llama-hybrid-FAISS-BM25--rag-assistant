C++ library works in vb6 but not in c#

I'm writing a C# application that has to consume a C++ api provided by my customer. The library works fine when it's referenced by a vb6 application, but when I reference it in my c# application and try to call the same methods, I get a different (wrong) behavior. The methods I'm calling take a couple of string arguments. Provided that I don't have the library's source code, I can only guess what could be wrong and this leads me to the following thought: Is it possible that the library could have been designed to be called from vb6 only? I mean for example, that it could be expecting the string parameters to be encoded in a certain way different from the one c# uses. If so, is there any workaround for this? So far the best I could do was to create a vb6 wrapper ocx, but it's not any elegant and least of all easy to deploy solution. I'm posting the code which initializes the object: ApiPrnClass apiprn; // this is the class imported form the com reference for (int j = 0; j I would appreciate any help, Thanks, Bernab√©
