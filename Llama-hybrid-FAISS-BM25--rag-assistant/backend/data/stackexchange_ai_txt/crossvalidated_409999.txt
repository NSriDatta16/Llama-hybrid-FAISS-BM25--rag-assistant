Which emmeans to choose between full and main effect mixed effect models with heteroscedasticity corrected

I have a split splot full factorial design : 3 blocks, each block contains 4 plots for factor E and each plot is divided into 3 subplots for factor F. I use a mixed effect model with random effects on both blocks and plot nested in blocks. > dat num_bloc F E y 1 bloc1 T B 0.0695 2 bloc2 T B 0.1540 3 bloc3 T B 0.0634 4 bloc1 C B 0.0770 5 bloc2 C B 0.0746 6 bloc3 C B 0.1020 7 bloc1 P B 0.0825 8 bloc2 P B 0.0559 9 bloc3 P B 0.0832 10 bloc1 T B.Br 0.0891 11 bloc2 T B.Br 0.1050 12 bloc3 T B.Br 0.1150 13 bloc1 C B.Br 0.1580 14 bloc2 C B.Br 0.0989 15 bloc3 C B.Br 0.1510 16 bloc1 P B.Br 0.1020 17 bloc2 P B.Br 0.0751 18 bloc3 P B.Br 0.0655 19 bloc1 T B.S 0.1020 20 bloc2 T B.S 0.0755 21 bloc3 T B.S 0.0631 22 bloc1 C B.S 0.0705 23 bloc2 C B.S 0.0782 24 bloc3 C B.S 0.0751 25 bloc1 P B.S 0.0826 26 bloc2 P B.S 0.0800 27 bloc3 P B.S 0.0996 28 bloc1 T B.S.Br 0.0850 29 bloc2 T B.S.Br 0.0688 30 bloc3 T B.S.Br 0.0727 31 bloc1 C B.S.Br 0.0762 32 bloc2 C B.S.Br 0.0880 33 bloc3 C B.S.Br 0.0751 34 bloc1 P B.S.Br 0.0694 35 bloc2 P B.S.Br 0.0619 36 bloc3 P B.S.Br 0.0627 > full0 Because I found differences in residual variances between groups I updated the model as follows: full I also test the main effect model since interaction is not significant main0 I am interested in the contrasts comparing treatments versus control for factor F. I can calculate them for the 4 models: > contrast(emmeans(full0,~F),method="trt.vs.ctrl") NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value C - T 0.00513 0.00856 16 0.599 0.7690 P - T -0.01189 0.00856 16 -1.390 0.3123 Results are averaged over the levels of: E P value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests > contrast(emmeans(full,~F),method="trt.vs.ctrl") NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value C - T 0.00513 0.00973 16 0.527 0.8110 P - T -0.01189 0.00905 16 -1.314 0.3482 Results are averaged over the levels of: E P value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests > contrast(emmeans(main0,~F),method="trt.vs.ctrl") contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value C - T 0.00513 0.00902 22 0.568 0.7857 P - T -0.01189 0.00902 22 -1.318 0.3392 Results are averaged over the levels of: E P value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests > contrast(emmeans(main,~F),method="trt.vs.ctrl") contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value C - T 0.000686 0.00469 22 0.146 0.9773 P - T -0.011254 0.00222 22 -5.072 0.0001 Results are averaged over the levels of: E P value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests The design is balanced with no missing data, so I do not understand why emmeans differ between the full and main model and even between main and main0 models. It seems to come from the weights given to treatments by the varIndent function. My questions is can anyone help me to understand this? And second question is which model is to be used to correctly calculate the contrasts? My feeling would be to use the main model because it drops the non significant interaction and it corrects the heteroscedasticity. However, I am confused by the difference in both the emmeans and p.values depending on the models (P-T can shift from ns to highly significant). Furthermore, for some other variables, the calculated emmeans of the main model differ much more from the experimental data. I am aware that emmeans are modelled values and not experimental data but it is not comfortable to argue for a 15% difference between two treatments (p
