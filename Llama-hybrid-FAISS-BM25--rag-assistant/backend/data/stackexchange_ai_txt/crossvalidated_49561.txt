I normally have a Bayesian bias, but If I understand you correctly, I think Frequentist hypothesis testing is fairly appropriate here. I think you probably want to do a t-test with of each $X_i$ with $X'$. This will tell you whether the mean of a given version is significantly different than the mean of the baseline. You can then also do a F-test , which tests if the variances are different. You may also consider computing Bayesian credible interval for the difference of means and seeing if 0 is outside that. Check out Bolstad's book Chapter 12. There's probably also a credible interval for the ratio of variances. With more sophisticated Bayesian approaches you could probably sqeeze a tiny bit more information out of data, but I think you're probably much better off doing this and collecting more data if you need it. I don't think you want to pool the $X_i$'s because that will tell you whether the sample weighted mean of version tests is different than $X'$. If I understand you, this is not what you're interested in, you're interested in which versions are different. If you're interested in which versions go beyond the normal variation between versions, then you'll have to do something more complex.
