Using git as a storage intermediary (and maintaining a rich and sane log history)

I develop on 4 machines, 1 at home, 2 at work - windows/linux. Often I want to use my git repository just to move code around, code in flux. This also covers my use-case for backing up code to a central raid-backed remote repository. I don't want to leave any comments or pushes in the commit log when I am using it for this purpose. In other words, the commit logs should only represent deltas that are feature or bug-fixes. Since git is a swiss army knife, what are some of the ways of achieving my use-case ? If you are going to demonstrate the use-case please list the commands, and some commentary if there are multiple approaches. Some commentary of compressing multiple commits into a single one in the log history would also be useful, since I have left behind a trail of commits as it stands :D edit If you know of complementary ways (to the answers allready presented) of achieving such use-cases please provide an answer. I will make it a community wiki if there are lots of good answers.
