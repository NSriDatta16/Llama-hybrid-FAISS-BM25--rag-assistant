I like jalbert's form of lining up the keywords on their right. I'd also add that I like the ANDs and ORs on the left (some people put them on the right.) In addition, I like to line up my equals signs when possible. SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.column1 = table2.column4 AND table1.col5 = "hi" OR table2.myfield = 678
