Hypothesis testing with binomial test vs Chi2

Is it valid to test the following hypothesis with a binomial test? Or should a chi2-test be applied in this case? A factory produces different products (A-G) with different rates of production errors in % (i.e., a product can be defect or okay). The question of interest is, if a newly introduced product is more prone to production errors than the average of the old products: Product Total % error A 28 14 B 49 10 C 33 6 D 44 9 E 68 10 F 28 10 G 55 14 New 60 12 Thus my hypothesis would be: H0: There is no difference in production errors (avg(A-G) ~= New) H1: New product is more error prone (New > avg(A-G)) Then my intuition would be to apply a simple binomial test Avg error % = (0.14 * 28) + (0.10 * 49)+ (0.06*33)+ (0.09*44) + (0.1*68)+ (0.1*28) + (0.14*55) / 305 ==> 0.105 from scipy.stats import binom_test binom_test(x=12, n=60, p=0.105, alternative="greater") ==> 0.02 Which would tell me that there is a statistically significant different thus I could reject H0. Is it valid to test in this way or would a chi2-test be more suited? Or are there even other possibilities to approach this?
