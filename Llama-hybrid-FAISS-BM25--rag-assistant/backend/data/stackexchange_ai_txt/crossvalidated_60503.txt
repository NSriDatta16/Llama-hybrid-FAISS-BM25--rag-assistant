The temperature you provide in your question repeats exactly every year. I suspect this aren't really measured temperatures over four years. In your example, you wouldn't need a model, because the temperatures just repeat exactly. But otherwise you could use the nls function to fit a sine curve: ToY But the fit isn't very good, especially at the beginning. It seems that your data cannot be adequately modelled by a simple sine curve. Maybe a more complex trigonometrical function will do the trick? nls.mod2 The red curve fits the data better. With the nls function, you can put in the model that you think is appropriate. Or maybe you could make use the the forecast package. In the example below, I have assumed that the time series started in January 2010: library(forecast) Degrees.ts Because the data is deterministic, no confidence bands are shown.
