I personally agree with Joel Etherton, conditionally. If you have a small enough project that even with EF's bloat you're still not looking at too much shenanigan-code, I would say the expediency it offers is worthwhile. However in larger codebases, it can become a lot to get your hands around so much bloat. The other benefit to EF vs older style business objects which goes unmentioned though, is with EF implementation you will probably get easier upgrades to newer .NET versions taking advantage of benefits in the next .NET without having to rewrite a bunch of code by hand. (This can also be a double-edged sword as upgrading to new .NET with EF may affect the behaviour of your dal as opposed to a hand-written dal is less likely to be so affected.) That said, I agree with Joel Etherton, write the simplest smallest dal you can implementing LINQ, the dal is always too important to make overly-complex whenever it can be avoided.
