First of all, this is not Naive Bayes, but a direct application of Bayes theorem. It would be naive Bayes if you had multiple features and assumed independence to approximate the likelihood. Bayes theorem can be used to "invert" conditional probabilities, so if you are given $P(B|A)$ , you can obtain $$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\,P(A)}{P(B)} $$ If you are given all the data needed to calculate $P(A|B)$ directly, then you don't need it. Here you can find worked example of using Bayes theorem where we do not have the information directly available, so we use Bayes theorem to calculate the probabilities from other sources. There are also other uses of Bayes theorem, but this falls far beyond scope of your question, you can check other questions tagged as bayesian if you are curious.
