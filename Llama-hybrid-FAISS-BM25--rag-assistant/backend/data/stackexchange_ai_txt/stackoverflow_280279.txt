I ended up embedding the HTML file into a resource (res) file and loading it up from there using LoadResData. I asked another question relating to the loading up of HTML files from res files (and got a pretty good answer too). Note that another option could be to embed the HTML (or any other text file) as a Custom Resource; this way you'll be able to reference the resource by name (i.e. the name of the Custom Resource) when using LoadResData rather than a number (which may not mean too much to someone who comes along and tries to understand your code). Note also that if you want to load the HTML into a string (as I do), you'll need to call StrConv on the result returned by LoadResData (LoadResData returns an array of bytes).
