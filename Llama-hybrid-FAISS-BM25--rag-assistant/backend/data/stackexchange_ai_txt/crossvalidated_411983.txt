Bayes factors in R for correlated proportions (such as a "Bayesian McNemar's test")

Is there any way to get Bayes factors in R for correlated proportions (i.e., paired sample)? For example, the same group of 90 people is measured with one technique, then with another; once there are 50 positive findings (with 40 negative), and once 70 positive (with 20 negative). With a frequentist approach, I could use McNemar's test to compare the two techniques - but what do I use for Bayes factors? A previous related question and answer is here: Bayes Factors for McNemar Test However, these solutions are rather complex and not implemented in R (as far as I know). I know that the BayesFactor package has the contingencyTableBF function for independent proportions, but not for correlated ones.
