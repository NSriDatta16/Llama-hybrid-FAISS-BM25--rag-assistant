How should three unordered categories be encoded in a bayesian network framework?

The SAS FAQ suggest that for unordered two categories I should one dummy variables, for example: The common practice of using target values of .1 and .9 instead of 0 and 1 prevents the outputs of the network from being directly interpretable as posterior probabilities , although it is easy to rescale the outputs to produce probabilities (Hampshire and Pearlmutter, 1991, figure 3). Following above logic, how do I know which target values I should use for three categories and why?
