How to use NSDecimalNumber?

I'm building a app that needs to perform calculations on money. I wonder how to properly use NSDecimalNumber, especially how to initialize it from integers, floats & doubles? I only found it easy to use the -decimalNumberWithString: method. The -initWith... methods are discouraged so that only left the ones with mantissa, but never in any of 7 languages I used before did I need that so I don't know what put there...
