In case of a logistic regression model, it is pretty easy to find the equation for the decision boundary. Assume a 2D case, i.e., you have two features: $x_1$ and $x_2$ and a GT class label $y$ . A logistic regression model will have three parameters here $w_1$ , $w_2$ and bias $b$ . For the samples on the decision line, $p(y==1 | x; Î¸)$ as given by output of sigmoid, will be $1/2$ . That is, both classes are equiprobable when confidence=0.5 . Sigmoid outputs a 1/2 when $w_1x_1 + w_2x_2+ b = 0$ ; if we move $x_2$ to one side, we will get $x_2 = \dfrac{-w_1}{w_2} x1 + \dfrac{-b}{w_2}$ . That is, the decision boundary is a line with slope of $\dfrac{-w_1}{w_2}$ and intercept $\dfrac{-b}{w_2}$
