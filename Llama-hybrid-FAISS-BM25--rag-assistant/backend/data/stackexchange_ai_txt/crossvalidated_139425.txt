Just to compliment tiagotvv's answer: I don't naturally think of these kinds of problems as matrices (even though they are). I have to draw it out, which I've done below. You can see that there are 3 places to move from S, all of which are As. From any A, you can either return to the S, or move to one of two Bs. From any B, you can move to the E, or to one of two As. This all translates to the transition matrix given by tiagotvv, which can also be drawn in graph form. Because I am terrible at math, I would just try to simulate your problem. You can do this with the markovchain package in R. library(markovchain) library(ggplot2) # Create a markovchain object, given the states and their transition matrix mcCube # This code simulates 1000 different applications of the markov chain where you # take 1000 steps, and records the step at which you landed on E list tiagotvv's answer can be calcuated in R as: q = matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 1/3, 0, 2/3, 0, 2/3, 0), byrow = T, nrow = 3) (solve(diag(3) - q) %*% c(1, 1, 1))[1] # = 10
