Any way to group methods in Java/Eclipse?

I would like to be able to group similar methods and have them appear in my Outline view in Eclipse. This makes navigating large swaths of code a little easier on the eye, and easier to find methods you need. In Objective-C there was a pragma mark command that you could set. Anything like that for java/eclipse?
