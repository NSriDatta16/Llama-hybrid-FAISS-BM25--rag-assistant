You can use Binary Logistic Regression for this analysis. Prior to using Binary Logit, you'd have to spend some time preparing the data for this analysis. You can create several RFM types of features from this data set. Examples: Number of donations, time between donations, time since the most recent donation, time since the first donation, average donation amount, the amount of first donation, the most recent donation amount, etc. (I can provide more examples, if needed.) Since your task is to predict the probability of donation during a four-month timeframe (Mar-Jun 2016), you can create those features (leading indicators) for each donor as of the end of October 2015. All leading indicators would be created based off of timeframes prior to that cut-off point. Your observation window is from Nov-2015 to Feb-2016. This is where your event flag (dependent variable) should come from: 1 if a donor donated (again) during the observation window, and 0 otherwise. In order to make this model generalizable, I'd recommend pulling several such cross-sections of your data (in addition to the October 2015 slice explained above,)
