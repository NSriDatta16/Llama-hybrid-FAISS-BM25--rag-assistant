Funny software metrics that have a relevant value

As a software developer, I've seen lot of different software metrics, mainly about code quality and bug-tracking. I have heard of a "Dilbert metric", which is "how many people read and laugh at Dilbert comics in your team", which shows how bad your company/organization is. There is also the "WTF per minute" during code reviews : http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg . I'm looking for metrics that are both funny AND still relevant, do you have any ?
