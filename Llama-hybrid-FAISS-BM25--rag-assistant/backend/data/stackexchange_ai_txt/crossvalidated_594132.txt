Partial answer: If you rephrase your problem it becomes much easier to comprehend. Here is how I would write it down: Suppose we have a bag which has x red balls and x+N green balls. Each turn we randomly draw a ball from the bag: If this is red, we discard it along with another green ball from the bag. Now we will have x-1 red balls and x+N-1 green balls in the bag. If this is green, we put it back and put one red ball and one green ball into the bag. Now we will have x+1 red balls and x+N+1 green balls in the bag. This will guarantee that we will always have N more green balls than red balls every time. In this alternative representation we have a variable $x$ , with probability $\frac{x}{x+x+N}$ it decreases by 1 and with probability $\frac{x+N}{x+x+N}$ it increases by 1. The game will stop when there are no red balls left or when $x=0$ . What's the probability that the game will stop of we start with $x = 1$ ? This situation is similar to The Dead Drunk Man but the probability of a step is not exactly 0.5 (only it's limit for $x \to \infty$ ) and variable instead. This you might solve by using some sort of relation between the probabilities to stop when $x = 2$ , $x = 3$ , etc. Let's define $P(k,m)$ be the probability that the game stops if we start with $k$ red balls and $k+m$ green balls. If you are at some value $k$ then you have a possibility that you increase or decrease. The number $k$ . And the probability to stop will be based on the values in those next cases. $$P(k,m) = \frac{k}{2k+m} P(k-1,m) + \frac{k+m}{2k+m} P(k+1,m)$$ We can fill in $P(0,m) = 1$ but that is not enough to solve it. This is similar to the frog problem described here: The frog problem with negative steps That problem could be solved by using a difference $Q(k,m) = P(k,m) - P(k-1,m)$ (see fuether below) or by having a additional stopping condition at the other end ( $k=0$ and also $k=K$ ) and let take the limit when that condition goes towards infinity $K \to \infty$ . You might possibly solve this as a diffusion problem or Markov chain with an absorbing boundary at $k=0$ . Working out the problem with the difference In this case we might do something like define $$P(k,m)-P(k-1,m) = \frac{k+m}{2k+m} \left(P(k+1,m) - P(k-1,m) \right)$$ And with $Q(k,m) = P(k,m) - P(k-1,m)$ $$ Q(k+1,m) = \frac{k}{k+m} Q(k,m)$$ And if we define $Q_1 = Q(1,m)$ , then $$ Q(k,m) = Q_1 \prod_{i = 1}^k \frac{i-1}{i+m-1} = Q_1 {k-1+m \choose k-1}^{-1}$$ and $$P(k,m) = 1+\sum_{i=1}^k Q(k,m) = 1+Q_1 \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {i+m \choose i}^{-1} = 1+Q_1 \frac{m\left(1- {k+m \choose k+1}^{-1}\right)}{m-1 }$$ (I am not sure about the last step, but Wolfram alpha tells this ) The limit of this is $\frac{m+1}{m-1}$ and because $P(k,m) \in [0,1]$ we have a limit for $Q_1 \geq -\frac{m-1}{m+1}$ and $$P(1,m) \geq \frac{2}{m+1}$$ . A special case is $m = 1$ (we start with 1 additional green ball), then the lower limit equals one and so then the probability to return is 1. For other cases $m > 2$ , I am not sure.
