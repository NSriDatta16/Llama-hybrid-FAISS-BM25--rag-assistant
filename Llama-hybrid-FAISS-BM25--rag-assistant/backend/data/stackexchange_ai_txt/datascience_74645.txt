What you are doing seems fine in terms of preprocessing. Removing less informative words like stopwords, punctuation etc. is a very common technique. Here are some of my notes: probably best for speed to load your "nlp" object outside of the function call "-PRON-" must be the lemma for "you're" in this case. So you shouldn't remove it as it is following the correct logic. Though, you should investigate whether your model improves if you change your preprocessing logic if you use SpaCy to create your classification model, I'd recommend experimenting training a model without using any preprocessing. As far as I know, SpaCy handles some of this implicitly through feature engineering
