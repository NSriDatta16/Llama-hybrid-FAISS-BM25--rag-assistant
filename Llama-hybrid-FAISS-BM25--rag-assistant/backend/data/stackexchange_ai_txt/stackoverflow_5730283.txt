This is a linker error and can be easily resolved once you understand the process. By #include -ing the header file in your source code, that lets the compiler know about the definitions it requires. However, there's an extra step needed. You have to link all the various object files and libraries together. That's because, while the header contains information about the ArrayIntStorage stuff, the actual code for it is elsewhere. That's what's bought in at the link stage. Basically, you need to ensure that the object file or library is included in your build process. For example, the following gcc command will include the abc.o object module and bring in anything needed from the libxyz.a archive library: gcc -o myprog myprog.c abc.o -L/path/to/libs -lxyz It may also be done differently for different environments. For example, an IDE will most likely have it under project settings of some sort. This answer provides some more information of the compiling and linking processes common in a lot of environments.
