Autocorrelation has several plain-language interpretations that signify in ways that non-autocorrelated processes and models do not: An autocorrelated variable has memory of its previous values. Such variables have behavior that depends on what went before. Memory may be long or short relative to the period of observation; memory may be infinite; memory may be negative (i.e. may oscillate). If your guiding theories say the past (of a variable) remains with us, then autocorrelation is an expression of that. (See, for example Boef, S. D. (2001). Modeling equilibrium relationships: Error correction models with strongly autoregressive data . Political Analysis , 9(1), 78–94, and also de Boef, S., & Keele, L. (2008). Taking Time Seriously . American Journal of Political Science , 52(1), 184–200.) An autocorrelated variable implies a dynamic system . The questions we ask and answer about the behavior of dynamic systems are different than those we ask about non-dynamic systems. For example, when causal effects enter a system, and how long effects from a perturbation at one point in time remain relevant are answered in the language of autocorrelated models. (See, for example, Levins, R. (1998). Dialectics and Systems Theory . Science & Society , 62(3), 375–399, but also the Pesaran citation below.) An autocorrelated variable implies a need for time series modeling (if not dynamic systems modeling also). Time series methodologies are predicated on autoregressive behaviors (and moving average, which is a modeling assumption about the time-dependent structure of errors) attempting to capture salient details of the data generating process , and stand in marked contrast to, for example, so-called "longitudinal models" which simply incorporate some measure of time as a variable in an otherwise non-dynamic model without autocorrelation. See, for example, Pesaran, M. H. (2015) Time Series and Panel Data in Econometrics , New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Caveat: I am using "autoregression" and "autoregressive" to imply any memory structure to a variable in general, regardless of short-term, long term, unit-root, explosive, etc. properties of that process.
