calculating variance inflation factor for logistic regression using statsmodels (or python)?

I am making a logistic regression model using Statsmodels while following the book "Discovering statistics using R" by Andy Field, Jeremy Miles, and ZoÃ« Field . While following along the example I went on to calculate the VIF to check multicollinearity between variables in logistic regression model using following code: import pandas as pd import statsmodels.api as sm from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor from statsmodels.tools.tools import add_constant pen_df = pd.read_csv('penalty.csv') pen_df.drop(['Unnamed: 4'], inplace=True, axis=1) pen_df['Scoredx'] = pen_df['Scored'].replace({'Scored':1, 'Missed':0}) pen_df = add_constant(pen_df) p02 = sm.Logit(pen_df['Scoredx'], pen_df[['const', 'PSWQ', 'Previous', 'Anxious']]).fit() copy_df = pen_df.copy() copy_df.drop(['Scored','Scoredx'], inplace=True, axis=1) from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor vif = pd.Series([variance_inflation_factor(copy_df.values, i) for i in range(1, copy_df.shape[1])], index=copy_df.columns[1:]) print(vif) Which gave the output However , the output in the book comes as follows Upon going through the answer by Alexander in this post and this_documentation , I come to understand that VIF in statsmodels use OLS and due to that there may be this discrepancy in my answer. I want to know that how to calculate VIF in this case(logit model) using statsmodels or more generally python to match the answer given in the book. I have added datafile just in the case it may be useful for reproducibility.
