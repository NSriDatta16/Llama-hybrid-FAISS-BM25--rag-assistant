Recalculating IPW after stratification

This may seem a bit odd as a question. If one stratifies a dataset using a variable, which was also used in IPW calculation, one will have to recalculate the weight, right? I am asking because there is a part of me thinking that since it is a binary variable for IPW calculated via logistic regression, all male participants will weigh the same. Therefore, recalculating the weight will be somewhat redundant. Meanwhile, sex was weighted, hence, I should remove it... So the question is, do I need to recalculate the IPW after I divide the data into male-only and female-only? My instinct is yes. Any thought?
