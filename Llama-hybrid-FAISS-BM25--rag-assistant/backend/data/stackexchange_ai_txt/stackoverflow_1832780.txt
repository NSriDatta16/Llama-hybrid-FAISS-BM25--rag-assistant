Javascript Session Data Storage

Does anyone know of a reliable way to store data to use across pages of a site?... Here is what I've found so far: Cookies - Not enough capacity to store what I need atm. URL hash - Same as above Frames - Not a method I would use atm. HTML 5 document.localStorage and document.sessionStorage - Not fully supported yet Google Gears - The users of the site will most likely not have this installed YUI Storage - This sounds promising... does anyone have experience using it? jStore - This also sounds promising, but when I tried using the demo and reloaded the page, it lost my input. Does anyone have experience with this plugin? Note: I am not an admin of the site in question, so I don't have database privileges, but I am able to add scripting. Edit: I found this interesting site that saves session variables in the window.name... it probably has some security issues as well
