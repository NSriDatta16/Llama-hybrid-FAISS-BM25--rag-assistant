I am not sure but maybe you can modify the following class-library to suit your needs. Above class-library is great since you can overcome one of the most annoying shortcomings of the standard OpenFileDialog, namely the limit of not being able to browse the whole file system (it just let you browse My Documents subfolders and Storage cards). Maybe not the answer you wanted to heat but hey: it might work out with some slight changes to the code. Good luck.
