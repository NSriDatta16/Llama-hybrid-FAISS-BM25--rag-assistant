This follows my suggestion of treating problem complexity as predictor and treating it on a logarithmic scale, if only because otherwise what you see will be dominated by the effects of about 10 wild points. The results are not convincing of a well-determined relationship. Here the smoother is fairly arbitrary but the scatter doesn't encourage variants. Bottom line: Disappointing or surprising though it may be, there isn't a convincing relationship between these variables. Further thoughts: If you have other variables, perhaps more structure can be seen within. Measurement questions may be part of the problem: notably the solution complexity varies over about a four-fold range, while the problem complexity varies about fifty-fold. So the complexity measures may not be easily comparable.
