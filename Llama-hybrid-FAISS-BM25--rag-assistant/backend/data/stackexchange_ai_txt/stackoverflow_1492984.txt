Unfortunately, since mobile phones generally do not spend most their whole life connected to the internet, the only true push mechanism available is SMS/MMS via the PushRegistry API. The real problem with true push is that the server needs a way to identify the client and you can't rely on a temporary IP address given to your handset by the Mobile Network Operator. If you plan on using an HTTP connection channel, you NEED to poll the server for chat message updates. However, there are ways to make this less of a bad situation. If your game is supposed to regulary send/receive data to/from the server anyway, you can bundle the chat data into your own protocol in the body of the http requests and replies. You can technically mix the two approaches by using SMS push to trigger the HTTP retrieval of data but that can become expensive. About the proper use of the synchronized keyword in your MIDlet java code, I suggest you ask a more precise question, with included code sample as it is a different problem domain.
