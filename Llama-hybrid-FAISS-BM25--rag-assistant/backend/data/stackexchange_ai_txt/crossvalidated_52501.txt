Categorical independent variable with three levels and binary logistic regression

I want to learn which level of a categorical independent variable should I look to interpret the odd ratios in binary logistic regression. For example, I have one independent categorical variable (education ) with three levels. The results of binary logistic regression show that "edu" (reference level) is not significant but one of the levels is significant "edu(2)". Is it possible to ignore the overall significance of "edu" and interpret the "edu(2)"?
