Improving a logistic regression model in R

I have to devise a model in R, capable of predicting the type of a disease, which is a categorical dependent variable (three possible values), through several continuous and categorical, some of the latter being ordinal or dichotomous, independent variables (details of the dataset below). I used the multinom() function to create a first model, but how can I assess about how good this model is? And how can I compute the true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative? Below there's a detailed description of the dataset, which has more than 6000 entries, and the process through which I created the model. **Dependent variable** type of disease : [T, D, M] **Independent variables** year week no : number of occurrences nso : number of severe occurrences average temperature humidity rainfall age gender : [M, F] race : ["Chinese", "Indian", "Arabic"] job : ["Student", "General worker", "Housewife", ..., "Other"] EDIT As suggested in the first answer, I created training and test sets (...) smp_size (...) and then the model, with the multinom() function: formula = type~year+week+no+nso+temp_avg+humidity+rainfall+age+gender+race+job+town model_multinom And afterwards I've done some prediction: prediction = predict(model_multinom, data=test) summary(prediction) type2 type1 type3 1171 88 3298
