"Deep" One of the earliest deep neural networks has three densely connected hidden layers ( Hinton et al. (2006) ). "Very Deep" In 2014 the "very deep" VGG netowrks Simonyan et al. (2014) consist of 16+ hidden layers. "Extremely Deep" In 2016 the "extremely deep" residual networks He et al. (2016) consist of 50 up to 1,000+ hidden layers.
