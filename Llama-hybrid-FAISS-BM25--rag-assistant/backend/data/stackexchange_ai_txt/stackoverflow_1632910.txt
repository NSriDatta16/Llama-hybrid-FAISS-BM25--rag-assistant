According to MSDN , ArgumentOutOfRangeException is thrown by the Unit class's constructor when the value argument is out of range (not between -32768 and 32767). Somehow, that's the value being passed to that element on the page. Now, you've said that you are passing different values in different requests and that those requests work. What are the values that you are passing that work? What are the values that you pass that fail? EDIT: I see that you are using the Infragistics WebDialogWindow, and that you're trying to get the topmost coordinate of the dialog. THAT is the coordinate that is off. It's outside the valid range of values for the Unit class. The big question now is why is that the case?
