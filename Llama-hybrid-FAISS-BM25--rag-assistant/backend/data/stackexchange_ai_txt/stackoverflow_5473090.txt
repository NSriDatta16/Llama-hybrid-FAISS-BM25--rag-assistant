Is it possible for me to rearrange the hierarchy in Page_PreInit() so that when my code fires in Page_Init(), I'll have the proper UniqueId's assigned? I can't tell exactly what you are trying to do, but it sounds like Microsoft discourages it: Typically, you will not need to use the UniqueID property. For example, you should not write code that references controls by using a predicted value of the generated UniqueID property. You can read and pass the value of the UniqueID property to other processes, but you should not rely on it having a specific structure.
