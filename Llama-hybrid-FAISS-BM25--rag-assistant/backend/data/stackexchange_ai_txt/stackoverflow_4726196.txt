Compile errors with templates and new/delete operators (C++)

I'm trying to build a vector -style class and in order to use templates as well as the new , delete operators I have this piece of code: template class storage { private: type2 *organs; public: int num; storage(); //constructor ~storage(); //destructor void operator+(type2 newone); void operator-(int howmany); type2 operator[](int place); }; storage :: ~storage() { delete[] organs; //~~~~~~~Error number 1~~~~~~~~~~ } void storage :: operator+(type2 newone) { // ~~~~~~~~~~~Error number 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ organs = new type2[1]; num++; oragns[num-1] = newone; } The compiler (Dev C++) writes this error on Error number 1: invalid use of undefined type `struct type2' And this error on Error Number 2: `newone' has incomplete type However, I don't understand what's wrong. Any hints?
