You need to venture into the art of "feature engineering". You noted you already tried "dummies" and maybe one-hot-encoders. You noted you have too many features that may or may not be good predictors. You also noted you have trained your model, and it appears as if though it is overfitting. As a result, your next best option is "feature engineering". For feature engineering to be successful, you have to have a strategy and a well defined goal. It is not as simple as putting your data into a pre-backed function implementation of sklearn or similar AI/ML libraries and letting it work automatically in autopilot. With feature engineering, you drive, and you may need the assistance of a subject matter expert (SME), to ensure your data science/AI goal produces a valuable model (to send it to production if applicable).
