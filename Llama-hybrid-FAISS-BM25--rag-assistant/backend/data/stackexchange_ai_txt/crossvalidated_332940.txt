What are some accurate yet relatively simple methods for time series forecasting (stock prices)

I have started trying to do some stock price forecasting, and would like to know what some accurate yet simple methods are. I've covered the basic methods (naive, seasonal naive, average, moving averages) and would like to take the next step. Any tutorials, videos, etc that would be good for beginners?
