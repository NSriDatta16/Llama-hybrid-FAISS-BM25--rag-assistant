Just for providing further details, here following is the dataset with some main information: tibble [3,000 x 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) $ hosp_id : num [1:3000] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... #corresponding to number 1 of the aforementioned list and including 10 centrers $ sub_id : int [1:3000] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... #subjects ID $ age : num [1:3000] 51.4 50.2 51.6 57.2 60.5 ... $ sbp : num [1:3000] 140 144 145 166 176 ... $ dbp : num [1:3000] 85.8 76.1 77.5 100.3 125.2 ... $ bmi : num [1:3000] 22.4 22.1 22.6 25.1 25.9 ... $ cholesterol : num [1:3000] 161 176 176 195 195 ... $ sex : Factor w/ 2 levels "male","female": 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 ... $ smoker : Factor w/ 2 levels "no","yes": 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ area : Factor w/ 4 levels "north","east",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... #the area where each hospital is located (the four cardinal points) $ public : Factor w/ 2 levels "private","public": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... #clinic tipology (private or public) $ cabg : Factor w/ 2 levels "angioplasty",..: 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... #treatment variable (angioplasty or cabg) $ death_30_days: Factor w/ 2 levels "no","yes": 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 ... #outcome (death within 30 days from receiving the treatment) The model I should build require to scale variables and account the probabiltiy to receive one between the two treatment (cabg or angioplasty), according to a propensity score analysis criteria. As I've been keeping getting the errore I've mentioned above, I am supposed to scale variables in the following formula. ps_random Which should I pick up? Which criteria should I stick to? How and could I scale the variables? Should I scale every of them? Thanks for paying attention.
