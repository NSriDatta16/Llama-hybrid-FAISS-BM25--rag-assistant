Beta testing a new product

As a Micro ISV I am coming to the stage in the development of a new desktop software application where beta testing it with an external group of users would be great. I would prefer private invite only beta testing as opposed to public free for all beta testing. Are there websites/organisations, both free or paid, where I can 'reach out' to people (with some degree of selectivity) who want to test software and provide feedback/bug reports and so on? What have other people done when beta testing their products? UPDATE: I came across TryBeta which looks interesting (Although activity on the website seems to have ended around 2007). With regard to turning testers into customers, I am not too concerned with doing this at the moment. Advertising towards the target audience to build up a customer base will be put in place at a later stage. Right now just testers, ideally managed by a third party website/organisation, would be ideal. Many thanks in advance.
