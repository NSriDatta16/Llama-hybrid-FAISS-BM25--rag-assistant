FILESYSTEM vs SQLITE, while storing up-to 10M files

I would like to store up-to 10M files, 2TB storage unit. The only properties which I need restricted to filenames, and their contents (data). The files max-length is 100MB, most of them are less than 1MB. The ability of removing files is required, and both writing and reading speeds should be a priority - while low storage efficiency, recovery or integrity methods, are not needed. I thought about NTFS, but most of its features are not needed, while can't be disabled and considered to be an overhead concern, a few of them are: creation date, modification date, attribs, journal and of course permissions. Due to the native features of a filesystem which are not needed, would you suggest I'll use SQLITE for this requirement? or there's an obvious disadvantage that I should be aware about? (one would guess that removing files will be a complicated task?) (SQLITE will be via the C api) My goal is to use a more suited solution to gain performance. Thanks in advance - Doori Bar
