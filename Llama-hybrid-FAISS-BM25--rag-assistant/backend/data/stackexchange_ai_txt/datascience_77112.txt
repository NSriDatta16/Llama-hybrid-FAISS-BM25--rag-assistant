How to create ROC - AUC curves for multi class text classification problem in Python

I am working on a multiclass text classification problem and trying to plot ROC Curve but no success so far. Tried many solutions available but didn't work. Kindly please someone help me out with the following piece of code to plot the ROC curve. There are actually five different classes for which I am performing text classification. categories = ['Philonthropists', 'Politcians', 'Showbiz', 'Sportsmen', 'Writers'] train = dt.load_files(r'C:\Users\...\Learning\Train', categories=categories, encoding='ISO-8859-1') test = dt.load_files(r'C:\Users\...\Learning\Test', categories=categories, encoding='ISO-8859-1') count_vector = CountVectorizer() x_trian_tf = count_vector.fit_transform(train.data) tfidf_transformer = TfidfTransformer() x_train_tfidf = tfidf_transformer.fit_transform(x_trian_tf) learn = MultinomialNB().fit(x_train_tfidf, train.target) x_test_tf = count_vector.transform(test.data) x_test_tfidf = tfidf_transformer.transform(x_test_tf) prediction = learn.predict(x_test_tfidf) print("Accuracy is of Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier", accuracy_score(test.target, prediction) * 100)
