Is this a good use of Standard Deviation on data that is not normally distributed?

I have a series of numbers ranging from -0.69 to 14.703. These datapoints measure YoY change. I want to create a text descriptor based on where a value falls in a range determined by the Standard Deviation. My mean is 1.13144 and Std Dv is 2.1579. This leaves me with these standard deviation steps, to which I assign a value (i.e. if you fall between the mean and (negative) 1 SD, you are Below Average, between the mean and (positive) 1 SD, you are Above Average, and so on. This the list of values I got the mean and Std Dev from: Nearly every item in this list falls 1 SD below the mean. I know the data is not normally distributed, but I would have expected something a little less skewed. Am I using this correctly? Edit: Year over Year (YoY) change. I take last year's sales and this year's and find the percent difference.
