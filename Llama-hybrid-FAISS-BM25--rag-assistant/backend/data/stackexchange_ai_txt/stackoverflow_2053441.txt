I recently wrote a URL encoder, so this is pretty fresh in my mind. http://site/gwturl#user:45/comments All the characters in the fragment part ( user:45/comments ) are perfectly legal for RFC 3986 URIs. The relevant parts of the ABNF : fragment = *( pchar / "/" / "?" ) pchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@" unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG sub-delims = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" Apart from these restrictions, the fragment part has no defined structure beyond the one your application gives it. The scheme, http, only says that you don't send this part to the server. EDIT: D'oh! Despite my assertions about the URI spec, irreputable provides the correct answer when he points out that the HTML 4 spec restricts element names/identifiers . Note that identifier rules are changing in HTML 5 . URI restrictions will still apply (at time of writing, there are some unresolved issues around HTML 5's use of URIs).
