One of our application has a BeanShell interface that connects to our application over JMX with RMI+SSL. You can indeed pre-define variables by calling Interpreter#set() before actually invoking the Interpreter. Other than that, I agree with you on the "readline" like functionality. There is a project called java-readline (and BSH apparently ships with a plugin for it) that purports to provide functionality but I haven't investigated using it. It also requires a JNI library. I've heard that people use Scala and Groovy to implement command line clients but as of now, I don't think the Scala API for embedding the interpreter is standardized yet. I also don't believe they support the "readline" features you're looking for.
