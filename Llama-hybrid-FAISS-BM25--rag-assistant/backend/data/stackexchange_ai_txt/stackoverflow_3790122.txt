Case for first character of string

I need to make a decision about a string based on the first character, and I have a method defined in this way: (defn check-first [string] (case (get string 0) "+" 1 "-" 2 3 )) Currently it always returns 3 even when the string starts with those characters. What am I doing wrong? Also, is there a more elegant way to implement this?
