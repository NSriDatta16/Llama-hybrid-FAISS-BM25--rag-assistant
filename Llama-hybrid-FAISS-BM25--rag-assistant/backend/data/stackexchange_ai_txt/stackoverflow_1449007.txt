You are comparing two totally different things here. Neural Networks are used for regression/classification - given a set of (x, y) examples, you want regress the unknown y for some given x. Genetic algorithms are an optimization technique. Given a function f(x), you want to determine the x which minimizes/maximizes f(x).
