Implications of strict exogeneity for OLS in time series

Zero Conditional Mean (ZCM), or Strict Exogeneity, is given by: $E[u|X]=0$ Equivalently, $E[u_t|X]=0, t=1,...,T$ Is it true that this implies: Zero Unconditional Mean: $E[u_t]=0, \forall t$ Contemporaneous Exogeneity: $E[u_t|x_t]=0, \forall t $ (Where $x_t$ is a vector of explanatory variables) $E[x_su_t]=0, \forall t,s$ And are there any other things that ZCM imply that are particularly useful?
