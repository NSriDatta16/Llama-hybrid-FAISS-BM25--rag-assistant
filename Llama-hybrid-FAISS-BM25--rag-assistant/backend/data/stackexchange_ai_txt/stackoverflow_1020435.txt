Your date literal '19/06/2009' may be interpreted as style 101,US,mm/dd/yyyy or style 103,British/French,dd/mm/yyyy. 19 is not a valid "numeric month", so my guess is your development server is set to british/french (19/06/2009 => Fri, 19 Jun 2009) and your production server to u.s. styles/formats (19/06/2009 => error). http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms180878.aspx#UsingDateandTimeFormats says: String literal formats affect the presentation of data in applications to users but not the underlying integer storage format in SQL Server. However, SQL Server might interpret a date value in a string literal format, input by an application or user for storage or to a date function, as different dates. The interpretation depends on the combination of string literal format, data type, and runtime SET DATEFORMAT, SET LANGUAGE and default language option settings . and We recommend that you use date-time formats that are not DATEFORMAT dependent and are multilanguage. The ISO 8601 formats, '1998-02-23T14:23:05' and '1998-02-23T14:23:05-08:00' are the only formats that are an international standard. They are not DATEFORMAT or default login language dependent and are multilanguage.
