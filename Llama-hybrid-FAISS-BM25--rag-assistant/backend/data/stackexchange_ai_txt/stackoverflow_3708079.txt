As far as reading up on it would suggest, there is no hard limit on the size of sqlite db on the internal storage other than the normal limits, ie. what is spare. However some people are reporting exceptions occurring on larger databases, though I have yet to see anyone work out why. Sadly the internal function to report max size isn't useful for this either, it seems set at 1TB.
