You don't need to write a separate console application for that if the job is very minor. you can write a page separately and write a batch file i.e. a scheduler fr the same to schedule it. You can also schedule it through window's user interface. Apart for that, if your job is plan/step of a maintenance plan (like re-indexing, taking backup of db, defragmenting , cleaning up history/log etc) then create a maintenance plan for it from you sql server, under "Management" folder available.
