How can I compare model fitting accuracy between Random Forest and Logistic regression models

I am conducting a classification problem. Usually AUC is used to check the effectiveness of a model when performing logistic regression model. However, if I fit the same data set by using Random forest and logistic regression models, which measures should be used to check the accuracy of the two models? Are there any measures like "BIC" can be used to compare the two models? Thanks.
