Internet Explorer submit button styling

I'm making a web application and I got the design for it from a sub-contracted design company. The design is pretty nice, I like it, but I've stumbled across one thing I'm not sure how to implement nicely. The thing is - they've redesigned the looks of buttons to match the page style. So now I have two images - button up and button down. In Opera and FF I just say in css something like this: input[type="submit"] { background-image: url(btn_up.png); } input[type="submit"]:active { background-image: url(btn_down.png); } And it works like a charm. IE unfortunately does not understand the :active part. As with most web applications the IE crowd are the main intended audience, so it's rather important that it looks good at least there. Currently I've made a bulky workaround using an IE-only JavaScript, but I'm wondering - isn't there a more elegant way of doing this? Google and SO search did not help.
