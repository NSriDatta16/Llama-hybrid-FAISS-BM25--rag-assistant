change background color with change in mouse position

I was wondering if it is possible to set background-color with help of mouse coordinates. What i have is: I have a DIV-A which is draggable and some other divs which are droppable. What i need is : I need to highlight other divs on my page which are droppable, whenever my DIV-A passes over them. What i have is mouse coordinates, is it possible to apply css on the bases of mouse coordinates using jquery.
