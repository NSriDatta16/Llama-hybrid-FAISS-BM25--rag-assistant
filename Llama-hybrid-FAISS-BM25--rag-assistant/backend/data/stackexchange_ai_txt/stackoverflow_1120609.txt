The high resolution timers are usually gettimeofday on Linux style platforms and QueryPerformanceCounter on Windows. You should be aware that timing the duration of a single operation (even with a high resolution timer) will not yield accurate results. There are too many random factors at play. To get reliable timing information, you should run the task to be timed in a loop and compute the average task time. For this type of timing, the clock() function should be sufficient.
