Is it possible to combine both cross validation time serie and stratified

We suppose that I have the following dataset, where: The data describe the behaviors of each employ during the realization of his mission from the first day he starts working on the society. Each employee must complete a mission, and he could succeed in a task, or he could get fail. Generally, in our data we have this case: the firsts tasks are usually failed because the employee still unfamiliar with the new mission and the latest tasks realized by an employee are usually succeeded. I would like to apply cross-validation for splitting my data by taking into consideration that the latest task of each mission is mostly successful (something looks like the use of time series!), and I need also to use the notion of cross-validation stratified k-fold for training and testing my model according to each employee. I am still a beginner in machine learning and I would like to know if there is a similar method for splitting data according to these conditions or if it is possible to combine both cross-validation method (CV time series and stratified) for splitting my data. ID_Employ Mission_Id Task Succeed 1 M_1 T1 0 1 M_1 T2 0 1 M_1 T3 1 1 M_1 T4 0 1 M_1 T5 0 1 M_1 T6 1 1 M_1 T7 1 1 M_1 T8 1 1 M_2 T1 0 1 M_2 T2 1 1 M_2 T3 0 1 M_2 T4 1 1 M_2 T5 1 1 M_2 T6 1 1 M_3 T1 0 1 M_3 T2 0 ...... 2 M_1 T1 0 2 M_1 T2 0 2 M_1 T3 1 2 M_1 T4 0 2 M_1 T5 1 2 M_1 T6 1 2 M_2 T1 0 2 M_2 T2 0 2 M_2 T3 0 2 M_2 T4 1 2 M_2 T5 1 2 M_2 T6 0 2 M_2 T7 1 2 M_2 T8 1 ```
