Dragging object around a QWidget in Qt

I am trying to make a custom widget in Qt Creator that supports dragging objects around. At its simplest form, the widget has a QRect (or any other shape), on which I can click and then drag it around the widget. Once I release the mouse button, the QRect should stop being dragged. In my QWidget class, I have this method void ImageArea::mouseMoveEvent(QMouseEvent *event) { QPoint mousePos = event->pos(); qDebug() that can get the coordinates of the mouse as the pointer is moved around the screen. I have tried updating member variables for x and y, and then painting the QRect via the paintEvent method, but this doesn't work. Does anyone have any suggestions?
