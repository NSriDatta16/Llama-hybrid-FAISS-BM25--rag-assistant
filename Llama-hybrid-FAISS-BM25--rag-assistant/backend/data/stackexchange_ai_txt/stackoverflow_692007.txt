use static_cast as strager answers. I recommend against using the implicit cast (or even a C-style cast in C++ source code) for a few reasons: Implicit casts are a common source of compiler warnings, meaning you may be adding noise to the build (either now, or later when better warning flags are added). The next maintenance programmer behind you will see an implicit cast, and needs to know if it was intentional behavior or a mistake/bug. Having that static_cast makes your intent immediately obvious. static_cast and the other C++-style casts are easy for grep to handle.
