The very simplest thing to do is to call setVisible(false) on the TreePanel when you first create it and make it visible in your RPC callback. A more visually elegant approach would be to use setEnabled(false) combined with a CSS style that changes the widget to a more neutral appearance to indicate that "there will be data here, but you can't use it yet". You could do this by setting the background to a light grey color, or perhaps turning down the opacity of the panel.
