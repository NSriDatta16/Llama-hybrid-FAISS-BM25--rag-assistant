It seems that you are misunderstanding what $p$ is in binomial distribution . We use $p$ to denote one of the parameters of binomial distribution. So $x$ may have binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ $$ x \sim \mathrm{Binom}(n,p)$$ and the probability of $X = x$ is $$ f(x;n,p) = \Pr(X = x) = \binom n x p^x(1-p)^{n-x} $$ so $p \neq \Pr(X = x)$. As you said, $\mu = np$ and $p = \frac{\mu}{n}$, so if you get on average $2$ successes out of $10$ trials then $p$ is $2/10$. I'll translate this to simple example. You have biased coin (no matter that such thing probably doesn't exist ) with probability of obtaining heads in a single flip is $p$ and of tails is $1-p$. Single coin flip follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$ (so $p = 1/2$ is a fair coin). Now if you want to calculate probability of obtaining $x$ heads after flipping such coin $n$ times (i.e. $n$ Bernoulli trials), you use binomial distribution with parameters $n$, $p$ and on average you get $np$ heads. Each of the coin flips is independent of other and probability of heads in each of the flips is the same and equal to $p$.
