You probably want different tools for performance profiling and code coverage. For profiling I prefer Shark on MacOSX. It is free from Apple and very good. If your app is vanilla C you should be able to use it, if you can get hold of a Mac. For profiling on Windows you can use LTProf. Cheap, but not great: http://successfulsoftware.net/2007/12/18/optimising-your-application/ (I think Microsoft are really shooting themself in the foot by not providing a decent profiler with the cheaper versions of Visual Studio.) For coverage I prefer Coverage Validator on Windows: http://successfulsoftware.net/2008/03/10/coverage-validator/ It updates the coverage in real time.
