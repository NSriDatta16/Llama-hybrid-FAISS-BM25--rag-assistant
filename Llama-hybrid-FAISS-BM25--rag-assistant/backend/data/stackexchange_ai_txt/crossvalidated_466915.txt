Partial data reconstruction PCA vs Autoencoders

I'm running PCA on a image data with 4 components. Obviously I could just multiply the projections with the components to approximately recover my original data set, but I can also view each projection multiplied by it's corresponding component individually. Using this technique I can visualize how much each component contributes to the original image. Is there a similar technique for autoencoders that will let me see, visually, the contribution each feature has on the input image? Can this technique be extended to autoencoders that use convolutional layers?
