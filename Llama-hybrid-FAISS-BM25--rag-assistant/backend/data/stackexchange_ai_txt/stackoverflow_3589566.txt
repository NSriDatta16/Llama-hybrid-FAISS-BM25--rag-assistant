jQuery UI draggable properties

I have a list: One Two and then I have: $("#selector li").draggable({ revert: "valid" }); $("#xyz tr").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { console.log(ui.draggable.text()); } }); Q: How do I determine that it was id=1 or id=2 that was dropped? The text property is giving me "One" or "Two", but I need "1" or "2".
