How do you clone an array of objects in JavaScript?

...where each object also has references to other objects within the same array? When I first came up with this problem I just thought of something like var clonedNodesArray = nodesArray.clone() would exist and searched for information on how to clone objects in JavaScript. I did find a question on Stack Overflow (answered by the very same @JohnResig) and he pointed out that with jQuery you could do var clonedNodesArray = jQuery.extend({}, nodesArray); to clone an object. I tried this though, and this only copies the references of the objects in the array. So if I nodesArray[0].value = "red" clonedNodesArray[0].value = "green" the value of both nodesArray[0] and clonedNodesArray[0] will turn out to be "green". Then I tried var clonedNodesArray = jQuery.extend(true, {}, nodesArray); which deep copies an Object, but I got " too much recursion " and " control stack overflow " messages from both Firebug and Opera Dragonfly respectively. How would you do it? Is this something that shouldn't even be done? Is there a reusable way of doing this in JavaScript?
