Autocorrelation

I am having a data set that is collected over a period from 1990 to 2005. In each year there are more than 25000 observations. Observations for a particular year are unique (i.e. Person A who appears in 1999 is not present in any other years). The dependent variable in binary. I have constructed a logistic regression model on the entire data set (irrespective of time period). I want to check for auto correlation. When I did a DW test, I got a d-statistic close to 2 but the p-values is Can I use the DW test directly on the residuals (aggregated together irrespective of time) or should I use the DW test over each year's residual ?
