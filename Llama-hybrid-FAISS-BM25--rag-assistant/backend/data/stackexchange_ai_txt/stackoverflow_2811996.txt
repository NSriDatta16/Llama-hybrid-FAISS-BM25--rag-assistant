There are times when I wish I could just plug in a grid or datareader, hook it up and it just works, like I did in ASP.NET. Making applications in ASP.NET MVC is arguably more work. But then I remember all of the nitpicky things I had to deal with in ASP.NET, like ViewState, code-behind, and magic id's. The page rendering pipeline was so opaque to me that I never really got the hang of using the code-behind events properly. ASP.NET MVC just seems cleaner and better organized, and I have far finer control over my application and its markup. That said, I am glad that you can intermix ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC pages, because there are some things you can't do in ASP.NET MVC, like use server controls. The new enhancements in ASP.NET 4.0 should make it easier for dedicated ASP.NET developers to produce applications with finer control over their markup.
