Sum and mean of residuals

I ran a regression analysis to predict performance on an exam, calculated residuals and took an average and sum of the residuals and the result was ~ -0.011 (for average) and -2.34 for the sum of residuals. This was when the calculation was done on Excel. Using SPSS, when I requested for residuals to be saved while running the regression and then did a descriptive statistics for those residuals, the average was 3.4 E-14 and the sum was 0.0000. I'm not sure why two programs would result in vastly different values. Also, a tad confused as to what could be causing the negative value for sum of residuals despite the plots not revealing any glaring homoscedasticity or outliers. With regards to the sum/average of residuals being equal to zero, does the value have to exactly zero or does it have to be something with a really negative exponent to qualify as zero? What would be considered close to zero or almost zero in terms of a threshold? If there are references that could be provided for this threshold or range, that would be much appreciated too. Thanks!
