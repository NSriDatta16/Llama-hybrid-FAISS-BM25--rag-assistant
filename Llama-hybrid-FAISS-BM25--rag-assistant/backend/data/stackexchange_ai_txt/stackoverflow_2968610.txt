Reading Web 2.0 HTML Source Code with Perl

Is it possible to read HTML Web 2.0 Source Code that is dynamically generated ? The Perl LWP with its agent->response does not pick up any dynamically generated HTML code. Many websites today are generating dynamic html. If I am shoppping for best prices, and the prices are dynamically fetched and dumped, then I am out of business. Are we reaching the end of a era?
