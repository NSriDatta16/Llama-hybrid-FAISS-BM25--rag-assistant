Thank you guys for the answers, I've used one that looks like pcampbell's (+1 to him): SELECT * FROM whatevertable where CONVERT(CHAR(7),DataHoraInicio,120) = '2002-10' (this gets every registry from october 2002) I don't see any set back for this method, in fact, it's working flawlessly Thanks again!
