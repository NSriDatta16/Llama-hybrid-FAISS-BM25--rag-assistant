Calculate mean and autocovariance function to check stationarity

Hey I need some help with this exercise: Assume $z_{ t }$ be a sequence of independent normal random variables, each with mean 0 and time independent variance $\sigma^{ 2 }$, and let c be a constant. Is the following process for a time series stationary? If it is stationary specify the mean and the autocovariance function: $$ x_{ t }=z_{ 1 }*cos\left( ct \right)+z_{ 2 }*sin\left( ct \right) $$ So for a weak stationarity time series the mean and covariance function should be independent of time. I'm not sure how to calculate them by hand without R. Thanks for help.
