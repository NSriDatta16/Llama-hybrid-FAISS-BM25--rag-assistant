calculation of correlation time?

I have two time series of a two realizations of a random process, the process fluctuate around an average so i consider that is a ergodic process. I compute the time correlation function, but i need the characteristic time scale, better known as the correlation time, but i don't know how, This time characterizes the time for time correlation function decay to zero. I tried to fit a curve, but the resulting time its too big, so i think its not the correct way.
