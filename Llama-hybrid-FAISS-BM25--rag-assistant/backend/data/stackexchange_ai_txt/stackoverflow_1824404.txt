I don't want to get UserGroups each time I'am getting User. Then don't tie them together in the object model. It gets complex fast, the more you start doing that. If you are doing that to hand a single instance to the views, you can have a viewmodel with the set of info u need. Pay attention if you constantly end up needing the user with a set of related information, which could point to an alternate way to load all that related data. And then you get to be able to decide if you'll want to eager load it, and save those extra roundtrips that don't do any good.
