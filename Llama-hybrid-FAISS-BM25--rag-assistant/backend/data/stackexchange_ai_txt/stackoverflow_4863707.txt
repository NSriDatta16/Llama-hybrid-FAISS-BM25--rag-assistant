How to see Linux' view of the RAM in order to determinate the fragmentation

The only program relevant I know of is pmap , but this only prints the memory of one process. I would like to see how the physical memory is occupied and by which processes/library, including the kernel, of the entire physical RAM (as opposed to that from the process' POV with pmap ). Ideally also with a graphical interface. Do you know if there's any such tool? I know about the ambiguity introduced by libraries. If it's the case, it could display a 1-pixel wide line and an arrow to the real location of that library. What do I need this for? To view the RAM fragmentation.
