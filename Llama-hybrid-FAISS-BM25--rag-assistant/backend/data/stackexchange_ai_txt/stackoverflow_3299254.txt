I'd say ASP.net MVC is more suited to this type of development but I dont see any overwhelming reasons why you couldn't produce webforms pages using HTML5 as it't for the most part an extension to HTML4. Probably a lot more hand-coding pages than the RAD drag and drop webforms (unfortunately) encourages.
