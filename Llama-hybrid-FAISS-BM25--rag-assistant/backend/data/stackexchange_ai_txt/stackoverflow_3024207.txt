You may use Java Architecture for XML Binding (or simply JAXB) - with annotations it should be extremely easy and elegant. In the simplest case, all you have to do, is just add @XmlRootElement annotation to the bean you want to serialize into XML @XmlRootElement class Foo{ .. } and marshall the bean into a formatted string StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(Foo.class); Marshaller m = context.createMarshaller(); m.setProperty( Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, Boolean.TRUE ); m.marshal(individual, writer); By default , the Marshaller will use UTF-8 encoding when generating XML data to a java.io.OutputStream, or a java.io.Writer.
