I've found the solution: def save_opencv(request): if request.method == 'POST': form = OpencvForm(request.POST, request.FILES) if form.is_valid(): handle_uploaded_file(request.FILES['picture']) new_obj = form.save(commit=False) new_obj.created_by = request.user new_obj.save() return HttpResponseRedirect('.') else: form = OpencvForm() return render_to_response('opencv/opencv_form.html', { 'form': form, }, context_instance=RequestContext(request)) and the handle_uploaded_file: def handle_uploaded_file(f): destination = open('root', 'wb+') for chunk in f.chunks(): destination.write(chunk) destination.close() Please review the indentation. Also, in models.py I have: picture = models.ImageField(help_text=('Upload an image (max %s kilobytes)' %settings.MAX_PHOTO_UPLOAD_SIZE),upload_to='root',blank=True) Please be careful that I am saving it to root, which means THE ROOT OF MY SITE , not anything related to the computer file organisation. Also, there is not big deal about the code, the deal is the path - I really didn't understand how to set it at first. Anyway, hope it helps you.
