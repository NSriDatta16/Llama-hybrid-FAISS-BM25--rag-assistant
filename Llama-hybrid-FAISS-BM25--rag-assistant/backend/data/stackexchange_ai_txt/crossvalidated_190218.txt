Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and Differencing (R)

I'm using the ADF test to check for stationarity of two variables, using the ndiffs function in R. > ndiffs(x[, "Apples"], alpha = 0.05, test = c("adf")) [1] 2 > ndiffs(x[, "Romulans"], alpha = 0.05, test = c("adf")) [1] 0 Next step is as far as I understand to difference the time series with the appropriate lag to achieve stationarity, but this is when I encounter difficulty. Using: d.x1 = diff(x[, "Apples"], lag = 2) d.x2 = diff(x[, "Romulans"], lag = 0) doesn't work as the lag and difference must be an integer >= 1. and excluding the lag option for the Romulans variable gives a warning message as soon as I try dx = cbind(d.x1, d.x2) saying that the number of rows result is not a mulitple of vector length (arg 1) . Should I use lag 2 for both variables? What is the best way to handle a situation like this?
