Determine if current user is a domain or local user?

Is there a way to determine (.NET preferably) if the current user is a domain user account or local user account? Ahead of time - I don not know the domain name this is running on so I can't just look for DOMAIN\Username v COMPUTER\Username. Part of the answer could be determining the DOMAIN or COMPUTER name from code. [Edit] Expanding on Asher's answer a code fragment would be private bool isCurrentUserLocalUser() { return Environment.MachineName == Environment.UserDomainName; }
