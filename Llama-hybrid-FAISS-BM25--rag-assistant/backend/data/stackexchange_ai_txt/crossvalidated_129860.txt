What are hot research topics for PhD dissertation in Biostatistics?

I've been thinking of choosing research topics for PhD dissertation in Biostatistics. I wish to know some hot research topics in recent years. As far as I know, some hot research topics are: High-dimensional data analysis; causal-inference in experiments and observational studies; propensity score matching; Bayesian statistics. Time series; Model selection; Survival data analysis; My questions are: Are there any good literature reviews that summarize recent research trends in Biostatistics? What are must-read review papers for these topics?
