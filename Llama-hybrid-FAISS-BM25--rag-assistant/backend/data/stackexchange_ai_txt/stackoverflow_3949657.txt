Drag and Drop Divs and compare values

I have four divs with custom Attributes like: A1 A2 A3 A4 Now I would like to use jquery to make each div drag- and drop-able. Now when a user drags e.g. div A1 on div A2 (vice-verca would alos be possible), it shall compare the marker attribute and if the marker happens to be the same, I want an alert to inform the user about this. How would I achieve that ? Can I use jquery-only or do I need a plugin for that ?
