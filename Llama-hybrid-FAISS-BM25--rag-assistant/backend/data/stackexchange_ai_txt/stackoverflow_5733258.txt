Textbox on TextChanged event giving error!

I have a textbox in my webpage and I want to fire as soon User clicks or enter something on this textbox. Code is working but it is firing when an User hits Enter button. I want it to fire when user types their 1st character. Which event is app for this? This is my mockup code: But when I am running this webpage it is showing me this err: CS0123: No overload for 'txtAgentName_TextChanged' matches delegate 'System.EventHandler' I have this on my code behind: protected virtual void txtAgentName_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { } Made a breakpoint in in here, and seems like it is firing when I am hitting Enter button. I want to fire when user enter 1st character inside that textbox. What I am doing wrong here?
