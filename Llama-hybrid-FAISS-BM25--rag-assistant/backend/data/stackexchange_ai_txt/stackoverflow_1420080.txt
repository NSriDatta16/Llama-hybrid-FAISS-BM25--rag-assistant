Your problem isn't Flash's stage area, but the size of the browser container that Flash is embedded into. It's hard to explain without drawing pictures, but I'll take a shot: When you create a SWF, you choose a size in the authoring tool. Call that size the "Stage size". Later, when you embed your SWF in a browser, you define a size in the HTML - call this the "Container size". Usually the two sizes will be equal, but they don't have to be. What's important here is that when you view your SWF in a web browser, the Stage size is largely irrelevant (* see note below) - Flash will render everything, regardless of whether it's inside or outside of the Stage size. The Container size, rather is what determines the extents of your SWF's visual area in the browser. It's exactly the same as defining a in HTML - when you embed your SWF at a certain size, you are telling the web browser to allocate only that much area to Flash, and not to allow Flash to render anything outside that area. Now with all that in mind, the solution to your problem is one sense simple - just embed Flash into a larger container. If that solves your problem, then fine. However, I'm guessing that the reason you're asking is that you want your SWF's graphics to appear to be extending outside of its container. If this is the case, the only way to do it is to embed your Flash with a transparent background, into a larger container that is absolutely positioned with CSS to overlay the rest of your HTML content. This is kind of an advanced topic, but search for tutorials about "wmode=transparent" and they should get you started. note: (Throughout this answer I'm assuming that you are embedding with scaleMode set to "noScale" - if you're not, you probably should be unless you understand why not.)
