Depending on your requirements you could use the operating system and the file system in a number of ways. How large will the queue grow and how fast does it have to be? If the queue may be big but you are willing to open a couple files for every queue access you could use a BTree implementation to store the queue and file locking to enforce exclusive access. Slowish but robust. If the queue will remain relatively small and you need it to be fast you might be able to use shared memory on some operating systems... If the queue will be small (1000s of entries) and you don't need it to be really fast you could use something as simple as a directory with files containing the data with file locking. This would be my preference if small and slow is okay. If the queue can be large and you want it to be fast on average, then you probably should use a dedicated server process like Alex suggests. This is a pain in the neck however. What are your performance and size requirements?
