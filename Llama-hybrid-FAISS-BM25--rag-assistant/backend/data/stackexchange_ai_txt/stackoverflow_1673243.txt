How to handle unmergeable files in a version control system?

I am working in a model-driven environment, where Java code is generated from a MagicDraw model by AndroMDA. The models are developed iteratively, hence we would have to merge them if we create branches. But as I was told the models cannot be merged, because every time it is saved every id of every element will be replaced. But I want to use branches, so that every task is self-contained and has an explicit starting point and endpoint. How would you handle that? This is probably not a technical but an organizational question. How could the model be excluded from the branches without breaking them? Or is there any workaround for MagicDraw models? (Offtopic: Generated files are not checked in.)
