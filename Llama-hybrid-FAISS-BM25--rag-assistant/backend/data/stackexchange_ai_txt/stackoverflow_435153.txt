+1 @WW As an aside: ROWID for index organized tables are different (they are called UROWID, I believe), because the physical location of the row can change during updates to the table (when tree nodes split or are joined). In order to make indexing still possible, the UROWID includes the "logical id" (the primary key), and the "likely physical id" (a regular ROWID), the latter of which may be expired.
