I think that for obtaining a point estimate of your parameter, a Bayesian approach does not really have any advantages over a frequentist approach I would strongly oppose to that. Take the case of a coin flipped three times and we are looking for a point estimate of the probability $\theta_{head}$ of a "Heads" result. Let there be three flips with the result of 2 Heads and 1 Tails. A Frequentist approach with no prior information will result in a point estimate of $\theta_{heads} = 2/3$ - which in a case of coin flips is just nuts . No reasonable person would deduct from this experiment, that the coin will likely show heads in 2 out of three flips to come. Prior information is worth a lot when making point estimates in case of scarce data. Missing the chance of adding prior information is a big downside of Frequentist statistics. (Obviously, not having headaches to define a prior and not having to defend you choice of prior is a big advantage of Frequentism, but that'S not the point here.) I think that for obtaining a point estimate of your parameter, a Bayesian approach does not really have any advantages over a frequentist approach, but I was wondering if this also was the case from a forecasting perspective I think that this question is missing an important point. You should ask: "Is it reasonable, to do forecasting/prediction based on point estimates?" A Bayesian would strongly argue, that you should do prediction based on the whole posterior distribution of possible coefficients because forecasting/prediction based on point estimates disregards all information about how imprecise the point estimate is.
