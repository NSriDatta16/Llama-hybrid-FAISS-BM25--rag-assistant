Localised filters for CNNs

I was going through some material and the term "localized filters" was used, can someone please explain what it means and what are the advantages of having a localized filter. EDIT-1 My question is in the context of the word used in NIPS 2017 tutorial on Geometric Deep Learning on Graphs and Manifolds at 7:23 it is said that "In many successful instances of CNN models, these filters are localized in space. And the intuition why they have to be localized can be understood from the geometric point of view, that if I apply my filters to the inputs that are slightly deformed then many of the filter responses are going to be stable." I am not able to understand the last line. For this purpose, I have read stuff related to localization of rings and related things in Algebra but can't relate from there as well.
