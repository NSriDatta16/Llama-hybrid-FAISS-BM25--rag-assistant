Yes you can set the color after it's initialized like this: $.jPicker.List[0].color.active.val('rgb', { r: 123, g: 123, b: 123 }); //or hex style: $.jPicker.List[0].color.active.val('ahex', 'FFFFFFFF'); //last 2 are alpha Where each value is the 0-255 of the color for red, green, and blue. The dragging there's no built-in support for, but you may be able to use a jQuery UI .draggable() on the panel...not sure what possible conflicts the picker's bindings will have with that.
