How to add a new category to a deep learning model?

Say I have done transfer learning on a pre-trained network to recognize 10 objects. How can I add a $11^{th}$ item that the network can classify without losing all the 10 categories I already trained and the information from the original pre-trained model? A friend told me that active research is going on in this field, but I cannot find any relevant papers or a names to search for?
