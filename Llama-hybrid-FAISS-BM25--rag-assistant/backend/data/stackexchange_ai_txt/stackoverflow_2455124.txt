We have created a complete MVP framework for .NET, based on the Taligent ideas. It took us some time to get right but now we can create applications by writing business classes, creating a new form and drag-dropping the properties of a class onto the form. The framework is very sophisticated and allows for the customisation of forms at runtime, as well as automatically hooking up validation in the business classes to edits on the form. We also wrote an OPF (Object Persistence Framework) to complement it, so avoiding the need to manage database code as well.
