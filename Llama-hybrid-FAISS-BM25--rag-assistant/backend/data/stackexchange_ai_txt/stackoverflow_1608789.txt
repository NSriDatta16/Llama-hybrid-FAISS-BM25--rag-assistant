There is an "elegant" way to do it with a single regex: ^(?:2()|3()|4()|5()){4}\1\2\3\4$ will match the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5 in any order. All four are required. Explanation: (?:2()|3()|4()|5()) matches one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, or 5. The trick is now that the capturing parentheses match an empty string after matching a number (which always succeeds). {4} requires that this happens four times. \1\2\3\4 then requires that all four backreferences have participated in the match - which they do if and only if each number has occurred once. Since \1\2\3\4 matches an empty string, it will always match as long as the previous condition is true. For five digits, you'd need ^(?:2()|3()|4()|5()|6()){5}\1\2\3\4\5$ etc... This will work in nearly any regex flavor except JavaScript.
