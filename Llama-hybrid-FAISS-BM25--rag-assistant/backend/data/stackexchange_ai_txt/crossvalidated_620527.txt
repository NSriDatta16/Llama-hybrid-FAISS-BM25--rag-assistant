Probability that $\beta_A$ > $\beta_B$ using the posterior distributions directly

Suppose a regression coefficient was estimated in sample A (from country A) through a Bayesian linear regression model. The resulting posterior distribution, comprising 10,000 simulations, was obtained and stored. Weeks later, the same model was subsequently applied to an independent sample (country B), referred to as sample B, resulting in another posterior distribution containing 10,000 simulations. Is it valid to estimate the probability, Pr( $\beta_A$ > $\beta_B$ ), by directly sampling the posterior distributions obtained from Bayesian linear regression models fitted separately on sample A and sample B, or is it necessary to fit a new model in which the coefficients are estimated in a unified manner?
