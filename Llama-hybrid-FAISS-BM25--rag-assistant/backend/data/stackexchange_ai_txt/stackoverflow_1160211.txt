iPhone Tile-based game board question

Let's say you have a game board where you have tiles, like those where its a picture and its scrambled but you have one empty tile. So you drag a tile around until you can reassemble the picture. You have a 3x3 or 4x4 (doesnt matter) matrix with one empty square. example: http://www.kirix.com/extensions/sliding-tile-picture-puzzle/ What I'm interested in is the mechanics of the dragging and placing. So you select a tile next to the blank spot, and drag it to the open spot and release. it then 'stays' put. has anyone a source example of such a game?
