A Google search turned this up (I didn't know how to do it, but your question made me curious). Post below. Got it to work on text files, as follows (on W32) ---- ~/vimfiles/after/syntax/text.vim hi default Oddlines ctermbg=grey guibg=#808080 hi default Evenlines cterm=NONE gui=NONE syn match Oddlines "^.*$" contains=ALL nextgroup=Evenlines skipnl syn match Evenlines "^.*$" contains=ALL nextgroup=Oddlines skipnl ---- $VIM/vimfiles/after/filetype.vim augroup filetypedetect au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt setf text augroup END ---- ~/vimfiles/colors/almost-default.vim [...] hi Oddlines ctermbg=yellow guibg=#FFFF99 hi Evenlines ctermbg=magenta guibg=#FFCCFF [...] Notes: 1. filetype.vim in an "after-directory" and with ":setf" to avoid overriding already-detected "special" .txt files. With "default" before the highlight name in the syntax file (but not without it) the colors from the colorscheme (invoked from the vimrc) are used. (Without a colorscheme, the "default" colors from the syntax file are still used.) Haven't succeeded (but haven't much tried) to make it work for a more complex filetype with an already defined syntax like HTML After entering the above changes, Vim must be restarted for them to take effect. OK, enough for now, I'm taking a nap. Best regards, Tony.
