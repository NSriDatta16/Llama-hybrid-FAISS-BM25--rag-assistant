Writing compilers ... what's right and what's wrong?

Okay, in my quest to figure out the necessary stuff to write a compiler, I've reached a bit of a roadblock. It seems that every technology or tool that I find has some opposition somewhere. I use Bison and Flex right now but I'm getting the feeling that this method is outdated. Is this true? Is this a good forward-compatible way to proceed with writing a full fledged programming language? In a sea of different concepts and tools (ANTLR, LL(k), GLR, LALR, LLVM, Flex, Bison) What's the current trend and best practices for writing compilers? Is the dragon book out of date?
