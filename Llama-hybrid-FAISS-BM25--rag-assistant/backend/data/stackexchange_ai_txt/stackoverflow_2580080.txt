P2 Touchpoint chmod not working?

I'm using Eclipse 3.5.2 and I've created a p2.inf with the following information: instructions.install = \ chmod(targetDir:@artifact,targetFile:$os$/libfoo.so,permissions:755); instructions.install.import= \ org.eclipse.equinox.p2.touchpoint.natives.chmod I placed the p2.inf inside the META-INF folder of the fragment, but when I install the update site, libfoo.so does not have execute permissions. After pulling my hair out, I tried a p2.inf referencing a non-existing *.so, but nothing seems to happen. No error messages, exceptions, or warnings of any kind to indicate the P2 touchpoint action failed... What's the deal? Any ideas?
