I basically agree with amoeba's comment but it doesn't offer much in the way of a solution. What I would do is first drop q from the inputs of the clustering. Secondly, you should standardize your variables to mean zero and unit variance. Now if you try your k-means again, it will likely not be as heavily dependent on tsd. However, you may also want to try other algorithms such as Gaussian Mixture Models or Affinity Propagation. Afterwards you can summarize your clusters by your ordinal variable. But this plotting approach is not the best for clustering, in my arrogant opinion. I usually plot the data on the first two or three PCA coordinates. Doing the PCA can also tell you a lot about the variables. For instance, if you had done it on this dataset ahead of time you would have seen that 1) the first PC dimension dominates the clustering and 2) tsd is very highly correlated with the first PC. Clustering is never an exercise in perfection, but keep at it and see if you get a result that is useful.
