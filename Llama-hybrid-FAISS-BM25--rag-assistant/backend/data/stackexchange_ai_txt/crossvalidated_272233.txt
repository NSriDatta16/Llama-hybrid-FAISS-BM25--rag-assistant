First of all: Slight Autocorrelation is not unusual for (non-squared) stock return data in my experience. Otherwise there would be no point in trying to decide, whether there is a positive/negative trend or not, from the perspective of investors. How big is the difference between both $p$-values? Which lag-orders did you choose for the test? The differing values might be from the differing power of the test for the different sample sizes, combined with a weak trend in the in-sample period. In practice, you may try to include an AR model for the mean series. If the AR coefficients aren't significant (which is to be expected), I'd suggest to just use a fixed mean for the daily return data and model the volatility with some GARCH model that can handle the leverage effect of stock returns (EGARCH, Beta-t-EGARCH).
