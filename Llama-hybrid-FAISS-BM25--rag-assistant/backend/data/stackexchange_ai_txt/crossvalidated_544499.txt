How can I combine the scores of a multilabel classifier?

I have a keras neural network with 8 outputs and it is a multilabel problem, which means that an observation can be classified into more than one target class. Let's suppose I have the following vector of 8 probabilities (events A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) calculated by the model to a given observation: [0.31, 0.45, 0.89, 0.02, 0.43, 0.21, 0.96, 0.32] So, we can interpret that: P(A) = 0.31, P(B) = 0.45 and so on... But what if I want the probability of an observation belong to classes A or B, for example ( P(A or B) = ? ). Or the probability P(A and B) = ? I imagine there are some things to take in consideration, like: Are the events independent? How can I check the intersection of the events? I would appreciate references of how can I approach this problem.
