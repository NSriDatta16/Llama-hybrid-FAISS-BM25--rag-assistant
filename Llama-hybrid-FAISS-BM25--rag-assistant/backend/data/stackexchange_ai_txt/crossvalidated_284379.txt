How to determine, whether time series is random

I have a discrete time series (1000 discrete ticks), which only has values from {0,1,2,3,4}. Here's a picture of 150 somewhere in the middle of this series. But, actually, it has no sensitive difference from the other 850 ticks. I mean, the series is completely stationary and has no visible dependencies... Goal is to forecast summed values within 1,3 and 10 tick intervals​. In my opinion , the best approach is to take the median for 1 tick and take the average among 3-length window and 10-length windows, because I think that it's random. I want to know, are there any methods that help to find out, whether a series is random or not. And listen to your ideas about forecasting it. Remark for Martjin's answer : Thank you for your answer. It's more likely, that state 3 goes to state 1 or 2 than 3 just because there are more states of 1 and 2 in the sample (they are more probable in general) I have thought of statistical tests, but the problem is that I have to idea of expected frequencies​. Imagine, that this time sequence, which shows number of customers per day. It may have the same values to dominate over others just because some loyal customers visit us. So it is still completely random but now uniformly random. But with assumption of frequency you will reject the Hypothesis, that claims the randomness of the series. I thought there are some tricks with algorithms, which have inner states. EG.: If we show, that it has very bad accuracy, that will mean, that 100% confident time series is independent​ from it's previous states
