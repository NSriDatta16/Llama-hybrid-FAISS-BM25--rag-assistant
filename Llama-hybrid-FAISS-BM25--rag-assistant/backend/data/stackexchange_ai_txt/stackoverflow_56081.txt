Can you not just handle the TextChanged event and execute the command from there? private void _textBox_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { MyCommand.Execute(null); } The alternative, as you say, is to create a TextBox that acts as a command source, but that does seem like overkill unless it's something you're planning on sharing and leveraging in many places.
