Retrieve user features in real time from UserId for prediction

Let's say I'm building an app like Uber and I want to predict the user's most likely destination based on the user's past history, current latitude/longitude, and time/date. Here is the proposed architecture - Let's say I have a pre-trained model hosted as a service. The part I'm struggling with is, how do I get the user features from the database in realtime from the RiderID to be used by the prediction service (XGBoost Model)? I'm guessing a lookup in a SQL database will take too long, considering I have 1M+ users and rides. Thanks in advance!
