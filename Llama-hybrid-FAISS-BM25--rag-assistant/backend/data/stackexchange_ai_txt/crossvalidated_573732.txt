Ridge or multiple linear regression following PCA?

I have a real world clinical dataset with a severe issue of p >> n. I have thus decided to run PCA before modelling the data. This leads to a dataset with 150 samples with 85 features. I would like to now use regression to predict outcomes in both a cross-validated fashion as well as build a model with the training data to predict outcomes in an external validation dataset. My question is: because I have done PCA (which from my understand would aid with the issue of collinearity), would ridge regression still be meaningful to use? I am getting very similar results in the cross-validation between the two, with ridge regression perhaps even performing slightly better (based on RMSE). My understanding is the regularization feature is helpful for predicting due to aiding with the issue of overfitting. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
