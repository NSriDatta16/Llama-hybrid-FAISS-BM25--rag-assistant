Low intraclass correlation although between variance is very high in random effects model

I don't understand why a random effects model can give you a very low rho (intraclass correlation coefficient), if the between variance (between subjects) in your dataset is very high on all independent variables compared to the within variance (over time). Maybe my interpretation of rho is incorrect and somebody can help me understand it correctly. As you can see from this table, between variane is much higher than within variance for almost all independent variables: . xtsum IV_1-IV_10 Variable | Mean Std. Dev.
