PDF of human population weight distribution

I have a lot of data on human weight coupled with information about gender, age, country and platform (desktop or mobile user). Looking something like this: id, gender, age, country, countryWeight, version, weight, count ... 11, m, 39, HR, 90.7, mobile, 99, 2 12, w, 38, RU, 72.7, desktop, 43, 7 13, w, 13, NL, 72.3, desktop, 57, 71 14, m, 31, PT, 78.7, mobile, 92, 1 15, w, 43, FI, 70.8, mobile, 95, 2 ... The countryWeight is a average weight for that gender and country which I found somewhere, so I do not plan to use country. I would like to compare the distribution of a subset of the data (based on other variable) with an estimated 'expected' distribution based on the subset's composition with regards to gender, age, country and version. Human weight is not normally distributed. So I tried to fit a log normal distribution but the tails were not looking that good. So I was looking into fitting a gamma distribution. I'm not good with statistics so I felt I better ask someone here if there is a good approach for this. I'm not trying to write a scientific paper, nothing has to be exact and no other number than the n= will be shown. Just nothing poking you in he eye when looking at lines of actual and 'expected' distribution. So is there a way to use this data to get a normalized probability density function for a given profile (e.g. women, age 34, from US, using desktop)? I'm using R by the way. And yes the reason I'm asking is that I'm a humble man who do not know what I'm doing.
