Simply saying "use fulltext" isn't enough. His solution is not necessarily about having more advanced text searching within each entity type. He needs to be able to query the index for any type of entity based upon the query string. I could see using NHibernate.Search as the method to populate a Lucene index, but don't know if the capabilities of it support searching the index irrespective of the index document type (the NHibernate class being persisted). So you may have to query the Lucene index more directly and interpret the results for display or direct retrieval of the underlying object in the SQL server DB via NHibernate itself.
