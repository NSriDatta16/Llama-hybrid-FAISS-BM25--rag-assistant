Application of Wavelet Transform and Differencing on Time Series Data (to denoise and remove seasonal adjustment and other trends)

I am working on an LSTM model to predict time series data (stock prices) and I would like an opinion whether to denoise my data or not before feeding it into the model. According to Investopedia, Denoising time series data before feeding it to your model can allow important patters to stand out, but also may lead to certain data points being ignored by emphasizing others. Hence, there is no correct answer as we will definitely have pros and cons. Some questions to shine some light on my doubts: What is the difference between Wavelet Transform and a Differencing Method to denoise data? Which method would be a better rational application? Can be both used together? To have a clarification on what I want to achieve, an example of differencing is applied in this post .
