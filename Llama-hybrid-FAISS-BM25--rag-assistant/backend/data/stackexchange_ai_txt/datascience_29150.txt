Demoing data science work

To data scientists who use python for development, how do you demo your work? I used to demo my work in Shiny as my developments was mainly in R. Now I develop 99% in Python but not sure of the best way to demo work (predictive modelling, data analytics side, pattern detection,..etc)? Currently I use Dash, but the amount if time I spend on html and css makes it less appealing.
