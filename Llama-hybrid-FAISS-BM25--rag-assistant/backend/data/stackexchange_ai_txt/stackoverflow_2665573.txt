You can cast the enum values to int without any problems: Bear in mind that the enum definition implicitly has a 0-based index. If you want more control, you can manually assign int values to the enum yourself: public enum Role { Viewer = 1, Reporter = 2, User = 3 } [Update] Based on your comments, I get that you want to bind a database value to the radiolist. You can do that by using the following code: This code assumes the database value is synced with Model.Role, but you can replace it with your own logic of course. And there are more elegant ways to write the radiobutton enumeration, but for only 3 radio options, it's safe to stick to this solution.
