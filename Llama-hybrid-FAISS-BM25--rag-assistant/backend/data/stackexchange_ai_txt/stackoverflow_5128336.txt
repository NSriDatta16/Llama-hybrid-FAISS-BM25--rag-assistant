Rails tip - "Use model association"

So, I've read in some book about tip "Use model association", which encourages developers to use build methods instead of putting ids via setters. Assume you have multiple has_many relationships in your model. What's best practise for creating model then ? For example, let's say you have models Article, User and Group. class Article and ArticlesController: class ArticlesController Is there a cleaner way ? Thanks!
