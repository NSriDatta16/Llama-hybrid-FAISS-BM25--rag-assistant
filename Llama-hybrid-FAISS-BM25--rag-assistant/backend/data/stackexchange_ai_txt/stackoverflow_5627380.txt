Upload file in ASP.NET MVC (Again!)

I have a problem with uploading file in asp.net mvc 2. My controller function's parameter is a FormCollection type. Because the fields are too numerous, I can't separate each field as a parameter. I have 2 upload file fields in my form. How can I get uploaded files in my controller? I tried this way: public ActionResult CreateAgent(FormCollection collection, HttpPostedFileBase personImage) { ... } but personImage was null . :( or this way: HttpPostedFileBase img = this.HttpContext.Request.Files[collection["personImage"]]; but img was null to. Also collection["personImage"] was the name of selected file (without path) and I can't cast it to HttpPostedFileBase . Note that all fields must be filled in on one page. I can't let the customer upload images in a separate page!
