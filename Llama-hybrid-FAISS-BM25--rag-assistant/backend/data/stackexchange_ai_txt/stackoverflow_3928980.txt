Filesnames with FUSE and IMAP

I want to build a fuse-filesystem with IMAP4 in python. As filename I would like to use the subject of each mail. So I can rename the filenames and with this the Subjects. But subjects can be used several times in one directory, so this breaks the common filesystem rules. I wouldn't like to use a difficult directory-system (like here ) nor the unique Message-ID (then I cannot rename my files and directories). I want to use e-mails in imap as (fuse-)directories and attachments of these mails as (fuse-)files. (For that only one layer of directories is possible.) The intention of this imapfs is to use mails as a storage-possibility. Are there any suggestions how to deal with this filename problem? Thanks for any incitements.
