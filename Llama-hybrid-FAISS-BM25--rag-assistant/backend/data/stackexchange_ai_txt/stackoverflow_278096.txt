Free OpenMosix replacement?

I was shocked to learn that OpenMosix is closed . Can you suggest any similar free tool for linux. For those who don't know, OpenMosix is a software package that turns networked computers running GNU/Linux into a cluster. It automatically balances the load between different nodes of the cluster, and nodes can join or leave the running cluster without disruption of the service. The load is spread out among nodes according to their connection and CPU speeds. The nicest part is that you don't need to link your programs with any special libraries neither do you need to modify your programs. Just "fork and forget". Another nice (but not must have) feature is the fact that it doesn't have to be installed on dedicated computers, but can sit on various desktop computers in your organization/lab/home etc. I'm aware of the names of several possible solutions ( for example ). I'm looking for personal experience and/or nice reviews EDIT Mosix , the predecessor of OpenMosix, used to be free (as free beer). However, now it costs money
