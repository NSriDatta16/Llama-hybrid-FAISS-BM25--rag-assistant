Why is RBF kernel used in SVM?

I learned that due to infinite series expansion of exponential function Radial Basis Kernel projects input feature space to infinite feature space. Is it due to this fact that we use this kernel often in SVM.? Does projecting in infinite dimensional space always makes the data linearly separable.?
