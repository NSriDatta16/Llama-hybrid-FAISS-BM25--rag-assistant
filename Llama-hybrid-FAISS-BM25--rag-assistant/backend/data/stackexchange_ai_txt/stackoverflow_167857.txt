Selenium Drag&Drop in testing javascript

Need your help in such a specific situation. I use Selenium framework for testing the application, which based on " ext js " library. There are 2 trees of elements. I need to move an element from one tree to another element in the second tree. I use dragAndDropToObject(xpath1,xpath2) ; I can see that method takes ' xpath1 ' element, tries to bring it to the ' xpath2 ' element and no result - the element ' xpath1 ' comes back to the previous place. It seems like the method doesn't see the pointed object, doesn't release a taken element on that. If I use another method of Selenium - f.e. click(xpath2); - it clicks on the pointed object, so the problem is in dragAndDropToObject .
