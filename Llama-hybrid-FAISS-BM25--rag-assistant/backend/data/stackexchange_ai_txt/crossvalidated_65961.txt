How to test for mean and variance both affected by a variable?

Suppose you observe $\left(x_i,y_i\right)$, where $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2\right)$. There are a number of ways that the $\mu_i, \sigma_i$ might vary with $x_i$: If one suspected $\mu_i$ varied with $x_i$, but $\sigma_i$ is independent of $x_i$, one could perform plain old linear regression. If one suspected $\sigma_i$ varied with $x_i$, a heteroskedasticity test ( e.g. Breusch-Pagan) could be performed. I am interested in a third case where ${\mu_i}/{\sigma_i}$ vary linearly with $x_i$, but there is no correlation assumed between $\mu_i$ and $x_i$, and no correlation assumed between $\sigma_i$ and $x_i$. Is there a standard test for this problem?
