You have several options: Create a package configuration table as described here and here . This could work well if you are running the packages on the same server. Override the connection settings in the SQL Server Agent Job. This could work well enough, but it can be difficult to manage if every job has to override connection settings. Use the package configuration XML file and run your packages through the agent via DTEXEC. This seems like overkill to me if the packages are on the same server. Use a variable in the package that inspects the store it is running under to determine which database to use. This is a theory that I haven't tested. If I am correct, the advantage of this approach is that you don't need to setup anything outside of the package. The downside is that it may be difficult or impossible to implement, particularly when you have to consider how the package will run locally in BIDS during testing.
