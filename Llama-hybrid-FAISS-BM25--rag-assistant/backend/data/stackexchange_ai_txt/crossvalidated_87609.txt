The first principal axis (some people would refer to it as "principal component", but I advocate calling it "principal axis") is a vector of length $756$ (number of your "locations"), so $756$ numbers $w_i$. To project your data onto the first principal axis you need to take each column of the data matrix (i.e. $1000$ years at one location), multiply it by the corresponding number $w_i$ (the whole column is multiplied by the same number), and add the $756$ resulting $1000$-long columns together. You will get one column of length $1000$, and this is your North Atlantic Oscillation. This projection is also what I would call "principal component" . Important thing to realize is that principal axis is a vector in location space, i.e. has as many coordinates as there are locations. Projecting onto this axis means reducing all your $756$ locations to one "composite location", which is simply a linear combination (i.e. "weighted sum") of all individual locations. See my answer here about this terminological distinction: What exactly is called "principal component" in PCA?
