Adding both a collection and a custom field to a Select Box

I am making a select box, and I'm using a collection in it. But at the top of all the selections I want to add something that otherwise wouldn't be in that collection. Here is my select box : = select (@organization, "tabs", @organization.tabs.collect { |t| [t.title, t.id] }, {}, {:class => "text_tab_link"} ) And I would like to add the words About and Edit as an additional selection at the top of the collection. Anyone know how to pimp a select box?
