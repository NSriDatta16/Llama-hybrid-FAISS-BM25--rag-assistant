Sometimes the optimization function is converted several times for simplicity. Take SVM for example. The original objective function is: It is just equivalent to: And this can be solved with Quadratic Programming package. With Lagrange duality, the objective function can be further converted to: Let , The objective function is now changed to: (1) Now consider another objective that just changes the order of maximum and minimum (also called the dual of (1)): (2) Note that â‰¤ . When Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition is satisfied, the solution of (2) is equal to the one of (1), and (2) is easier to solve since after the derivative on $w$ and $b$ to minimize the function, there is only one unknown $\alpha$ in the optimization function. From the example above you can notice there are several times in one problem that the minimization and maximization can be exchanged in order to get the solution more quickly.
