JQuery SelectToUISlider Issues

Hopefully this hasn't been asked before as just a slider question, but I couldn't find an answer when already browsing questions. So, here goes: I have a SelectToUISlider ( http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/update_jquery_ui_slider_from_a_select_element_now_with_aria_support/ ) which is basically a modified JQuery UI Slider, and I'm using a range value. So, I start with one handle at 60, and another at 100 (scale from 0 to 100). What I want to do is click a radio button so that the 100 changes to a 0, and be able to change back to 100. I have been unsuccessful at changing it via JQuery selectors/javascript. However, when changing the selects to move the handles, this works, but the range appears not to follow if the second handle (at 100) moves to 0 behind the first handle (at 60). I'm thinking I might have to destroy the slider and rebuild it with the second handle (that starts as 100) become the first handle at 0 in this scenario (although I've tried destroying it and it doesn't seem to respond to that either.) Here's what I've tried so far that doesn't work: {literal} $(function(){ $('select').selectToUISlider({ labels: 10 }); }); function event_occurs(does) { if (does == 1) { $('.ui-slider').slider('option', 'values', [60,100]); } else { $('.ui-slider').slider('option', 'values', [0,60]); } } form {font-size: 62.5%; font-family:"Segoe UI","Helvetica Neue",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; } fieldset { border:0; margin: 1em; height: 12em;} label {font-weight: normal; float: left; margin-right: .5em; font-size: 1.1em;} select {margin-right: 1em; float: left;} .ui-slider {clear: both; top: 5em;} .ui-slider-tooltip {white-space: nowrap;} {/literal} {section name="estimates" loop=101} {$smarty.section.estimates.index} {/section} {section name="estimates" loop=101} {$smarty.section.estimates.index} {/section} Event Occurs Event Does Not Occur As it is now, nothing happens when clicking the radio buttons, but I'm also not getting any Javascript errors. After I get this working, I would also like to find some way to disable one of the handles through changing the slider property. Ie leave the handle where its at but not allow it to be dragged. Any help is greatly appreciated.
