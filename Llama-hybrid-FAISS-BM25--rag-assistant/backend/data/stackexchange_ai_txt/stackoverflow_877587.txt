Java Interface: Inheriting, Overriding, and Overloading Methods

In "THE Javaâ„¢ Programming Language, Fourth Edition" By Ken Arnold, James Gosling, David Holmes, its mentioned that: paragraph: (4.3.2) "Similarly, if an interface inherits more than one method with the same signature, or if a class implements different interfaces containing a method with the same signature, there is only one such method. The implementation of this method is ultimately defined by the class implementing the interfaces, and there is no ambiguity there. If the methods have the same signature but different return types, then one of the return types must be a subtype of all the others, otherwise a compile-time error occurs. The implementation must define a method that returns that common subtype." Can anybody give me some example code that justifies the points of above paragraph ? I tried to write the code and test what is mentioned but I am getting compile-time error the sub-interface hides the base interface method so can only implement sub-interface method. Thanks in advance. -Arun
