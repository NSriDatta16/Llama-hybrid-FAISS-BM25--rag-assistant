How to make "Tag" pages SEO'd in Magento?

In magento, I have SEO url rewriting enabled, and it is working fine - apart from: tags (showing as site/tag/product/list/tagId/1/) reviews (showing as, for example site/review/product/list/id/1/) RSS feeds (showing as site/rss/catalog/category/cid/3/sid/1/) How come this is not SEOâ€™d? and what will be the solution for this issue. I am more concern about my tags. Please help Thanks
