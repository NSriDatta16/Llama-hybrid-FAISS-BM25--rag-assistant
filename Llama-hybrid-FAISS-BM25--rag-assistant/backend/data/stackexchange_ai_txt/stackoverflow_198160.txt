Apparently the preview rendering differs from the posted rendering. This paragraph is here to make sure the next two lines show up as code. // Preserve native alert() if you need it for something special window.nativeAlert = window.alert; window.alert = function(msg) { // Do something with msg here. I always write mine to console.log, // but then I have rarely found a use for a real modal dialog, // and most can be handled by the browser (like window.onbeforeunload). };
