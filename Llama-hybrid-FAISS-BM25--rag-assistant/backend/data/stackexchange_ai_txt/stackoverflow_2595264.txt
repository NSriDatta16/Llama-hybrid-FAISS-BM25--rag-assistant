MSBuild Include Remote File 2008?

TFS 2008, VS 2008. I have a tfsbuild.proj and tfsbuild.msp file in $/MyStuff/TeamBuildTypes/Dev folder. I have a targets file at $/MyStuff/TeamBuildTypes/IncludeFiles/Common/test.xml. test.xml contains an XML fragment that overrides the BeforeGet task. I tried to get the file into my tfsbuild.proj file like this: The build fails because it tries to get the file from a relative path that is way off. I have shifted gears a little and am now trying an Exec task to get the file from TFS into the local filesystem. I have no idea where the file is going. I don't get an error. I have access to the $(SolutionRoot) variable but the TeamBuildTypes folder is above that one in the filesystem. How can I get to this file and use it as an overrride to my task for the current build? Help? Thanks!
