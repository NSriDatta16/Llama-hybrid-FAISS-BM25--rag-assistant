Inspired heavily by Lunatik's answer, adding: command.help.$(file.patterns.vb)=http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&q=site%3Amsdn.microsoft.com+%222003+VBA%22+$(CurrentWord) command.help.subsystem.$(file.patterns.vb)=2 to my vb.properties file gives me a reasonable work around (loads a Google search results page with search criteria of: site:msdn.microsoft.com "2003 VBA" $(CurrentWord) Obviously no guarantees of it taking me to a helpful page, but then the inline help in the VBA editer isn't all that reliable on that one either... Can anyone who knows SciTe better suggest a more elegant solution?
