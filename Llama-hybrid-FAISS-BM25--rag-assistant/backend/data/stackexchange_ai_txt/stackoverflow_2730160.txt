You can do a time-storage trade-off by storing a one-way hash of the post's tag names sorted alphabetically. When a post is tagged, execute select t.name from tags t inner join post_tags pt where pt.post_id = [ID_of_tagged_post] order by t.name . Concatenate all of the tag names, create a hash using the MD5 algorithm and insert the value into a column alongside your post (or into another table joined by a foreign key, if you prefer). When you want to search for a specific combination of tags, simply execute (remembering to sort the tag names) select from posts p where p.taghash = MD5([concatenated_tag_string]) .
