Is it alright to split a GridSearchCV?

Is it ok to split a GridsearchCV? At first, I would try estimators from 100-300 (100 steps) for a random forest regressor and some other parameters and after that, I would start the GridsearchCV with the same parameter and just change the estimators from 400 - 600. Is there any aspect that would disagree with that logic?
