I would highly recommend supplementing the books with screencasts. Ryan Bates in particular has done an enormous amount of Rails screencasts at Railscasts , which are freely available. He has also done some paid screencasts for the Pragmatic Programmers site which are much more in-depth, and very helpful. Creating multi-model forms was a bit of an early sticking point for me, and Ryan's Pragmatic Screencast series on forms was very helpful. I would also recommend the ActiveRecord series .
