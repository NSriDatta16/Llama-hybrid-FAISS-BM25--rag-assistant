You can naturally continue to override when you define the specific classes. You can declare them to be based on your class, rather than the ZF class. For specific projects, you can modify your classpath to be a custom version of ZF or possibly have a custom override folder. With a custom folder then your changes are not machine wide, but neither is your zend framework. on ***nix based systems, you can leverage symbolic links to keep yourself to one copy of ZF. Are you trying to modify your source code to include the license headers and PHPdoc? If so, what I have done in the past is have a simple build step that adds the information you need. Each file type can have the appropriate header information. You can have nice tags to tell the system to ignore files, or only run on controllers. Good Luck, Jacob
