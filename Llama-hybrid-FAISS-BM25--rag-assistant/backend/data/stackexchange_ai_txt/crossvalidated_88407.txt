ADF test, PP test, KPSS test: Which test to prefer?

If a time series is tested for Unit Root (by ADF, PP, KPSS,...) problem is detected with some tests and not found by others. Which one is preferred? For example if ADF says us that there is a Unit root and PP says that is not problem. Which one of them would be preferred?
