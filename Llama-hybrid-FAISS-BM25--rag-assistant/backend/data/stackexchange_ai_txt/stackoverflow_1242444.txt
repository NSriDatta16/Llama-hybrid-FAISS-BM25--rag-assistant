I had a "similar" issue some time ago so I can at least tell you what I found out. It seems .Net is resorting to OLE remoting when drag/drop operations are performed in but the simplest of cases. For some reason GetDataPresent will in these cases be successful and GetData will fail. This is furthermore mystified by the fact that there are several versions of the IDataObject in the .Net framework. Windows Forms defaults to System.Windows.Forms.IDataObject. However, in your case you could try to give System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IDataObject a shot instead. You can also check out my discussion here . Hope this helps.
