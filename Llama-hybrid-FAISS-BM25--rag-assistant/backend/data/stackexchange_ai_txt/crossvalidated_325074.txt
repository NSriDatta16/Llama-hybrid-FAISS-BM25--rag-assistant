This is a case in which a per-patient probability model would be much better than a strict yes/no per-patient classification model such as you have developed. Classification models developed on mis-classification rates have a hidden assumption that all types of mis-classifications are equally bad. Whether or not that was specifically the case in your modeling, the criteria you used to develop your classification model clearly did not meet your goal of being able to separate out any hospital-related risks. A model that predicts the probability of each individual developing HAI would be much more useful. With estimates of the probability of each individual in a hospital having HAI based on the nationwide data, you could assess whether the hospital has more or fewer HAI than would be expected from the nationwide data, taking the number of individuals and the probabilities estimated from their characteristics into account. If patient probabilities within a hospital are independent, the sum of their probabilities (and thus the number of HAI events) is a Poisson binomial distribution , so you can calculate (or take multiple random samples to estimate) the distribution of expected HAI events based on the nationwide data for the patients in each hospital and see if the observed values for the hospital are significantly toward a tail of that nationwide distribution. Logistic regression is a classic way to develop such a probability model. In a logistic model you also could incorporate hospitals as fixed or random effects and get direct estimates of inter-hospital differences. If for some reason a logistic regression is inappropriate, it is possible to develop logistic regression trees that predict probabilities rather than classifications. A web search for "logistic regression tree analysis" should provide many more links to this type of approach. (I have no experience with such models, and don't know if you could directly model inter-hospital differences with this approach.) If this is a US-based study, however, I fear that inter-hospital differences in medical record systems (and thus in identifying true patient characteristics) might overwhelm the inter-hospital iatrogenic issues that I suspect are your primary interest.
