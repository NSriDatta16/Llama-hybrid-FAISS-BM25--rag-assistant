NMF stands for "nonnegative matrix factorization", which means that your input data must be nonnegative. The factorization you get is also nonnegative, so you don't have to worry about the interpretability of your results compared to PCA that generally requires other post processing steps to interpret the results. If your data are negative, NMF is not suited then. The NMF optimization problem is flexible, you can add additional constraints and regularization terms to the objective function to specify the solution you want. There are many NMF extensions and variants among them orthogonal NMF, which aims to produce a unique solution. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of NMF over PCA.
