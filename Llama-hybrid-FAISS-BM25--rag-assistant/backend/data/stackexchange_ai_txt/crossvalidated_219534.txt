Use McNemar's test to evaluate marginal homogeneity. Use the poly/tetra-choric correlation coefficient if its assumptions are sufficiently plausible. Possibly test association between proxies with the log odds ratio. For more agreement tests with continuous variables check this out: http://web1.sph.emory.edu/observeragreement/review_manuscript.pdf To assess raw agreement you can utilize Cohen's kappa for categorical data: from its p-value, establish that agreement exceeds that expected under the null hypothesis of random ratings; interpret the magnitude of kappa as an intraclass correlation. In R you can use the psych package ( cohen.kappa function). Alternatively, calculate the intraclass correlation directly instead of a kappa statistic.
