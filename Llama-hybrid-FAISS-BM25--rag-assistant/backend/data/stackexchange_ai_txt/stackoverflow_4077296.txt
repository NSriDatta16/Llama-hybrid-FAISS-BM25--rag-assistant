Extension methods on Enum - unable to expose methods on the Enum itself

Consider this Enum: enum State { On, Off } ... And this extension method: public static void Foo(this Enum e) { // Here be dragons... } If I want to call Foo() , I have to call it on one of the Enum's properties: State.On.Foo() ... I can't call it on the Enum itself: State.Foo() . Why is this? And what do I need to do, to be able to call Foo() on the Enum itself?
