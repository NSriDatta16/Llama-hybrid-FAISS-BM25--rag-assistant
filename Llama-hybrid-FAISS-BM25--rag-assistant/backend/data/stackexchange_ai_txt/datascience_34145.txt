How to draw a simple LSTM network

I'm new to deep learning, I am learning LSTM for my PhD work. This is a simple LSTM network for sequence classification. This code is from MATLAB tutorial: layers = [sequenceInputLayer(1) lstmLayer(5,'OutputMode','last') fullyConnectedLayer(3) softmaxLayer classificationLayer]; For simplicity, the dimension of the input sequence is 1 , there are 3 classes. I am trying to draw the diagram of this network. This is my attempt: Is this right? Should the LSTM blue units be connected? The orange units are the softmax layer, is there any symbol the should be on each unit (like âˆ‘)? The same question for each layer? Should be any extra layer to represent the " classificationLayer "? The fullyConnectedLayer is represented implicitly in the full connection in the last layer, Do I need to add any extra layer for this? Any other comments, please?
