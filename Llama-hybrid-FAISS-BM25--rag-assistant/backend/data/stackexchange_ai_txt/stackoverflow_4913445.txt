You're much better off creating public properties for the values you're trying to retrieve. FindControl is fragile at the best of times, but even more so in retrieving previous page values. Try this: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178139.aspx Scroll down to ' Getting Public Property Values from the Source Page ' Edit You could also create a base class for the master page, and then cast the PreviousPage's master page to that class. Then you'd have access to the properties of the master page, strongly typed. There are some good examples on complex master pages here: http://odetocode.com/code/450.aspx
