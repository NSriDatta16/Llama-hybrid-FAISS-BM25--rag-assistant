Is there a macro to conditionally copy rows to another worksheet?

Is there a macro or a way to conditionally copy rows from one worksheet to another in Excel 2003? I'm pulling a list of data from SharePoint via a web query into a blank worksheet in Excel, and then I want to copy the rows for a particular month to a particular worksheet (for example, all July data from a SharePoint worksheet to the Jul worksheet, all June data from a SharePoint worksheet to Jun worksheet, etc.). Sample data Date - Project - ID - Engineer 8/2/08 - XYZ - T0908-5555 - JS 9/4/08 - ABC - T0908-6666 - DF 9/5/08 - ZZZ - T0908-7777 - TS It's not a one-off exercise. I'm trying to put together a dashboard that my boss can pull the latest data from SharePoint and see the monthly results, so it needs to be able to do it all the time and organize it cleanly.
