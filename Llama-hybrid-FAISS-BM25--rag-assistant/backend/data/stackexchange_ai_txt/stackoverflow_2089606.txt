There's no practical way to identify every image in an arbitrary folder. Almost anything you can't identify as something else, could be some sort of image. Then again, using steganography, even something you can identify as something else still might be (or contain) at least part of an image as well. Realistically, you want to pick out a set of formats you want to support, and write code that knows about them. For quite a few purposes, a half dozen formats or so is quite adequate, though the exact half dozen you pick will vary by the type of application -- only a few programs have any use for both bitmapped and vector graphics, for one example. Once you've decided what you want, DlgDirList is probably the easiest way to list some files. If that isn't flexible enough for your purposes, the next obvious choice is FindFirstFile , FindNextFile , and FindClose .
