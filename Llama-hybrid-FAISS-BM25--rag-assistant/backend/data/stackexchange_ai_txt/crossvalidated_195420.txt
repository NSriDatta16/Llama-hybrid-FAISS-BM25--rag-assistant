Creating a transition matrix for markov chain

I have a dataset with monthly frequency of observations that fall in each category, Cat . I would like to construct a transition matrix from this, i.e., from Cat1 1 to Cat2 , Cat1 to Cat3 , to all the combinations of Cat . The goal would be to use the markovchain package in R for predicting the future months frequency based on the original data. My questions are: Is it possible to construct a transition matrix based on this data? Is it the correct approach? I looked at the examples in library(markovchain) / library(etm) , but I am confused. For example, library(etm) head(sir.cont) id from to time age sex 1 41 0 2 4 75.34153 F 2 395 0 2 24 19.17380 M 3 710 1 0 33 61.56568 M 4 710 0 2 37 61.56568 M 5 3138 0 2 8 57.88038 F 6 3154 0 2 3 39.00639 M have the 'from', 'to' columns. and my dataset is df1
