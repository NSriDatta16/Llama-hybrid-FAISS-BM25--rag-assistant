Radial Basic function decision boundary

I am using radial basic function(rbf) in neural network using "newrb" method in Matlab and all things are good, but i hope to find a way which makes me able to draw the decisions boundary between the two samples that i have. For example in perceptron the decision boundary is a line with equation WX+b=0 W:weights, X:Inputs and b is the bias.How can i draw the complex decision boundary result from rbf? Thanks.
