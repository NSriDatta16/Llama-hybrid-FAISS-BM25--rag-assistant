Copy one column over another in a delimited file

For instance, I needed to remove column 25 and replace it with a copy of column 22 in a simple csv file with no embedded delimiters. The best I could come up with was the awkward looking: awk -F, '{ for(x=1;x I would expect something like cut -d, -f1-24,23,26-59 to work but cut doesn't seem to want to print the same column two times... Is there a more elegant way to do it using anything typicaly available in a linux shell environment?
