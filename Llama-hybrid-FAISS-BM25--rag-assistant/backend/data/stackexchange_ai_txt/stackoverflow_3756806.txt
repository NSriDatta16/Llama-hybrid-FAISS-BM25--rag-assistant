Character case in HTML tags

What's the rule for character casing in html tags? I have a situation where I need to force no caching on a site of mine. I have been using all lower case for all html tags and attributes (being under the impression that it's case insensitive). I haven't had any issued from this, until now. I have found that the following works on IE7: While this does not: FYI I am using PHP and also included the following, but it does not seem to work without the HTML meta tag as well: header( "Expires: Mon, 20 Dec 1998 01:00:00 GMT" ); header( "Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT" ); header( "Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate" ); header( "Pragma: no-cache" ); header("Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8"); EDIT (Added): We have the following doc type (I must admit I am not leet enough to know what this means or how relevant it is)
