Nothing so strictly defined. Mac OS X considers the parts of your question to be separate concepts: The icon on the right side of the menu bar (i.e., in the status bar ) is a status item. Any application can create any number of them, using the NSStatusItem class . An application with no Dock tile is usually an agent. An application with no UI at all is a daemon. A status item counts as UI, so an application with only a status item is an agent. The typical way to make an agent (with or without a status item) is to set LSUIElement to the string "1" in its Info.plist . Having never programmed DOS or Windows, I have no idea what “resident” means to you. On Mac OS X, it simply means “in RAM”, which any running application at least partially is.
