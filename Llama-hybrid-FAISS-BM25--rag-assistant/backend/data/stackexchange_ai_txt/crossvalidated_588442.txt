Why does central limit theorem give such big x in $\phi(x)$

I am solving a problem : The number of new customers in the mall each day follows Poisson distirbution with $\lambda = 50$ . Find approximately the probability that after one year (200 working days) the number of customers that visited was between 950 and 1100. My idea : Day i we have $X_i \sim P_o(\lambda) $ new customers . Now we need $P(950 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{200} X_i\leq 1100 )$ . $X_i$ 's are independent and equally distirbuted. We have $200 > 30$ samples and therefore Central Limit Theorem should hold: $$ Z=\frac{S_{200}-200\lambda}{\sqrt{200\lambda} } \sim N(0,1)$$ Then : $P(950 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{200} X_i\leq 1100 ) = P(\frac{950-200*50}{\sqrt{200*50} } \leq Z \leq \frac{1100-200*50}{\sqrt{200*50} })$ And I could actually apply continuity correction and have instead: $$ P(\frac{949.5-200*50}{\sqrt{200*50} } \leq Z \leq \frac{1100.5-200*50}{\sqrt{200*50} }=P(-90.5 \leq Z \leq -88.9)=\Phi(-88.9) - \Phi(-90.5) = 1-\Phi(88.9) - 1 + \Phi(90.5)= \Phi(90.5)-\Phi(88.9)$$ Why are they so huge ? At least in theory , CLT should hold , the conditions were satisfied. Side note : We have at average 50 people per day and also 50 deviation . So let's suppose we have 50 and 0 people/per day alternatively --> after 200 days we should have 100* 50 = 5000 so less than 1100 seems small (if this kind of thought makes sense)
