ASP.NET MVC CookieTempDataProvider: any experience?

UPDATE: looks like I've misunderstood what TempData is for and what it isn't. It definitively shouldn't be used to "keep certain session-wide data" as I asked initially (see ASP.NET MVC TempData Is Really RedirectData why). I've modified the question accordingly. Has anyone used CookieTempDataProvider for TempData storage? Are there any caveats to watch out for (apart from keeping the session storage small)? Any issues with using it on Web farms?
