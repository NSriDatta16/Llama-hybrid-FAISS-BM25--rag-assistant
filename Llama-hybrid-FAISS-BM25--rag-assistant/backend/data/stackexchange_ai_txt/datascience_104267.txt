Although it is the least attractive, the best solution is to eliminate them. Including outliers, even if modified, goes a long way in modifying your dataset. For example, if your goal is to build a Machine Learning model, using modified data falsifies the training of your model and therefore gives you an unreliable result. The whole thing is summarized by the principle "garbage in, garbage out", or if you use garbage data as input you will get garbage results. Therefore the cleanliness of the data is very important, better less data than more but not very reliable data.
