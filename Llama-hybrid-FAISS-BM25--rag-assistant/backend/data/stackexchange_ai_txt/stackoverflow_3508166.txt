Can I buy a Context Menu control for Silverlight?

I've been looking for a ContextMenu control for Silverlight. There is one from Microsoft, but it's severely crippled (you can't add/remove things at runtime, does not support submenus, etc...) I've looked at the commercial components from Telerik, ComponentOne, Infragistics, etc... and they provide the features I am looking for, but they only sell the ContextMenu component as a part of their larger suite (in excess of $1000). Can anyone recommend a reasonably priced ContextMenu control?
