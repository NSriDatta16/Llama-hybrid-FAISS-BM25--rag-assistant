How to get ranks with no gaps when there are ties among values?

When there are ties in the original data, is there a way to create a ranking without gaps in the ranks (consecutive, integer rank values)? Suppose: x In this case the desired result would be: my_rank(x) [1] 2 2 2 1 1 3 3 I've played with all the options for ties.method option ( average , max , min , random ), none of which are designed to provide the desired result. Is it possible to acheive this with the rank() function?
