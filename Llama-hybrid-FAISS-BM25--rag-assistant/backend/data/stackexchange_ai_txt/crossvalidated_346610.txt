Approximate Bayesian Computation for parameters estimation in ODE-based model

I am simulating a system of ODEs by using parameters taking from the literature. The next step would be to use ABC in order to estimate them (I have experimental data about all the curves of the model). I tried to implement a very rudimental ABC rejection scheme but probably the model is too complex for this (10 equations and 39 parameters). Therefore I am trying to find a library (Python or R) that can do the job. Unfortunately, there are no examples for such a procedure and I am having some difficulties adapting existing code to my problem (AstroABC, ELFI, etc...). Does anyone have any suggestion?
