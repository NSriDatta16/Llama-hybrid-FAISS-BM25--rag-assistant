What is the Fluent NHibernate Convention for value object list

I'm trying to figure out what the convention would be for a value object list, in this case an IList. Here a code fragment for my domain model: public class RegionSetting : Entity { public virtual bool Required { get; set; } public virtual string Name { get; set; } public virtual IList Options { get; set; } } My automapping is set to: public class RegionSettingMap : IAutoMappingOverride { public void Override(AutoMapping mapping) { mapping .HasMany(x => x.Options).Element("Options") .Table("RegionSettingOptions") .KeyColumn("RegionSettingId"); } } I'd like to make the .Table() and .KeyColumn() overrides into a convention so that I don't have to do that everywhere I'm using IList . I thought that I could create an IHasManyConvention , but it doesn't seem to affect this mapping. I set a breakpoint in my custom HasManyConvention class, but it doesn't break for the Options property. Could anyone tell me what convention I should be using to automate this override?
