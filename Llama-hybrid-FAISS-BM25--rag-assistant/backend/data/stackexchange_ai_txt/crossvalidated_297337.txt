What are some of the disavantage of bayesian hyper parameter optimization?

I am fairly new to machine learning and statistics but I was wondering why bayesian optimization is not referred more often online when learning machine learning to optimize your algorithm hyperparameters? For example using a framework like this one: https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization Does bayesian optimization of your hyperparameters have any limitation or major disadvantage over techniques like grid search or random search?
