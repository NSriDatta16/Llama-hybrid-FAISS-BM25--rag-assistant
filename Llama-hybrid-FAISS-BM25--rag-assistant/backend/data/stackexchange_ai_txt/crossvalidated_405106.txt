On p114 of the same book you cite: "The problem of estimating a set of means with unknown variances will require some additional computational methods, presented in sections 11.6 and 13.6". So it is for simplicity; the equations in your chapter work out in a closed-form way, whereas if you model the variances, they do not, and you need MCMC techniques from the later chapters. In the school example, they rely on large sample size to assume that the variances are known "for all practical purposes" (p119), and I expect they estimate them using $\frac{1}{n-1} \sum (x_i - \overline{x})^2$ and then pretend those are the exact known values.
