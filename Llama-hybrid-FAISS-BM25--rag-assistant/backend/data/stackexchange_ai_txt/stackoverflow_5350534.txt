It sounds like FatFreeCart is keeping it's promises, but your application needs more features that go beyond it's scope. I like this "spartan" e-shop very much. It is great for promotion of simple items in any site. What you could do, would be to set up a "real" e-commerce application, since you are PHP oriented, like osCommerce , Magento or VirtuaMart . Virtuemart is an addon for Joomla. All three offer you a full range of features and a full back-office administrator application that will allow you to make offers, define discount periods and pricing according to criteria like number of items ordered etc. Now, you can keep your nice website and link your products straight to the appropriate items of the eshop instead of adding FatFreeCart links. This way the user will proceed to complete the purchase. The other option would be join the E-Junkie.com team and extend FatFreeCart to do what you think is missing. You should be aware to keep it fat free after the add ons. I just almost bought a Flipstick...
