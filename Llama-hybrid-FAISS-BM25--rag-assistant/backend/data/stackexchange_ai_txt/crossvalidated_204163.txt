sklearn's random forest doesn't currently support density estimation, and I don't think there's any easy way to hack it without significant changes to the random forest code. The code to start looking at is here , but your best bet is probably to ask for advice on the mailing list about the best way to go about implementing it. Here isn't really the right place, because none of the regulars are scikit-learn developers (as far as I know), the question-answer format isn't super appropriate, and it's not really on-topic since it's about implementation only.
