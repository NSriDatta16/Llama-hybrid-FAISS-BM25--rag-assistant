Constrasts in R after logistic regression with interaction

I would like to calculate contrasts of predictive probabilities. In a nutshell, I would like to compute the difference in differences of probabilities. The code below illustrates exactly my problem. Among men, I calculate the predictive probability of the event by smoking: p1 = prob. of event|sex==1 and smoking == 1; p2 = prob. of event|sex==1 and smoking == 0 Among women, I calculate the predictive probability of the event by smoking. p3 = prob. of event|sex==0 and smoking == 1; p4 = prob. of event|sex==0 and smoking == 0 Now, what I want to calculate is the (p4-p3)-(p2-p1) along with 95% CI. In the example below, the difference in differences would be around -0.06 [e.g., (0.44-0.5)-(0.52-0.52)]. How do we estimate the SE/95% CI for that difference in R? library(ggeffects) N = 100 set.seed(123456) hypertension Thank you so much for any tips/suggestions. All the best, Jacob
