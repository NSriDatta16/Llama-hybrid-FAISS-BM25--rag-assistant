jQuery Modal Example with .Net 2.0 Infragistics Grid

I'm new to jQuery (I must have had my head buried in sand for the last few years!) and I'm wondering if I could use it with an Infragistics grid for updating and inserting instead of the edit row template. We're currently constrained to using the 2.0 framework, and I'm stuck with the infra grids as well. Does anyone know if this is possible? Do you think this is a bad/good idea? Any good sample/walk-throughs out there? Any, and all, advice/opinions appreciated!
