I second Blindy's suggestion to use the MAC address of the (first?) network adapter. Yes, the MAC address can be spoofed, but this has side effects (you don't want two PCs with the same MAC address in the same network), and it's something that "your average pirate" won't do just to be able to use your software. Considering that there's no 100% solution against software piracy, the MAC address is a good compromise, IMO. Note, however, that the address will change when the user adds, replaces or removes a network card (or replaces his old PC altogether), so be prepared to help your customers and give them a new key when they change their hardware configuration.
