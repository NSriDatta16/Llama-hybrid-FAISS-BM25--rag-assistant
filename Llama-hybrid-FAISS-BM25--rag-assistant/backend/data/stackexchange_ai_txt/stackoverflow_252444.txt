ctypes will be the easiest thing to use but (mis)using it makes Python subject to crashing. If you are trying to do something quickly, and you are careful, it's great. I would encourage you to check out Boost Python . Yes, it requires that you write some C++ code and have a C++ compiler, but you don't actually need to learn C++ to use it, and you can get a free (as in beer) C++ compiler from Microsoft .
