The default PHP user agent is blocked; see Wikimedia's User-Agent policy for details. You can easily enough change your user agent using ini_set at the top of your script, like this: ini_set("user_agent", "Testing for http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509640"); Do note that the English Wikipedia forbids downloading many pages via the API (offering database dumps instead), and that automated processes that actually edit the wiki are forbidden unless approved . See their bot policy for details.
