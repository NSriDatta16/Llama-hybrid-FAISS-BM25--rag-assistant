There is no simple interpretation in binary logistic models other than the intercept and slopes satisfy the property that the the average predicted probability equals the observed prevalence of $Y=1$ in the dataset used to fit the model. But I don't find it very useful to think about this in either linear models or logistic models, because the idea of reference values is arbitrary. For example one person may think of the median or mode as the reference and another the mean. When categorical variables are included things are more complex. I like to think of the intercept as an arbitrary constant that makes the model work no matter what the numeric origin is for the predictors. In R when you request predictions everything is handled automatically.
