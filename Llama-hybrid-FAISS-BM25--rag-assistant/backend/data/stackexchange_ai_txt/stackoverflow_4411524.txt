I'm pretty sure you're looking for this the NodeList.toFrag() method . The toFrag source code is here and the underlying _nl2frag (NodeList to Frag) code is here . I haven't used it myself and didn't find examples, but it looks pretty straight forward. I assume you would just appendChild it into another node.
