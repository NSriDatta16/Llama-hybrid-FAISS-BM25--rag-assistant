How do I set the "Version control path to custom assemblies" for custom MSBuild tasks

With TFS 2010 build controllers/agents there is the option to set a version control path to custom assemblies that will be available on all build agents. The documentation states that this works for custom workflow activities as well as custom MSBuild tasks (about in the middle of the page): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330987.aspx Does someone know how this feature can be used for custom MSBuild tasks? I checked into version control an assembly with a custom task and set the option on our build controller to the correct version control path. But I don't know where the assembly will be on the build agent and how I can reference it from within my MSBuild targets file (i.e., UsingTask). I even searched for the assembly on the build agent but could not find it... Any help is very much appreciated!
