In such a case I use the following strategy: Write a test for each method (just covering its default behavior without any error handling etc.) Run a code coverage tool and find the blocks not covered by the tests. Write tests covering these blocks. Do this until you get a code coverage of over 80% Start refactoring the class (mostly generate smaller classes following the separation of concern principle). Use Test Driven Development for writing the new classes.
