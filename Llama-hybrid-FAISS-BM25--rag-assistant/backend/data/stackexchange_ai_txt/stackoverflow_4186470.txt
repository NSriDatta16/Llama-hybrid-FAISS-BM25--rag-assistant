Different images for different resolutions in HTML resources in Android

How do you display different images for different screen resolutions (hdpi, ldpi, mdpi) in an embedded HTML resource of an Android app? The HTML resource is located in assets , but can be changed if necessary. If this is not possible, how do you change the display size of the image based on the screen resolution?
