State Diagrams work wonders for that task. They allow you represent a computational process at a level suitable for the people you are communicating with. The states hold a brief comment on what processing goes on there. The arc between states show the conditions that cause a transition to a new state. Having constructed the basic state diagram, you can move on to discuss the information that is being fed into the state machine. This is where the persons domain knowlege ought to come into play. Follow some data though the diagram to see the flow of how it gets processed. Generally at this point, they start to notice other situations that haven't been discussed. It may be necessary to drag in another white board, expand one or more of the states into its own state diagram. Then generally, when they are comfortable with the flow, it's time to inject error handling into the diagram. This technique has worked pretty well for me.
