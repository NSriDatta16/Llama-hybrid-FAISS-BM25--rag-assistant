How can i adjust this T-SQL query so that it returns one table rather than two? :)

SELECT patron_name, producer.fed_number, tax_number, average_tb_test FROM producer INNER JOIN producer_details ON producer.federal_number = producer_details.federal_number INNER JOIN statement ON producer.patron_number = statement.patron_number WHERE producer.patron_number = @PatronNo (SELECT MAX(statement.statement_number), MAX(period_ending) FROM statement)
