Welcome to the site, Marcel. I believe your question is about whether the temperature variable, which does not vary within plots, can be examined in a mixed effects model. The answer is yes! This is one of the powerful aspects of mixed effects models - the ability to look at predictors that are measured at the occasion or individual unit level (e.g., SLA ) as well as predictors measured at the group level (e.g., temperature ). The mixed effects model separates the variance in the outcome, herbivory , into within-plot and between-plot components. Predictors that vary at the plot level can only explain between-plot variance. Predictors that vary within-plots can explain both within- and between-plot variance because such predictors' average level might vary across plots. For example, if you were to take the SLA average for each plot, you will likely find plot-to-plot variation in the means. So SLA can explain both within- and between-plot variance in herbivory .
