You can't directly get an iterator for an array. But you can use a List, backed by your array, and get an ierator on this list. For that, your array must be an Integer array (instead of an int array): Integer[] arr={1,2,3}; List arrAsList = Arrays.asList(arr); Iterator iter = arrAsList.iterator(); Note: it is only theory. You can get an iterator like this, but I discourage you to do so. Performances are not good compared to a direct iteration on the array with the "extended for syntax". Note 2: a list construct with this method doesn't support all methods (since the list is backed by the array which have a fixed size). For example, "remove" method of your iterator will result in an exception.
