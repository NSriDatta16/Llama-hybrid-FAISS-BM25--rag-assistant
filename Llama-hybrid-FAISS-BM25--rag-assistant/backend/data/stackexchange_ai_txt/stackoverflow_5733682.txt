My knowledge about this is limited, as i never developed games.. as i supposed you are doing. Is this the right thing to do? I do not understand how (and why) I could use the fact that some devices are hdpi and others are mdpi. With this information you can load different images automatically. You can you the directories: drawable-hdpi drawables-mdpi ... Should I provide different bitmaps for different screen densities, and why? (right now I have everything in res/drawable-hdpi) If you have all in hdpi then the images will be shrinked i think, to be smaller due to the lack of specific images o that scale. Providing the images will give you more control over the final product and it will spend less processing. What size should my .png have? Can I create them much bigger (2 Ã—) than their expected size, in order to be sure that this will not look blur or aliased? I think they can be exactly the size needed. But as i said above.. not much experience.
