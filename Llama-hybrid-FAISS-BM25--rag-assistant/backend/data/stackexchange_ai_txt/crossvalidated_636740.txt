Adjusted R2 for LSTM

Background : I am working on a problem, where I am making predictions for a time-series data. I am considering two approaches: Use LSTM, predict n samples using recursive strategy (suggested e.g. in here: How to make LSTM predict multiple time steps ahead? ) Do not treat data as a time series, build linear regression model using independent variables. I want to evaluate results using adjusted R2 (due to using different number of inputs in both types of models). Question : in case of LSTM, what is the number of independent variables (in adjusted R2 formula), assuming that look_back is 24 and I am using only single time series as input? I bet I shall use 24, but wanted to be sure.
