Here's how to do implement it as middleware in Django, assuming that's what you're using on appengine. class DetectiPhone(object): def process_request(self, request): if 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' in request.META and request.META['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].find('(iPhone') >= 0: request.META['iPhone'] = True Basically look for 'iPhone' in the HTTP_USER_AGENT. Note that iPod Touch has a slightly different signature than the iPhone, hence the broad 'iPhone' search instead of a more restrictive search.
