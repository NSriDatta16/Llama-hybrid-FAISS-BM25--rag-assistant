Opening Web Site

I'm kind of new at Perl. A friend of mine asks me to write him a program that could search specific ad on his favourite boat for sale Web Site. It's a very convenient little program that will allow a user to search multiple Web Sites for specific ads. Here is how it works. I load up the Web Page into a temporary file and search for matching ad and return the result. It works fine most of the time but I noticed that some site won't load up and I donâ€™t know why. Here is the script that loads the pages and stores it a temp file: use LWP::UserAgent; use HTTP::Response; use URI::Heuristic; unless (defined ($content = get ($URL) )) { print "could not get $URL "; } open (DATABASE, ">$web_page_file"); print DATABASE "$content"; close (DATABASE); # I've been successfully run it on many sites and it works fine. But recently, 2 sites won't load up. It's : http://www.babord.ca http://www.sailboatlistings.com I have 2 Questions: A) Can you tell me what is wrong with my script with these two sites? B) More important, is there a diagnostic tool that can tell me what the problems are (for future problem site)?
