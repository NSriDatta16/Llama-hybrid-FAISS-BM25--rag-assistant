Have you considered General SQL Parser ? I don't have any experience with it myself but browsing their website it has potential. Personally I have rolled my own built on the parser in Eclipse Data Tools Platform (sorry I can't share, it's proprietary), but now I will have to evaluate the one I linked above because it claims to have more coverage of Oracle SQL than my parser does.
