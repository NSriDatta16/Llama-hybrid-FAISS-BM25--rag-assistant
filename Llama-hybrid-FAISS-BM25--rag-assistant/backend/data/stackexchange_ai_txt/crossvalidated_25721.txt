As @cardinal points out, variations on the 'block bootstrap' are a natural approach. Here, depending on the method, you select stretches of the time series, either overlapping or not and of fixed length or random, which can guarantee stationarity in the samples ( Politis and Romano, 1991 ) then stitch them back together to create resampled times series on which you compute your statistic. You can also try to build models of the temporal dependencies, leading to the Markov methods, autoregressive sieves and others. But block bootstrapping is probably the easiest of these methods to implement. Gon√ßalves and Politis (2011) is a very short review with references. A book length treatment is Lahiri (2010) .
