Dungeons & Dragons Attack hit probability success percentage

In D&D players roll a 20 sided die trying to beat a set number to determine if an attack hits the target. Players often can add modifiers to this roll to help the odds in reaching this target number. If the target number (enemy armor level) is passed by the attack roll, damage is done to the target which requires a different roll depending on the power of the attack. If the armor level is matched for that attack roll, damage is calculated like normal (rolling dice, adding modifiers) and then halved, rounding down to the nearest integer. One of my spells allows me to do three attacks at once on one creature, and on a hit deals 2 6-sided dice +2 damage. It so happened I used this spell on my "Ally" and I'm trying to figure out what my chances of actually killing him were. I roll a 1d20 (1 20-sided die) and add +4 to the roll and if that result is greater than or equal to 16 (my 'Allies' Armor level), I roll damage which is 2d6+2 (halfing then rounding down the damage if the attack equaled Armor level). That damage result is then subtracted from my 'Allies' starting Health which is 20. I repeat this 2 more times, adding damage on each hit. If his health reduces to 0 then he is dead. If his health is 1 or more by the end of this attack he lives and gets to attack me. I want to know, statistically what percentage of time will my Ally be reduced to 0 health after doing this spell?
