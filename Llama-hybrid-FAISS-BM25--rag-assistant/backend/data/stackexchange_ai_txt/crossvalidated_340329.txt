Population stratification: adjustment via principal components analysis

I'm new to statistical genetics and trying to learn more about using principal components to adjust for population stratification in case-control studies. My understanding is that the PCA approach tries to explain variation in genotypes, some of which could be due to population stratification in a sample with population structure. The question is this: isn't some of that variation in genotypes also related to true associations between SNPs and case-control status? In particular, in a sample with no population structure, wouldn't the principal components reflect the very signal you are trying to capture? EDIT: I might have figured this out - it seems that generally "random" SNPs (those not associated with the outcome) are used to infer population structure. If this is true, it would avoid the problem I described above. If I am wrong on this, please do let me know.
