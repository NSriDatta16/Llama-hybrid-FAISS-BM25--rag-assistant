How to achieve single-processing mode running php scripts?

I have cron job - php script which is called one time in 5 minutes. I need to be sure that previously called php script has finished execution - do not want to mix data that's being processed. There are three approaches I used to apply: Creation of auxiliary text file which contains running-state flag. Executed script analyzes the contents of the file and breaks if flag is set to true. It's the simplest solution, but every time I create such script, I feel that I invented a bike one more time. Is there any well-known patterns or best-practices which would satisfy most of the needs? Adding UNIX service. This approach is the best for the cron jobs. But it's more time consuming to develop and test UNIX service: good bash scripting knowledge is required. Tracking processes using database. Good solution, but sometimes database usage is not encouraged and again - do not want to invent a bike, hope there is a good flexible solution already. Maybe you have other suggestions how to manage single-processing of php scripts? Would be glad to hear your thoughts about this.
