just use File.Exists instead, it accepts a full path. EDIT: Sorry, calling your directory variable f confused me.... I trust you can translate the following C# code:- return Directory.Exists( Path.GetDirectoryName( fullPath ) ); The .NET BCL ARM has decent coverage of this stuff, though I'm sure there's a better reference out there. The System.IO.Path and Environment docs would probably be just fine.
