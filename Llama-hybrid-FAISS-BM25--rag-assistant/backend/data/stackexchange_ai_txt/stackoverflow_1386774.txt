You mean your 'tables' aren't really SQL tables? And that you wish to implement a SQL interface to what is not actually a DMBS but your own clone of one? I think you better use an existing DBMS like Derby and let the users query it directly. You can offer some query filtering if data damage is what you are concerned about. All in all, this doesn't look like a wise decision to make. That said, you can implement your own MySQL storage engine through the "Storage Engine API", which lets you define the file format (and more): http://solutions.mysql.com/engines.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/6.0/en/storage-engines.html http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_Custom_Engine
