You can pass the SOCK_RAW flag when you create the socket using WSASocket() (or socket() , as your tastes run). This is described in further detail under TCP/IP Raw Sockets on MSDN. From that page -- Once an application creates a socket of type SOCK_RAW, this socket may be used to send and receive data. All packets sent or received on a socket of type SOCK_RAW are treated as datagrams on an unconnected socket. Of note, Microsoft crippled their raw sockets implementation after Windows XP SP2; the details are described on the MSDN page in the section Limitations on Raw Sockets: TCP data cannot be sent over raw sockets. UDP datagrams with an invalid source address cannot be sent over raw sockets. A call to the bind function with a raw socket is not allowed. If these limitations are too restrictive, you can fall back to the previously recommended winpcap library.
