How to get only desirable comparisons from post-hoc

I have some experimental data that I'm trying to analyze. I have 1 response variable and 3 explanatory variables (these are factor variables). The explanatory variables are the presence of a disease(positive and negative), a genetic profile (X and Y), and whether or not an MRI contrast agent was given (YES and NO). Structure of data looks like this: measurement profile disease contrast 1 -1.76269 X NEG YES 2 -0.34492 X NEG NO 3 0.57455 X POS YES 4 2.16539 X POS NO . . . . . . . . . . . . 77 -1.76269 Y NEG YES 78 -0.34492 Y NEG NO 79 0.57455 Y POS YES 80 2.16539 Y POS NO I looked into using ANOVA for this analysis but the post hoc Tukey HSD looks at all possible combinations of the explanatory variables so it makes far more comparisons than I actually care about. We have some specific hypotheses that, e.g.: X.NEG.NO will differ from Y.NEG.NO, X.NEG.NO will differ form X.NEG.YES, X.NEG.NO will differ from X.POS.NO, etc. (notice that each compared group "consist" from interaction of all three variables) How to get only some specific comparisons from TukeyHSD? Is appropriate to make Is there a better approach? Reproducible example: my.data
