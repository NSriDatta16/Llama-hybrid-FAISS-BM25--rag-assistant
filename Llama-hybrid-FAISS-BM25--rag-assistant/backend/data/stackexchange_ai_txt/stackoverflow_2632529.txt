What's the best way to authorize a USB Key

We have an auto update for our software that is installed via USB key (with the auto run). If I wanted to ensure that only authorized USB Keys were used, what's the best way? Our installer is already signed, and it won't run otherwise. But I'm more wanting to inspect the USB Key for a signed installer, and if it's not there, just ignore, or even "Eject" the USB device. And I should be able to tell the difference (in code) between a usb storage device, and say a camera, or keyboard. I'm only wanting to disable non-authorized storage devices. Thank you for your ideas.
