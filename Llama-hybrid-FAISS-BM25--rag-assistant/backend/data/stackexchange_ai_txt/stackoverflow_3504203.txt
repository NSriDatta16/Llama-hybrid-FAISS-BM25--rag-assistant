Get additional user details with PHP and mail() function

I have a simple PHP script that sends a message to a specified email address with content from a HTML form using the mail() function (which I am aware is prone to spam). I was wondering if it's possible to obtain additional information about the user's settings and input them in the sent mail. Additional information could contain: Browser type and version Whether Javascript is enabled or disabled Operating system Resolution If any of those are possible, that would be awesome. Thanks, Amit EDIT: Thanks to @Stephen, I was able to use the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] to get more info regarding the browser. However, when using the get_browser, it did not work. This is my code: $browser = get_browser(null, true); $message = 'From: ' . "\n\n" . 'Name: ' . $_REQUEST['name'] . "\n\n" . 'E-mail: ' . $_REQUEST['email'] . "\n\n" . 'Comments: ' . $_REQUEST['comments'] . "\n\n" . 'Details: ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "\n\n" . 'Further: ' . echo ($browser); Anyone knows the reason why? Thanks!
