How to write the equation of a time series model?

I needed to use SAS to find an adequate model for some data using time series analysis. To get the adequate model I needed to include first order and season differencing, then I used an ARIMA model along with autoregressive and moving average to find the adequate model. Here is my adequate model: $\text{ARIMA } p=(1, 2, 3, 7) d=(1, 12) q=(8, 10, 12)$ I think I know what the equations are for each part, I need help with putting it together and creating one equation for the model. Simple and Season diffeencing: $z_t=y_t^*-y_{t-1}^*-y_{t-L}^*+y_{t-L-1}^*$ I am not sure if $L$ means number of years or the frequency of my data, my data was monthly between 1959 and 1992. Autoregressive: $z_t=\delta+\phi_1z_{t-1}+\phi_2z_{t-2}+\phi_3z_{t-3}+\phi_7z_{t-7}+a_t$ Moving Average: $z_t=\delta+a_t-\sigma_8a_{t-8}-\sigma_{10}a_{t-10}-\sigma_{12}a_{t-12}$
