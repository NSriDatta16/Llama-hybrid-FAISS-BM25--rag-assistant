Integrated security gives greater flexibility in user access IMO. For example if my organization wants to limit the hours during which the developer group can access the server, integrated security is my best bet. But it's not right for everything. [EDIT] Also it's great for logging access. If I had to create a SQL login for each new developer in a large organization...it would probably stop happening and logins would get shared, then I'd never have confidence in the ability to point the finger at the knucklehead who dropped a table.
