How to compare SEM estimation methods in R?

I would like to use several estimators in SEM (e.g. ML vs Yuan-Bentler vs DWLS) and then by using Monte-Carlo approach compare: (a) average relative bias of the estimators, (b) average relative bias of standard error estimates, (c) relative bias of chi-square statistics, and (d) the model rejection rate associated with the chi-square statistic at an alpha level of .05 What would be the best way to do this in R? Would appreciate provided example as well.
