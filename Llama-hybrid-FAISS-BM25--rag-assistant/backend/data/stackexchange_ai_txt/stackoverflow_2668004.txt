Add kilometers to a map point

Good morning. I would like to know how do I add kilometers to a map point (latitude / longitude). For example: The city JaraguÃ¡ do Sul is in latitude -26.462049, longitude -49.059448. I want to add 100 kilometers up, down, and on the sides. I want to do a square and get the new points. How do I do that? I tried it: '; echo 'LNG: ' . $lon2; ?> But it's returning wrong cordinates. Thank you! Thank you very much.
