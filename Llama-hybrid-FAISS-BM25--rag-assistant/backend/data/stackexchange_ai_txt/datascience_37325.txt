Why would a validation set wear out slower than a test set?

On this page of Google's Machine Learning Crash Course, we find the following statement: "Test sets and validation sets "wear out" with repeated use. That is, the more you use the same data to make decisions about hyperparameter settings or other model improvements, the less confidence you'll have that these results actually generalize to new, unseen data. Note that validation sets typically wear out more slowly than test sets. " I don't get the last sentence. Why would a validation set wear out slower than a test set? To me it would wear out faster as the validation set is used a lot more frequently than the test set. What am I missing?
