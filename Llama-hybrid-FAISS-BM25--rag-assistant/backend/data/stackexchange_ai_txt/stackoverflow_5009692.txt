The first thing i do when i get that is a Clean All usually solves that. If you don't see the Clean All button right click your Xcode toolbar, customize, and drag the Clean All button to your toolbar from there. -Check that the provisioning profile installed on your device haven't expired (would see a red dot in the organizer - Window->Organizer). -Try restarting XCode.
