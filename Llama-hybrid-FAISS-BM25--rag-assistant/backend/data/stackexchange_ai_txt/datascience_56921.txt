A critical part of the success of a Machine Learning project is coming up with a good set of features to train on. This process, called feature engineering, involves: • Feature selection: selecting the most useful features to train on among existing features. • Feature extraction: combining existing features to produce a more useful one (as we saw earlier, dimensionality reduction algorithms can help). • Creating new features by gathering new data Quoting : "A Hands on Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow - Aurelien Geron"
