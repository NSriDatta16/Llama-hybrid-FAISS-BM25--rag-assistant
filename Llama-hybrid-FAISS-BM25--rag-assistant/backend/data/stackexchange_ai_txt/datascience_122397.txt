To answer your question: First, why is XGBoost is giving accuracy as 1. The model looks too good to believe. It might be that the model is overfitting on the data. Try shuffling the training data. Please try to use early_stopping in your XGBoost, so the model will stop training when it gets best score. You can use early stopping over any metric. Also try to do some feature selection and model tuning to get better results. The result you are getting are probably because you have 1 or 2 columns that are highly correlated to your label (target) column. Hope I answered your question.
