Change url: ´NOSCRIPT.HTML´ to your taste. Note: this is not valid HTML, though for this specific feature request, this is the only awnser. I could tell people on how to do it properly, but sometimes proper is not an option when a client is breathing down your neck and a pragmatic low cost solution is required ;) That said, progressive enhancement is the proper thing to do and showing a message to enable javascript is definatly a cleaner way of informing your visitors to .. well enable JavaScript.
