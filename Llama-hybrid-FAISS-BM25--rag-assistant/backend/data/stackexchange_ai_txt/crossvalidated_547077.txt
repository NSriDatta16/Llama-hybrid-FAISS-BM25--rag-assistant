PCA statistical units

I have a school project where I'm required to use a factor analysis. I chose this dataset from FiveThirtyEight about police killings. I want to characterize the places where people have been killed so I decided to group the data by cities, compute some summary statistics (median income, poverty rate etc) and perform a PCA. Can I perform my exploratory data analysis on the original data where the statistical units are the people killed and then use the pca on the cities, hence changing the statistical units? I'm asking this because we are required to define the statistical units in the introduction. And if it is possible or not, is there a justification for doing so? From a statistical standpoint.
