Using a predictive model on a dataset with different explanatory variables

As part of an assignment, we built a logistic regression model on a training data set. The test data, however, doesn't have one of the variables that was in the training data and included in the model. What should be done to test the model in this situation? Can we just ignore the fact that the model contains a variable that's not in the data, or do we have to accommodate for this somehow? I'm using R, and originally planned to use the predict() function to test the model, but this won't be possible given the different variables between the model and the data.
