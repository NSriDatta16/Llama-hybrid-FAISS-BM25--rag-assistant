As Nariman stated, you can't have server affinity - the load balancing is beyond your control. You can use either table storage or SQL Azure for session state. I don't really see much value in storing session state in blobs. See this post on the SQL Azure blog, from August 2010, to see how to implement session storage in SQL Azure. This will allow you to manage session state across instances as you scale up. EDIT 6/16/2014 - The Redis cache supports this. See Azure Redis Cache (Preview) ASP.NET Session State Provider EDIT 5/23/2012 - Wow, lots has changed since I posted this. SQL Azure is fully supported as a session state provider (via Universal Providers, shipping since v1.4), as well as Windows Azure Cache. More details are provided in this StackOverflow answer.
