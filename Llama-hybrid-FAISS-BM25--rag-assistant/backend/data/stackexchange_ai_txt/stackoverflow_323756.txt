The trick is to use negative lookbehind . If you need just a yes/no answer: (? If you need to match the whole URL: ^.*(? These regexes will work with any URL where the file name occurs at the end of the URL (i.e. URLs without a query or fragment). I'm assuming your URLs fit this limitation given the regex .asp$ in your question. If you want it to work with all URLs, try this: ^[^#?]+(? Or this if you want the regex to match the whole URL: ^[^#?]+(?
