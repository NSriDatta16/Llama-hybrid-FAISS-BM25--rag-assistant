This is an excellent question. Actually, it is so good that there are no answer to it. To the best of my knowledge, there are no true "agnostic" term for describing Y. In my experience and readings, I found that the semantic is domain-specific and also model-objective-specific. Econometricians will use the Dependent variable terms when building a model that is explanatory. They may use the terms Predicted or Fitted or Estimated variable when they are building a forecasting model that is more focused on accurate estimation/prediction than on theoretical explanatory power. The Big Data/Deep Learning crowd uses a completely different language. And, they will typically use the terms Response variable or Target variable. Their models are such black boxes that they typically do not attempt to explain a phenomenon as rather to predict it and estimate it accurately. But, somehow they wouldn't be caught using the term Predicted. They far prefer the terms Response or Target. I am less familiar with the term Outcome variable. It may be prevalent in other areas I am less exposed to such as social sciences including psychology, medicine, clinical trials, epidemiology. In view of the above, I could not provide you with any "agnostic" semantic for describing Y. Instead, I provided a bit of information on what semantic to use when catering to different audience and also reflecting the objective of your model. In summary, I don't think anyone gets hurt if you talk about Dependent variable with econometricians and Response or Target variable with Deep Learning types. Hopefully, you can separate those crowds apart otherwise you could have a verbal food fight on your hand.
