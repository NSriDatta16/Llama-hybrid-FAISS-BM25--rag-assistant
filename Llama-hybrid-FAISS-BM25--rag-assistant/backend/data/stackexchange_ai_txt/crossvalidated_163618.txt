What Percent of Neural Network is used while processing a single image

What percent (on average) of entire Neural network (say, AlexNet) is actually used while processing a single image. There should only a very small amount of network that should actually be utilized while processing a single image, i.e. removing some branches of the network should cause no or very little effect on the result. But this an intuitive statement. Is there any quantitative number or a research around this area?
