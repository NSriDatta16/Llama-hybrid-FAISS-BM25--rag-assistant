How to stop mouse drag events from moving entire window? [cocoa]

I think this should be a very easy one, but I cant find the answer on the docs. I want to stop mouse dragging events which are in (or start in) my custom nsview subclass from causing the window to be dragged around the screen. How can I tell the window to stay still so i can interact with the view instead of dragging the whole window around? thanks.
