If I was to build a form designer I'd make all elements divs with an image of the actual widget as a css background image, that way you can drag the widget representation around the form without activating it or having any of the overlay problems. If you really wanted to make it look like the finished product you can have the actual widget nested inside the div but invisible when the users mouse is within the div, when the user moves the mouse out of the div then set the widget visible again. DC Yes I was aware that the background image would look wrong when stretched. So I thought about it on the way home. A better technique would be to create a widget sandwich place the widget between 2 divs the bottom div controls the size and position the top prevents the widget from activating function ShowHide(button,id){ elem = document.getElementById(id) if (elem.style.visibility=='hidden') { elem.style.visibility='visible'; button.value="Hide Overlay"; } else { elem.style.visibility = 'hidden'; button.value="Show Overlay"; } } test 1 test 2 test 3 $(function() { $( "#draggable" ).draggable(); }); The above will work in firefox Clicking the button hides the overlay div allowing testing of the widget, You can drag the object around the screen, no resizing logic has been implemented.
