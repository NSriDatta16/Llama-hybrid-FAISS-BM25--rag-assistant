My advice is to always organise at the project level first. Then modules that make sense. Languages only seem to come into play when a module has multiple implementations. In those cases I find the making the module it's own project works best. $/Project/XXX $/Project/YYY/Lang1 $/Project/YYY/Lang2 Then if XXX uses YYY then it's binding is the output of YYY not the source of YYY
