The main problem I had with this was that I didn't know how to make Visual Studio break when an exception was thrown within the WPF code as I was doing the drag and drop operation. Turns out this can be done under the Debug-menu in Visual Studio: Debug -> Exceptions -> Find the exception you're interested in and click the checkbox so that the debugger breaks when the exception is thrown also.
