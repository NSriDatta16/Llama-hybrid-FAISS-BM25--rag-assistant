I just got a CycloDS Evolution the other day, and I am loving it! DSOrganize is like a mini-OS which adds a bunch of stuff I was wishing the DS came with, like an actual calendar app! To address Mike F's #3, there is actually an FTP server for DS , which you can use to transfer files to your DS wirelessly. I haven't tried it myself though, since my network uses WPA and the DS only seems to support WEP.
