You should be able to see the build status as BuildStatus.NotStarted once the build actually reaches the queue. There is a time before it reaches the queue that it really doesn't have a status, though. If you're submitting your build programmatically, you can do: bool success = queue.WaitForBuildStart(pollingIntervalInMilliseconds, timeOutInMilliseconds); As long as the agent is listening, this should actually return very quickly. If you have a slow network, this could potentially take a couple seconds for handshaking. Once it passes the WaitForBuildStart, the status is set to BuildStatus.NotStarted until it moves to InProgress and the rest of the way down the line.
