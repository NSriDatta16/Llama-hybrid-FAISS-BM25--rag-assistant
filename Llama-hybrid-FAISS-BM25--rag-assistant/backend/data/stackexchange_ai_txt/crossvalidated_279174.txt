Your data can be simply modeled using logistic regression. Logistic regression can be used also for data in other format then 0's and 1's, for example in R you can use it with three different (but equivalent) formats of data . In fact you can view your data as successes and failures in some number of trials. Even if you have only the aggregated data (total number of successes) accompanied with the number of criteria that were used, you can still use logistic regression for such data. The model that you assume is modeling $k$ successes in $n$ Bernoulli trials, where the probability of success $p$ is unknown and to be estimated, i.e. you are dealing with binomial distribution and logistic regression is designed for such problems. The overall effect may be viewed as the per-study effect estimated using logistic regression. Moreover, logistic regression, or alternatively generalized mixed effects model with logistic link, may enable you to study the influence (control for) of other variables.
