Training with feature metadata - bayesian network (naive bayes)

I am building a project for fun - reverse astrology! I am making a dataset like: planet_name, life_impact Saturn, impact1 Saturn, impact2 Sun, impact2 Sun, impact3 Sun, impact4 Mars, impact 5 Mars, impact 6 etc… I have trained a bayesian network over this^. I want the network to learn metadata based learnings also. ie. Right now for positive evidence “impact 1” network will contribute probability 1/2 to Saturn and 1/3 to Sun. Now, I have metadata(duration) for feature: life_impact duration for impact2 for Saturn is 1/5 duration for impact2 for Sun is 5/5 This should change the probability contribution to sun/saturn: Now contribution should change as per the value of duration also. eg. impact 1 with duration 1 should contribute more to Saturn and less to Sun, similarly impact 1 with duration 4 or 5 should contribute more to Sun. Note that metadata duration might not be there for all impacts, something else might be present like “relevance” How should I design my features to accommodate this?
