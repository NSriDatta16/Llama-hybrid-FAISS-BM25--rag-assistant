Use of general-purpose scripting languages

There are many scripting language communities claiming that the language can be used for everything but in fact, nearly everybody uses it for one specific thing, e.g.: web development. If I take a look at Ruby, for example, they tell you its general-purpose but actually everybody is using it with rails for web development only.. Can you list me some uses of popular general-purpose scripting languages for the local PC? (except embedding) Are there any? Is the fast development usually worth having to bring the whole interpreter with your program? Then there would be some language-dependent performance and stability problems too in most cases.. best regards, lamas
