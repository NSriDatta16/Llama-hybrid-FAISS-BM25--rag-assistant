Assuming that the expressions "20 % rain, 80 % dry" and "30% cloudy, 70% rain" represent probabilities, that the classes are mutually exclusive and that we may ignore a possible ordinal relationship (such as "dry > cloudy > rain") among them, models such as polychotomous logistic regression may be fit to these values, as though they were grouped or replicated. I suppose other, ad hoc procedures could be employed as well, which would minimize, for example, the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence.
