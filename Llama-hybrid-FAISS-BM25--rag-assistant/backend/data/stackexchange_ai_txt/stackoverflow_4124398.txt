Can someone explain me this Oracle SQL Command?

ALTER TABLE "APPLICATIONS_SRV_STORAGE" ADD CONSTRAINT "APPL_SRV_STORAGE_APPLICAT_FK1" FOREIGN KEY ("APP_ID") REFERENCES "APPLICATIONS" ("APP_ID") ON DELETE CASCADE ENABLE; Does it mean: When something on table APPLICATIONS is deleted, delte altough the entry in APPLICATION_SRV_STORAGE?
