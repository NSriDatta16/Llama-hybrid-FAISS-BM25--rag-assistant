iPhone app -- are plists the way to handle default values and other languages?

I wrote my first program almost fifty years ago (yes, coding is still a blast, managing big projects with many programmers was not), but my Von Neumann thinking gets in the way. I want to (a) load default values and (b) account for multiple languages more elegantly (?) than 60-plus iterations of NSLocalizedString. Can I park all of this data into what amounts to a record with fields like this: (key value stuff), (tweak-able user prompt / screen name / whatever), (tasteful default), (user-supplied value)? NSUserDefault has worked well so far; Core Data looks like overkill (?), and sql lite, well, where's Oracle when you need it?
