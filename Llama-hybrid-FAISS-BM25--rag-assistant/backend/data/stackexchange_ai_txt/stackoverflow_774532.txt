Personally, I don't find much use for anonymous types. They're certainly to be used with a degree of caution at the least. The situation in which they are typically are used are when creating LINQ queries that reteurn multiple values, and you only need to utilise the queried data for the duration of the function. (If the data needs to be used outside, then anonymous types can't be used - you need to declare your own, and for good reason, i.e. readability.) More generally, they can sometimes be useful when using plain lambda expressions, though again I myself have required them very infrequently. (When I say required, there are almost alternatives depending on the context, but sometimes anonymous types are in fact the most elegant option.) If you'd like a code example, just let me know and I'll try to come up with one with some reasonably decent application.
