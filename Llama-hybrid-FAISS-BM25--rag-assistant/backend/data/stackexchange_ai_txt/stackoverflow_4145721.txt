Silverlight - Bring Popup to Front

I have 4 popups, defined like this: The template for the Thumb is just a user control. Since the Popups are already open, I animate the contained thumb to size up when I need to show them to the user. The problem is, when the user clicks on the thumb to drag it around, I'd really like to be able to bring it to front, so it's the top most control - just like regular popup windows work. I have implemented the leftMouseDown event (in the usercontrol template of the Thumb), and tried both of the following (the second one to see if ANYTHING would work) Canvas.SetZIndex(this, 9999); Canvas.SetZIndex(VisualTreeHelper.GetOpenPopups().ElementAt(1), 9999); (I also tried setting the Z-Index to 0 - to try and push a popup to the bottom, just, again, to see if anything would work) Nothing has worked in the least. I've also tried what's here, also to no avail, though I suspect this doesn't apply to me since I don't have a ContentPResenter Bring element forward (Z Index) in Silverlight/WPF
