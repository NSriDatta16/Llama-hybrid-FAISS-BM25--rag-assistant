Is there a way to use pre-existing JSP Tag libraries within the Lift framework (e.g. via snippets)?

I'm fairly new to Lift/Scala but like the ideas of less code writing and function passing etc. I've had a brief look at the Lift web framework but was wondering if it is at all possible to leverage pre-existing JSP Tag libraries, ideally while being able to still place/mix with Lift's snippet tags? As Scala is able to utilise normal Java libraries, it would seem a shame to not, directly, be able to use JSP Tags within Lift, in some guise. JFYI, I am mainly considering the use of Apache's Reusable Dialog Components: http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/rdc-doc/intro.html for VoiceXML markup. Cheers Richard
