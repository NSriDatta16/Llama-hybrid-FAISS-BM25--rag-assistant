It's not good practice IMO to have partials asking what the current controller and action names are. Think "tell, don't ask" ( http://www.pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask ). That is, rather than having the partial ask it's caller about its state, tell the partial what you want it to do. One way to do this is by passing variables to the partial through the locals option: "/common/toolbar", :locals => {:edit => true} %> Then in the partial: ... stuff appropriate to edit mode
