Increasing height & width of an image means one of two things: i) You are increasing the physical size of the image (i.e. cm or inches), without touching its content. ii) You are trying to increase the image pixel content (ie its resolution) So: (i) has to do with rendering. As the image physical size goes up, you are drawing larger pixels (the DPI goes down). Good if you want to look at the image from far away (sau on a really large screen). If look at it from up close, you are going to see mostly large dots. (ii) Is just plainly impossible. Say your image is 100X100 pixels and you want to make 200x200. This means you start from 10,000 pixels, end up with 40,000... what are you going to put in the 30,000 new pixels? Whatever your answer, you are going to end up with 30,000 invented pixels and the image you get is going to be either fuzzier, or faker, and usually both. All the techniques that increase an image size use some sort of average among neighboring pixel values, which amounts to "fuzzier". Cheers.
