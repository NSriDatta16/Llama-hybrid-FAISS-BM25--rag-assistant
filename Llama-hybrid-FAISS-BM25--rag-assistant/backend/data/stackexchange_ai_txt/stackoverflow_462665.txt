is the HTML way of expressing a line break, as there is no other way of doing it. Physical line breaks in the source code are rightfully ignored (more correctly: treated as a single white space), so you need a markup way to express them. Not every line break is the beginning of a new paragraph, and packing text into s (for example) just to avoid s seems overly paranoid to me. Why do they bother you?
