Is alpha error inflation a problem with multiple ordered logistic regressions?

Following problem: I'm doing a survey where my independent variables are: (1) the perceived attractiveness of a product on a 7-Likert-scale and (2) the willingness to invest in such a product as a numeric value (0-10.000). During the survey, multiple descriptive questions are asked, such as "level of education", "age", "gender" or "occupation". I'm now doing a multiple ordered logistic regression regarding each of this variables. Recently I came across the problem of alpha error inflation in multiple comparisons problems. Is this an issue here? I have some weakly significant values, for example Masters students show significantly (p = 0.049) higher results regarding the invested sum - are they really significant or do I have to do a Bonferroni correction (which would, of course, render those results insignificant)? I'm not sure whether I fully understood the application of the multiple comparisons problem, so I'd be glad if anyone could help :). Best
