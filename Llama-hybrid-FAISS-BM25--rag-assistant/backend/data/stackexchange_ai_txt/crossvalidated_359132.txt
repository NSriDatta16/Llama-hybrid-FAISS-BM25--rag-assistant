How to predict a univariate time series with Elman neural networks in R

I have following time series on weekly basis Week Value 1 23456 2 56787 3 12546 4 5564 Like wise I have data for 4 years. I want to use Elman neural networks to predict the non-linear time series. I am facing the difficulty in data preparation for the following elman function. elman(x, y, size = c(5), maxit = 100, initFunc = "JE_Weights", initFuncParams = c(1, -1, 0.3, 1, 0.5), learnFunc = "JE_BP", learnFuncParams = c(0.2), updateFunc = "JE_Order", updateFuncParams = c(0), shufflePatterns = FALSE, linOut = TRUE, outContext = FALSE, inputsTest = NULL, targetsTest = NULL, ...) What should be the value of X and Y ? And while predicting for weeks ahead,how should I do it?
