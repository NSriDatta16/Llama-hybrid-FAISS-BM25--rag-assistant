The Gamma prior is not conjugate for the Gamma sampling model. See Conjugate prior for a Gamma distribution The following R code shows how to sample from the posterior of a Gamma model with uniform priors on $[0,1000]$ for the scale and shape parameters, you can play with other priors, using an adaptive MCMC sampler. set.seed(12345) # Simulated data data = rgamma(100,shape = 2.5,scale=97) # Histogram and likelihood fit hist(data) library(MASS) fitdistr(data,"gamma") # -log posterior mlogpost = function(par){ loglik = sum(dgamma(data,shape=par[1],scale = par[2],log=T)) logprior = -2*log(1000) return(-loglik - logprior) } # Library for the MCMC sampler library(Rtwalk) # Initial point init = c(2.5,97) # Support of the posterior Support 0)) } # Random initial points (see documentation of Rtwalk) X0
