Sounds like you connected your outlets to the buttons, but didn't connect the buttons to the actions. Right click Cancel the UIBarButtonItem in Interface Builder. Hover over Selector, then drag the + that appears onto File's Owner. Connect it to cancelEntry:. Repeat for Save. Instead of using (id) for your IBActions, you should probably use (UIBarButtonItem *) . That'll prevent you from connecting a different object type to those IBActions.
