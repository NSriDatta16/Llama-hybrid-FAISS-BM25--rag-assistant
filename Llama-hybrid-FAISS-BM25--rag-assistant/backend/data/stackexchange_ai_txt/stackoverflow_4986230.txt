Why is my android RadioButton text being truncated at the beginning?

I'm having a really weird layout problem... basically the first button in this RadioGroup is losing it's first letter, as per this screenshot (it should say "Booked Off", not "ooked Off"): The XML fragment is fairly simple (and I've got nothing funny in an external style or anything): Does anyone recognise the problem here and can offer a solution? I'm using 1.6 if it matters, because the device I'm targetting only has a 1.6 ROM.
