As far as the integration goes its very complicated to integrate an existing application with it CMS, especially if it is dynamic and uses controls like gridview etc. Here I share link for: Problems in integration of existing application with dotnetnuke When to use dotnetnuke Dotnetnuke vs Umbraco Further I quote the following comparisons between the two: Both have the advantage of being open source programs, which means they are constantly updated and improved. There are many plugins and applications created by a core of invested users, increasing functionality and removing bugs with regularity. Still, there are plenty of differences, as anyone who has used both systems will note. Here are some things to consider about Umbraco: It can be edited in Microsoft Word, making for easy editing for most users. There are OSS or commercial install options A high-quality, highly functional CMS Install gives you a blank page – no template, not much of anything else – This means plenty of freedom and flexibility – freedom to succeed or freedom to fail. Success of a site is entirely up to a developer, meaning you must have a highly qualified and creative developer who also knows legal compliance and standards compliance. Umbraco has high requirements for hosting, so it is difficult to find a “shared” hosting environment that will support it Still working on good ecommerce solutions Version 4 has better support for Safari and Firefox There are good plugins available, and a management system built into Umbraco By contrast, here are some items to consider about DotNetNuke: Has a proprietary feel, despite being open source Dot NET developers like it, those who are not dot NET developers have trouble with it Based on Microsoft’s ASP.NET, which is the most popular web technology currently Cheap to use and reduces total development costs – no ongoing licensing fees Full access to source code so it can be altered to fit individual organizations Can manage text, image, documents, links, events, news, banner ads and threaded info Supports multiple websites Installs easily Can manage site hosting, content, security, web design and membership in one program Multi-language ability Fully extensible and scalable User friendly interface and intuitve site wizards, help icons and interface for those familiar with Dot NET Hope this helps.
