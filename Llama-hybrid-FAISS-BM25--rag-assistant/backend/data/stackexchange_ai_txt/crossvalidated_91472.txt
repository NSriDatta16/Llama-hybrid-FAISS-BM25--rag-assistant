How would you go about pairing them? A paired t-test asks whether the mean difference between paired observations is different from zero. For example, you might weigh people, put them on a diet, and then weigh them again some time later. An unpaired t-test would ask whether the average weight of the "before" group differs from the average weight of the "after" group. A paired t-test, however, compares each person's weight loss/gain. It doesn't sound like you have any sensible way of pairing your questionnaires, so you cannot use a paired t-test. This isn't necessarily the end of the world--you can use an unpaired t-test instead: this would tell you whether there was a significant different in the two total scores.
