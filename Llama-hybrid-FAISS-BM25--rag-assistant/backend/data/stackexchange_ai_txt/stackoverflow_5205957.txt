In Azure, affinity groups are an abstraction concept that simply tells the Fabric controller to do its best to ensure groups of related services are deployed to ensure optimization for inter-app communication. Groups ensure that services, storage, etc will all be placed in close proximity whenever possible. Affinity groups are bound to regions, so you don't need to worry about a AG switching countries on its own, as that would be bound to the region. In Azure, the explicit geo-location concept is that of a region . If you specify a region you are binding to a datacenter (or virtual concept of a DC) in that particular geographical region. At this time there is no ability to move/migrate services among regions on your own. The Fabric Controller does replicate across physical datacenters for fault tolerance, but this action is bound to the country-specific nature of the region definition. So Datacenter 1 in North Central US likely replicated to Datacenter 2 in South Central US, but never to a European region. Even the "anywhere" regions which let the FC determine the best place for your code are bound by national boundaries. In the future I wouldn't be surprised (though I'd say 50% chance) if Azure had a geo-replication option, but I highly doubt this would be a passive feature of the platform. There are simply too many governmental and legal ramification to just turn this on.
