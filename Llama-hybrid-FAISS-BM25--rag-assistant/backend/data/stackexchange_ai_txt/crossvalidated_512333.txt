When is it appropriate to use the residuals from one model as data for another?

I came across the opinion to never use the residuals from one model as data for another model in both the lecture ( linked time stamp for his comments ) and text (excerpt below, maintaining the original emphasis and cited reference) by Richard McElreath [1]. But I see this technique used in machine learning [2,3], and I have some sense using the residuals is some form of feature extraction. Rethinking: Residuals are parameters, not data. There is a tradition, especially in parts of biology, of using residuals from one model as data in another model. For example, a biologist might regress brain size on body size and then use the brain size residuals as data in another model. This procedure is always a mistake. Residuals are not known. They are parameters, variables with unobserved values. Treating them as known values throws away uncertainty. The right way to adjust for body size is to include it in the same model,[83] preferably a model designed in light of an explicit causal model. Is using the residuals as demonstrated in Zhang et al. [2] inherently wrong or misguided? Can it be appropriate to use the residuals to only increase the predictive performance or feature engineering?
