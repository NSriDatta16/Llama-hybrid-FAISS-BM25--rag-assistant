OK found it. Not an Android problem but just my error (not the first time) : mkdirs must be applied to the parent file, not the file I want to write... So, for people interested : Access the sd card using File root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); Don't forget to require this permission WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Then make, as usual, mkdirs and file creation. And don't forget : the android device cannot write on the sdard while it is mounted on you PC.
