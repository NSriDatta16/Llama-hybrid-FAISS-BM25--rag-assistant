How can you echo the existing settings in Vim?

So I'm working on updating my .vimrc file since it's a gigantic mess currently. What I'd like to be able to do is give a command to vim to get it to echo the existing settings. For example, in my .vimrc I have set shortmess += r Now, going off of the help file, I know that shortmess has currently more options turned on than r - but I don't know what they are! How do I get vim to echo the currently active settings to me?
