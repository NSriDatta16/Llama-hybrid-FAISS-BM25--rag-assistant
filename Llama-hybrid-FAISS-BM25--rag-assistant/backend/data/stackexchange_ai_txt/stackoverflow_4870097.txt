Development "workflow" question using document-based storage

This question is generic to any document-based storage, but at the moment I am using RavenDB. Often I have had to do things in a hurry and test new UI tweaks by modifying the data. It's easy enough in the days of SQL Server - whip up Management Studio, a few Update queries and such, and I have new data to test UI changes. What's the best practice when using document-based storage? I know RavenDB has the HTTP mode but I noticed it hung quite a fair bit. I keep getting the prolonged "Loading..." status. What's everyone doing to make data tweaks?
