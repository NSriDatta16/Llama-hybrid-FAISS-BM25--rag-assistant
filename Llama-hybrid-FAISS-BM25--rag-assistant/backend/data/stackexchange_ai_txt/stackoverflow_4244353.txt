TeamCity Vs BuildForge

We are currently using TeamCity and planning to move on to BuildForge because of organizational needs/constraints. I want to do a feature comparison on TeamCity and BuildForge. Could anyone please help me on this. As I could find comparison of BuildForge with other CI tools such as Hudson, CruiseControl only.
