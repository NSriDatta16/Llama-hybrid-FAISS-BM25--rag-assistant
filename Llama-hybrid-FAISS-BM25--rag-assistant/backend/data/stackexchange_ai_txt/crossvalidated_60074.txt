Wald test for logistic regression

As far as I understand the Wald test in the context of logistic regression is used to determine whether a certain predictor variable $X$ is significant or not. It rejects the null hypothesis of the corresponding coefficient being zero. The test consists of dividing the value of the coefficient by standard error $\sigma$. What I am confused about is that $X/\sigma$ is also known as Z-score and indicates how likely it is that a given observation comes form the normal distribution (with mean zero).
