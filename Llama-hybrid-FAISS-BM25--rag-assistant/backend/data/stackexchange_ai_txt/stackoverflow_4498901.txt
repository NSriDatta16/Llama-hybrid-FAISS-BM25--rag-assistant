There isn't a really elegant way for this... SELECT Name INTO #foo from Lookup_Country where Code = @Code IF @@ROWCOUNT <> 0 SELECT Name FROM #foo ELSE Select Name from Lookup_Country where Id = @Code Whether you use a table variable or count, it doesn't matter Or you have this construct, perhaps with an aggregate SELECT TOP 1 Name FROM ( Select Name, 0 AS Precedence from Lookup_Country where Code = @Code UNION ALL Select Name, 1 AS Precedence from Lookup_Country where Id = @Code ) foo ORDER BY Precedence If you include Precedence in the output you have information on how it was found...
