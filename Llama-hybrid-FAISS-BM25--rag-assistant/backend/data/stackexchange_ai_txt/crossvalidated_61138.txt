Multinomial logistic regression and marginal effects

I am trying to calculate the marginal effects of a multinomial logistic regression. To do this I use the mlogit package and the effects() function. Here is how the procedure works (source : effects() function of mlogit package) : data("Fishing", package = "mlogit") Fish $alt, mean), catch = tapply(catch, index(m)$ alt, mean), income = mean(income))) # compute the marginal effects (the second one is an elasticity effects(m, covariate = "income", data = z) effects(m, covariate = "price", type = "rr", data = z) effects(m, covariate = "catch", type = "ar", data = z) I have no problem with first step ( mlogit.data() function). I think my problem is in the specification of the multinomial regression. My regression (for example with three variables) is on the form: Y ~ 0 | X1 + X2 + X3 . When I try to estimate the marginal effects for a model with 2 variables, there is no problem, however for 3 variables R console returns me the following error: "Error in if (rhs% in% c (1, 3)) {: argument is of length zero " (translation from error in R console in french). To understand what is my problem I tried to perform a multinomial regression of similar shape on the dataset "Fishing", i.e.,: mode ~ 0 | income + price + catch (even if this form has no "economic" sense.) Again the R console returns me the same error for 3 variables but manages to estimate these effects for a model with two variables. This leads me to think that my problem really comes from the specification of my multinomial regression. Do you know how I could find a solution to my problem? Or could you suggest another logit multinomial regression form?
