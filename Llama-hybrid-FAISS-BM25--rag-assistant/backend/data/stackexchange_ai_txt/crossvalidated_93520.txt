One reason is that the predictor doesn't have a very big impact on the binary response. What was the p-value of the predictor when output by the regression? If it was high, that would explain it. Alternatively, if you didn't specify the link function properly whatever software you're using could be using an identity link function (which is not, strictly speaking, logistic regression in that case). Otherwise we'll need more information to diagnose.
