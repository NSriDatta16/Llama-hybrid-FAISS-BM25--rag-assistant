Prevent users from creating Schedules for jobs

I need to restrict the development users from creating new schedules for SQL Agent jobs. They should be able to create a job and pick one of the available schedules, but should not be able to create a new schedule. I have a bunch of developers creating SSIS packages that need to be scheduled off business hours. I am now faced with either having to do that myself, or risking the possibility of someone scheduling a major task during business hours and slowing down the DEV server noticeably. Is this possible? Any alternate solutions also welcome. Thanks, Raj
