Chrome does support the netscape plugin api, but that is for displaying certain kinds of content. You seem to be after a extention api, really firefox is the only major browser to encourage and support third party extentions to browsing capability (that aren't simply new toolbars) Nothing in the developer documentation points to a browser enhancing api - google seem to want to keep a tight reign on the look and feel of the application. You might find a more conclusive answer on the development site: dev.chromium.org, and some of the developers might be on irc on #chromium on freenode.
