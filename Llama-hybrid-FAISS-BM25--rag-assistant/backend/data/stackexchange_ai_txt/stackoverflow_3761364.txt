NSTextView's HTML support is only rudimentary. It does't hook into WebKit or anything to render full HTML. The only way I know of that comes even close to accomplishing what you're trying to do with an NSTextView is tab stops. You can add an NSTextTab with an alignment of NSCenterTextAlignment to the line's paragraph style. Then use a tab to separate the left-aligned text from the center-aligned text. The biggest problem with this is that you have to calculate the center point of your text view and create your tab stop at that location every time the size of your text view changes. I suppose you could also subclass NSLayoutManager , but that's probably more heavy-handed than you were expecting.
