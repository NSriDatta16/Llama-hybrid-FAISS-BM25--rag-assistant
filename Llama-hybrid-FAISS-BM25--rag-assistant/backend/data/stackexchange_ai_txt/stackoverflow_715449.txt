I Agree with Craig, You don't want CC.NET on your stage servers. We do everything from a build server and pushout to dev. and stage. Using MSBuild we have targets set up for each of the compiles, and for pushing any and all parts out to both servers or combinations of servers depending on which environment. So each project on CC.net on the build server corresponds to a target or tragets in the MSBuild plus the over all continuous builds.
