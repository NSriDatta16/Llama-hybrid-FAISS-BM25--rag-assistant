You might want to look at dpkt . It's a Python library to simplify reading (or generating) network data. Just save your Wireshark data as a Pcap stream and it can easily be opened from within Python. I don't know exactly which headers you want or how you need them filtered and formatted, but here's an example of what you could write: (taken from a contributor's blog post ) import dpkt pcap = dpkt.pcap.Reader(open('test.pcap')) for timestamp, buf in pcap: eth = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf) ip = eth.data tcp = ip.data print 'Got data from port ' + str(tcp.port)
