For the classification of images, use the Convolutional Neural network(CNN) Or you can opt for the Pre-trained model that was trained on a large amount of dataset Which provides good accuracy. Examples of the pre-trained models are VGG, MobileNet, Inception V3, etc. For choosing various hyperparameters you can use the grid search approach.
