So here's how I solved it after a lot of testing and browsing MSDN. It turns out that things are a bit different in the Map control on Windows Phone (see MSDN ). There are new behaviors and events compared to normal Silverlight. ... private void Map_MapPan(object sender, MapDragEventArgs e) { e.Handled = true; } private void Map_MapZoom(object sender, MapZoomEventArgs e) { e.Handled = true; }
