I could be wrong, but I think you need to decide the relative importance of performance parameters based on domain knowledge. At least in my knowledge statistics offers you no insight into the relative weights. e.g. Say you had to rank cars on the basis of gas-mileage and top-speed. Every persons mental model of car rating would give different weights to each of these two parameters. So I am doubtful you can get Statistics to solve this conundrum for you. I agree with @BGreene that PCA might help you understand the dataset; though high variance by itself does not imply that a variable must be the most important in a rating context. Again, I could be wrong.
