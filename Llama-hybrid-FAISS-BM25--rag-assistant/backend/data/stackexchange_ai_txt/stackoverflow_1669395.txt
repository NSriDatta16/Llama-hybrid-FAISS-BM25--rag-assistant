If the proxy servers are caching your site, there's very little you can do. You can try adding CACHE-CONTROL and PRAGMA:NO-CACHE headers to your pages. You should also try replicating the problem with as little between you and the server as possible. I've had problems with Tomcat holding onto files in its 'work' cache, so be sure to delete that.
