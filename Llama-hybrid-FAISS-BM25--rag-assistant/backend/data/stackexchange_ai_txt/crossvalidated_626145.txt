Your question and answer indicate some confusion in terms and concepts, which I'll try to clear up first. The acronym "GUM" My expertise in measurement uncertainty is restricted to ISO/IEC Guide 98 Uncertainty of measurement. That Guide has multiple parts and supplements. The acronym "GUM" usually means Part 3, i.e. ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 Uncertainty of measurement — Part 3: Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM:1995) (pdf at bsigroup.com ). I suggest using unqualified "GUM" to refer to only the whole of that document, e.g. not Part 6: Developing and using measurement models and not Annex D of the GUM. I also suggest using the ISO Online Browsing Platform to check for ISO recognised definitions. Population parameters vs. measurands From GUM 3.1.1 The objective of a measurement (B.2.5) is to determine the value (B.2.2) of the measurand (B.2.9), that is, the value of the particular quantity (B.2.1, Note 1) to be measured. A measurement therefore begins with an appropriate specification of the measurand, the method of measurement (B.2.7), and the measurement procedure (B.2.8). NOTE The term “true value” (see Annex D) is not used in this Guide for the reasons given in D.3.5; the terms “value of a measurand” (or of a quantity) and “true value of a measurand” (or of a quantity) are viewed as equivalent. 3.1.2 In general, the result of a measurement (B.2.11) is only an approximation or estimate (C.2.26) of the value of the measurand and thus is complete only when accompanied by a statement of the uncertainty (B.2.18) of that estimate. B.2.9 measurand particular quantity subject to measurement EXAMPLE Vapour pressure of a given sample of water at 20 °C. NOTE The specification of a measurand may require statements about quantities such as time, temperature and pressure. In passing, I note that GUM:Annex D - to which you refer as "ISO terms and definitions" and "GUM description for uncertainty" - is really explanation of why GUM eschews reference to "true value" and "error", and doesn't really help define measurement uncertainty. Note that the objective of a measurement is not to estimate a population parameter. Considering the two examples in your answer: In Math : Usually the student's mark is of no interest except as an indication of that particular student's ability (the measurand ) and as such it is certainly subject to error. Less commonly the objective may be to estimate the average ability of a group, but even then the average mark is only an estimate of the measurand. In Physics : Due to unavoidable changes in conditions there will be differences in the (unknowable) true periods of different oscillations. You seem to be suggesting that the measurand is some essentially hypothetical average of an infinite number of oscillations. OK, on to your question " what would be the correct definition of measurement uncertainty which would be applicable to any case whereas 'systemic error is involved or not' or 'Result belongs a very small or a very large sample of measurements'? " You don't mention the definition of measurement uncertainty in GUM which seems appropriate to all the circumstances you cite: 2.2.3 The formal definition of the term “uncertainty of measurement” developed for use in this Guide and in the VIM [6] (VIM:1993, definition 3.9) is as follows: uncertainty (of measurement) parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand NOTE 1 The parameter may be, for example, a standard deviation (or a given multiple of it), or the half-width of an interval having a stated level of confidence. NOTE 2 Uncertainty of measurement comprises, in general, many components. Some of these components may be evaluated from the statistical distribution of the results of series of measurements and can be characterized by experimental standard deviations. The other components, which also can be characterized by standard deviations, are evaluated from assumed probability distributions based on experience or other information. NOTE 3 It is understood that the result of the measurement is the best estimate of the value of the measurand, and that all components of uncertainty, including those arising from systematic effects, such as components associated with corrections and reference standards, contribute to the dispersion. Your final 'Result belongs a very small or a very large sample of measurements' suffers from imprecision in language. Using ISO terminology the "measurement" is the final result for which the uncertainty is required - "a ... sample of measurements" doesn't make much sense. If you mean "the (final) measurement value is calculated from a ... number of other quantities" then the number and nature of those quantities is part of "the method of measurement (B.2.7), and the measurement procedure (B.2.8)" in GUM 3.1.1 quoted above. The relationship between those other quantities and the measurement value is the subject of the "measurement model" covered in "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement — Part 6: Developing and using measurement models" which your answer refers to as "GUM". In my experience the considerations in Part 6 are rarely used in practice. Hope this helps.
