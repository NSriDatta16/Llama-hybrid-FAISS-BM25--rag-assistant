I believe the major difficulty here is defining the features, while the clustering is pretty standard. Do you want the real values to match? Then cluster on the value directly. Do you think the meaning lies in the difference over time? Then define your features as $P_t-P_0$ Do you think the features shuold be the change in percentage over time? Then define your features as $\frac{P_t-P_0}{P_0}$ Another way would be to model the time series with some model equation, for example with autoregression and use the coefficients as a measure of similarity. The real question here is what do you define as similar curves, and if you don't know the answer then no clustering algorithm will find what you're looking for.
