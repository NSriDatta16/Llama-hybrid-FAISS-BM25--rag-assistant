In this example, you're basically implementing na√Øve word-wrap. This is the crude and inelegant way I'd do it: Create a holding variable which you use to dump a single line's output into. While the length of that variable is less than or equal to the maximum line length, pop(-1) the first element out of the list of words, and append it to the placeholder string. When this condition isn't true (test it before popping the element), print the line and start all over again. I'm not doing it for you, but this is the way I would start.
