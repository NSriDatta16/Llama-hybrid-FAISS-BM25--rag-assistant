Html/ css coding standards

I'm building my first website for an internship. My instructors always told me to never embed any styles on my html page.Now that I'm actually creating a site I find it annoying that, if I want to change the color of my font for a span tag - I have to I.D. it and reference it in a css file. Is there some other reason then organizational purposes for using CSS? Would embedding a single style be such a convention breaker? Thanks for reading this and I'd appreciate any feedback.
