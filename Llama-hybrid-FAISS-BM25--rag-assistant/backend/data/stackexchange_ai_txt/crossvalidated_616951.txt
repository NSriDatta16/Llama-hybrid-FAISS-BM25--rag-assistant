Multiple cases, each having multiple time seies

I have multiple cases, each having multiple independent variables measured over time. One of the variables represents known failure/success in the past, and I am trying to model a binary logistic regression to predict future failure/success (DV). Am I barking under the wrong tree? What will be the best model to move forward? Thanks, Joseph
