The general rule you'll be quoted by almost all other answers is "do not process HTML with regex - you can't capture all the edge cases" I believe this to be quite true Anything even slightly malformed in your string, and even the best-crafted regular expression will still mess it up Ignoring that you want to split some tags and not others (p-tags are tags, after all, and you're looking to split one into two), you may need to rethink the process, and get very specific about what you're wanting to achieve e.g. is splitting in the middle of a paragraph tag okay? What about divs? If middle point is inside a tag, do you want the first string to be longer, or the second? Assuming that splitting paragraph tags is okay, but others aren't, try an approach as follows: (no copy-paste code here, sorry) * Strip the target string twice - once of all tags, and once of just paragraph tags * Find the middle point in the no-tags-at-all string * Split the no-tags-at-all string at first space after middle point * Find the spot in the just-p-tags-stripped string that matches the word/words just after the middle point in previous step - this should tell you where in the just-p-tags-stripped string is 'the middle' when tags are ignored * Check to see if you're inside a tag. .. actually, just as I got to this point I realised that 90% of what I wrote is pretty darned obvious, and that the last dot-point is precisely where the problem is I'm going to leave my half-finished rant here at a warning to others, and to myself..
