Which components should be chosen to analysis?

Recently i've started to do some analysis with PCA. I'm trying to seek for variables correlated with a variable X. Should i then visualize and check components where the correlation or contribution of X variable in component is highest? It's not clear for me why everyone always use PC1 and PC2 for the analysis/plots and why they won't examine for example PC3 and PC4? Any help would be highly appreciated!
