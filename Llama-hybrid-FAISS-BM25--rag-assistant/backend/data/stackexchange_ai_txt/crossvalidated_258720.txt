Show that a time series process is stationary

Consider the time series $$ x_t = B_1 + B_{2}t + w_t, $$ where $B_1$ and $B_2$ are known constants and $w_t$ is a white noise process with variance $\sigma^2$. Show that the process $y_t = x_t - x_{t-1}$ is stationary. For finding Covariance I cant seem to understand what to do.
