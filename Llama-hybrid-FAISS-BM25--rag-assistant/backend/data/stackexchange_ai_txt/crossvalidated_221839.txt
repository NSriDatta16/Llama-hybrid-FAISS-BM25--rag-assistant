Assuming you cannot convert both measures to a common set of units, and both measures are continuous and are roughly normally distributed, convert both to standardized scores (e.g., $z = \frac{x- \mu}{\sigma}$). Added in response to @Nick: Bland-Altman plots plot the difference between two measures against the average of the two measures, so to be meaningful the two measures need to be measured on the same scale. Converting two measures that are on different scales to dimensionless standardised scores allows you to do the necessary calculations. Added in response to @Nick (2): Not sure what you are saying. Here is a workable example: # Load packages library(dplyr) library(BlandAltmanLeh) # Using the same conditions @Ashe used ## Set seed set.seed(2063) ## Generate data x % ## Add two new columns containing standarized values of x and y mutate(x_std = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x), y_std = (y - mean(y)) / sd(y)) ## Bland-Altman plots of: ### i) raw x and y values raw ### ii) standardized x and y values std It achieves the same (in shape at least) result as the lm approach used by @Ashe, which is what you would expect since both methods are 'rescaling' the values.
