selecting root element in jquery

I need to be able to select the root element from a fragment without knowing the node types, class, id or hierachy. I want to be able to do something like $(':root') and have 0 selected in the example above. Better still I would prefer $(':level(0)') which would mean the same as above, $(':level(1)') would select 0a, 0b and 0c and $(':level(1)>div') would select a01. Any ideas on how to do it neatly?
