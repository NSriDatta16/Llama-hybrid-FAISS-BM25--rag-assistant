Build a good ARIMA model for your price history incorporating memory, events (e.g. Black Friday etc ...), day-of-the-week, seasonal dummies, level shifts , local time trends and the run a program that incorporates robust ARIMA (not AIC or BIC based as those procedures assume no outliers and restrict the model form to a list) and assess whether or not an intervention pulse has occurred at the last period. If it has then an exception has been detected ... if not then nothing exceptional in last data point. To do science is to search for repeated patterns. To detect anomalies is to identify values that do not follow repeated patterns. For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways. One learns the rules by observing when the current rules fail. The problem is that you can't catch an outlier without a model (at least a mild one) for your data. Else how would you know that a point violated that model? In fact, the process of growing understanding and finding and examining outliers must be iterative. This isn't a new thought. Bacon, writing in Novum Organum about 400 years ago said: "errors of Nature, sports and monsters correct the understanding in regard to ordinary things, and reveal general forms. For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations; and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways." [ II 29]
