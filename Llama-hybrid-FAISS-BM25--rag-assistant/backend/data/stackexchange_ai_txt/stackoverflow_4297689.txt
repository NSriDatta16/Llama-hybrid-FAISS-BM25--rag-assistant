To expand on Joe's response, the 72-char limit basically allows for bodies to then be quoted, so it gives room for the additional chars added to a line, e.g., From "scratch": > From Joe Bloggs, 24 Sept 1985 > > > Probably some flame about emacs vs vi, eulogising one over the other. > > The quote chars have added four characters to the start of the line, so > > forcing wrapped lines at 72 chars pushes this to 76 chars, without > > affecting the formatting of the paragraph. > > Some rant accusing Joe of talking crap, and throwing out some random > evidence to the contrary. Quote char adds 2 chars. Again, paragraph > formatting retained. Someone else chimes in deciding to eulogise pico over either of the other two editors. All sides about to turn on this person. :-) So giving an extra few chars allows the parapgraph formatting to be retained on 80-character terminals, for at least two levels, and potentially more depending on how the quote characters are added/used.
