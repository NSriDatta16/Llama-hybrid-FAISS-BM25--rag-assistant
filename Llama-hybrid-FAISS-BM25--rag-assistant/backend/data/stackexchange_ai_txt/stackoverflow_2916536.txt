You don't want to have the build agent build to the actual location your site is running from. You need to add script to the end of the build process (tfsbuild.proj file) to take the code from the drop location and move it to the web server. Something like this: '\\testserver.test.lab\Test Lab\MyWebPortal\%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')" ContinueOnError="true" />
