Checking the interpretation of log odds in logistic regression (with multiple variables)

Here's a log odds equation --> 0.8=2.5(Hypertension)+0.3(Gender)+0.06(Age)+15 Please let me know if my interpretation of it is right --> My interpretation: With one unit change in 'Hypertension', log odds of heart disease increases by 2.5 units. Or in other words, a person with hypertension is 2.5 times more likely to get heart disease as compared to a person with no hypertension.
