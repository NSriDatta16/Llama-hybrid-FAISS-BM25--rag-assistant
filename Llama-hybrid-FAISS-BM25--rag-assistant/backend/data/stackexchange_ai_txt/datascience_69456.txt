One possible way to disambiguate multiple meanings for a word is to modify the string literal during training. For bank , the model would learn bank_FINANCE and separately learn bank_RIVER . Creating separate tokens from the string literal is a way to allow the tokens to capture different meanings and disambiguate those separate meanings. This is commonly done for parts-of-speech, excuse can be excuse_NOUN and excuse_VERB . Adding context-specific metadata to disambiguate the meaning of the same string literal would work in a similar way for both word2vec and BERT.
