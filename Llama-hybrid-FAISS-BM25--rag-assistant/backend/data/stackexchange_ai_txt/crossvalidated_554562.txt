Suppose $X$ is mean-centered (you have subtracted the mean of each column) with the columns storing the features and the rows storing the observations. PCA is the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix $\Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1}X^T X$ . There is a deep relationship between PCA and SVD. In fact, you can use SVD to compute PCA. See: Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA? SVD does not require forming $\Sigma$ , and you can use power iteration to compute the singular vector to the largest singular value from $X$ directly. Note that this will work best if the largest singular value is much larger than all other singular values. This is simply a naive approach using tools that you've already outlined. I'm sure there are better ones, perhaps exploiting specific knowledge about $X$ .
