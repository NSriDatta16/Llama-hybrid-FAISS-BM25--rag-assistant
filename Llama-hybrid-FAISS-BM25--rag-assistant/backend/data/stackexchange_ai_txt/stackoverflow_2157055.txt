Yes, you can store documents of VARBINARY(MAX) type (with the FILESTREAM storage attribute) on multiple drives. All you need to do is to partition the table across multiple filestream file groups. Each of these file groups may have a filestream container on a different disk. See here for general information on partitioning: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188730.aspx A great white paper that mentions filestream-specific partitioning: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc949109.aspx
