The first approach (assigning 0 to 5) is not recommended. Because that encoding indicates Network is 5 times than Application, which is not true. Or this encoding imposes additional constraints to the model. In machine learning, people usually use one-hot encoding, which (similar to) your second approach, but many people do not use drop_first=True There is another small issue on one-hot encoding: for a discrete variable has 6 possible values, should we encode with 6 columns or 5 columns? People in statistics community usually encode with 5 columns. Many people in machine learning will use default setting in python, which does not have drop_first=True . If we encode it with 6 columns there are linear dependencies in your design matrix and it will cause some problems in some model. But python usually use regularization on linear model by default, so, it is fine there. Finally want to give you some statistical way of encoding in addition to machine learning way. https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/
