This is all inherently subjective, of course... Yes. There are many open source end user applications. Firefox, GIMP, Inkscape, Open Office, and many many (other) GNOME and KDE apps, for example. You definitely don't need to wait until v1.0, though it might be good to wait until you've got some early proof of concept code to "announce" the project. If you announce an empty code repository you'r unlikely to get contributors, and it may be hard to drum up enthusiasm later. Spotting a GPL violation of an app is probably easier than spotting a GPL violation of a library, on average. If the code is GPL and you have evidence (or strong suspicions) that the GPL was violated you could try contacting gpl-violations.org or the FSF .
