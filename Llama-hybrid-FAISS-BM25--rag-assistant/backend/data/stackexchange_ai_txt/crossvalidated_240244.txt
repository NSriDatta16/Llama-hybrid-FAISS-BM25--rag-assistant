As posed, this question does not actually seem to depend on the periodic nature of the data? If you want to find the actual peaks in your data, typically you would literally just scan the data to find local maxima. (For regularly gridded data in Matlab this can be done with imregionalmax .) A secondary issue related to "finding peaks" is precision. In some cases it may be desirable to refine the discrete local maximum at a sub-grid scale. This can be done by fitting a quadratic to the discrete peak and its neighbors, and computing the peak of the quadratic (assuming it is positive definite ). There are some details related to ensuring a consistent sub-grid peak is identified, which are described in many places (e.g. papers on SIFT ). However, the primary issue is dealing with noise. There are various ways to do this. The simplest is perhaps to smooth the data. This can be done with a Gaussian blur in some cases, but this will tend to change the peak position. Alternative smoothing approaches would be an edge preserving filter (e.g. median filter, medfilt2() in Matlab), or a Savitzky-Golay filter (e.g. a quadratic filter, to combine smoothing & sub-grid refinement in one step). Another simple method is to ignore local maxima below a given relief threshold (e.g. imextendedmax() in Matlab). Aside from using parametric models (e.g. Fourier analysis ), you could apply other constraints based on the quasi-periodic nature of the time series. For example if you apply one of the techniques above to detect local maxima, and similarly for local minima, then you would want to ensure that the subset of these you call "peaks" and "troughs" form an alternating sequence (i.e. one of each per period).
