How do I get average and sum in my cross query?

I have asked before, but still no answer. Is it possible with cross query to do this? (in Access 2007) I have this table: 50 | A1 60 | A1 70 | B1 80 | B1 90 | C1 I need to get this result: A1 B1 C1 sum | avg sum | avg sum | avg 55 | 110 75 | 130 90 | 90 I try to write this: TRANSFORM Sum(Worki.Value) AS XXsum SELECT Worki.Name AS Name, Worki.Tdate AS Tdate, Worki.ID AS ID FROM Worki GROUP BY Worki.Name, Worki.Tdate, Worki.IDPIVOT Worki.Trit How can I get the average and the sum?
