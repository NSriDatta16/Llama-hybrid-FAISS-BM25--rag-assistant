These approaches should be supervised approached , must need training data. So I think you'd like to mention if the model needs normal data or anormal data. This is tricky problem. In classification method like SVM, it outputs anormal or not by training normal and anormal data. In the other hand, prediction method like LSTM normally is trained by normal data. Then comparing the prediction from normal data and anormal data by LSTM. Now you get error of prediction and actual data. Error:Normal data Error:Anormal data For separating anormal and normal data, Some theory is need like threshold. The threshold should be calculated by error on both data . (You might need feature engineering.) It means LSTM may need anormal and normal data. So you have to check which data will be needed in whole process. Majority of statistical and machine learning method can be used in anormaly detection. Point is which feature represent anomaly behavior , which model can fit its behavior.
