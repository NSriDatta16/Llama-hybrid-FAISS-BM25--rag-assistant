today I read an article on neural networks. It explains how it's possible to create a sort of artificial brain which can learn. It's awesome! I think cleverbot could be based on this kind of mechanism.. Look these two discussion (M = me, C = cleverbot): 1) M: so you haven't a fixed alghoritm right? C: No, I haven't. M: do you know what's supervised learning? C: Physics material? M: no.. why it's called learning otherwise? C: Heh. Fair point. So, what is your favourite type of cheese? M: red? yours? C: Rain is not a type of horse. M: but i saw it yesterday.. C: Did you like it? M: it doesn't exist! C: Do you exist though? M: me..? C: Yes, you. M: to be, or not to be? C: That is a thought. M: whose? C: The horse 2) C: Who are you? M: i'm who i am and i'm not who i am not.. C: What are you then? M: did you expect that answer didn't you? C: I didn't. M: didn't what? C: I didn't telling you a joke. M: so.. am i really death?! C: Can you hear yourself type? M: no... i'm listenning to music, and i'm deaf C: I thought you were a mute? M: no, i hear me when i'm talking C: Really??? M: yes, even if i'm deaf.. C: Are you really a robot? I don't think so. It gets really confused when I change subject, you see? That's why during its learning process it never saw a pattern matching my speech, so the answer it gives is the one that matches the most similar pattern it saw before. However it's amazing, I swear I never thought this kind of things could be possible, a computer that learns from its past experience still sounds sci-fi to me!!!
