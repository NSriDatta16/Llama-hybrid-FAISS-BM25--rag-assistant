A couple of points that might help (I'm assuming that this is homework, so this has a pedagogical structure): You are going to need to stick the data somewhere while you're accumulating it. And since you don't know how much is coming, dynamic allocation is going to be necessary. Lots of choices here: dynamic arrays, linked lists, hash tables, etc. ad nauseum ... Pick one that will work for you (see below). Once you've got it, you're going to need to sort it. Or , you could store it sorted in the first place. Do you happen to know a data structure that can manage that? Once it is sorted, you just spit it out the other end. Easy, no? Apropos the comment: Do you have K&R? Or some other basic text on c or c++ ? You'll want one. And you want to pick one language or the other and stick with it. If you are used to OO programing in another context use c++ . If you don't know either, use c++ . If you're using c++, the STL container will take care of the dynamic storage for you. The simplest thing would be to use a std::vector (using the size from the command line argument), and invoke the sort on it. Other people have pointed out that you need to do binary IO. This is important, because neither your input nor your output are structured like text IO.
