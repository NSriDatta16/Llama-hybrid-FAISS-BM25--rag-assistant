How to Interpret scatter plot for binary response?

I have come to know about scatterplot matrices, where pairwise scatterplots for covariates are built and then binary responses are jittered. This plot is helpful to give an idea about how each covariate has an effect on the response without fitting a logistic regression. But I actually don't understand the plot really. Here is the code that gives this type of plot: library(MASS) library("ggplot2") train $type type)-1L library(GGally) pairs(subset(train, select= - c(type)), col = as.factor(train$type)) The red dots are maybe the points where the response is 1. How can I interpret this plot below?
