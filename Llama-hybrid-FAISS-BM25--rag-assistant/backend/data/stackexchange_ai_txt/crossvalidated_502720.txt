R fitted() function applied to rbart (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees w/ random effects) object in the dbarts package

I'm having a hard time figuring out what the output of fitted() applied to a rbart object means. Specifically, I fit my data using the rbart_vi() function in the R package dbarts , and I'm trying to understand what fitted(rbartFit) returns. The documentation says it returns the "posterior mean of a predicted quantity". Can someone please explain what this means and how it is calculated? I don't have much background in either Bayesian stats or machine learning so am spending a lot of time figuring out but with very little progress :( Thanks!!
