The "at least 30" rule is addressed in another posting on Cross Validated. It's a rule of thumb, at best. When you think of a sample that's supposed to represent millions of people, you're going to have to have a much larger sample than just 30. Intuitively, 30 people can't even include one person from each state! Then think that you want to represent Republicans, Democrats, and Independents (at least), and for each of those you'll want to represent a couple of different age categories, and for each of those a couple of different income categories. With only 30 people called, you're going to miss huge swaths of the demographics you need to sample. EDIT2: [I've removed the paragraph that abaumann and StasK objected to. I'm still not 100% persuaded, but especially StasK's argument I can't disagree with.] If the 30 people are truly selected completely at random from among all eligible voters, the sample would be valid in some sense, but too small to let you distinguish whether the answer to your question was actually true or false (among all eligible voters). StasK explains how bad it would be in his third comment, below. EDIT: In reply to samplesize999's comment, there is a formal method for determining how large is large enough, called " power analysis ", which is also described here . abaumann's comment illustrates how there is a tradeoff between your ability to distinguish differences and the amount of data you need to make a certain amount of improvement. As he illustrates, there's a square root in the calculation, which means the benefit (in terms of increased power) grows more and more slowly, or the cost (in terms of how many more samples you need) grows increasingly rapidly, so you want enough samples, but not more.
