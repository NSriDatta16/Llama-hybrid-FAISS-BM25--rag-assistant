How to predict one variable depending upon two other variable in Random Forest?

Instead of modeling the function as an ARIMA process, I am trying to use random forests and gradient boosting as regression techniques. In the problem setup, the predictors are t_2, and t_1 and the predicted variable is t. Using the period between January 1974 and December 1978 as a training set, and using 1979 as a test set. I am trying to make a Random Forest model in R, but I am stuck at the below part, where I am getting No. of variables tried at each split: 1 and sometimes OOB is 100%. Could anyone please help me out? Thanks In advance library(randomForest) library(caret) library(e1071) library(ranger) #converting ldeath timeseries to vector ldeathsVector
