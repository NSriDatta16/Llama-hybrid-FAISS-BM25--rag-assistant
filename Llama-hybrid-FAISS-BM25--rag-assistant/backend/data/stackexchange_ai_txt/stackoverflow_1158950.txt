Voice Alteration Algorithm

Could somebody point me to a voice alteration algorithm? Preferably in Java or C? Something that I could use to change a stream of recorded vocals into something that sounds like Optimus Prime. (FYI- Optimus Prime is the lead Autobot from transformers with a very distinctive sounding voice... not everybody may know this.) Is there an open source solution?
