If you absolutely need an xls file (instead of just csv), the FileHelpers library makes it easy to write an xls file. FileHelpers takes a strongly typed class and writes it as a csv or xls, or can connect directly to a SQL server and save records there. Basically, you'd have something like: public class Record { public string filename; public string storedProc; } You could use Robert Harvey's code or a regex to extract the path and procedure names, create a new Record , and drop them in the new object. Record r = new Record(); r.filename = myString.Substring(0, myString.IndexOf(".cs"),3); r.storedProc= myString.Substring(myString.IndexOf("proc_")).Substring(0, temp.IndexOf('\"')); You can then use the ExcelStorage class to save the file.
