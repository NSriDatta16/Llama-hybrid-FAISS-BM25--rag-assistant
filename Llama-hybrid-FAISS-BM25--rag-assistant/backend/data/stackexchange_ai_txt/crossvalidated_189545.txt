For a Bayesian, $$ p(y|x) = \int p(y|\theta)p(\theta|x) d\theta $$ where we are using the usual posterior for $\theta$ given $x$, i.e. $$ p(\theta|x) \propto p(x|\theta)p(\theta).$$ For "Describe the maximum likelihood approach ...", we could use $p(y|\hat{\theta}_{mle})$ where $$ \hat{\theta}_{mle} = \sup_{\theta} p(x|\theta) $$ but this does not account for our uncertainty about $\theta$. I know of no way to properly account for this uncertainty in a frequentist paradigm (this doesn't mean it doesn't exist just that I don't know what it is).
