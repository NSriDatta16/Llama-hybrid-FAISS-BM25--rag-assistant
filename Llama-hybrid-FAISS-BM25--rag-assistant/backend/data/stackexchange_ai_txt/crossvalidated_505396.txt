There is a whole discussion about using bootstrap in time series data. In dynamic models like GARCH you associate today's volatility with yesterday's and so on. When you sample with replacement the ordering collapses and you usually end up with data having roughly the same moments with the original but different dynamic characteristics. In time series analysis one is advised to use a different technique called block-bootstrap ( https://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/35143/6/51007106.pdf ). In very plain terms you divide your data in blocks (optimal block size is also debated) and you sample those blocks with replacement, just as in the simple bootstrap case. In this way most of the ordering is reserved and thus the simulated series retain the majority of the characteristics of the original data.
