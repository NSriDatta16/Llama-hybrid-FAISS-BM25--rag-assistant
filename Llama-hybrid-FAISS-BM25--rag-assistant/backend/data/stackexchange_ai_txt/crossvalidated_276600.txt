Let $X_1$ be the indicator of group 1, and $X_2$ be hair cortisol levels. $Y$ be working memory. The model will be as following: $Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 +\beta_3X_2^2 +\beta_4X_1X_2+\beta_5X_1X_2^2 + \epsilon $ If $E(Y|X_2)$ and $\log(X_2)$ have better linear relation for given group, then transform it. Otherwise, do not. You can delete the non-significant terms step by step. Replace $Y$ with inhibition control and attention shifting, fit other two models. Do not use bootstrapping because of small sample size. Bootstrapping is used for some difficult situations, but cannot increase the sample size. Theoretically, you can add other factors such as gender into the model. But given the sample size is 32, I would not do it if I analyze these data. Example of not using bootstrapping: When you estimate the mean from a sample following normal distribution, then sample mean +/- t * SE is the best regardless the sample size. If you perform bootstrapping with 1,000,000 replica, you may get the same result. Example of using bootstrapping: You find a way to estimate parameter u with statistic T, but you cannot derive the variance of T mathematically, and of course you cannot estimate the variance of T from sample. Under this situation, bootstrapping can be used to estimate the variance of T.
