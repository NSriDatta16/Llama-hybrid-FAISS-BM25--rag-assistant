Once your if statements start becoming big and nested, one of the possiblities may be that the number of conditions you have to test has grown. In that case, as you add more conditions to the situation it starts becoming exponentially easier to let some combination of conditions fall through the cracks, and then bam, you've got yourself a bug. I always thought in cases like these, some kind of truth table would be good. About the closest approximation I can come up though ends up being kind of baffling to the average programmer. It involves assembling all your conditions into a single integer, and then trying to cover every number in the range that creates with either a switch statement or a lookup table. I'm not sure polymorphism is the right answer for this one though. Anyone got any better ideas?
