I found an essay ( How Not To Sort By Average Rating ) which argues that you should compute a 95% confidence interval for the true fraction of people who would vote positively, and then sort ratings by the lower end of the confidence interval. This is an interesting approach. It is hard for me to judge whether this is in some sense the "right" way to do it, but it seems to behave better than some of the more naive alternatives. Worth noting: @raegtin gives a cogent criticism of this approach, in his answer to a related question . The short version of the criticism is that using the lower limit of a confidence interval pushes items with few ratings towards a very low rating, where it's probably better to push them towards the average rating over all items (as Bayesian rating does).
