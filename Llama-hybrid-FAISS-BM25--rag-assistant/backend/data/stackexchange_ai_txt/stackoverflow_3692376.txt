A few things.. 1) ItemRenderers should always be cached [and reused]. This is one of the benefits of using a Flex list in the first place. I suspect your itemRenderer is implemented inorrectly as to not change when it's data changes. If you share some code for this it would be helpful. But, basically, your itemRenderer should listen to the dataChange event and when the data changes you should update the component's visual display with new data. 2) In Flex 3, I'd have sworn that dragging an item from one list to another automatically updated the relevant dataProviders. Are you sure you need to write manual code to make those changes? You will, though, need code to update your backend as relevant.
