You want to take the page title, and create a unique url slug for it, then you want to be able to load the content from the database based on the url slug (using the url slug as the id, rather than an actual database id). public ActionResult Index(string UrlSlug) { // Get Content For Page {UrlSlug} } So your route would be /Pages/{UrlSlug} and a sample would be /Pages/Links. Then your Index action on your PagesController would pull off the url slug (Links) and load the appropriate content from storage, and render the content inside your master layout. I think you were thinking along these lines, just make sure when the user adds a page, you create a unique url for it. Replace spaces with underscores, remove special characters, etc to create a url safe key to use to load the page information when it is requested.
