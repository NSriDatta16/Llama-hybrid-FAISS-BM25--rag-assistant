For Java I recommend Algorithms in Java, Parts 1-4 by Robert Sedgewick . And the companion book Algorithms in Java, Part 5: Graph Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick . For general studies I also have the Introductions to Algorithms books, it is a good general reference. This Algorithms, Fourth Edition by Robert Sedgewick looks good as well, but probably covers a lot of stuff already in the previously mentioned books. For Clojure, you will probably need to get a Functional based Algorithm book. Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design looks like it might be a good companion to a the more general procedural books.
