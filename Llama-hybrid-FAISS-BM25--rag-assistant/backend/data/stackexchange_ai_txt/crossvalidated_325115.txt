Bayesian improper prior on product of parameters

I'm interested in two sets of variables coming from bivariate normal distribution. $X_i$ 's iid ~ N( $\mu_x$ , $\sigma^2$ ) $Y_i$ 's iid ~ N( $\mu_y$ , $\sigma^2$ ) and Cov(Xi,Yi)= $\sigma_{xy}^2$ . Now $\mu_x$ = $\mu$ + $\gamma$ and $\mu_y$ = $\mu$ + $\lambda$ * $\gamma$ . In this case, can I use prior on only one of the parameters of $\mu$ 's? That is, can I use prior on $\lambda ~ \text{Uniform}(a,b)$ and obtain posterior distribution of $\lambda |X,Y$ ? (Updated) If I have to impose prior to all parameters. Can I impose a constant prior to $\mu$ and $\gamma$ ? Will my choice of constant affect the posterior distribution of $\lambda$ significantly? (Or maybe very large uniform prior on $\mu$ and $\gamma$ as well?)
