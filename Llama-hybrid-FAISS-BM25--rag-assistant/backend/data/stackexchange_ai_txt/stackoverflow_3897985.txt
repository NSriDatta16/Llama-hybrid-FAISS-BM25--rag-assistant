I was able to figure out a short cut: LoginName loginName = HeadLoginView.FindControl("HeadLoginName") as LoginName; if (loginName != null && session != null) { loginName.FormatString = "Full Name"; } This finds the LoginName control within the LoginView, then hijacks the value by setting FormatString. I wish there was a more elegant way of doing this. If anyone knows, please send it my way.
