What’s the XPath equivalent to the CSS selector [attr^=]?

In CSS selectors, you can select an element with an attribute who’s value starts with a string. E.g. both of these paragraphs can be selected using this selector: p[class^=geoff] Is there an equivalent in XPath? I know how to select based on the complete value of an attribute, i.e. //p[@class='geoff'] Can you select based on the start of the attribute’s value in XPath?
