To determine whether the results seem to indicate some shenanigans were afoot, we can test it! To begin, we need to specify what our null hypothesis is. I'll take the moment here to stress (as subsequent answers have pointed out in more detail) the importance of forming hypotheses before seeing the data we will use for testing this hypothesis. For example you observed that odd and lower-valued numbers appear more often, but our hypothesis should be formed prior to seeing the data. As such, it would be wrong to look at the data, note that odd numbers appear more often in the data, and then test that hypothesis based on the same data (as @Him points out, it's certainly reasonable to collect new data to test this hypothesis). Based on your writing, it seems like past data has made you believe that inconsistencies may be occurring, so a natural test would be whether the draws are from a (discrete) uniform distribution (the null hypothesis), or whether the draws are from some other distribution which would thus indicating bias towards certain numbers (the alternative hypothesis). A simple test of this hypothesis is a chi square test . Under the null hypothesis, each number has an equal chance of being drawn (i.e. for each draw, there is a $1/12$ chance that any given number is drawn -- subsequent answers have also shown how a chi square test can be used with different hypothesis such as odd/even difference). Under our null, we can calculate how many draws each number should have had by multiplying $1/12$ by the total number of draws for each number. The test essentially measures by how much the observed draws differ from the expected number of draws under the null. Using your observed numbers and performing this test (see code below), we find that the p-value is $p = 0.71$ , and thus we fail to reject the null that the draws came from a fair process. Thus, we cannot conclude that the draws came from a biased sampling process. >obs = c(23,18,21,15,24,17,20,16,21,13,19,13) >p = rep(1/length(obs),length(obs)) >chisq.test(obs,p=p) Chi-squared test for given probabilities data: obs X-squared = 8, df = 11, p-value = 0.7133 As for the second part of the question, suppose we did conclude the draws came from unequal probabilities (which we did not). There are tons of plausible explanations for why this may be. To list two: A hustler with enough skill could probably easily make the process seem fair when it is not, either by cranking the machine in a consistent way that ensures the numbers that started at the bottom end at the bottom after they are done turning the lever, or by simply following the balls while he cranks it. You say it was from a real lottery, but did you actually observe this process? If not, then it's easy to say these were due to a fair lottery even if they were not.
