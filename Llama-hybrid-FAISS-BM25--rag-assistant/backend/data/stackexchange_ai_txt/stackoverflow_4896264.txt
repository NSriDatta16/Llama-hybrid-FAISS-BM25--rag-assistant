Fatal error: PDOException SQLSTATE[28000] [1045] Access denied

I'm trying to install a PHP application that was coded by another guy that I can't contact and he used PDO. I'm getting a lot of problems to run this code. In some areas, MySQL connects well because PDO is not used (this shows that the username and password are right), but in others it throws this exception: Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[28000] [1045] Access denied for user 'www-data'@'localhost' (using password: NO)' in /var/www/x/include/SPDO.php:14 Stack trace: #0 /var/www/x/include/SPDO.php(14): PDO->__construct('mysql:host=;dbn...', NULL, NULL) #1 /var/www/x/include/SPDO.php(22): SPDO->__construct() #2 /var/www/x/include/class_Projecte.php(55): SPDO::singleton() #3 /var/www/x/dades_proj_edit.php(116): Project->__construct() #4 {main} thrown in /var/www/x/include/SPDO.php on line 14 I don't understand why is trying to look the user www-data . I looked in Google and found a lot of problems with this error, but from a CMS like Magento and nothing that can help me.
