Alternate Solution: There is another method that uses the parameters of the prior beta distribution and adds them to the success and trials of the likelihood. This example considers batting averages Understanding empirical Bayes estimation . In the cited example the parameters for the beta distribution are estimated from all the data . Those estimated parameters are then added to the observed results. Which gives an approximation of the expected value of beta given the likelihood and the prior: $$ \begin{align} S=\ \text{observed success},\ N=\ \text{trials}&, \alpha=\ \text{prior success}, \beta=\ \text{failures from prior}\\ prob(\theta)=&\frac{s + \alpha}{n + \alpha + \beta} \end{align} $$ For the use case in a grid approximation the calculation is repeated at each step in the grid. However, the magnitude of the prior is still much greater than the likelihood, the scale factor is applied to the parameters $\alpha$ , $\beta$ . The resulting distribution is very similar to the original solution (figure: Esitmated posterior, red x): It is still unclear to me how to do this without creating a hierarcichal model. For this initial use case the rationale seems clear: The influence of the prior on the likelihood should be a compromise. Scaling the parameters of the prior to the likelihood is one way to equalize the effect of one on the other. This does have the benefit of simplicity and ease of implementation.
