DragDrop - DragEnter/DragLeave Events keep firing

I have a drag/drop operation on a Canvas that is supposed to do something when an object gets dragged into and out of it. My problem is that the DragEnter/DragLeave events keeps firing as the mouse moves the object over it, not just on enter/exit. The faster the mouse is moving, the more frequently the events fire. The Canvas DragOver Event moves the Canvas.Top/Left of the DraggedObject and I think that might be my problem, but I am not sure how I would fix this.
