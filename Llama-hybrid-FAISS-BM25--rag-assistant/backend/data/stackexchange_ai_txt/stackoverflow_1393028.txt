Using "GetThreadTimes"? If you measure the time between calls to "GetThreadTimes" and store the previous user and/or kernel times then you know how much time the thread has had since you last checked. You also know how much time has elapsed in the mean time and thus you can work out how much CPU time was used. It would be best (for timer resolution reasons) to make this check every second or so and work out its average CPU usage over that second.
