The (unrotated) eigenvalues in factor analysis do not explain portions of total variance, they explain portions of common variance (i.e. variance not unique to each variable). These SPSS labels "Extraction Sums of Squared Loadings." The "Eigenvalues" in the first column result from an eigendecomposition of the correlation matrix: so these are eigenvalues from a PCA. The former will always be smaller than the latter.
