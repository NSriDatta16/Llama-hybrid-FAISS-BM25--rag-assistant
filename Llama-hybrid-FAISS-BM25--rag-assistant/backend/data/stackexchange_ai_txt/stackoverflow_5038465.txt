Good summary from rsp. Without knowing more about your requirements, it's hard to say which one is better suited for your use case. One clear advantage that SQLite provides is that is has simpler installation and administration. As a library, it's linked into your application and installed along with your application. No separate database to install and configure. This is one of the features that makes database libraries, like SQLite and Berkeley DB very attractive, and possibly preferable to database servers. Just to add to your list of considerations, Berkeley DB and Berkeley DB Java Edition are also database libraries that you may want to consider. Berkeley DB (written in C) offers you the choice of using a schema-free key-value pair API, a POJO-like Java API or a SQLite-compatible SQL API. Berkeley DB Java Edition (100% Java) offers you Java APIs for key-value pairs, Java Collections or POJO-like object persistence. Berkeley DB and SQLite tend to be the products of choice for people who are looking for embedding data management functionality inside of their application. Disclaimer: I am the Product Manager for Berkeley DB, so I'm a little biased. :-)
