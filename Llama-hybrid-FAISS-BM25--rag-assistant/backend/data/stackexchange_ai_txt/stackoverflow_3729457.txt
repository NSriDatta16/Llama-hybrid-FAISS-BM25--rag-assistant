jquery/javascript How to add image on top of column header

I am implementing a column re-ordering functionality for a grid. When I drag the column, I want to have an arrow in between column headers to give the user a feedback of where the new column would be placed. SOmething that we have in tab re-ordering in firefox. How do I add this image in between and on top of two column headers. Can I create a div or something dynamically and add image to it while I am dragging ?
