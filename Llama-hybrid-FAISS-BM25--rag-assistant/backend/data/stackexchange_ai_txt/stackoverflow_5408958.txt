Just on a whim I decided to change the user-agent of the the flex browser to the one used by Chrome and viola! - it works. Apparently .net or MVC 3 doesn't like flex's userAgent string and decides to muck up the url. It is probably trying to set cookieless sessions or something (which my application isn't set up for). So here is my new, working user-agent string: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/11.0.696.16 Safari/534.24
