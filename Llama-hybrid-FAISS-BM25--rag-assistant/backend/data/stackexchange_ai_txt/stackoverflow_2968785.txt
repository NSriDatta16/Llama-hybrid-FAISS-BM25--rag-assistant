It's because the one-of randomly chooses one of its arguments and returns that one. neighbors4 returns an agentset with 4 patches (the ones N,S,E, and W of the turtle's patch). Thus, one-of neighbors4 will randomly choose from among these 4, so it might return a different value each time you call it.
