If you want the entire structure to be serializable, then you'll need to make the parts serialiable as well. What this means in practice is that you need to make your Dragon, Hero, and Item classes implement Serializable. It's just a marker interface, so you only need to add implements Serializable . Some ides (at least eclipse, anyway) may complain that you should add a private long SerialVersionUID which may or may not optimize the serialization a bit - in any case it's not strictly necessary. This requirement is recursive - any of their subparts that are custom or non-serializable objects have to be taken care of as well, so for example if your Item class looks like this public class Item implements Serializable { private String s; private MyClass c; .. then you'll also need to make MyClass Serializable, any of it's instance variables, etc etc.
