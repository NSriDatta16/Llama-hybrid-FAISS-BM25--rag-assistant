Why does second component have to be orthogonal to the first component in PCA?

PCA is done through series of orthogonal rotation. My impression of PCA precedure is: First component is on the direction of largest variance and second component is on the orthogonal direction to the first direction. Then the third component is found through another round of orthogonal rotation. What make the second largest variance has to be on the orthogonal direction to the first component?
