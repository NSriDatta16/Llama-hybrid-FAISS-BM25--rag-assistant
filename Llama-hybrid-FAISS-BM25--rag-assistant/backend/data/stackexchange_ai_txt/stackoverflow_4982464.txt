mass action in restful ways with rails?

what is your idea of mass action still sticking with rails restful out of the box methods? like a mass delete. I was tempted to create a mass_delete method already on my controller can't seem to wrap my head around if there's any existing or more elegant way to handle mass actions. just shopping for ideas. thanks.
