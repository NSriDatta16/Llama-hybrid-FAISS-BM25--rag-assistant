Convolutional neural networks are suitable for detecting objects in your computer game application. The only problem is that you cannot probably use the pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet, etc. which are trained on the real life images from ImageNet (or you can only use the first layers ). You should probably train your own CNN from scratch or try to find a pre-trained model which are trained on the images which are similar to your images. Anyway, you can test the existing pre-trained models such as VGG and try to fine-tune their higher layers based on your images and evaluate their performance in your application.
