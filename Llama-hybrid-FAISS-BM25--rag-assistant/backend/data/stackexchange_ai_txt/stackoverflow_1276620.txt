You only have the two already mentioned Options. 1.) If your changes can benefit the community then give back and hopefully it will become Part of the next release. 2.) If your changes are to specific and fit only your needs than your only chance to stay organized is setting up your own VCS (e.g. Subversion) and learn to use it properly.. ;) There are some good infos on using Subversion with drupal on the Drupal.org site. There is also a new Module available that allow you to capture some features into your own modules (e.g. features ( http://drupal.org/project/features )). I have not much experience with it but maybe this is also a solution for you.
