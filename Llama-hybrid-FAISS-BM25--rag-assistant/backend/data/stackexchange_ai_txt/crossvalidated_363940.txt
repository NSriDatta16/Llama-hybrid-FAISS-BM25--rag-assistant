I think the basic problem you're facing is that you are asking your random forest to predict Location + Temperature , i.e. a compound of two variables. This is not a standard random forest; the problem is a multivariate random forest. I don't think the randomForest package can perform those. There is, however, a MultivariateRandomForest package that can do exactly what you're after. If you want to learn more about multivariate random forests, Segal & Xiao (2011) seems like the place to start. Segal, M., & Xiao, Y. (2011). Multivariate random forests. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 1(1), 80-87.
