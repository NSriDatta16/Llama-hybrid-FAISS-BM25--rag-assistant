Lost RPC connection to remote Agent error with Oracle connected to Informix

I am having a problem with a simple data importer / updater that takes data from Informix, inserts it into a table in Oracle, and updates a flag in the original table. The set up is this Pro*C program calls a PL/SQL procedure The procedure opens a cursor on Informix, loops through each row insert the data into an oracle table commit update the "new data" flag in Informix (i.e. stop a re-import) commit The two commits are necessary to stop a particular Oracle error (I forget which one, but it is because the tables being updated are in two databases and a single commit can't handle it). This code works fine for a small number of records (5-10) in the source table, but falls over when there are > 1000. The alert log in the Oracle log directory shows an error "Lost RPC connection to remote Agent". There is no corresponding error in the Informix directory, so I suspect the driver is at fault. We are using Oracle 10.2 with the unixODBC driver on Red hat. Does anyone have any ideas for a workaround or indeed how to fix it? There does not seem to be any useful information about this error message - most pages just say something along the lines of "It's not an Oracle problem".
