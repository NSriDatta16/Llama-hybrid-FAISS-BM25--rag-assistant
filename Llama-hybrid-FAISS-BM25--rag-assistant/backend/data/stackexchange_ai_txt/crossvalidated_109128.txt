K-means doesn't have a limitation of two features. Actually you should work in the original space to get better results. If you just want to visualise your dataset indeed you can go for PCA or many of other similar methods. I prefer classic multidimensional scaling (cmdscale in R). It requires first computing the similarities of your documents in a NxN matrix. Then it is straight forward projecting the documents on a 2D plane with respect to their relative distances.
