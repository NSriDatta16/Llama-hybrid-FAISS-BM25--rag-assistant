How can I use two different datasets as a training model for svm

I know that you're supposed to scale your test data using the parameters (mean and stdev) from your training data. This is relatively simple; but what if the number of samples is limited in one training data set (e.g. Set A = 5 samples) so I want to combine two data sets (i.e. Set A + Set B = 10 samples) to have enough samples for training, what can I do so that I can scale/normalize the two sets into one and then use those parameters on my test set? If I scale them individually I will have 2 means and 2 stdev. The context is I'm trying to combine two microarray expression from two different microarray platform so their expression ranges are different. Thank you for your help in advance
