binomial mixed model random effects structure

I am having difficulty with the structure of a binomial mixed effects model. I'm using brms, but my question is more about model design than bayesian modeling so I hope to get some good insights from the broader audience here. Briefly, I have a list of ~200 individuals that have been tested in each of 15 conditions, with a binary response (T/F) in each condition. Each of the conditions falls into one of three groups, although unevenly (3 conditions in group A, 9 conditions in group B, 3 conditions in group C). I want to test whether there is evidence for differences between the three groups. The current structure of my model is: response ~ group + (1|condition) + (1|ID) and the code, for those interested in the specific brms model: bern_prior When I use this model structure, however, differences between this model and the null model (i.e. response ~1 + (1|condition) + (1|ID) ) are negligible (weighted AIC values are almost identical). Before I conclude there really is no difference among groups, I wanted to ask: is it possible I overdid the random effects by including (1|condition)?
