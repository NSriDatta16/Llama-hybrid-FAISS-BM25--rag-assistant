Distributional forecast for $X_{t+1}$ in GARCH(1,1) with residuals student t distributed

Let's say I have time series of $n$ (simulated) data from the GARCH(1,1) process: $$X_{t+1,n} = \sigma_{t+1,n}(...)*Z_{t+1,n}$$ where $Z_{t,n}$ is iid student t-distributed with $v$ degree of freedom. I want to create a distributional forecast for $X_{t+1,n}$. When working with $Z$ normally distributed I simply let $X_{t+1,n}$ have the conditional distribution: $N(0,\sigma_{t,n}^2)$. Is it different when the distribution of $Z$ is student-t? In general, how do I create distributional forecast for $X_{t+1,n}$ when $(X_{1,n},...X_{t,n},\sigma_{1,n},...,\sigma_{t,n}$) is known? (my purpose is application so a theoretical derivation is not necessary)
