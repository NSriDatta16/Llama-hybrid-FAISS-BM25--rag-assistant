Measures of goodness-of-fit using multiply imputed data in Zelig

I am running a logistic regression model in R using multiply imputed data created using Amelia II, which I am then analyzing using Zelig. I would like to be able to report some measures of goodness-of-fit (e.g. likelihood ratio, pseudo R-squared, Hosmer-Lemeshow), however none are provided in the default Zelig output and I haven't been able to figure out a way to extract any from the zelig() object. Do measures of goodness-of-fit need to be calculated differently when using multiply imputed datasets? Are there any R packages that are able to do this? I have looked into several packages that provide measures of goodness-of-fit, such as pscl, however they only work on glm objects, not MI objects created when using Amelia and Zelig. Thanks in advance for your help!
