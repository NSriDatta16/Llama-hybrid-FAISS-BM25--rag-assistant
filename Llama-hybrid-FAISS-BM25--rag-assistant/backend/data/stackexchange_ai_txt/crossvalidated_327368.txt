If your overlapping clusters reflect a heavy-tailed distribution (as jbowman showed), a possible solution would be to use heavy-tailed distributions for your mixture components instead of Gaussians. For example, student T mixture models might be appropriate. Here are some relevant papers: Peel and McLachlan (2000) . Robust mixture modelling using the t distribution. Svensen and Bishop (2005) . Robust Bayesian Mixture Modelling. Archambeau and Verleysen (2007) . Robust Bayesian clustering.
