Brute force calculation This code takes a few seconds on my laptop total = 0 pb output: 0.2677479 But still it might be interesting to find a more direct method in case you wish to do lots of these calculations or use higher values, or just for the sake of getting a more elegant method. At least this computation gives a simplistically calculated, but valid, number to check other (more complicated) methods.
