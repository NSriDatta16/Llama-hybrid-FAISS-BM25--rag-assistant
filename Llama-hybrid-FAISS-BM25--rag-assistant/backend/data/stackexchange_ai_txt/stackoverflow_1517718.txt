VB.NET project upgrade VS2005 to VS2008

I have a VB.NET 2.0 project developed using VS2005 Free Edition and I am considering to upgrade it to VS2008 FE, mainly because I have problems once per year, whenever my Temporary Certificate expires . I was wondering if you can point to some resources describing in what parts of the code I should pay attention after the upgrade. My project uses only two external components ( zipforge and objectlistview ) and I am not using any databases, in case this information is of any use to your answers.
