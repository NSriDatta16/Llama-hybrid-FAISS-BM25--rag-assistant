You haven't described any mechanism by which individuals were randomly assigned to groups. As written this is not a random allocation. Also, you don't mention how recruitment took place. Paying attention balance in design can make analysis easier, but if your goal is to make unbiased inferences about the population(s) from which your subjects were drawn you also need to a) sample randomly from the target population(s) and b) randomly allocate subjects from the sample to groups (possibly stratified by academic background and sex). There is a thread here that offers suggestions of books that may help.
