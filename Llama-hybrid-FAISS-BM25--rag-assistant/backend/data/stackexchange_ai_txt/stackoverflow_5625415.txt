I realize that you're not asking a question, but I thought I'd share the way I prefer to do this. See http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/08/28/nhibernate-tips-amp-tricks-efficiently-selecting-a-tree.aspx return session.CreateCriteria () .SetFetchMode("Children", FetchMode.Join) .SetResultTransformer(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()) .List (); I don't know if this accomplishes everything that you intended to accomplish with your approach, but I've found it to be a very useful tool when dealing with hierarchical data.
