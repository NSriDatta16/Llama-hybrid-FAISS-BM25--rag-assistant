I often use behavior/capability detection. Directly check whether the browser supports functionality before working around it, instead of working around it based on what might be the browser's name (user-agent). A problem with browser-specific workarounds, is you don't know if the bug has been fixed or if the feature is supported now. When you do capability detection, you know the browser does or doesn't support it directly, and you're not just being browser-ist. http://diveintohtml5.ep.io/everything.html
