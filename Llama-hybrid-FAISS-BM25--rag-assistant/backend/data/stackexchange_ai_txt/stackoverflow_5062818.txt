Unfortunately, there is no extension point for you to extend for this functionality. I recommend that you stop trying to muck around with the Eclipse Command Framework. The JavaEditor does not use that framework to register its commands, and instead, registers commands when the editor is opened. And there is no easy way for third parties to extend/change this. The action that gets run when F3 is pressed is the org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.OpenAction . Although there is no easy way to extend or change the JavaEditor, there are ways to do this. The one way that I recommend for your situation is through Equinox Aspects (http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/incubator/aspects/). This allows you to use AspectJ to weave into Eclipse and make changes where you require. This is how AJDT (http://eclipse.org/ajdt) is able to alter the way JDT works. In your particular situation, I'd recommend creating a pointcut that targets the instantiation of the OpenAction class and replace it with an implementation that you create. It delegates to JDT's implementation normally, or it runs your command when you require it. If this is the kind of solution that you are looking for, then I can expand on exactly how to do this.
