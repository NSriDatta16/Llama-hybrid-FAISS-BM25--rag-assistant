Knowledge of statistics To be a data scientist

I am an undergraduate student pursuing my BSc in Maths. I have taken statistics classes in first year. I want to know how much statistics do I need to know to get a decent place in the data science world? Also, please do provide me with suggestions where to begin if I start my preparation now.
