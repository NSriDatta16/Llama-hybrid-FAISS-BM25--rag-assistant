Pthreads and mutexes; locking part of an array

I am trying to parallelize an operation using pthreads. The process looks something like: double* doSomething( .... ) { double* foo; foo = new double[220]; for(i = 0; i The stuff happening inside the for-loop can be done in any order, so I want to organize this using threads. For instance, I could use a number of threads such that each thread goes through parts of the for-loop, but works on different parts of the array. To avoid trouble when working on overlapping parts, i need to lock some memory. How can I make a mutex (or something else) that locks only part of the array?
