For time series, is non stationary an issue for machine learning models like they are for traditional time series models like ARIMA?

Sorry if the question seems basic. I understand that non stationary data is a big issue for traditional time series forecasting methods like ARIMA and VAR but is it the same for machine learning methods like XGBoost and neural networks? Meaning to say, do I have to do differencing on the y variable for machine learning methods like I do for ARIMA?
