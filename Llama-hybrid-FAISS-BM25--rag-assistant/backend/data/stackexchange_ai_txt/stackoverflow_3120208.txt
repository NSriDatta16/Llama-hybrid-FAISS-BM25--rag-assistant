Regarding #1 - The correct way to do it is to not store the passwords at all. Instead, store a salted hash of the password. As for safely identifying users without asking for their passwords, that's a bit of an intractable problem. Anything you might use to identify them in essence becomes another password (with the same storage problems as the first one). Practically speaking, most services would use some other bit of personal information - last 4 digits of soc. sec. number, mothers maiden name, or a "security question". All of these are almost certainly less secure than a good password though.
