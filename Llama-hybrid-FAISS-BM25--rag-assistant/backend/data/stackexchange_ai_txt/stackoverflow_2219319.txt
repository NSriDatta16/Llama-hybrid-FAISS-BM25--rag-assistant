MS Access ADP Disconnected Recordset Reverts

I have an Microsoft Access 2003 ADP, which uses a bound "main" form with several bound continuous-style subforms. They all utilize disconnected Recordsets via a helper class. Several users have noticed the same strange behavior: they add/edit a record in the continuous subform, they leave the record (committing the edit to the Recordset), they lock the computer (Ctrl+Alt+Del), they unlock the computer, they go back to the form, after about 5 seconds it flickers and revert to the original unedited state. I've been able to reproduce this following the steps above, further, after making a change in my form, bound to a disconnected Recordset, I went to SQL Server and changed a value. After the lock/unlock computer routine, the form flickers and refreshes, and the NEW value I just entered in SQL Server appears. It's as if after about 5 seconds, my disconnected Recordset is reconnecting (on it's own) and requerying the Recordset. I realize I'm not giving a lot of information here, but has anyone encountered an issue with disconnected Recordsets reconnecting and requerying? Or at least have an ideas of where I could start debugging? I have the ADP and SQL script to create the database if someone would like to recreate this in their environment. Here's how I'm creating the disconnected Recordset: Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim stmTest As ADODB.Stream Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection cnn.Open Application.CurrentProject.AccessConnection.ConnectionString ' Create recordset and disconnect it. Set mrsTest = New ADODB.Recordset mrsTest.CursorLocation = adUseClient mrsTest.Open "SELECT * FROM [tblChild] WHERE ParentID = 1" _ , cnn _ , adOpenStatic, adLockBatchOptimistic Set mrsTest.ActiveConnection = Nothing cnn.Close Set cnn = Nothing ' Copy recordset to stream in memory. Set stmTest = New ADODB.Stream stmTest.Open mrsTest.Save stmTest, adPersistADTG ' Bind form to disconnected recordset. Set Me.Recordset = mrsTest ' Open a copy of the recordset from the stream. Set mrsTest = New ADODB.Recordset stmTest.Position = 0 mrsTest.Open stmTest
