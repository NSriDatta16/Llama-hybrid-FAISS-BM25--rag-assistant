Java - Highest, Lowest and Average

I've just started studying and I need help on one of my exercises. I need the end user to input a rain fall number for each month. I then need to out put the average rainfall, highest month and lowest month and the months which rainfall was above average. I keep getting the same number in the highest and lowest and I have no idea why. I am seriously pulling my hair out. Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is what I have so far: public class rainfall { /** * @param args */ public static void main(String[] args) { int[] numgroup; numgroup = new int [13]; ConsoleReader console = new ConsoleReader(); int highest; int lowest; int index; int tempVal; int minMonth; int minIndex; int maxMonth; int maxIndex; System.out.println("Welcome to Rainfall"); for(index = 1; index 100 || tempVal highest) { highest = numgroup[1]; maxMonth = maxIndex; } } System.out.println("The average monthly rainfall was "); System.out.println("The lowest monthly rainfall was month " + minIndex); System.out.println("The highest monthly rainfall was month " + maxIndex); System.out.println("Thank you for using Rainfall"); } private static ConsoleReader ConsoleReader() { return null; } } Thanks, Emily
