One solution is to convert grades to GPA and then do a t-test or U test. A = 4, B = 3. C = 2. D = 1. F = 0 is the usual way to do this. Or, if you have covariates, you could use some form regression. If you want to keep the grades ordinal, then you could do a test that accounts for that, like Jonckheere-Terpstra, or, with covariates, you could use ordinal logistic regression.
