hidden markov model with multiple factors

I am reading about hidden markov models. The example I have been reading is based on determining the average annual temperature on the earth over a series of years before thermometers were invented, i.e. we have to use indirect evidence of the temperature. We have two states, hot (H) and cold (C). They suppose there is a correlation between the size of tree growth rings and temperature. They consider 3 different ring sizes, small (S), medium (M) & large (L). Matrix A - state transition H C H 0.7 0.3 C 0.4 0.6 Matrix B - observation probability matrix based on available evidence the probabilistic relationship between annual temperature and tree ring size is given by the matrix below. S M L H 0.1 0.4 0.5 C 0.7 0.2 0.1 The example is a good introduction for someone such as myself (very limited knowledge). My question though is in the example above we only have one factor (size of tree rings) that we believe explains temperature. However if we had more factors lets just say 2 to keep it simple how does that work for a hidden markov model. Or can you only use one factor in a hidden markov model? If so what model should be used for multiple factors?
