Do Stochastic Processes such as the Gaussian Process/Dirichlet Process have densities? If not, how can Bayes rule be applied to them?

The Dirichlet Pocess and Gaussian Process are often referred to as "distributions over functions" or "distributions over distributions". In that case, can I meaningfully talk about the density of a function under a GP? That is, do the Gaussian Process or Dirichlet Process have some notion of a probability density? If it does not, how can we use Bayes' rule to go from prior to posterior, if the notion of the prior probability of a function is not well defined? Do things such as MAP or EAP estimates exist in the Bayesian Nonparametric world? Thanks a lot.
