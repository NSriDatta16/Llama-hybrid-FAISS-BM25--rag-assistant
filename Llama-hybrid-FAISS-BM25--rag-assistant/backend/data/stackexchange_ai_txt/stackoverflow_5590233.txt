Cookies should not be used for caching, since your cookie is sent from the browser to the server on each request!! This means you send more bytes, which means higher latency. So you are actually slowing your system down, not helping it, by using cookies in this way. The proper way to cache data on a website is to use localStorage (or one of the other HTML5 storage classes) to cache it.
