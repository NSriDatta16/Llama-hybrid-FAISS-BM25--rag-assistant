These are the values that need to be set in the HttpBrowserCapabilities object for a asp.net webforms site to run, I would try making sure these are set and see if that fixes your problem, I'm not sure if it would but hey it worth a shot right? Browser (aka name) useragent (passed in the request) tables (true/false) version (version of browser eg 1.0) w3cdomversion (eg 1.0) cookies (true/false) ecmascriptversion (eg 1.0) Hope this helps.
