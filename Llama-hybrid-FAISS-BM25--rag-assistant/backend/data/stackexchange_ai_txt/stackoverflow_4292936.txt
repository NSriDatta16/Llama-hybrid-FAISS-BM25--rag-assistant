You can enumerate all the files in a directory by doing files= dir('folder_wilth_your_csv_files\*.csv'); And then you traverse that with num_files = length(files); for i=1:num_files data=csvread(files(i).name) end csvread will allow you to read in only a certain row and col range if you want. Once you have your data, averaging is the trivial part.
