How to generate a form file from existing code?

In netbeans you can choose to work on "design" or "source". If you don't have a form file, netbeans won't let you see the design and work on that with drag and drop. I have some existing code with much swing. How can I use the "design" mode in netbeans on that code? To me it seams I can only use the "design" mode if I create a new empty file and work on that. I can't copy the existing code to new file because netbeans have this autogenerated code that none can edit :S
