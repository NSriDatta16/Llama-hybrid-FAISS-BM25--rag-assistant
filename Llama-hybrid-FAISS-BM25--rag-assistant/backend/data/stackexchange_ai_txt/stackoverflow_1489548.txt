So you want the data shown in the main report to be based on a parameter passed to it from a subreport? I don't think this is possible - the Report Processing Model (described here ) states that SubReports are in 'Pass 2', while data retrieval is in 'Pass 1'. This means that the parameter prompt will always appear first. You might instead be able to have the main report contain TWO subreports, the first of which is used to retrieve the parameter and the second uses it. That can get very messy, especially when dealing with page headers and footers.
