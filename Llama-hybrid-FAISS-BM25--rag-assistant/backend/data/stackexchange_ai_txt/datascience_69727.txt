Use all available data to build Logistic Regression model

Using K-Fold, I chose to use Logistic Regression for a project of mine. I made it learn on my X_train (80% of data), and tested it on my X_test, with good results. My question is : now that I need the model to be used, can I rebuilt the model with the same parameters but on all my data ? Will there be overfitting, or maybe as I saw that those parameters doesn't, will it be safe ?
