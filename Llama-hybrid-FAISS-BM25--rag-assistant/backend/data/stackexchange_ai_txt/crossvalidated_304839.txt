Why $\log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = b_0+b_1x $ in Logistic regression

I have read about logistic regression on Quora and also from different online source and they said that, $$logit = b_0+b_1x$$ Where $logit = \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \log (\frac{probability-of-event-happening)}{probability-of-event-not-happening)} = \log (Odds)$ $or,\log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = b_0+b_1x $ My question is we know output, $y = b_0+b_1x $ So how $y$ become $\log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ or why $\log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ is equal to $b_0+b_1x $ Does $\log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ produced the same output as $y$ Edit: Finally I have found my answer which is given in @Peter_Flom's comment. But another question came into my mind- What is the proof that $p = \frac{exp(b_0+b_1x)}{exp(b_0+b_1x) + 1}$is the probability in Logistic regression?
