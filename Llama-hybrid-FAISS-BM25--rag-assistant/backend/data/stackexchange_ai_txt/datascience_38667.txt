How many pairs of image needed for training Siamese Network? And how to augment them?

Hi Deep Learning researchers and engineers, Does anyone have experience in Siamese Network regarding the training data size? How many pairs of image do I need to train a Siamese Network? And what kinds of data augmentation should I do? Thank you.
