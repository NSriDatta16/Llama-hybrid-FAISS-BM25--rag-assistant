Although you're asking about the file name, I believe you can use %type to get the fully qualified type name (a.b.className). If you just want the class name, use %type{1} Note that any method that generates caller information (%file and %type) have a performance cost associated with them. As an aside, you can bypass the performance hit by naming the Logger using the Type name. namespace MyNamespace { public class Foo { private static ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Foo)); } } Your conversion pattern would look like: "%date [%thread] %-5level %logger %message" Where your logger would be " MyNameSpace.Foo ". Likewise, if you only want the class name, use " %logger{1} , which will resolve as " Foo ". One of the best advantages to this approach is that you can leverage log4net's hierarchical repository system to adjust logging levels per type:
