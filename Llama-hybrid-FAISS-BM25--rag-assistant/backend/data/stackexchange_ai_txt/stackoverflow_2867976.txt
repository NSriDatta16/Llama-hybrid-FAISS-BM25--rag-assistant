Is there an elegant way to have a list_filter for a M2M field in the Django admin?

If I have a Pizza model and a Topping model, with m2m between them, is there some quick elegant way to add to the admin list page for either of them a list filter for all pizzas which contain a certain topping / all toppings that are contained in a certain pizza? The built-in list_filter doesn't support m2m fields so I'm looking for some workaround to allow this sort of filtering.
