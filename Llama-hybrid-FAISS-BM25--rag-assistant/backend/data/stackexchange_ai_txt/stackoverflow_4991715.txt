PHP Dom replace text - Keep case

I am using the below code to replace some text which is working fine. Where the issue lies is that I would like to set some text to search for (i.e Black ) and rather than just telling it to replace Black with Black I would like it to be able to look at the case of the word or string and keep that case. At the moment if I tell it to replace Black with Black it will replace both Black and black with the uppercase Black . I hope I have made some sense as to what I wish to achieve. If more information is needed let me know. Here is the code: $revised = str_ireplace("Black", " Black ", $node->wholeText); $newNode = $dom->createDocumentFragment(); $newNode->appendXML($revised); $node->parentNode->replaceChild($newNode, $node);
