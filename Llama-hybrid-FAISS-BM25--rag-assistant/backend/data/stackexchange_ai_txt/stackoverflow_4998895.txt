Ensuring that at least one related record still exists

Is there a better way to ensure that I don't delete the last record of a relation? I feel like this should be done through a validation, but could not make that stop the destroy action. FYI - @organization is present because nested routes class LocationsController 1 @location.destroy flash[:notice] = "Successfully destroyed location." redirect_to @organization else flash[:notice] = "Could not destroy the only location." redirect_to @organization end end end
