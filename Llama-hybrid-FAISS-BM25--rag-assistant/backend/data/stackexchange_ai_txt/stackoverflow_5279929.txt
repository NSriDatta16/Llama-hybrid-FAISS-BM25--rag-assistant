You can generally compile your prolog project. However, depending on the prolog environment you are using, it might be an intermediate code and not directly executable code. SWI Prolog and Sicstus prolog both allow to generate an executable of this form (embedding the interpreter along with you compiled intermediate code). Other prologs like Arity Prolog/32 compiles directly to an x86 executable. There is a page on Wikipedia that compares various prolog systems. There is an ISO standard for prolog. However almost every prolog system will be mostly compatible with each other, requiring minor changes to port the code from one prolog system to another.
