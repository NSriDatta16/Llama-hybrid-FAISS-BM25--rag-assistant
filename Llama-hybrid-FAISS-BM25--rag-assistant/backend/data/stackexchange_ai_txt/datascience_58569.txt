Take this with a grain of salt (I'm super new to this stuff), and I'm assuming this is only a piece to the puzzle, but maybe someone with more expertise can build on this. I wonder, though, if utilizing a Levenshtein distance to quantify the accuracy of the string would be helpful. I got some pretty accurate correlations from a previous project, though I've admittedly never used it for NLP. If this is a terrible idea, I'd be interested to know why...
