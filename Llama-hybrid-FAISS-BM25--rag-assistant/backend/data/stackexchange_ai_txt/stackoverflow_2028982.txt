Drawing abstract canvas

I'm planning to write a diagram editor-style application, where you organize objects on a canvas. This application will need to support setting viewport, zooming, cropping and a lot of other standard features of such a graph style application. I'm looking for toolkits or frameworks which could supports drawing in a standard mathematical coordinate space (0,0 as center point, extendable in all directions), and will scale, crop and zoom this according to (user) commands. Language doesn't really matter, but the more geared it is towards standard GUI applications the better. I would namely like to be able to reuse standard controls and buttons on the canvas if possible.
