Why does this code sometimes throw a NullPointerException?

Consider the following Java source: if( agents != null ) { for( Iterator iter = agents.keySet().iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) { // Code that uses iter.next() ... // } } The agents is a HashMap . Why does the for statement sometimes throw a NullPointerException ? Thank you.
