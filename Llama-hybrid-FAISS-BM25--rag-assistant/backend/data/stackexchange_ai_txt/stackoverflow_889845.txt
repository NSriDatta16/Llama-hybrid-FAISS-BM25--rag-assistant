At a minimum, you would need to utilize JavaScript to implement what you want. Most would implement it the way Tim describes in his first paragraph. Set up two .JSP's: The first contains your main form with the country drop-down menu. Some JavaScript on the first .JSP triggers an AJAX request to a second .JSP. The second .JSP accepts a country-ID parameter and uses a servlet to query your DB for a list of cities, then renders that data. Once the request returns, the JavaScript in your first .JSP inserts the list of cities into a new drop-down menu. This may seem complex, but several JavaScript libraries exist to assist you with this task. Look into jQuery or Dojo .
