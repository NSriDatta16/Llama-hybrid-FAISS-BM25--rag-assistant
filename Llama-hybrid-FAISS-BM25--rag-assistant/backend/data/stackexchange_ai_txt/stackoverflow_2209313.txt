SharePoint and SQL Server Compact Data Files

I'm doing a consulting job for an organization wanting something a small step above what an Access Database would do. Generally, they want to track network lines between buildings on their campus (obviously, I'm obfuscating a bit, just go with it). And of course, they want it done in SharePoint, WITHOUT a huge software development and maintenance effort due to a limited number of users. So, the idea is to do initial data entry via an Infopath form (and some custom code for a few basic reporting features). However, SharePoint lists aren't going to work due to the amount of data being stored. Is it possible to publish a single SQL Server Compact sdf file to, say, a SharePoint document library to hold this data? (DBAs for the company are being obnoxious). I'm aware of the 4 GB limit on SDF files.
