You're getting the compiler error because you are in VB.NET, not C#. In C#, having a method with the same signature as an interface method you need to implement makes the compiler wire it up for you automatically. VB.NET requires that you explicitly implement say what method is being implemented. You can use the same name (it's encouraged), you just have to have that 'implements' clause.
