There might be a clash of two paradigms. Multiple imputation is a heavily model-based Bayesian solution: the concept of the proper imputation essentially states that you need to sample from the well-defined posterior distribution of the data, otherwise you are screwed. Propensity score matching, on the other hand, is a semi-parametric procedure: once you have computed your propensity score (no matter how, you could've used a kernel density estimate, not necessarily a logit model), you can do the rest by simply taking the differences between the treated and non-treated observations with the same propensity score, which is kinda non-parametric now, as there is no model left that controls for other covariates. I don't feel good about the discontinuities introduced by the literal implementation of matching (find the control with the closest possible value of the propensity score, and ignore the rest; Abadie and Imbens (2008) discussed that it makes it impossible to actually get the standard errors right in some of the matching situations). I would give more trust to the smoother approaches like weighting by the inverse propensity. My favorite reference on this is "Mostly Harmless Econometrics" , subtitled "An Empiricist Companion", and aimed at economists, but I think this book should be a required reading for other social scientists, most biostatisticians, and non-bio statisticians as well so that they know how other disciplines approach data analysis. At any rate, using only one out of 15 simulated complete data lines per observation is equivalent to a single imputation. As a result, you lose efficiency compared to all 15 completed data sets, and you can't estimate the standard errors properly. Looks like a deficient procedure to me, from any angle. Of course, we happily sweep under the carpet the assumption that both the multiple imputation model and the propensity model are correct in the sense of having all the right variables in all the right functional forms. There is little way to check that (although I'd be happy to hear otherwise about diagnostic measures for both of these methods).
