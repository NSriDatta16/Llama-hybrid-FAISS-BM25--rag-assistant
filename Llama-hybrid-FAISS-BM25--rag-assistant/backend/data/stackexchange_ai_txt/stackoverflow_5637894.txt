DialogFragments with devices api level < 11

I am in the process of making a honeycomb project/fork backwards compatible with 1.6+. Based on the documentation provided by Google/Android I decided to build off all my fragments off DialogFragment s which worked great for honeycomb...it gives me the flexibility to put anything as a dialog or 'full screen' element. I've now incorporated the compatibility kit and moved my imports and method calls over to that. Now that I'm on 2.3 I am trying to launch an identical intent but I receive this issue: java.lang.IllegalStateException: DialogFragment can not be attached to a container view The documentation for DialogFragment suggests that it can perform as Fragment when you don't desire the dialog/popup functionality.
