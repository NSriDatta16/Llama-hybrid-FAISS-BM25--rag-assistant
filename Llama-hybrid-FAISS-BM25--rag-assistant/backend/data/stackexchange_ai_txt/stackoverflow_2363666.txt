Android Drag/Animation of Views

I'm not a programmer, but I'm trying to learn android development, and having a blast. Lately I've hit a fork in the road, and I don't know that any of the directions I can identify will meet all my needs. This is where you (the experts) can help ;) Endpoint: I want to have the user touch a ball, and drag it to any location on the screen. I would also like to animate this ball when it gets drawn, and when it gets dropped. I can accomplish the dragging part using a custom class (that doesn't extend anything... just a class like is found in this tutorial: basic drag & drop , however, I don't know how to apply the tween animation to it since it's not a view. I have also developed an animated version of an ImageView with my image in it, however, I can't manage to apply the same drag & drop functionality without using AbsoluteLayout, which I know is a no-no. So... how do I move an ImageView around a ??? layout using MotionEvents, or how do I animate (using tweens defined in XML) a non-view based custom class? Please ask questions if this is not clear. I don't know all the terminology as well as most of you might. There is also a copy of this question on the anddev.org forums, so I'll keep this post updated with any responses I get over there.
