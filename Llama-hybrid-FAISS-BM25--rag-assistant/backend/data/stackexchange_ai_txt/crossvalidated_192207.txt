Multiple regression - A question about dependent variable

I have a doubt about hierarchical regression analysis. My dependent variable is Presenteeism (the act of attending work while sick). Originally that variable has 4 levels (Has it happened to you that you had gone to work despite thinking that you should stay at home because of illness? categories: never, 1 time, 2-5 times, more than 5 times. The first two categories indicate 'no presenteeism', last two categories indicate 'There is presenteeism'). Then, I recoded that variable into 0 and 1 value (0 - no presenteeism, 1 - presenteeism). Maybe I shouldn't have done that? My main doubt is: can I use hierarchical linear regression when my dependent variable is dichotomous and should it stay as 4-categorical variable or should it be dichotomous? Or I MUST use logistic regression?
