This is taken straight out from the 1991 original paper of Schmidhuber in 1991: "I propose a novel general principle for unsupervised learning of distributed non-redundant internal representations of input patterns. The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each representational unit there is an adaptive predictor which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to filter `abstract concepts' out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those upon which the other units focus." if you understand the basic principle behind GAN's and the min-max optimization game that the generator and the discriminator play, then in principle there is essentially no difference in GAN's and Schmidhuber's original paper(in principle) the principle is same and if Goodfellow didn't cite his paper then in academic terms it is called plagiarism and in real life, it is called stealing. There is essentially no debate here to have its either you accept that you took the idea or not. If you look at the original paper he proposes a similar min-max optimization game (This excerpt is directly taken from the original paper): Maximization of the objective function(as defined in the original Schmidhuber's paper follows the following constraints) tends to force the representational units to take on binary values that maximize independence(referring to generators ability in GAN's to maximize it such that the outputs sampled from the vector of distribution encoded by the generator becomes impossible for the discriminator to discriminate) in addition to minimizing the reconstruction error(refers to minimizing the discriminator's loss function i.e maximizing its ability to differentiate between generated and real image). Hence to anyone who understands this kind of stuff can realize who is at fault here and why Schmidhuber's annoyance is justified in the true sense. The statements in the bracket compare the principle similarity between GAN's and Schmidhuber's original 1991 paper.
