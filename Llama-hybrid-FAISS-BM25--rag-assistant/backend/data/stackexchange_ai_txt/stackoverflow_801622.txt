I've had the exact same problem with both input fields and textareas in IE7, but only if I gave them a width. I don't remember where I got it from, but I found this solution, it may not be very elegant, but it solved the issue. Just add: filter:alpha(opacity=100) to your css of style attribute of the troublesome fields.
