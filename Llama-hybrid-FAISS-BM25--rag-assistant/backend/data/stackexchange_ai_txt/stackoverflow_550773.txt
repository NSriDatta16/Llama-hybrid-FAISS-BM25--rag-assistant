It doesn't work for idea's or diagrams, but i found this very impressive: I love sketch . Hopefully, we'll see similar tools in the future for other forms of information. When i was still using windows i used adobe illustrator and a wacom tabled for sketching diagrams ( example ). Powerfull, but a steep learning curve, if you just want to do sketching. On linux i use Inkscape (with a wacom tablet). It's not as powerful as illustrator, but it gets the job done. ( example ). I would love to use a sketching tool for creating presentations. Have a number of slides on my screen, and just sketch to contents of every sheet, also using the wacom to drag and drop the slides in the right order, etc.
