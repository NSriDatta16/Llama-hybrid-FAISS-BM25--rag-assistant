Since the response variable is binary (Well / Not-well), you can use logistic regression. You will need to know the count for each cell (Men-June-Well, Men-June-NotWell, and so on). If you have the same individuals across time, it is helpful to be able to identify each individual across time. (You would need this information for McNemar test also). If so, you can use mixed-effects logistic regression. I think it is the Gender x Time interaction you are interested in. The following example is just a logistic regression model without repeated measures, analogous to a two-way factorial anova. Data = read.table(header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=TRUE, text=" Time Gender Result Count June Men Well 76 June Men NotWell 24 June Women Well 81 June Women NotWell 19 Sept Men Well 71 Sept Men NotWell 29 Sept Women Well 79 Sept Women NotWell 21 ") library(tidyr) Long = uncount(Data, Count) rownames(Long) = seq(1:nrow(Long)) XT = xtabs(~ Time + Gender + Result, data=Long) XT model = glm(Result ~ Gender + Time + Gender:Time, data=Long, family=binomial()) library(car) Anova(model) ### Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) ### ### LR Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) ### Gender 2.37792 1 0.1231 ### Time 0.69110 1 0.4058 ### Gender:Time 0.07645 1 0.7822 library(emmeans) marginal = emmeans(model, ~ Gender:Time, type="response") marginal ### Gender Time prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL ### Men June 0.76 0.0427 Inf 0.667 0.834 ### Women June 0.81 0.0392 Inf 0.721 0.875 ### Men Sept 0.71 0.0454 Inf 0.614 0.790 ### Women Sept 0.79 0.0407 Inf 0.699 0.859 ### ### Confidence level used: 0.95 ### Intervals are back-transformed from the logit scale pairs(marginal) ### contrast odds.ratio SE df null z.ratio p.value ### Men June / Women June 0.743 0.257 Inf 1 -0.859 0.8259 ### Men June / Men Sept 1.293 0.416 Inf 1 0.800 0.8544 ### Men June / Women Sept 0.842 0.286 Inf 1 -0.508 0.9573 ### Women June / Men Sept 1.741 0.587 Inf 1 1.646 0.3528 ### Women June / Women Sept 1.133 0.401 Inf 1 0.353 0.9849 ### Men Sept / Women Sept 0.651 0.215 Inf 1 -1.302 0.5616 ### ### P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 4 estimates ### Tests are performed on the log odds ratio scale
