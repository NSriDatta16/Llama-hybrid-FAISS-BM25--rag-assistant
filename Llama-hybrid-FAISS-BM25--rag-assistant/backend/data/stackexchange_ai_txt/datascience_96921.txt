Difference between grayscaled and binary mnist dataset

When making a cnn you could use the classic mnist dataset containing grayscale images. I am considering transforming them to simple binary images instead, the questions is should i? It will be much smaller file sizes and easier to determine the text from background. Why is the mnist dataset grayscaled and not binarized? Will it have any postive or negative effects when applying the binarized images in a cnn?
