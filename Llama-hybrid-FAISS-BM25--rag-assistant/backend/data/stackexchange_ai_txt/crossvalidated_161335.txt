Yes you would have to consider that when calculating your probability, and you would also need to have an idea of how is the bias of your coins... Assuming that you pick a coin at random you have a 0.2 probability of having a honest coin, and a 0.8 probability of having a tails-biased one. Say that your biased coins will land on heads with probability $p$, and on tails with probability $1-p$. Then, conditioning on what coin you picked: $$ \begin{aligned} \text{Probability of having $k$ heads in $n$ flips} &= 0.2*\binom{n}{k} \cfrac{1}{2}^{n} + 0.8*\binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k} \end{aligned} $$ So if you have $20$ flips and $7$ of them are heads, $$ \begin{aligned} \text{Probability of having $7$ heads in $20$ flips} &= 0.2*77520* \cfrac{1}{2}^{20} + 0.8*77520*p^{7}(1-p)^{20} \\ &\approx 0.015 + 62016*p^{7}(1-p)^{20} \end{aligned} $$ and you can find the cumulative distribution likewise. The answer for the second part of your question is also yes, you should take that into account and I expect people do that in real life problems. Using conditional probabilities depending on previous knowledge / outcomes is not unusual and it's also sensible. However I think your example with gender equality in salaries is a bit confuse... why would you test if salaries are equal if you already know that women earn 10% less than men in this country? I would suggest you take a look into conditional probability and Bayesian techniques (priori and posteriori distributions) in case you're not familiar with it.
