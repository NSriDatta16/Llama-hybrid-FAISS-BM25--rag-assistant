(This is not an answer, but a suggestion) I think you're trying to make this too complicated. You really have two problems: Break a paragraph into sentences Identify which sentences contain a 4-digit number, probably in the range of 1900-2100 or so. Point #1 is quite difficult, because of the ambiguous use of the . character. For example, how would you process the sentences: I was born in 1986. Mr. Smith was born in 1976. You need to be able to recognize that the period after "Mr" is not a sentence terminating character, and that there are actually two sentences. Most answers you get (including @Tatu's) will do a na√Øve split based on the period. edit another use case: money I earned $42.00 yesterday that I don't have to report on my 2010 tax return. Once you're able to adequately identify sentences, point #2 is pretty trivial.
