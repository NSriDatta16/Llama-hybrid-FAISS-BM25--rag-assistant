The Java Scripting API ( javax.scripting ) package was introduced in Java 6, so that will not be available in Java 1.4 or 5. As the default installation, Java SE 6 comes with a stripped down version of Mozilla Rhino which is interfaced through javax.scripting . However, Mozilla Rhino itself does not require Java 6. From the requirements page: Recent versions of Rhino have only been tested with JDK 1.4 and greater. Older versions support JDKs as early as 1.1. Therefore, to use Rhino, it appears that Java 1.4 is actually sufficient. As for resources, the documentation for Rhino seems to have a lot of information. In particular, the Embedding Rhino section might be useful to see how the scripting will work. Of course, the lack of the javax.scripting package means that interfacing to Rhino itself is going to require the use of the Rhino API rather than the Java 6 native scripting API, but I would guess that the functionality is going to be fairly similar. The only downside I can see is, if in the future, Java 6 is going to be supported on the target platform and/or using another language, it may necessitate a rewrite to use the Java Scripting API rather than directly supporting Rhino.
