Find out which object was clicked on a html5 Canvas

Suppose I have a html5/canvas application in which I can place objects on a drawing-canvas. Some kind of diagram editor, something like Visio (but much simpler) Is there a framework which helps me find which object is clicked/dragged? An option is to capture the click-event and iterate over all my objects (in a semi-smart way) and check if it is clicked/dragged, but I hate to reinvent the wheel!
