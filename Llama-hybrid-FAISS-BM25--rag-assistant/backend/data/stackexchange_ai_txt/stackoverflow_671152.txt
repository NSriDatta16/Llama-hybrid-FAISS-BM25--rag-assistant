What's the most compact version of "match everything but these strings" in the shell or regex?

Linux: I want to list all the files in a directory and within its subdirectories, except some strings. For that, I've been using a combination of find/grep/shell globbing. For instance, I want to list all files except those in the directories ./bin ./lib ./resources I understand this can be done as shown in this question and this other . But both versions are not solving the case "everything, but this pattern" in general terms. It seems that it is much easier to use a conditional for filtering the results, but I wonder if there is any compact and elegant way of describing this in regexp or in the shell extended globbing. Thanks.
