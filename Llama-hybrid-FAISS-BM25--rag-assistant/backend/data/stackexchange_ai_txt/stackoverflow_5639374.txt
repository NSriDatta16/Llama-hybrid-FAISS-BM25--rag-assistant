undefined reference when including a local header file in android NDK

I construct a simple android application which uses ndk with JNI. The application has onw .cpp(debugTest.cpp) file that is used to link java and c++ with jni and another .c(javaEssentials.c) file with it's header(javaEssentials.h). When I include in the .cpp file the .c file(#include "javaEssentials.c") no error is reported when compiling. When I include in the .cpp file the header the compiler reports error of undefined reference of the functions the .c file has.It is real strange problem and I can't understand why is this happening. As usual I have an include declaration of the header file in the .c file. My android.mk is: # build file written to describe the C and C++ source files to the Android NDK LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir) include $(CLEAR_VARS) LOCAL_MODULE := debugTest LOCAL_SRC_FILES := debugTest.cpp include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY) Any ideas why this is happening ?
