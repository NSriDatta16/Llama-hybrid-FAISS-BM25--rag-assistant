Feature importance understanding

I would like to ask if I understand correctly the feature importance in random forest. I am examine random forest by selecting 4 or 6 features and also with different number of trees. I would like to know if I get a result like using 25, 50, 75, 100 trees with 4 features and 6 features. the result for having 25 tree with 4 features better because those randomly selected features were more important than when build a model with 75 trees? Is it correct or I completely misunderstand feature importance? many thanks
