How to suspend topmost process? (solution preferably in c#)

I have application written as a module on top of host app. Let's call host app process A and my app process B. Process B is in child relation to process A. From process B I start another process, called it C and while process C is running I want A and B to be suspended. To start C from B I use Process class and I block B calling WaitForExit(). But how to also block A. Again, while C is running A and B should be suspended. Host app is third party app so I have only access through API. I was thinking about getting process' B parent process (which is A) and for every thread in A calling it's Suspend() method but this method is obsolete. What are the elegant ways to achive my goal? My host app is SAP B1.
