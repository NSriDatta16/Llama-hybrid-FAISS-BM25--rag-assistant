I would strongly discourage you from the proposed branching option. This is sometimes tricky for developers, so I let you imagine the mess you will end up with if all your designers start merging their branches on top of each other. And if the developers are working on the trunk, you may have to periodically do a merge TRUNK into some designers' branches. One possibility could be to have one IIS for all your designers but each one (e.g. johndoe) would be working on his own application (let say http://johndoe.ueberserver.local/application ) that is checked out onto a network drive (e.g. i:/johndoe/application). That way, John can work on some files and see the result in the browser. When it is time for John to check in his changes, you can either let him do it or designate a "check in buddy" that will do it for him.
