importing flash library symbol into flex

I am embedding a flash file in my flex file and then trying to add it to the stage. IU try addChild to a canvas element and to a container element, but it keeps giving me the error, the symbol "myBtn" is cannot be converted to a IUIcomponent. I understand that I need to place everything inside some sort of component, but what is the proper way to do this in flex?
