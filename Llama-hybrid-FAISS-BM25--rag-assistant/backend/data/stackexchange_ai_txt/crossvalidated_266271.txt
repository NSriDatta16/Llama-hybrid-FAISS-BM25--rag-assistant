Multi-collinearity will not be a problem for certain models. Such as random forest or decision tree. For example, if we have two identical columns, decision tree / random forest will automatically "drop" one column at each split. And the model will still work well. In addition, regularization is a way to "fix" Multi-collinearity problem. My answer Regularization methods for logistic regression gives details.
