CSS takes a bit of time to learn, but the thing I initially found most discouraging was the fact that so many hacks were needed to get all browsers to behave the same way. Learning a system which doesn't adhere to logic seems dumb... but I've clung to the vague belief that there is logic behind each browser's idiosyncrasy, in the form of the W3 spec. It seems that the new generation browsers are slowly coming into line - but IE6 still makes my life hell on a daily basis. Maybe creating an abstraction layer between compliant/valid CSS code and the browsers' shoddy implementations wouldn't be a bad thing. But if such a thing was created - would it need to be powered by JS (or jQuery)? (and would that create an unreasonably burden, in terms of processing cost?) I've found that it useful to 'level the ground' when scripting with CSS. There are probably loads of different flavours of reset script out there - but using YUI resets has helped me to reduce the number of quirks I'd otherwise encounter - and YUI grids make life a little easier sometimes.
