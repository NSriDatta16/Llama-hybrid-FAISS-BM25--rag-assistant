What's the octave equivalent of eig(X, 'nobalance')

I'm trying to find the equilibrium distribution of a markov chain, which means finding the eigenvalues of the transition matrix representing it, however, the eig function automatically normalises the eigenvectors it returns, in MatLab there is a flag you can pass to the function to stop this behaviour eig(X, 'nobalance') Where X is a matrix. See http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/eig.html . However, when I try this in octave I just get an error: error: eig: wrong type argument `sq_string' Is there some other function I should be calling? Cheers
