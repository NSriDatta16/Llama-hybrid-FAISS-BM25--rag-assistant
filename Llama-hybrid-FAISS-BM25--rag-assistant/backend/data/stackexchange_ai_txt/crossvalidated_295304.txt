Lightweight estimation of $\sum_{i=0}^n \gamma(i)$, the sum of the auto-covariances

Suppose $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ are samples from a stationary time series and let $\gamma(i)$ denote the autocovariance $\gamma(i) = \mathrm{Cov}(X_{k},X_{k+i})$. Suppose $n$ is very large. In a numerical method I am working on, the quantity $\sum_{i=0}^n \gamma(i)$ appears all the time. I am looking for a quick/lightweight way to guess/estimate this quantity from the data without computing $\sum_{i=0}^n \hat\gamma(i)$ because this is tedious for large $n$ (here $\hat\gamma(i)$ denote the sample autocovariance). It has to do the estimation in $O(n)$ time. Does there exist such a method/trick/insight?
