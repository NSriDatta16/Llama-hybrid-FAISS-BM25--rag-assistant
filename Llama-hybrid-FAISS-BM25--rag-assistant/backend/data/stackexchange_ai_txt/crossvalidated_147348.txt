Compute a Pvalue from the averaged Pearson and Spearman rho

On the one hand, Pearson correlation is sensitive to outliers, while Spearman is not. On the other hand, if you have quantitative data, Spearman will treat it like ordinal data. How about averaging Pearson's and Spearman's rho? Is that legit? If there is a correlation just caused by outliers, the average should be less sensitive. And quantitative information is not completely ignored. The significance of both Pearson's and Spearman's rho can be computed as $t= \rho \sqrt {\text{df}/(1-\rho^2)}$. Can I apply the same to get the $t$-statistic and the $P$-value of this averaged $\rho$ value?
