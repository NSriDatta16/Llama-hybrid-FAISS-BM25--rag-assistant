The NMDS vegan performs is of the common or garden form of NMDS. If metaMDS() is passed the original data, then we can position the species points (shown in the plot) at the weighted average of site scores (sample points in the plot) for the NMDS dimensions retained/drawn. The weights are given by the abundances of the species. This is one way to think of how species points are positioned in a correspondence analysis biplot (at the weighted average of the site scores, with site scores positioned at the weighted average of the species scores, and a way to solve CA was discovered simply by iterating those two from some initial starting conditions until the scores stopped changing) You'll notice that if you supply a dissimilarity matrix to metaMDS() will not draw the species points, because it does not have access to the species abundances (to use as weights). Really, these species points are an afterthought, a way to help interpret the plot. You interpret the sites scores (points) as you would any other NMDS - distances between points approximate the rank order of distances between samples. The species just add a little bit of extra info, but think of the species point as the "optima" of each species in the NMDS space.
