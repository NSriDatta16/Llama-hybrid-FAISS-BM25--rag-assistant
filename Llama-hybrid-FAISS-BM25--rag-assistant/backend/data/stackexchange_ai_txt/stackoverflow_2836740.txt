jQuery datepicker calendar - call to function updates database

So I'm using the datepicker plugin to make an availability calendar. Here is my javascript: http://pastebin.com/H7D9PcAg When dpSetSelected() is called it is also calling dateSelected() which triggers the AJAX call to my PHP script. I need a way to only update the database if the date is clicked on and not pre-loaded. When I pre-load the dates they are sent to the PHP page and subsequently removed.
