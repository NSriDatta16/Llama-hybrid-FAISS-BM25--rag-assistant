I think the demonstrable distinction between "confidence intervals" and "precision" (see answer from @dsaxton) is important because that distinction points out problems in common usage of both terms. Quoting from Wikipedia : The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. One thus might argue that frequentist confidence intervals do represent a type of precision of a measurement scheme . If one repeats the same scheme, the 95% CI calculated for each repetition will contain the one true value of the parameter in 95% of the repetitions. This, however, is not what many people want from a practical measure of precision. They want to know how close the measured value is to the true value . Frequentist confidence intervals do not strictly provide that measure of precision. Bayesian credible regions do. Some of the confusion is that, in practical examples, frequentist confidence intervals and Bayesian credible regions "will more-or-less overlap" . Sampling from a normal distribution, as in some comments on the OP, is such an example. That may also be the case in practice for some of the broader types of analyses that @Bey had in mind, based on approximations to standard errors in processes that have normal distributions in the limit. If you know that you are in such a situation , then there may be no practical danger in interpreting a particular 95% CI, from a single implementation of a measurement scheme, as having a 95% probability of containing the true value. That interpretation of confidence intervals, however, is not from frequentist statistics, for which the true value either is or is not within that particular interval. If confidence intervals and credible regions differ markedly, that Bayesian-like interpretation of frequentist confidence intervals can be misleading or wrong, as the paper linked above and earlier literature referenced therein demonstrate. Yes, "common sense" might help avoid such misinterpretations, but in my experience "common sense" isn't so common. Other CrossValidated pages contain much more information on confidence intervals and the differences between confidence intervals and credible regions . Links from those particular pages are also highly informative.
