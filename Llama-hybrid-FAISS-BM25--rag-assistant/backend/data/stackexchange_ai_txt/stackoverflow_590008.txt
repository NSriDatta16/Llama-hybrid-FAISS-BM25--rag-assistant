IParameterInspector is not a bad choice. Do you need to know which operation/session/endpoint is happening, or are you just installing the same logic for all operations? Do you need to modify the Message object? (These considerations may change your choice of extensibility point.) Do you need to modify thread-local storage? If so, prefer ICallContextInitializer.
