This refers to the short section 12.1.4 PCA for high-dimensional data in Bishop's book. I can see that this section can be a bit confusing, because Bishop is going back and forth between $\newcommand{\X}{\mathbf X}\newcommand{\v}{\mathbf v}\newcommand{\u}{\mathbf u}\v_i$ and $\u_i$ using a slightly inconsistent notation. The section is about the relationship between the eigenvectors of covariance matrix $\frac{1}{N}\X^\top \X$ and the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix $\frac{1}{N}\X \X^\top$ (in the context of PCA). Let $\v_i$ be a unit-length eigenvector of $\frac{1}{N}\X \X^\top$: $$\frac{1}{N}\X \X^\top \v_i = \lambda_i \v_i.$$ If we multiply this equation by $\X^\top$ from the left: $$\frac{1}{N}\X^\top \X (\X^\top \v_i) = \lambda_i (\X^\top \v_i),$$ we see that $\X^\top \v_i$ is an eigenvector of $\frac{1}{N}\X^\top \X$. However, it will not have unit length! Indeed, let us compute its length: $$\|\X^\top \v_i\|^2=(\X^\top \v_i)^\top \X^\top \v_i = \v_i^\top \X\X^\top \v_i=\v_i(N\lambda v_i)=N\lambda\|\v_i\|^2=N\lambda_i.$$ So the squared length of $\X^\top \v_i$ is equal to $N\lambda_i$. Therefore, if we want to transform $\v_i$ into a unit-length covariance matrix eigenvector $\u_i$, we need to normalize it have unit length: $$\u_i = \frac{1}{(N\lambda_i)^{1/2}}\X^\top \v_i.$$ (Please note that the above was not using $\v_i=\X\u_i$ definition that you quoted. Instead, we started directly with a unit-length $\v_i$. I believe this might have been the source of your confusion. Bishop uses $\v_i=\X\u_i$ definition earlier in the section, but it is not relevant anymore for this particular argument.)
