You don't say what CPU and what amount of RAM your computer is equipped with. Your situation is this: A scanned document as PDF, sized about 500 kB per page on avarage. That means each page basically is a picture, using the scan resolution (at least 200 dpi, maybe even 600 dpi). You are re-distilling it with Ghostscript, using -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen . This setting will do quite a few things to make the file size smaller. Amongst the most important are: Re-sample all (color or grayscale) images to 72dpi Convert all colors to sRGB Both these operations can quite "expensive" in terms of CPU and/or RAM usage. BTW, your setting of -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 is not required; it's already implicitely set by -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen already. Try this: gswin32.exe ^ -o output.pdf ^ -sDEVICE=pdfwrite ^ -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen ^ -dNumRenderingThreads=2 ^ -dMaxPatternBitmap=1000000 ^ -c "60000000 setvmthreshold" ^ -f input.pdf Also, if you are on a 64bit system, try to install the most recent 32bit Ghostscript version (9.00). It performs better than the 64bit version. Let me tell you that downsampling a 600dpi scanned page image to 72dpi usually does not take 23 seconds for me, but less than 1.
