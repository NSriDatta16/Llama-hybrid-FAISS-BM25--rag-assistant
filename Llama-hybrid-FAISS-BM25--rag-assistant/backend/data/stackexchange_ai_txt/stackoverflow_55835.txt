Is there a reliable way to prevent cheating in a web based contest where anonymous users can vote?

I'm working on a web-based contest which is supposed to allow anonymous users to vote, but we want to prevent them from voting more than once. IP based limits can be bypassed with anonymous proxies, users can clear cookies, etc. It's possible to use a Silverlight application, which would have access to isolated storage, but users can still clear that. I don't think it's possible to do this without some joker voting himself up with a bot or something. Got an idea?
