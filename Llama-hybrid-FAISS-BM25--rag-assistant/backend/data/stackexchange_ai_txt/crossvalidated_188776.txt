You already have a hint from @whuber on how to solve the problem and I encourage you to work through it. I am going to offer another approach that is based on an application of a famous inequality relating probabilities and expectations. First, recall the definition of convergence in probability. We say that a sequence of random variables $X_n$ converges in probability to a random variable $X$ if for every $\epsilon>0$, it holds that $$\lim_{n\to \infty} P\left[|X_n - X| We will work with the complement of the above probability. Pick an $\epsilon>0$ and let's try to compute $$\lim_{n \to \infty} P\left[|X_n - 0| \geq \epsilon \right] = \lim_{n \to \infty} P\left[X_n \geq \epsilon \right]$$ due to the nonnegativity. Applying Markov's inequality , we get $$\lim_{n \to \infty} P\left[X_n \geq \epsilon \right] \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{ \mathbb{E}\left[X_n \right]}{\epsilon} \to 0$$ by assumption. Since the probability of the complement goes to zero and $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, the probability of the event $\left\{ X_n
