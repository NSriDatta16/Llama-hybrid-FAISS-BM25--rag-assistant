Real world model training in R: how to get instant feedback?

I want to train a model. I can just randomly choose method (e.g. random forest), put whole dataset, wait a few hours, check accuracy, plot every possible curve (like accuracy vs train size) and see from the chart that i could have chosen different number of trees or different mtry or just to stop earlier because error rate doesn't seem to decrease. If I could see all those curves being plotted during the training, I could make the process shorter or at least estimate the duration. So my question is: how it's being done in the real world? Does R provide some way of on-the-fly plotting, or maybe we have to program it by ourselves? Like train only using some subset, plot, train again using a bit bigger subset and plot again? Or maybe there is a way to train the model incrementally? Then we don't have to train each time new model from scratch.
