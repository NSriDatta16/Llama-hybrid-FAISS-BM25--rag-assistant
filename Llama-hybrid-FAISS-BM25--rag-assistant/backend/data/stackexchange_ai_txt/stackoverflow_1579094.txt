Using Swing I tend to organise things so that the component tree can be created without a Window at the top. Doing this allows you to simply create a JPanel in a unit test and use that as your top-level component. There are certain things you cannot test, such as focus and any logic involved in the creation of the Frame for normal operation, but the vast majority can be tested. You may want to look into the FEST library to make life easier whether you go headless or not, it looks very good: http://fest.easytesting.org/swing/wiki/pmwiki.php
