You can use sprintf which is only a basic version but requires no extra libraries, examples Follow $String = "Firstname %s, lastname %s, Age %d"; echo sprintf($String,"Robert","Pitt",22); And also handles type casting and position replacements: $format = "The %2$s contains %1$d monkeys. That's a nice %2$s full of %1$d monkeys."; sprintf($format, $num, $location); All though i do like the look of jacob's answer :) taker a look at the great functionality of t his function and its sister function here: http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php
