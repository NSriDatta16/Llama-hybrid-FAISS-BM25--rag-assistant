What is the difference between deterministic and stochastic model?

Simple Linear Model: $x=\alpha t + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t$ ~iid $N(0,\sigma^2)$ with $E(x) = \alpha t$ and $Var(x)=\sigma^2$ AR(1): $X_t =\alpha X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t$ ~iid $N(0,\sigma^2)$ with $E(x) = \alpha t$ and $Var(x)=t\sigma^2$ So a simple linear model is regarded as a deterministic model while a AR(1) model is regarded as stocahstic model. According to a Youtube Video by Ben Lambert - Deterministic vs Stochastic , the reason of AR(1) to be called as stochastic model is because the variance of it increases with time. So is the feature of non-constant variance to be the criteria to determine the stochastic or deterministic? I also don't think simple linear model is totally deterministic as we have a $\epsilon_t$ term associated with the model. Hence, we always have a randomness in $x$. So to what degree can we say a model is deterministic or stochastic?
