As pointed out nobugs (thanks again), the problem really resided in the used 3rd party components - Infragistics. As I find out later, Infragistics team decided to keep static references to all the added controls in memory in order to support such (secondary imho) effects as XP theme changes. Really helpful on the problem was this article , the solution provided in witch replaced the kept in memory objects with WeakReferences, that can be collected by the GC. Luckily we used a older version of Infragistics that in the article and the solution worked. It's a pity, however, that Infragistics does not plan to fix this bugs, even declared years ago.
