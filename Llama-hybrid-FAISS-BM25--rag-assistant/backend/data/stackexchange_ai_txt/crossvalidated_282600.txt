It does not penalize the intercept. But it does penalize the covariates, which are correlated with the intercept. Thus, changing the estimates of the coefficients for the non-constant variables changes the estimates of the intercept. To help see that, note that in your dataset, all your covariates are in the interval $[-100, -99]$, making the estimate of the intercept highly correlated with the estimate of covariates; if you resimulate your data several times, you will note that for small $\lambda$, the estimated intercept is all over the place. If you remove the -100 from the creation of the covariates, the estimate of intercept is much closer to 0 for small values of $\lambda$, as the covariates are less likely to "drag" the intercept.
