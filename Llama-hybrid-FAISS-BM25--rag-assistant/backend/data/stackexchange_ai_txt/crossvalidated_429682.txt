Prediction interval for multi step forecast

If I have a multi-step forecast of some time series, where the model is some auto-regressive function $$y_t=f(y_{t-1},x_{1t},x_{2t})$$ is it a valid approach to use sections of historical data to train the model and than evaluate it on future section recursively to obtain the multi-step forecast. Doing this multiple times with different sections of my historical data I can obtain the forecast error $$e_t=\hat{y}_t-y_t$$ over the forecast horizon T. Can I use this error to estimate the prediction interval? Thanks!
