simpler understanding to "average" in demographics

I am trying to understand "Graph 7a: HES average 24-hour electricity use profile for owner-occupied homes, England 2010-11" in United Kingdom housing energy fact file , especially the definition of " average ". To make it simple, assume there are 3 families in that stats, consider the peak, around 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm. the average value is around 710 Watts, could it be interpreted as those 3 families consumed 900*2, 800*2, 430*2 respectively, in watt-hours. $\dfrac{(900*2+800*2+430*2)}{2*3}$ , the denominator part represents 2 hours and 3 families. the whole piece illustrate how average defines. Is my understanding correct?
