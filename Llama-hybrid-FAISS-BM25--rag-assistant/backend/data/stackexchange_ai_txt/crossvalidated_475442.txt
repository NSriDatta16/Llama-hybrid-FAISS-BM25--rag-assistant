LMER model failed to converge due to repeating identical observations by ID, what now

I have a mixed fixed and random effects model: m1=lmer(pollution~ GDP2018 + vehicle_percapita + HH_SolidFuel + interruption + obs_seasons + interruption:HH_SolidFuel + days +interruption:days + interruption:GDP2018 + interruption:obs_seasons + interruption:vehicle_percapita + ( 1 + days | SiteName), data=new8, REML = FALSE) I've figured out why i'm getting the "model failed to converge" error ... for each SiteName (my random term) I have repeating observations for the other predictors ie SiteName Days GDP Uganda 1 10,000 Uganda 2 10,000 Uganda 3 10,000 ...... for up to 2000 observations by Site (GDP would differ by site but not within site) so when I remove the random effect "Site Name" my model runs smooth but I need to account for this important random effect based on intuition/literature/ etc. my question is how can i include SiteName (evaluate/ control for the random effect of site on pollution) in a model, knowing that by site there are many identical responses for certain variables over the whole time period.
