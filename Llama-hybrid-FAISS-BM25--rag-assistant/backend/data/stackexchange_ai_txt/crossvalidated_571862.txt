Categorical and ordinal variables and one dependent discrete variable

√ç have a dataset with two categorical variables: let's say "city type" (categorical) and "living crampedness" (ordinal), and one discrete dependent variable ("house square meterage"). I'm supposed to analyze whether the two independent variables explain or have a relationship to the dependent variable. Any tips on how to go about this?
