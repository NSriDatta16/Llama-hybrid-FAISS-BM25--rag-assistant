Simplified Bayesian networks are graphical models to define joint probability distributions. The main use for such a joint distribution is to perform probabilistic inference or estimate unknown parameters from known data. Bayesian networks and other generative probabilistic models like HMMs, Boltzmann machines can also be made to works as classifiers by estimating the class conditional density. In general, regression is just like classification except the response variable is continuous. Take for instance the linear regression (statisticians "horse") especially in supervised case. How to get classification from linear regression? With kernels linear regression can model nonlinear patterns and when continuous output (Gaussian) is replaced with binomial or multinational distribution you get the classification.
