IE 6 OR IE Tester -

took me a long time to figure this out and was wondering if it is IE 6, IE TESTER or something i have done. im creating a session to store quotes, which i am using md5($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) The problem being when i tested in IE 6 in the IE tester application, results are being inserted but the quotes are not being retrieved. After some digging and looking i found that the token being used to retrieve the quotes and the token being used to insert the quotes where different. On the main page, i added this; " /> " /> which returned; which i was expecting. yet when i applied the same test to the php script that was inserting the data it returned this; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2) 127.0.0.1 can anyone tell me why it is saying that the second script is being ran through IE 8 ?!?! regards, Phil
