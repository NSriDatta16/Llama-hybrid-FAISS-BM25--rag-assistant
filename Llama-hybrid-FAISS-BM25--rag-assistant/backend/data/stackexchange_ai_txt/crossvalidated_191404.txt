Difference between the effect and the contribution of a regressor

I have a very basic question about the difference between effect of a regressor and its contribution. Consider the following simple case. In economics, Gross Domestic product is defined as the sum of consumption, investment, government expenditure and net exports. Consider that we have the following time series of observations: $C_{t},I_{t},G_{t},X_{t}-M_{t}$ Now, $Y_{t}$ is defined as: $$Y_{t}=C_{t}+I_{t}+G_{t}+X_{t}-M_{t}$$ If we were to run a regression of $Y_{t}$ on the RHS regressors, we would get an $R^{2}$ of 1 and \beta of 1 as well. This is because this model is deterministic. My question is, although the effect of these regressors is all the same, how can we judge the contribution of each of these to the regressand? Is partial $R^{2}$ a good way to do this? Also, the contribution will be different for each observation. Would the partial $R^{2}$ be a measure of average contribution?
