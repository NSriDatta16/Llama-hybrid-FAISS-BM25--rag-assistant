Time series forecasting using Gaussian Process regression

I used Gaussian Process Regression to predict a time series, what I have is sensor's readings that come every hour ( I have data for about 3 years) I chose the periodic kernel function mentioned here [1] which looks like this $$ K(x,x′)=\sigma^2 \exp(−2\sin^2(π|x−x′|/p)/\mathcal{l}^2) $$ The period p simply determines the distance between repetitions of the function. In my data I can observe 2 kind of periods (every 8 hours, every 24 hours) so P in this case can be 8, 24 1.how can I estimate the other hyper parameters $\sigma$, $\mathcal{l}$? 2.how can I plug the two periods in this kernel function?
