In an SVM, $y\in\{-1,1\}$. This is because the classifier is measuring the distance from the separating hyperplane, so it's sufficient to just check the sign (last line of the image you posted). You can use any two distinct values, but this will only make your life harder because your derivation will involve lots of tedious arithmetic to move around constants.
