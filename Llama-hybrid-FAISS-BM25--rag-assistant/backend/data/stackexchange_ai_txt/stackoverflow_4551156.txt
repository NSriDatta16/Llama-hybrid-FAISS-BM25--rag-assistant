Ctrl + Alt + Del is a system hot key registered by the process winlogon in early versions of Windows (that is, 2000/XP pre SP1). You cannot override the registration or hook the WM_HOTKEY message (at least not in a safe way). It is understandable that the OS prefers operating system (specifically the Winlogon process) rather than a third party program to get the user's password, but want to be flexible in case the user want to authenticate via fingerprint, smart card, etc read more here . On Windows 2000/XP the official way to customize the login experience is to write your own Gina (detailed in the article linked in ig2r's reply) but Gina can conflict with each other (e.g. A Think Pad laptop with fingerprint login has problem with McAfee Safeboot, pcAnywhere, etc). Gina is gone in Vista. On Windows Vista or later the way you can customize the logon experience is credential provider . It's extensibility is limited, but you still get an HWND via ICredentialProviderCredentialEvents::OnCreatingWindow in case you want to display a dialog in response of credential provider events. The documented way to use the HWND as the owner of your dialog (be win32 or MFC or whatever). Of cause there is always the keyboard driver filter approach, provided you know driver development and user mode-kernel mode communication for each Windows version. You can even block the whole keyboard if you want.
