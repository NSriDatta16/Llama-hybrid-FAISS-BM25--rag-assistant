storing an jpg image from internet to disk / db

I don't know which is the most efficient way of organizing images downloaded from server. I will be downloading around 200 images on to my iPhone on request for download. Which is the most efficient way of organizing ? just dropping it as a file on the phone's memory or having it in sqlite (via coredata) after download ? which one is most efficient and easy to handle ? which access is faster ?
