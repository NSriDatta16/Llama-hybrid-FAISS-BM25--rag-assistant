Social/Open Log-In: Magento?

Its easy enough to install/configure something like ShareThis but what about the social "log-in" plug-ins that are increasingly popular? e.g. "sign in with"... Facebook Twitter OpenID My questions are this: Does the development of each of these three have to be done separately or can it essentially be replicated for each. If a user chooses to "sign in with"...Facebook, Twitter or OpenID is there a compromise on the admin/store owner? what would the store owner loose by letting users do this? When users create accounts this way, are they given a regular user account (site.com/magento/index.php/customer/account/index/)??
