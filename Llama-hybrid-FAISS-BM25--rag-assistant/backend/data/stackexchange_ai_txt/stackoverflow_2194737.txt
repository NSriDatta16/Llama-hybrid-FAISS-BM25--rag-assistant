How to grow a textbox to match size of input for data entry dynamically (ASP.NET)

I'd like to add a description field to an application that can be as long as several lines (or even paragraphs) or as short as a one-liner. Instead of taking up a lot of screen real estate or have scroll bars, it would be preferable to have the textbox grow based on its input. On IE6 adding Style="overflow-y:visible" accomplishes this nicely (both on display of read only, and if we are in edit mode). However, it has no effect on Firefox, or IE7 for that matter. Is there a relatively easy fix for this? Thanks!
