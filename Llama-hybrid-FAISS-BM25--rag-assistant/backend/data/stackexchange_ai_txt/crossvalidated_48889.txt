What machine learning algorithm solves this problem?

I want to solve this classification problem. Basically what I have is a sequence of feature vectors $\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\dots,\mathbf{x}_N$, and each feature vector is sequential in time. I want to predict the class label $y$ based on the observation of these $N$ feature vectors. The outcome label $y$ can be from a set of two possible classes $y \in \{A,B\}$. So my question is: What machine learning algorithm is best suited for this kind of problem? I know sequential learning like Hidden Markov Model, but they are more suitable for the case where each observation $\mathbf{x}_i$ corresponds to a hidden state $y_i$, versus here in my case only the final class label is needed. There is no hidden states along the time in my problem. So the goal is to predict the class label $y$ based on a sequence of feature vectors $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$. Any suggestions?
