What is the most "elegant" way to define a global constant array in PHP

I was wondering what do you think would be the best and cleanest way to define a constant array variable similar to the way define function works. I've seen a lot of people asking this question in Google and so far the easiest solution I have come up with is to use the PHP serialize function inside the define statement, like this define ("MY_ARRAY", serialize (array ("key1" => $value1,"key2" => $value2, ..))); then to use the defined constant you can do something like this: $MY_ARRAY = unserialize (MY_ARRAY) print_r ($MY_ARRAY); Not sure if the serialize function will slow you down if you have a lot of defines in your code. What do you think?
