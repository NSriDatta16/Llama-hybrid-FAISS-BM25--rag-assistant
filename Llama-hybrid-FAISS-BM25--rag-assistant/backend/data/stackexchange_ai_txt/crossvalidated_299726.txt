I get a different accuracy each time I run a classifier on my data

I'm trying to perform binary classification on a data (80 sample data points, 39542 predictor dimensions). The data contain 2 classes, one in 18 samples and the other one in 62 samples. I split my data into training, validation, and test samples, but each time I run the classifier it gets a different result, e.g., 0.87, 0.83, 0.70, or even sometimes 0.50. I tried SVM or DT - both give almost the same result. What does this indicate? Does this mean my data is noisy? Is there any way that I can stabilize my result?
