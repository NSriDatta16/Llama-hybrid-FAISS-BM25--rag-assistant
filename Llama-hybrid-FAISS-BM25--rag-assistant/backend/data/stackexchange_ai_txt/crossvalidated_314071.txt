Using parallel tempering, is it possible to swap too often?

In parallel tempering I have replicas of the Markov chain I'm studying evolving at different temperatures , and intermittently I swap the replicas on a nearest-neighbouring temperatures basis. Between swaps I evolve the replicas independently for $M$ Monte Carlo steps. Is it possible to set $M$ too small and stop the algorithm from reaching equilibrium? Or just cause it to perform worse than independent Markov chains?
