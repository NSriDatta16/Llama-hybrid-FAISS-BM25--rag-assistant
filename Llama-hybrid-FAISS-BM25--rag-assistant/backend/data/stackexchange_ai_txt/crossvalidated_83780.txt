How to compare two different predictors

I have developed a new predictor based on neural networks for a specific problem in bioinformatics. This predictor takes as inputs several features and returns a boolean target value. Additionally i have runned my dataset through other already published predictors (none of which based on neural networks). From all these results i have generated 9 contingency tables (one per predictor) based on the target value and the predictor response like the one below. Target | 0 1 | ----------------| Prediction 0 | 123 10 | 1 | 5 171 | ---------------- Is there any way to compare these statistical tables in such a manner that i can state that my predictor is better or worse than any of the other predictors supported by a significant p-value? Note that i have the results table for all cases (Ei) in my dataset for all the predictors (Pj), like: P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 P9 E1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 E2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 E3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
