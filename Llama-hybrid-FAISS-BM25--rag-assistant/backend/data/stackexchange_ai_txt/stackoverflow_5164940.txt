Sharepoint service web service problem: Unauthorized

all I'm a phper and new to sharepoint. I'm now developing a website using php and file storage service with sharepoint service 2.0 By enabling anonymous authentication in IIS, the web service itself can be accessed to with no problems. Here's my question. When debugging my code, I keeping receiving "Unauthorized" error. The exception message looks like SoapFault Object ( [message:protected] => Unauthorized [string:Exception:private] => [code:protected] => 0 [file:protected] => /var/www/snippet/wsdl/index.php [line:protected] => 12 [trace:Exception:private] => Array ( [0] => Array ( [function] => __doRequest [class] => SoapClient [type] => -> [args] => Array ( [0] => Issue [1] => http://192.168.56.101/sites/SPS2003/_vti_bin/Lists.asmx [2] => http://schemas.microsoft.com/sharepoint/soap/GetList [3] => 1 [4] => 0 ) ) [1] => Array ( [file] => /var/www/snippet/wsdl/index.php [line] => 12 [function] => __call [class] => SoapClient [type] => -> [args] => Array ( [0] => GetList [1] => Array ( [0] => Array ( [listName] => Issue ) ) ) ) [2] => Array ( [file] => /var/www/snippet/wsdl/index.php [line] => 12 [function] => GetList [class] => SoapClient [type] => -> [args] => Array ( [0] => Array ( [listName] => Issue ) ) ) ) [previous:Exception:private] => [faultstring] => Unauthorized [faultcode] => HTTP [xdebug_message] => SoapFault: Unauthorized in /var/www/snippet/wsdl/index.php on line 12 Call Stack: 0.0004 637376 1. {main}() /var/www/snippet/wsdl/index.php:0 0.0006 758992 2. SoapClient->GetList(array(1)) /var/www/snippet/wsdl/index.php:12 ) and my code snippet's something like $client = new SoapClient("http://192.168.56.101/sites/SPS2003/_vti_bin/Lists.asmx?wsdl"); try{ $result = $client->GetList(array("listName" => "Issue")); } catch(Exception $e){ print_r($e); } Could it be the IIS configuration's fault? I'm using sharepoint service 2.0 and sharepoint portal server 2003. So, could anyone help me out? Thanks in advance.
