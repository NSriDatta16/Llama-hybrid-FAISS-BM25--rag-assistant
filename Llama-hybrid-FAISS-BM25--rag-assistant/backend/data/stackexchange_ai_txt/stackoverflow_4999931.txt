According to the URI RFC : Other characters are excluded because gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify such characters, or they are used as delimiters. unwise = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "[" | "]" | "`" Data corresponding to excluded characters must be escaped in order to be properly represented within a URI. Trusting a browser's response or ability to handle a link is risky. They do everything they can to return a page, instead of enforcing the standards, so they are not authoritative sources whether a page or URL is correctly defined. RestClient's response is probably based on URI's, which returned the same error when I tested parsing the URL using URI. I haven't ever seen a URL using unencoded "[" and "]" characters.
