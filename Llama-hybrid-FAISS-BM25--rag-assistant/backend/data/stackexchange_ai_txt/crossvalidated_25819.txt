Your professor makes some bold claims. I suspect that the problem was unfamiliarity with R language, not the actual results produced. I work in a company which does a lot of econometric modeling and we do everything in R. I also converted my economist colleague into using R. Concerning field of economics in my personal experience, reliability issue might go the other way around. For example EVIEWS version 5 had some strange bugs when working with panel data. And it reported usual Durbin-Watson statistic for pooled OLS, which in panel-data setting is plain wrong. R package for working with panel data has its issues too, but the money argument here plays strongly in R favor. Recently I was in course on non-stationary panel time series methods. The lecturer used RATS software. When demonstrating some code he advised clicking on some icon which cleans the workspace several times, just in case. Talk about reliability.
