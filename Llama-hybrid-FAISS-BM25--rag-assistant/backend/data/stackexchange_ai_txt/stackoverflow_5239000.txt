Starting urls without a protocol (http://, etc) means it is relative to the current document. If the different pages are in different folders then the file that relative URL points to will change, which is probably your problem. Starting a URL with a slash makes it relative to the entire domain/subdomain the page is on. I consider this a good practice so would encourage you to use it. In your example however you are following it with ../../, which are "directory above" hints, which are ignored because you are already at the base of the domain.
