Drag and drop example?

I have a simple question,I searched the internet already but i can't really find an example. I just need something simple: I have 2 listviews and i want to have drag and drop. But it has to be in WPF and MVVM. The examples i found weren't that clear.I have problems with handling the events. Someone who can help me out and give a good link to a nice example or tutorial?
