Firstly, there are a couple of things you need to be careful about. LDA, RF, and NBC are classifiers, so this assumes that each object (person) is assigned to a class label. Your question, however, states that you want to be able to somehow predict individuals based on concentration values, which implies a 293-class prediction problem. You didn't say you wanted to use concentration values to predict location, state, or region. This would be impossible since would only have 1 object per class label (a sparse or ill-conditioned problem). What you could do first is determine if there is a significant difference between concentration values (for each of the 7 substances) across location, state, and region using nested ANOVA. Nested ANOVA is a telescoping-type test of mean differences for concentration values for which you assign subject IDs within regions, within states, within locations. (lookup nested ANOVA examples in R). The main questions you want to answer with ANOVA is: Does region matter, does state matter, or does location matter, where "matter" implies: Is there a significant difference in average value of concentration for one (of the 7) substances across the various regions, states, locations? As a beginner, I would recommend running nested ANOVA with one dependent variable which is set to one of the 7 substances. (that is, you need to run 7 nested ANOVA analyses). There is a way to shotgun all 7 substances into nested ANOVA at one time, but if you don't know the multivariate Hotelling Test and/or multivariate repeated/nested MANOVA, don't go there. For correlation between concentrations of the 7 substances, you can simply run Pearson (or Spearman rank) correlation for the entire dataset, and then run correlation of the same within each region, state, or location. You don't have to do this, but it could reveal different patterns. I have never heard of a nested correlation methods. You could also run a regression analyses instead of ANOVA by using a "panel data" approach. (lookup panel data-based regression analysis of the Boston Housing data, for which there are zip codes within neighborhoods, within counties, etc.) For R, lookup something like "panel data analysis using R". I like to use GEE regression for panel data (nested data) instead of using nested ANOVA, since I commonly run regression instead of the ANOVA (it's the same thing). Now that we are done addressing the nested hierarchy of your data, it's important to note that LDA, RF, NBC are not nested-friendly, but rather are for straightforward unnested classification analysis. But what you could do is determine if concentration values among the 7 substances predict region, state, or location based on LDA, RF, NBC, etc., in which you use the class labels for region, state, or location as the categorical outcome you are trying to predict.
