I think you're leaving out another part of the story, which I believe is that your data is a time series: what you pay for an item over time. Your Total_Cost reflects two things: how many items you buy in each time period (Quantity), and how much they cost (Average_Cost). By breaking it into those two pieces, you can better track what it is you care about. You'd never look at the relationship between Average_Cost and Quantity. You'd be looking at Average_Cost versus other variables (including time). You could of course try to look at Quantity versus other things, but it could be that Quantity is a "nuisance" parameter: something that you want to factor out of your analysis. I'd also add that Average_Cost is better named simply Cost in this example. It'd be Average_Cost if you averaged across multiple time purchases or if you were purchasing different kinds of things. As it is, you're taking the total bill (Total_Cost) and using Quantity to derive actual cost per thing.
