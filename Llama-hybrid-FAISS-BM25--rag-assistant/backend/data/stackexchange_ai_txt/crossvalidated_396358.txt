Could you please explain your model in more detail. The Python code obscures what's happening, since an X matrix and Y matrix tell us little about the actual model. What are your X's for each sample, and what is your Y -- at what point in time? Is each observation a point in time and you can have multiple observations from a single game? In that case, the observations are not independent. (Not to mention that if you're not careful, you will be using information "from the future" in your model, which will cause it to perform unrealistically well.) Is your model, in the end, identifying individual players or competitions and therefore simply predicting that good players (or players that play in certain venues) are more likely to win? Machine Learning will pretty much always find a signal: the question is what is the signal? As an example of what I mean, I once heard a talk by an incredible data scientist who won a competition to predict the severity of cancer for patients based on MRI results. She looked back at the data after the fact and figured out that what her model had really done was to identify which cancer center the patient had gone to for their MRI -- which MRI machine they had used, actually -- and since different cancer centers tend to see patients with different levels of severity, that was what her model was predicting.
