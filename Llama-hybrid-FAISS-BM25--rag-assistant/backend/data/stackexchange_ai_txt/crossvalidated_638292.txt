What's a sensible way to put a credible interval on samples in [0, 1]?

Say I take a bunch of measurements of a discrete random variable in {0, 1} (coin flips of a weighted coin for instance). I understand that a reasonable way to report on the mean and credible interval is to introduce a uniform beta distribution as a prior and treat each coin flip as a bayesian update. The resulting expectation value is slightly less aggressive (less towards either 0 or 1) than a straight average, and the confidence interval can be computed via the inverse cdf. Right, now let's say I have a continuous random variable in [0, 1]. What's the analogous "reasonable" way to do the above? I don't think it's to use a guassian prior because this has a few issues: It has non-zero probability outside of [0, 1]. The expectation value may be overly-aggressive. Getting a single 1 would give an expectation value of 1 which feels unfair. I've found the error bars are far wider than the Bernoulli version above, given the same number of experiments.
