After few hours checking the samples and my code, the problem was because of event definition of the Event indeed.(Thanks Mihir and Dabblernl). I've done a mistake in the 3rd argument of RegisterRoutedEvent method by providing the event type instead of a Handler type. The correct code is the following : public delegate void DropEventHandler(object sender, DropEventArgs e); public static readonly RoutedEvent DropEvent = EventManager.RegisterRoutedEvent( "Drop", RoutingStrategy.Bubble, typeof(DropEventHandler), typeof(DragDropHelper)); The error message was misleading.
