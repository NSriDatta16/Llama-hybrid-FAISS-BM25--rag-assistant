I also had some problems with running PartCover 2.3 on .NET Framework 4. Didn't want to use PartCover.NET4 as it seems that the browser have a bug which makes the coverage not appear in code view window. Fortunately looks like guys from Sharpdevelop managed to do the job. In Sharpdevelop 4.0 PartCover 2.3.0 works out of the box with .NET 4 and NUnit 2.5.8.
