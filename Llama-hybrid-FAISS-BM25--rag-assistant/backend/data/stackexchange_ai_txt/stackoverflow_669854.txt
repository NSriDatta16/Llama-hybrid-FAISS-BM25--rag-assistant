It is encouraged to generate random IVs for each encryption routine, and they can be passed along safely with the cipher text. Edit: I should probably ask what type of information you're storing and why you're using a salt with AES encryption, since salts are typically used for hashing, not symmetric encryption. If the salt is publicly available, it defeats the purpose of having it. What you really need to do is ensure the strength of your key, because if an attacker has the salt, IV, and cipher text, a brute-force attack can easily be done on weaker keys.
