Yes it does make sense to move to an RDBMS, which is made for handling data structured in just that, tables. Things tend to be messy when having spreadsheets referring to each other and they just keep on growing, something an RDBMS handles well. You could add features via SQL such as complex formulas in a much more simple way than with spreadsheets. The move (estimating, don't know enough about the data) seems easy since it's already well organized and you are dealing with this problem before it even is a problem. Footnote: out of usability concerns, I would allow the users to hang on to a similiar solution as they have now, GUI-wise. You can export/import data to, for example Google Docs or MS Excel, via csv or other file formats, which still allows you to have the backend in an RDBMS for maintainability, speed and indexing etc. There is a nice article on http://www.cazh1.com/blogger/thoughts/2007/03/excel-vs.shtml which emphasizes just that differentiation of use: quick & dirty: go for spreadsheets maintainability & long-term-storage: go for a database
