That's not how CLS compliance works. It is something that's your burden. C# doesn't restrain itself to strict compliancy itself, that would make it a language with poor expressivity. Dragging all .NET languages down to the lowest common denominator would have quickly killed the platform as a viable programming environment. It is up to you to ensure that the publicly visible types in your assembly meet CLS compliancy. Making sure that class members don't differ only by case is very simple to do. Let the compiler help you out by using the [assembly:CLSCompliant(true)] attribute and the compiler will warn you when you slipped.
