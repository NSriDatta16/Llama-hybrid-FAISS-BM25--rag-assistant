$database is not in the scope of function GetGameNumber . The easiest, though not necessarily best, solution is query($query); // line 5 return mysql_result($result, 0); } ?> global is deemed not perfect because it violates the principles of OOP, and is said to have some impact on performance because a global variable and all its members are added to the function's scope. I don't know how much that really affects performance, though. If you want to get into the issue, I asked a question on how to organize such things a while back and got some good answers and links.
