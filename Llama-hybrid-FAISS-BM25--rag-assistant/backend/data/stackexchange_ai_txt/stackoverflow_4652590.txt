iPhone Could Not Support Development

I recently reinstalled OSX. It has been a pain rounding up all of my certificates, etc, but I finally am back. However, when trying to install an app on either of two iPhones 3G's I have, they both say: Software version: 4.2.1 (8C148) | XCode cannot find the software image to install this version. | Could not support development. What is going on? Both iPhones list themselves as up to date in iTunes, and iOS developer's center only lists 4.2 as the available SDK. EDIT: I do have a paid membership, and I have recently had test apps installed on both of these devices. UPDATE: I removed all 3 ( the 2 included ) of my devices from the provisioning portal, and deleted them from the organizer, closed XCode, detached device, restarted, plugged in device, no luck.
