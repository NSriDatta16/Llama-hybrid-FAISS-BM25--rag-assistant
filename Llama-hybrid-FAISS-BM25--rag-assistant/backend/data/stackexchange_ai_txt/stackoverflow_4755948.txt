Build simple cms web app with rest api

I have to build a simple cms-like webapp for a group of non profit organizations. Each one Of them will log into the app and manage its basic informations. I will then need to read this infos from other apps through a rest Service. I will love a final user app, something i will just have to setup. Is there anything i can start from? Will it be' a good investiment to spend some Time in learning a framework like django? Im new to Python (expert asp.net objc c# java html jscript, beginner php) How easy it will be to implement this in django? What about Zend, Symphony, CakePhp?
