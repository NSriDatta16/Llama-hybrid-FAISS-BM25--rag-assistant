If you looked in boost::signals library, you'll see an example very nice, that is very elegant: Suppose you have 4 functions like: void print_sum(float x, float y) { std::cout Then if you want to call them in a elegant way try: boost::signal sig; sig.connect(&print_sum); sig.connect(&print_product); sig.connect(&print_difference); sig.connect(&print_quotient); sig(5, 3); And the output is: The sum is 8 The product is 15 The difference is 2 The quotient is 1.66667
