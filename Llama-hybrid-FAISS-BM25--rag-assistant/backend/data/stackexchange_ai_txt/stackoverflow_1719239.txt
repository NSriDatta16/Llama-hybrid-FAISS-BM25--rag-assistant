This is clearly a homework problem, and you are clearly a beginning programmer. Your teacher can probably give you better help than we can. Some tips: You have copy-and-pasted code. You should get rid of about the first half of the program; you should only keep the variable declarations and the loop. For clarity's sakes C programmers usually have the \n at the end of a string, rather than the beginning of the next string. You shouldn't use a "for" loop iterating over values of 'x' to drive the user interface. If the user pressed "1" 28 times to calculate the GPA average, then pressed "2" to enter a grade, then pressed "1" to calculate the GPA average again, you'd divide the grade by 30 even though they only entered one grade. You should not iterate over 'x'. Instead, you should drive the user interface with a "while (True)" loop. You should increment 'x' only when the user chooses to enter a GPA. Your code for calculating 'total' is only run the very first time (when 'x' is 0). There are no other assignments to 'total'. Now do you see the danger of copy-and-pasted code?
