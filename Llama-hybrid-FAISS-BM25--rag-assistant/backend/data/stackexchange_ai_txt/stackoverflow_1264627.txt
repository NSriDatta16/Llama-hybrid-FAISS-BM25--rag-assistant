First way using union: select 'AD' union all select 'AE' .... The second - not obvious, but elegant - using recursive queries; declare @x as varchar(200) set @x = 'ADAEAFAGAIALAM' ;with FakeTbl AS ( SELECT substring(@x, 1, 2) sval, 0 as ROWN WHERE LEN(@x) > 0 UNION ALL SELECT substring(@x, (it.ROWN+1)*2+1, 2) sval, it.ROWN+1 as ROWN FROM FakeTbl it WHERE LEN(@x) > (it.ROWN+1)*2 ) select sval, ROWN from FakeTbl You places to @x string, assuming that code has len 2. Small restriction of this method is recursive level (for 2005 it is 100)
