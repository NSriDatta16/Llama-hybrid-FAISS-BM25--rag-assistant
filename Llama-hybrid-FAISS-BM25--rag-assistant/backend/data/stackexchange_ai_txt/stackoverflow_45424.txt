Struts 2: return to calling page

I'm using Struts 2 . I'd like to return from an Action to the page which invoked it. Say I'm in page x.jsp , I invoke Visual action to change CSS preferences in the session; I want to return to x.jsp rather than to a fixed page (i.e. home.jsp ) Here's the relevant struts.xml fragment: /pages/home.jsp Of course my VisualizationAction.execute() returns home . Is there any "magic" constant (like, say, INPUT_PAGE) that I may return to do the trick? Must I use a more involved method (i.e. extracting the request page and forwarding to it)? T.I.A.
