Objections against Java Webstart?

Since the release of Adobe AIR I am wondering why Java Web Start has not gained more attention in the past as to me it seems to be very similar, but web start is available for a much longer time. Is it mainly because of bad marketing from Sun, or are there more technical concerns other than the need of having the right JVM installed? Do you have bad experiences using Web Start? If yes, which? What are you recommendations when using Web Start for distributing applications?
