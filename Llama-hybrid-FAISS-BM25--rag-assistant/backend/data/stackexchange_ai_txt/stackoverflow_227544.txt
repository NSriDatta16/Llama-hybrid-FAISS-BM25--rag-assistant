It is vastly easier to write, debug, and maintain code that is free of compiler error messages, code-analysis warning messages, and routine accepted exceptions (particularly exceptions that are thrown in one place and accepted in another). Because it is easier, the code will on average be better written and less buggy. To me, that programmer and quality overhead is the primary argument against using try-catch for process flow. The computer overhead of exceptions is insignificant in comparison, and usually tiny in terms of the application's ability to meet real-world performance requirements.
