Alternative for Coefficient of Variation as measure of reliability for grouped estimations

I have conducted a series of pairwise relatedness estimations. The resulting relatedness values can technically range from 0 to 1 . I have then clustered the individual estimates into groups/populations of interest, and then calculated an average relatedness value for each group. My supervisor then advised me to calculate a coefficient of variation of the mean, or standard error of the mean expressed as a percentage of the mean within groups (since sample size per group varies). This is supposed to give some measure of reliability of the averaged relatedness measure of the group. Now, looking at the available literature, most papers using similar methods do not provide any measurement of this sort. They usually don't investigate the dispersion of their estimates within subgroups at all. I noticed that when the mean of estimates within a group is close to zero, the CVmean becomes very high, and I read that the "standard" CV approaches infinity as the mean comes close to zero. This, in my opinion, would make its application for our purpose relatively useless, since a mean relatedness of 0 would be quite informative and not unexpected. Would anyone be aware of an alternative and less problematic way to express the dispersion/variance of these estimates from the mean within a group? Each individual estimate has 95% confidence intervals associated with it, could there be a way to utilize those in some way? I found one similar question approaching topic, but with no answer provided. Edit to clarify: The estimates are relatedness values between individuals within a group. We want to know how closely related individuals within any group are, on average, and then use this information as a variable in other investigations. We essentially have, for example, pairwise estimates between ten individuals in one group, and would want to express how close the estimates are to the averaged estimated relatedness within that group. The spread from the average would hopefully tell us whether the average a good representation of the within-group relatedness, so we know we can use it. If lets say the relatedness values we get within a group are everywhere between -0.2 and 0.7 , and the average is 0.1 , the CVmean could potentially tell us if 0.1 actually does reflect the average relatedness within the group. Estimate here refers to an estimation of relatedness between two individuals from a population, based on comparisons of their genetic information.
