If that's all the data you have - that is, everyone in your data set has the illness - then there is no way to test your hypothesis. You would need data on a sample of people, some of whom have the illness and some don't and some of whom are western and some not. Then you could do chi-square, which is quite simple, but it would probably be better to also collect data on features related to the illness (such as age or whatever) and do a logistic regression with "illness" as the dependent variable.
