Unfortunately, as you seem to agree, you probably can't do this elegantly in Raphael. However , if, by some stroke of %deity% you don't need to support IE for this particular feature, you could forgo the Raphael API and manipulate the SVG directly . Then, perhaps, you could rig a mask to ride along the path and reveal the line at a natural pace. You could degrade gracefully in IE to simply show the path using Raphael, without animation.
