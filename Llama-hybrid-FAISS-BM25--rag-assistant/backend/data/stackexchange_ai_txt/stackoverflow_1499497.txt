Look at Breck Carter's Foxhound . It was built specifically for SQL Anywhere. I'm not sure it supports version 11, but as Graeme said there are built-in monitoring tools for that version. If file fragmentation is an issue, my experience with dbunload is that the rebuilt database files will also be fragmented to some extent. What you can do is stop the database server and run Sysinternal's contig against the .db and .log files.
