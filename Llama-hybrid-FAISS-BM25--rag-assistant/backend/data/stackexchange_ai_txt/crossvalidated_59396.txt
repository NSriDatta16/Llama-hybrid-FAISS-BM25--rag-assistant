It seems we dont have a very trustworthy response variable with which we may perform regression. What we could do is assign subjective probabilities of being positive to "positive", "likely positive" and "likely negative", say 0.95, 0.7 and 0.2 and then run 3 randomForests for three separate binary variables "positive/not positive", "likely positive/not likely positive" and "likely negative/ not likely negative". This would yield three separate predictions for each observation. You could get a probability estimate for each observation by performing a weighted average of the three predictions. Lets say a certain observation has predictions of "not positive", "likely positive" and "likely negative", the weighted average would be (0.95*0 + 0.7*1+ 0.2*1)/3 = 0.45, which would mean that based on your a priori subjective probabilities and the information available the observation is somewhere between "likely positive" and "likely negative".
