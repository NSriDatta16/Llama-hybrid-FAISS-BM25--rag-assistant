This wouldn't work for me with an iphone 3G running IOS 3.1.3. I verified that the distribution profile wasn't on the phone by looking at settings->general ( there was no profile option listed). I then installed the iphone config utility: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL851 Then: run iphone config drag and drop embedded.mobileprovision file to app click device on left side click "provisioning profiles" tab click on the profile and then click the "install" button Then the app installed just fine.
