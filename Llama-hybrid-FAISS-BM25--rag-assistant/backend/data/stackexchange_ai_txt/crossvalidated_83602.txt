k-NN classifiers do not output probabilities.You would need to transform distance to a probability yourself, for example by fitting a logistic regression model on the distance. The output of a k-NN classifier is in terms of distance of $\mathbf{x}$ to nearest member, e.g. $f(\mathbf{x}) = d \in \mathbb{R^+}$. You can transform this distance $d$ to a probability using logistic regression, e.g. find optimal coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ such that $$g(d) = \frac{1}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_1d)} \in [0, 1],$$ is a well calibrated probability of class membership. Your total classification would then resemble the following $g(f(\mathbf{x}))$.
