Can one-sided confidence intervals have 95% coverage

I was wondering given a one-sided (one-tailed) hypothesis with an alpha-level of .05 , can we be talking about 95% confidence intervals? For example, can we construct separately "one-sided" and "two-sided" confidence intervals for a one-sided Z or t test? what would be the "interpretation" of each of these confidence intervals given the one-sided test? I am a bit confused about this?
