For your application, where what you care about is ultimately the probability that an individual has property P, it seems that one of two simpler types of analysis should suffice. These analyses do not depend on distributions of the $X_i$ or $Y_i$, but simply whether an individual has property P and, possibly, to which sub-population it belongs. If all of your sampled sub-populations are independent random samples of the population as a whole, then what you describe is simply a Bernouilli trial, like flipping a biased coin many times. Your estimate of the overall proportion is simply the ratio of all $X$ cases to the total number of cases observed. This page on Bernouilli Confidence Intervals describes how to proceed for confidence intervals. You fear, however, that the probability of having property P may differ among sub-populations depending on some characteristic of the specific sub-populations, such as their size. Then you need to know which sub-population an individual belongs to in order to estimate the individual's chance of having property P. This latter possibility seems like a good candidate for logistic regression , where you examine how the probability of an individual having property P relates to one or more covariates associated with the individual. I don't know of a reason why the size of the sub-population containing an individual can't be such a covariate. Statistical programs that perform logistic regressions will provide confidence intervals for odds ratios, which can be translated back to the probability scale. The model you use to set up the regression should ideally be based on domain knowledge. If you instead use your data set to set up the model (like deciding whether you examine a relation to the absolute size versus the log of the size of the sub-population), your confidence intervals will be too optimistic.
