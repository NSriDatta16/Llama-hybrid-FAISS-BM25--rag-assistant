Yes, I think many algorithms take the advantage of all the information revealed by all the other arms at a time stamp. Let's take RL (Reinforcement Learning) for e.g There is a trade off of exploration and exploitation in RL. We apply e-greedy policy in which our agent chooses the action that corresponds to the largest expected value with e probability. In this we can easily see our agent is exploiting information given by different arms to continue to learn more about them.
