CakePHP Pagination with conditions on has_many

So I have a User table and a History table with User hasMany Histories, and I'm trying to implement pagination on the user table. My problem is that I have search, and some of the things one can search by are things in the History table. Is there a way to filter pagination results based on data in a table associated by hasMany? Containable, which initially seemed like a solution, allows such filtering but only in the retrieval of associated data, not the records themselves (unless I'm missing something?) Has anyone had to solve this before?
