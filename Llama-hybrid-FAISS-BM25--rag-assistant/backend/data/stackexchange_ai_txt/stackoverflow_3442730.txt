I used the example gave by microsoft to drag and drop an object from a ScatteredView to a Surface List Box but it is not working

I developped the example given by Microsoft to drag and drop and object from a scatterview to a surface list box. The scatterview is working, I can move the objects on it. But when I try to drag and drop them on the Surface ListBox nothing happen. I posed a breakpoint on the method OnDragSourcePreviewContactDown but it doesn't enter in. Anyone have an idea what could be the reason ? Thanks for your answers
