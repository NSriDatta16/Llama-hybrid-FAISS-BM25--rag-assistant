Is T Test the proper method to compare two character frequency tables?

Given two sets of histogram both arranged alphabetically: [ A ] containing the typical frequency of letters in the English language [ B ] containing the frequency of letters in this cryptogram (ignore character case, white spaces, and punctuations): Urerhcba Yrtenaq nebfr, jvgu n tenir naq fgngryl nve, naq oebhtug zr gur orrgyr sebz n tynff pnfr va juvpu vg jnf rapybfrq.

Also, given that the cipher used on this cryptogram was a simple substitution cipher, how do I determine the closeness of the two histograms? My end goal is to determine how many shifts do I need to make on [ B ] in order for it to align or best fit with [ A ] . I have stumbled upon this post , however I don't understand how should I apply it. If you would be so kind to show me the proper steps, as well as equations necessary to solve this problem, I would be very grateful. Thanks in advance!
