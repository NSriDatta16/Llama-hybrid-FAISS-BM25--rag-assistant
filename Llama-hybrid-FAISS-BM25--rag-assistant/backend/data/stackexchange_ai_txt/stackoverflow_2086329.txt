c#: Choosing or modifying a control to create draggable graphics on a canvas

I'm attempting to write a small app that will do something similar to what is shown here: http://www.soccertutor.com/tour/MASTER_SKIN_team.swf However I've not used WPF/Win Forms very much at all and can't seem to find a control that will be most applicable to the situation. I want to have some sort of grid for the pitch so I can have players, cones, other items snap to certain parts of the grid and I would like the players to be draggable onto the various grid squares. Thanks very much, I look forward to hearing your recommendations/suggestions!
