I consider EventAggregator events to be those that you want any old view or viewmodel written in other modules to listen to (or not, as they please). In the case that I have two views that are very dependent on each other to operate and they always live in the same logical tree, I use regular old .NET events . It's only the "fire and forget" type of events that I feel are appropriate for the EventAggregator . I know the samples in the Prism package seem to advocate their use in more tightly coupled master/detail scenarios, but I don't really think that appropriate (read: overkill). Although this doesn't directly address your issue (I'm of the mind that you have a memory leak as well), if you organize it like this you'll likely avoid this issue altogether.
