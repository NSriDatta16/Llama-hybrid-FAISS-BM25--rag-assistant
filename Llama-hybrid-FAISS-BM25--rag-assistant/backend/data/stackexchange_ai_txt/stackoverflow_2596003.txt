Starting with VS2010 we have ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute . Commenters have noted this to work in NCover as well as DotCover + NUnit. Example usage: [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] public class myUntestableClass { } Also see this link . They suggest using VSInstr as command line tool, it have /EXCLUDE options (it's not as handy).
