How do I divide the members of a list by the corresponding members of another list in Python?

Let's say I have two data sets. I have a week-by-week tally of users who tried my service. trials = [2,2,2,8,8,4] And I have a week by week tally of trial users who signed up. conversions = [1,0,2,4,8,3] I can do it pretty quickly this way: conversion_rate = [] for n in range(len(trials)): conversion_rate.append(conversions[n]/trials[n]) Can you think of a more elegant way? Bonus: The result of this is a list of ints [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] , not a list of floats. What's the easiest way to get a list of floats?
