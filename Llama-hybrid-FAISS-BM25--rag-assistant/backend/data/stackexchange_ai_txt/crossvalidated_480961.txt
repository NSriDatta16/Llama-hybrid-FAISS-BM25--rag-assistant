From what you describe, there's no reason to abandon the full four-predictor model. Unless it's extreme, VIF isn't much of a criterion for evaluating a model. It describes the correlations among the coefficient estimates. A high VIF just means some imprecision in those estimates. See this page among many other for discussion on implications of VIFs. Things like goodness of fit and predictive performance are much more important. There's little to be gained and potentially a lot to be lost if you remove the nominally "insignificant" predictor. There's a problem even in ordinary least-squares regression with omitted-variable bias : if you omit from a model any predictor that is correlated both with outcome and with another predictor, then the estimates of the coefficients for the retained predictors will be biased. In other types of regressions like logistic regression, you can have this problem even if the omitted predictor isn't correlated with the retained predictors . So I don't see much reason to omit dtn from your model.
