implementing a perceptron classifier

Hi I'm pretty new to Python and to NLP. I need to implement a perceptron classifier. I searched through some websites but didn't find enough information. For now I have a number of documents which I grouped according to category(sports, entertainment etc). I also have a list of the most used words in these documents along with their frequencies. On a particular website there was stated that I must have some sort of a decision function accepting arguments x and w. x apparently is some sort of vector ( i dont know what w is). But I dont know how to use the information I have to build the perceptron algorithm and how to use it to classify my documents. Have you got any ideas? Thanks :)
