Neither is correct. It's not clear from your fragment what you are trying to do, but the syntax to update one table with values from another would be more like: update table1 set (col1, col2) = ( select col1, col2 from table2 where table2.num = table1.id and table2.code = 'abc' ) where table1.id in (select num from table2); The final WHERE clause is to prevent updating all non-matched table1 rows with nulls. Another method that works when table1 is "key preserved" in the query is: update ( select table1.id, table1.col1, table1.col2 , table2.col1 as new_col1, table2.col as new_col2 from table1 join table2 on table2.num = table1.id ) set col1 = new_col1, col2 = new_col2;
