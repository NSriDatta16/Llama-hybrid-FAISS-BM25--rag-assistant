Interpret coefficients from logit/probit models with inverse definition of dependent or independent variable

I have a couple of empirical studies examining the determinants of credit ratings. Here, the dependent variable is a binary variable indicating whether a firm has a credit rating or not ($rating$). The studies use logit or probit models to estimate the impact of certain firm characteristics $D_1,...$ (as e.g., the firm's leverage ratio, market-to-book ratio, ...). The model can be formalized as: $$ rating_{ij} =\beta_0 + \beta_1D_1 + \beta_2D_2 + \dots + \epsilon_{ij} $$ I have two questions: (1) There are two different definitions for the dependent variable : (a) $rating_{ij}=1,$ if the firm has a credit rating, and 0 otherwise, or (b) $rating_{ij}=0,$ if the firm has a credit rating, and 1 otherwise. To directly compare the values for the coefficients $\beta_1,...$ from studies with type (a) and (b) definition, do I just have to change the sign for $\beta$ and the corresponding $t$-statistic? And the standard errors and p-values should be the same for both definitions? (2) In some studies the definition of the independent variables are inverse. E.g., some studies use market-to-book ratio as a independent variable $D_1$ and others use the inverse definition, which is book-to-market. How can I convert the $\beta_1, \dotsc$ from a study using book-to-market, such that the regression coefficient shows the marginal effect of a change in market-to-book? And how can I convert the corresponding standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values?
