"Comparing models" needn't involve (and in many situations, probably shouldn't involve) hypothesis testing. Note that trying to use the CDF as a transform will only work if you know the parameters ... but you don't. So you simply wouldn't get a uniform when you transform. In general the only level of certainty you can get that you have the correct model is 0% certainty (that is, you can nearly always be completely certain you have not identified the correct model). The point of a model is not to reproduce a phenomenon in its entirety -- we don't have access to enough information to reliably identify all the effects and their form (and usually, can never hope to) -- but instead to describe the most salient features while abstracting out/approximating the remainder. As it is put in Box and Draper: Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful -- George Box & Norman R. Draper, Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces Before you get to the point of comparing models, however, you need to be able to clearly formulate them. There are numerous time series models that you might find make sense for your situation, but at the least you should be aware of how the common ones are written and understood, and what the "tools of trade" are for identifying, estimating, diagnosing and predicting time series. To that end you should review some basic work on time series models and forecasting. There's a good, free (to read online) book - Hyndman and Athansopoulos, Forecasting Principles and Practice - that doesn't go heavily into theory here (scroll down for the links into the book chapters). You may also find the free to download* of Shumway & Stoffer's Time Series Analysis , 3E here of some use. * (this is from Stoffer's own staff web pages; there's the ordinary and "EZ" versions) Both of these books use the free statistical software R.
