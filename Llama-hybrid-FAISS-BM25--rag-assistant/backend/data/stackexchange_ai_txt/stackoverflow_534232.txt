Visualising Change In Version Controlled Files

We have been experimenting with using data visualisation techniques inspired by Edward Tufte to display our test suite and it has been very effective. I would like to extend this to our Subversion Repository as I feel that there is a lot of information buried in the commit history that COULD be better represented in a graphical format. I would like to be able to identify at a glance things like: which modules are comparatively stable - a lot of writing - a little maintenance and which ones have been written and rewritten which modules are all one persons work and which are the work of many Ideally I would like to annotate this information with other stuff from testing and performance tools, like: code coverage xref stuff like function call graph mebbies even things like processor utilisation under consistent load Anybody good any good tips, examples, utilities, etc, etc... Our shop uses mostly the mighty Erlang but we will take heart and inspiration from any source.
