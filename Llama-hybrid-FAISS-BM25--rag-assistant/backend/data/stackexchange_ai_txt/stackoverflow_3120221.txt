Cg and HLSL are almost the same (same builtin function names). GLSL looks and feels a bit different (i.e. mix instead of lerp , use of a main -like function), but the overall transition is still easy. The only differences are in the details and in the respective APIs (i.e. stuff like matrix storage order). Switching between shading languages is way easier than switching between GUI toolkitsâ€¦
