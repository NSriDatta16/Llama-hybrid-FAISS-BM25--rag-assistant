Comparing strength of correlation and cointegration

I am doing analysis of time series of returns on various currency pairs, commodities and stocks in Python/R and I would like to compare the strength of cointegration and correlation (Spearman's) between the various assets . Basically I would like to show quantitatively that those two differ and how much for the corresponding assets. To my knowledge I have not seen a cointegration measure of strength that would allow me to do so. The only idea I have had was the significance of the cointegration test, but I do not know how I would then compare it to the correlation.
