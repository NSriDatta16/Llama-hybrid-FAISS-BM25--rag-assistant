Interpreting logistic regression coefficients of a variable overall and levelwise

Context Let Y be a logical vector and X1 a factor with 3 levels. Since Y is binary, logistic regression is used. Y $coefficients) exp(fit.levelwise$ coefficients) Both these fits are not significant. Assuming the variables were significant, we could interpret the coefficients of the variables in terms of odds-ratio. When using as.factor(X1), it seems that dummy variables are created. Question How can one interpret a general coefficient (here X1) versus levelwise coefficients (factor.X12 factor.X13 factor.X14) ? > exp(fit.overall $coefficients) (Intercept) X1 0.6680935 1.0842614 > exp(fit.levelwise$ coefficients) (Intercept) factor.X12 factor.X13 factor.X14 0.6666667 1.0000000 2.2500000 1.0000000 Attempt to answer Here is how I would interpret these odd-ratios : With fit.overall, the odds of Y increase by a factor of 1.08 if X1 is increased of one unit. With fit.levelwise, the odds of Y are equal whether X1 is 1,2 or 3 and are multiplied by 2.25 if X1 is 3.
