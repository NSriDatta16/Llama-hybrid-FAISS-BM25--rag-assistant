I'd suggest having the actual project files ignored by the version control system due to the downsides you mentioned. If there is enough consistent information in the project settings that there would be benefit from having it accessible, copy it to a location that Eclipse doesn't treat as special, and you'll have it available to work with on checkout (and copy back to where Eclipse will pay attention to it). There is a decent chance that keeping the actual project files separate from the controlled ones will result in loss of synch, so I'd only suggest this if there is clear benefit from having the settings available (or you're confident that you'll be able to keep them synchronised)
