jQuery(':input').val(''); should select all your inputs and clear the value. I do not know however if and need special attention. Also, you might need to exclude invisible inputs if you have . In that case, consider: jQuery('[type!="hidden"]:input').val(''); EDIT Just read that I missed something. If you are selecting from a subset, select the subset first. jQuery('#subset :input').val('');
