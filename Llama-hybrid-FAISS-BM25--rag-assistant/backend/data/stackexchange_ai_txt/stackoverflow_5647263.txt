A/B Test Checkout Magento

our projectmanager wants to A/B test different payment methods. He wants to be able to test that with an external analysing tool e.g. Google Website Optimizer, Econda. Because you need two diffenrent URLs for that test I think we need two complete independent checkouts. Is it possible to override an existing checkout with a new frontname and two other payment methods? Do I have to clone the complete core checkout model? Thanks a lot. cradossk
