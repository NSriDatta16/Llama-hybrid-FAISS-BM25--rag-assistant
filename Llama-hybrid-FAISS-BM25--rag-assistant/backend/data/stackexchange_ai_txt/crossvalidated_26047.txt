Larger ngrams vs nested ngrams?

Whenever I see people using ngrams - I often see them looking for higher chains like 4-grams, 5-grams and so on. However, I'm wondering why I never see any mention of "nested ngrams" (I'm not sure what the real name is). For example, suppose you tracked the bigram "to follow" followed by the bigram "after dark" instead of the 4-gram "to follow after dark". Is there any reason to look into checking multiple nested levels of smaller ngrams instead of continuing to grow larger and larger ngram chains? It seems that one benefit might be storage costs.
