Is your double value in its own field, or is it in the partitionkey or rowkey field? PartitionKey and RowKey are always strings. I just created a simple test which writes and reads a row with a double field, and the values are preserved just fine. I modified the sample SmsMessage class from Bill Lodin's SMS code via msdev.com training (I took the int Delay field and changed it to a float, and renamed it to MyDouble for clarification): public class SmsMessage: TableServiceEntity { public double MyDouble { get; set; } public SmsMessage(string destination, string message, double myDouble) { PartitionKey = destination; RowKey = message; MyDouble = myDouble; } public SmsMessage() : base("", string.Format("{0:d10}", DateTime.Now.Ticks)) { } } I then write to the SmsMessageTable: smsTable.AddObject("SmsMessages", new SmsMessage(destination, message, myDouble)); smsTable.SaveChanges(); I view this in the table storage explorer, and my doubles are how I entered them (e.g. 1.2345). I then retrieve with a simple linq query, for a given username in the partition key: var results = from m in smsTable.SmsMessages where m.PartitionKey.Equals(txtDestination.Text.Trim()) select m; My double values are all preserved and strongly typed as doubles.
