As Friedman once said, robust standard errors provide the right estimates for the wrong quantities if the model is misspecified. This is not very appealing. And Gould has found that for binary logistic regression, sandwich estimators can be noisy, i.e, standard error estimates can have low precision. For logistic models we tend to use sandwich covariance estimates only when there is intra-cluster correlation, i.e., use the robust cluster sandwich covariance estimator.
