Never use the first code . As written in the Qt documentation there, it might not work in a non-English environment, due to the fact that the file name encoding is not by CFStringGetSystemEncoding() , which returns the primary non-unicode encoding of the user. Instead, the file name is always encoded by UTF8 (with a slight variant.) const char *pathPtr = CFStringGetCStringPtr(macPath, kCFStringEncodingUTF8); More precisely, you need to use CFStringGetFileSystemRepresentation . QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() (mostly) correctly takes into account these subtleties, so you should use the latter approach, if you want your app to work on non-English Macs.
