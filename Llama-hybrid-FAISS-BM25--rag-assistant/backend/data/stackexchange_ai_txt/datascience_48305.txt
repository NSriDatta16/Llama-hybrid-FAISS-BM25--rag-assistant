I think it is true. Tree based algorithms especially the ones with multiple trees has the capability of capturing different feature interactions. Please see this article from xgboost official documentation and this discussion . You can say it's a perk of being a non parametric model (trees are non parametric and linear regression is not). I hope this will shed some light on this thought.
