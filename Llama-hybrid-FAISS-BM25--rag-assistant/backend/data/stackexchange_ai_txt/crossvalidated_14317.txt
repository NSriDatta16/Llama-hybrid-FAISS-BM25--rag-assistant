First of all, AIC/BIC do not make sense in mixed models. I mean, if you can explain what your $n$ that goes into your BIC is (number of groups? number of observations? something in between? how about level 1 and level 2 variables that obviously have different amount information in them?)... So I wouldn't pay any attention to these. Second, I am surprised your model with the random effects for group level variables was identified at all. Let us think about an extreme case: a binary group level variable in the a model lmer(Y ~ X + G + (1 + X + G| group) . What is it that it describes? That a group has an additional random shift when G==1 , i.e., group-level heteroskedasticity. So that appears to be something rather odd to estimate. So all in all, I would run this as M2 i.e., only with an individual level covariates having random effects assigned to them.
