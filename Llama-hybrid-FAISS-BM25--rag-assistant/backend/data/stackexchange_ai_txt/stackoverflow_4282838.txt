Hi You can use the same certificate for multiple number of applications. Once your certificate is in place, you will be required to create a provisioning profile of your application. -Using this provisioning profile you can install your appilcation on iPhone. -For development purpose you should create a developer Provisioning porfile. -Once your application is tested and ready for sale on App Store you have to create a Distribution profile. -Once done with this process you are required to install that provisioning profile on your device. I recommend you should read the Apple documentation in your Agent account which you must have created as you have mentioned you already have a certificate. They have explained in detail a full walk through for creating a certificate and Provisioning profile. Hope this a cleared your initial doubts so that you can jump in for minute details.
