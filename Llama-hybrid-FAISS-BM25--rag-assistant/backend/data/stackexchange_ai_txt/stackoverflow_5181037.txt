How do I temporary disable warnings in my objective c source file?

One project I work on has a build system that enforces no warnings. But I have some code that needs warnings to work. Here is an example NSString* title = @""; if ([view respondsToSelector:@selector(title)]) { title = [view title]; } After some googling I tried disable warnings for the code block by wrapping that code area with #pragma warning disable // my code #pragma warning restore Didn't work :( Anyone know how to do this in Xcode? Any help is appreciated. -CV
