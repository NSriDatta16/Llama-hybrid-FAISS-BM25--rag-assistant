ATE is the average treatment effect, and ATT is the average treatment effect on the treated. The ATT is the effect of the treatment actually applied. Medical studies typically use the ATT as the designated quantity of interest because they often only care about the causal effect of drugs for patients that receive or would receive the drugs. For another example, ATT tells us how much the typical soldier gained or lost as a consequence of military service, while ATE tells us how much the typical applicant to the military gained or lost.
