Look at your past experience. Even though you're a novice, you were hired as a data scientist, so you'll probably have some experience with data science projects. A simple binary classification problem with a few hundred datapoints can be solved in a productive afternoon, whereas a large project that requires significant upfront engineering for the acquisition of your dataset could take months. Honesty is always key , as it leads to proper expectation management. Just stating the different phases of the project with an indication of how long they could take will already be quite nice. This could even be very rudimentary like: data acquisition: 1 week ~ 3 months EDA and preprocessing: ... If you don't have a better guess than 'somewhere between 1 week and 3 months', don't try to make a better guess. Because it will only lead to disappointment. Trust me, I'm speaking from experience here. Your supervisor will probably know you're a novice, and should not be offended and/or surprised if you come up with a timeline that is still quite abstract and prone to change over the coming time period. Also always take into account Hofstadter's law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law
