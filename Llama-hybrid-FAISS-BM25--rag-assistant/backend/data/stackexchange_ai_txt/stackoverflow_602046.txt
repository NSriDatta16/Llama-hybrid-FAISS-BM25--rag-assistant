Should I check the types of constructor arguments (and at other places too)?

Python discourages checking the types. But in many cases this may be useful: Checking constructor arguments. e.g. checking foe Boolean, string, dict etc. If I don't and set the object's members to the arguments it will cause problems later. Checking functions arguments. In properties. If someone sets a wrong value or different type, I should respond quickly.
