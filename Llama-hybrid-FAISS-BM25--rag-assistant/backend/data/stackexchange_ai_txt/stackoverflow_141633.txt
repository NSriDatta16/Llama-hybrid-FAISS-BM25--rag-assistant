The size of data you're talking about actually isn't that gigantic. I don't know what your efficiency concerns are, but if you can wait a few hours for it to insert, you might be surprised at how easy this would be to accomplish with a really naive technique of just INSERTing each row one at a time. Batching together a thousand or so rows at a time and submitting them to SQL server may make it quite a bit faster as well. Just a suggestion that could save you some serious programming time, if you don't need it to be as fast as conceivable. Depending on how often this import has to run, saving a few days of programming time could easily be worth it in exchange for waiting a few hours while it runs.
