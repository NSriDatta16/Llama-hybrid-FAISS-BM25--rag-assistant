Excluding the target variable, if your dataset has $n$ columns (predictors, covariates etc.), then your SVM separates the space $\mathbb{R}^n$ . So, Your SVM operates on $n$ dimensional data. The separating hyperplane is in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ , i.e. $n-1$ dimensional by definition, and its equation can be generally written as $w^Tx+b$ , where $w,x$ are $n$ dimensional, and $b$ , bias, is $1$ dimensional (i.e. a scalar). So, the hyperplane equation has $n+1$ coefficients, including the bias term, which means your parameter space is $n+1$ dimensional. I haven't heard a term like SVM dimension, but these are all the dimensionality concerns inside the classifier.
