Network traffic manipulation (Virtual LAN)

I am interested in learning more about manipulating network traffic to utilize LAN only programs (games in this case) over the internet. There already exists several programs that does this ( Hamachi , GArena ), but I am interested in learning how they approach this and how to build this from the start up. Obviously you need to capture the traffic - for Windows, I've heard mention of WinPCap which seems to be able to do what I need, though I need to study it further. What I'm looking for are articles, general knowledge and even books that can show me where to start, what to do, etc. Thanks.
