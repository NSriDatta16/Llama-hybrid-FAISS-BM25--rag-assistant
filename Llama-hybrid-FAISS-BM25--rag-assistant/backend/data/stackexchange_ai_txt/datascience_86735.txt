Standarizing the Label to postive intergers in Machine Learning Classification task, why is it recommended?

When doing a classification task suppose we have 3 targets with notation -2, -1, 0. I read somewhere it is a good practice to Standardize the labels to positive integers.. In this case suppose we change it to 2, 1, 0 . Why is it recommended? Theoretically I don't think it should matter since each class is unique. But in practice it matters, why?
