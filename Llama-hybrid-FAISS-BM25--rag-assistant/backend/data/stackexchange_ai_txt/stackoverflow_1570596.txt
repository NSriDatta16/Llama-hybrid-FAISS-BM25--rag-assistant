You are explicitly including ..\boost_1_40_0\stage\lib\libboost_program_options-vc100-mt.lib in the link. You should let the boost auto_link stuff configure do the correct #pragma comment(lib, ...) stuff ensure you bring in the right library and set the linker search path correctly. The most likely thing is that the boost library and your code are linking against different runtime libraries.
