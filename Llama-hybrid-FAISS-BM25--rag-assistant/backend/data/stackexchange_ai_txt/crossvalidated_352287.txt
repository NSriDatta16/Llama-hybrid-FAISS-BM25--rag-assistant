Book about ordination in ecology

I am looking for a book that would cover a lot of different ordinations techniques (indirect gradient analysis e.g. PCA, CA, DCA, MDS, nMDS but also direct gradient analysis e.g. CCA, CCorA, RDA) with applications in ecology (with R would be better) and mostly focusing on these methods. I think " Numerical Ecology " by Legendre & Legendre ( https://www.elsevier.com/books/numerical-ecology/legendre/978-0-444-53868-0# ) would be relevant but it seems to cover a very extensive number of topics. Any other idea ?
