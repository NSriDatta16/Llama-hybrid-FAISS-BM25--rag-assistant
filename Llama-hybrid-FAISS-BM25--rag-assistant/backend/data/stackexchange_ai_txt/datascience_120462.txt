Biased Learner In machine learning, a biased learner is a learning algorithm that consistently makes predictions that are systematically incorrect in some way . This means that the predictions made by a biased learner will be systematically different from the true values of the target variable , and this difference will not be random or arbitrary . For example, a biased learner might consistently over- or under-estimate the values of the target variable , or it might s ystematically favor certain values over others . This systematic error in the predictions made by the learner will introduce bias into the model , and it will affect the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by the model. One example of a biased learner is a linear regression model that assumes that the target function is linear . If the true target function is nonlinear , then the linear regression model will make systematic errors in its predictions , and it will be a biased learner . Another example of a biased learner is a k-nearest neighbors algorithm that assumes that the data is uniformly distributed . If the data is not uniformly distributed, then the k-nearest neighbors algorithm may make systematic errors in its predictions , and it will be a biased learner. Unbiased Learner In contrast, an unbiased learner is a learning algorithm that makes predictions that are not systematically biased in any way . This means that the predictions made by an unbiased learner will be unbiased with respect to the true values of the target variable . An unbiased learner will make predictions that are randomly distributed around the true values of the target variable , and the difference between the predicted values and the true values will be due to random error rather than bias . This will ensure that the predictions made by the model are accurate and reliable , and they will not be systematically biased in any way. Some examples of unbiased learners include decision trees and random forests , which make no assumptions about the data distribution or the functional form of the target function . These algorithms are expected to make accurate predictions on average, without any systematic bias.
