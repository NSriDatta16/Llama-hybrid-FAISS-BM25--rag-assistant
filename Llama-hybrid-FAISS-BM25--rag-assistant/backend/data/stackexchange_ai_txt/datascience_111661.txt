How to make good visualization of time series data using tableau?

The time series data looks like this: Month Count1 Count2 1 20 100 2 40 200 3 100 17 4 21 12 I have tried to use area charts or basic line/bar charts to visualize the two counts based on the Month. Are there any fancy way to visualize it? How about radial map?
