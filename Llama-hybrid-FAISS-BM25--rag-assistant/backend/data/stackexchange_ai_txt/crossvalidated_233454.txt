Notice that $(\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2)/\bar{X}_2 = (\bar{X}_1/\bar{X}_2)-1$. Now further notice that subtracting a constant doesn't change the standard deviation, so $\text{sd}(\frac{\bar{X}_1}{\bar{X}_2}-1) = \text{sd}(\frac{\bar{X}_1}{\bar{X}_2})$. And therefore the calculation is for that of a simple ratio of averages. So the theorem in question should apply directly (as long as otherwise the conditions for it to work still hold).
