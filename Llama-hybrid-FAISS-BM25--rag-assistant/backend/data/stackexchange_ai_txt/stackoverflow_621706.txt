If you are not expecting the code to change then a gigantic single file can be more convenient for the user. For example SQLite distribute their code as a monolithic source file that the user can easily incorporate into their own build. However, during development it is a terrible idea, for the reasons you mention and also because it almost guarantees that there will be RCS merge problems when more than one programmer is working on the project.
