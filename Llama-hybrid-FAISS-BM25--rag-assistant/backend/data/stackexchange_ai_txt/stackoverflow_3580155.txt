You may also want to look at Membase. http://www.northscale.com/products/membase_server.html I have not used it, but it appears to be similar to Redis in that it is a memory-centric KV store with persistence. The major differences from what I can see are: Redis has significantly more data manipulation capability (ordered sets, etc.) Redis has a pending Redis Cluster project to add horizontal scalability Redis has a single tier of data offload to disk (VM) based on a hybrid algorithm that considers both LRU and the size of the object. Membase uses the memcached wire protocol - useful as an upgrade path for existing applications Membase is set up to scale horizontally using a distributed hashtable approach Membase can support multiple tiers of data offload using an LRU approach (very seldom used goes to disk, somewhat seldom stuff goes to SSD, frequent stuff stays in RAM) Not sure about TTL capability in Membase. The choice may depend on the degree to which your application can leverage the extra data manipulation functionality in Redis.
