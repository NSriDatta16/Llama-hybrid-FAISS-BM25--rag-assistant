First, you shouldn't be using sudo inside of a script that is already running as root. Under the default Mac setup it shouldn't cause a problem, but it depends on how the user has configured sudoers. This still would be my biggest suspicion of what's breaking. Next, are you getting any error messages to console when this runs? You mentioned that other things are running; are they before or after this? Are you checking the unix error result from this script line? I'll assume you've read Creating launchd Daemons and Agents . You say that the script is running, so I'll assume that it actually has the extension .sh and that pFileName does not include the ".sh". TN2083 makes no reference to AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges . What do you mean by "as TN2083 states?" I assume you don't have setuid bits set on the script, correct? That will give you trouble with AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges .
