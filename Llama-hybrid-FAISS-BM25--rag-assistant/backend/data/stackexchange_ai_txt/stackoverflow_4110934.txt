So, this should hold true for all languages with eval : Basically, with few exceptions, if you are building the value passed to eval or getting it from a non-truested source you are doing something wrong. The same holds true if you are calling eval on a static string. Beyond the performance problems with initializing the parser at runtime, and the security issues, You generally mess with the type system. More seriously, it's just been shown that in the vast majority of cases, there are much more elegant approaches to the solution. However, instead of banning the construct outright, it's nice to think of it as one might goto . There are legitimate uses for both, but it is a good red flag that should get you thinking about if you are approaching the problem the correct way. In my experience, I've only found legitimate uses that fall in the categories of plugins and privileged user (for instance, the administrator of a website, not the user of such) extensions. Basically things that act as code coming from trusted sources.
