I'm guessing that you're seeing this delay when running your application via Xcode. Xcode has to set up a few things behind the scenes to grab console output, etc., which induces an initial delay on startup. My recommendation is to perform your application startup timings (from main() to -applicationDidFinishLaunching:) by launching the application manually on the device. Do this a few times to account for initial load artifacts. If you log your results to the console, you can then grab them using the Xcode organizer. I've seen much shorter startup timings when testing my applications this way.
