actually, you don't have to combine gesture recognizers - you can do this solely with UILongPressGestureRecognizer... You enter StateBegan once your touch(es) have stayed within 'allowableMovement' for 'minimumPressDuration'. You stay in your continuous longPressGesture as long as you don't lift any of your fingers - so you can start moving your fingers and track the movement through StateChanged. Long-press gestures are continuous. The gesture begins (UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) when the number of allowable fingers (numberOfTouchesRequired) have been pressed for the specified period (minimumPressDuration) and the touches do not move beyond the allowable range of movement (allowableMovement). The gesture recognizer transitions to the Change state whenever a finger moves, and it ends (UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) when any of the fingers are lifted.
