Predicted Probabilities Using Multi-level Logistic Regression

I am using PROC GLIMMIX to run a multi-level logistic regression model that contains a random intercept. I am outputting the predicted probabilities for each individual in my dataset, and then I am taking the average of these probabilities to get my average predicted probability over the entirety of the data. My average predicted probability should equal $$ \text{p} = exp(\pi)/(1+exp(\pi))\\ $$ However, I am getting slightly different answers. For instance, when I output the predicted probabilities in GLIMMIX I get $$ p=.0482359 $$ When I output the linear predictor I get $$ \pi=-3.1041776 $$ and $$ exp(-3.1041776)/(1+exp(-3.1041776))=.0429352616\\ $$ I don't know why I am not getting p=.0482359 for the last equation. Does anyone know why this is? Thanks.
