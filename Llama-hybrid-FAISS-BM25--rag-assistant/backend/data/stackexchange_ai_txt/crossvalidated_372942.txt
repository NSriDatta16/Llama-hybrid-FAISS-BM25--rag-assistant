Are self loops allowed in Markov networks?

I am studying about Markov networks from Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques Book by Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman . In Bayesian networks, it is clear that, it is a directed acyclic graph and hence self loops are not allowed. But what about Markov network? Does they allow self loops?
