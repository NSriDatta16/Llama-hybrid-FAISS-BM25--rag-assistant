A good web 'desktop' JavaScript, CSS, or both, library that likes ASP.NET Web Forms

I've come across, in passing, several suites of functions, widgets, frameworks, etc. that seek to produce a desktop like experience on the web. Most are JavaScript and CSS tools that handle web content on an emulation of the desktop-paradigmed UI, e.g. TreeView + Content == Explorer. Is there such a library nicely compatible with ASP.NET Forms without weeks of grief? I'll also settle for something similar, but instead of native ASP.NET, a library for any of the open source CMS products for ASP.NET. (Umbraco is at the top of my list, followed by mojoPortal. I aspire to the level of coding their creators easily demonstrate in the product. [PS, I don't want a 'desktop' ux per se, just light and simple dynamic layout for drag 'n drop, dock windows, a dock bar?.. and other fancy magic.
