Application of Metropolis Hastings

I am trying to implement the Metropolis Hastings algorithm for Bayesian analysis. In this case, the parameter of interest is the scale parameter for a Weibull distribution. The context is for reliability estimation; the scale parameter is analogous to the service life of an item. I am working in R. I have data that has an "Age" property that is the age at which an item failed. There is no censored data. I fit the data to a Weibull distribution: weib_fit I create a function to serve as the prior distribution based on some assumed 2-param Weibull distribution: f I create a liklihood function using the data parameters: data_shape $estimate["shape"]) data_scale estimate["scale"]) qx The rest is outlined below step The problem: I don't think I'm understanding the implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. I would assume the qx function above would be selecting for the Weibull scale distribution, but I get somewhat non-sensical results. If I modify it to rweibull(1, x, data_scale) it aligns much more with the expected frequentist results, but it doesn't make sense to me why I would be iterating by passing x to the rweibull() shape parameter when I am interested in the distribution of the scale parameter. What am I missing in my understanding and how would I need to modify the code above to fix it?
