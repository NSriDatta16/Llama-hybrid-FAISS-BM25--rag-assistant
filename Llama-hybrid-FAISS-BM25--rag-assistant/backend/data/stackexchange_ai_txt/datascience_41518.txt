Training and Test set

I was asked by my supervisor to replicate a result from a former graduate student. My supervisor believes the result of that paper is not accurate and he asked me to find out why! The paper was about conducting a random forest classifier to classify some sort of diseases. I was reading through the simulation process, and I realize that the training set and the test test were generated separately (the same set of parameters were used in the simulations). In other word, the training was simulated first, then another simulation was carried on to generate the test set. My understanding for training and test set is to simulate one data set then use the same data for training and test set. My question, is it correct to simulate the training and test set separately? Does it affect the accuracy of the classifier? any reference will be truly helpful.
