Unfortunately, BeautifulSoup can not be blocked to parse the code blocks. One solution to what you want to achieve is too 1) Remove the code blocks soup = BeautifulSoup(unicode(content)) code_blocks = soup.findAll(u'code') for block in code_blocks: block.replaceWith(u' ') 2) Do the usual parsing to strip the non-allowed tags. 3) Re-insert the code blocks and re-generate the html. stripped_code = stripped_soup.findAll(u"code", u"removed") # re-insert pygment formatted code I would have answered with some code, but I recently read a blog that does this elegantly. http://iboris.com/page/add-source-code-syntax-highlighting-your-django-content-pygments.html
