Intuitively you can think the three component as the projection of original data(input data matrix X) to lower dimensions. Or you can think like the original data is transformed to lower dimensions. Once you got the components keep aside the original data. Just use the three components you got instead of your original data(input data matrix X) in training the model. I hope you have no doubt on training logistic regression. This is the best resource so far I encountered for PCA.
