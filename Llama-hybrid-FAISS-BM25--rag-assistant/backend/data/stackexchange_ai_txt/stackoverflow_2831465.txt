Can two separate pointers reference the same address? If so, can I change the value at that address with either pointer?

So, I have this code fragment: int * iPtr ; int * jPtr ; int i = 5, k = 7; iPtr = &i; jPtr = iPtr ; I have just started learning about pointers, and need to get some doubts cleared. is jPtr now essentially also pointing at i? I know I can change the value of i by using *iPtr, but how can I change the value of the object being pointed to by jPtr? How will changing the object being pointed to by jPtr affect the value of the object pointed to by iPtr, and i ?
