I would take a look at Project Lombok and try to reuse the attempt they take. They use Java 5 annotations to hook in a Java agent which can manipulate the abstract syntax tree before the code is compiled. They are currently working on creating an API to allow custom transformers to be written which can be used with javac, or the major IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans. As well as annotations which trigger code to be generated, they are also planning on adding syntax changes (possibly mixin or pre-Java 7 closure syntax). (I may have some of the details slightly off, but I think I'm pretty close). Lombok is open source so studying their code and trying to build on that would probably be a good start. Failing that, you could attempt to change the javac compiler. Though from what I've heard that's likely to be a hair-pulling exercise in frustration for anyone who is not a compiler and Java expert.
