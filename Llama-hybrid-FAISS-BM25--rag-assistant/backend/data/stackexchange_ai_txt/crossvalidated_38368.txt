Signal processing refers to operations on the measurement and analysis of time and spatially varying signals where a signal is defined as a function that contains numerical information about the behaviour or attributes of some phenomenon. While signals can be analog (i.e. continously measured quantities) the field is generally defined by the numerical analysis of digitally sampled signals, also referred to as digital signal processing (DSP). Common applications of signal processing are in machine learning and communications. References: Steven M. Kay, Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing, Volume 2: Detection Theory.
