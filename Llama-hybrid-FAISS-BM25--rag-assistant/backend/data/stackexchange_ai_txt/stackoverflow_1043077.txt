You can connect to a remote JVM, if it has been initialized in the debug mode. i.e. during the remote application startup you should pass arguments to the JVM similar to the following: -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=6079,server=y,suspend=n Then you can attach to the application in Eclipse, using the "Debug configurations" window, selecting "Remote Java Application". In the connection properties nothing more than just the host name and port number (6079 in my case) is really required.
