I was seeing a very similar issue using the HTC Thunderbolt. I saved the image data byte[] from PictureCallback.onPictureTaken() directly to the SD card. When I viewed the image on the SD card, it showed the same banding effect. I then realized I was setting the previewSize in the camera parameters. I was using this code: // Ensure that the camera resolution is a multiple of 8, as the screen may not be. // TODO: A better solution would be to request the supported preview resolutions // and pick the best match, but this parameter is not standardized in Cupcake. Point cameraResolution = new Point(); cameraResolution.x = ( screenResolution.x >> 3 ) > 3 ) When I removed this code and did not set the preview size at all, my images were no longer banded.
