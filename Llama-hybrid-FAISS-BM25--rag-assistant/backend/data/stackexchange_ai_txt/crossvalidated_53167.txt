I'm not sure how to interpret my binary logistic regression output from SPSS

My dependant variable is diagnosis of cancer malignant being 0 and benign being 1. And my covariate is mean radius (of the tumour). I get this: Variables in the Equation: B S.E. Wald df Sig. Exp(B) 95% C.I.for EXP(B) Lower Upper Step 1a radius 1.020 .104 96.518 1 .000 2.774 2.263 3.401 Constant -15.039 1.474 104.091 1 .000 .000 a Variable(s) entered on step 1: radius. How do I interpret this in words?
