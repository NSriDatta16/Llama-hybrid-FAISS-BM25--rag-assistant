Definitely filter out the ones that aren't important to your organization. For example, the entire Internationalization block was largely unimportant to one of our project so we just excluded it and that alone was enough to make the list manageable. (There are some great suggestions in that block that we wanted to implement but they weren't important to app at the time.) You can also create a few FxCop projects grouping the exceptions until you get the number down to something manageable ("fix these now," "fix these soon," "fix these whenever"). I'm pretty sure I spent a solid week of excluding/including violations until we had a list that was appropriate for our policies. Then another 2-3 just fixing violations. :-(
