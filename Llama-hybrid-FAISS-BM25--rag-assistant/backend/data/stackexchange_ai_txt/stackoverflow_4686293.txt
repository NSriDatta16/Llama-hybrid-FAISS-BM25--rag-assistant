Grouping data and making aggregate calculations in C#

I have something like this within a List where object contains Cat , Type and Items . Cat | Type | Items -------------------- A | P | 3 A | Q | 4 A | R | 2 A | P | 1 A | Q | 5 B | P | 2 B | Q | 1 B | R | 3 B | P | 9 What I want to do is calculate the average items of the types so produce something like this: Cat | Type | Items -------------------- A | P | 2 A | Q | 4.5 A | R | 2 B | P | 5.5 B | Q | 3 B | R | 5 As you can see the average items are calculated for the types Whats the best way to do this?
