How to forecast demand with time series and/or other models?

I need to forecast data which has many periods of zero demand, also there is no seasonality or trend in the data. I tried ARIMA, but it converges to the mean. I also applied some predictors, but they don't affect the forecast significantly. What forecasting methods should I use? Below is my dataset Time series: sales Predictors: sales$dayOfWeek sales$promo sales$marketing
