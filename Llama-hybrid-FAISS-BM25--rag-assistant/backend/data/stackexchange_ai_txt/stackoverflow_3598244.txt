I also faced a similar situation once. I had to produce an exe using my exe. I didn't want to go the compiling a source code because of complexity and license problems. Lets call the parent app P and child app C. Also lets assume that whatever option C needs can be summed up in a config file (XML/INI etc). What I ended-up doing was: Create P and C. Inserted C in resource data of P. When user clicked the button after selecting options, P would extract C from its resource data. Created an XML file containing the options selected by user and inserted it in C's resource data. So whenever C will run, it will use the options given in the XML file stuffed in it . It looks like complicated and hacky but is reliable and simple. Do a google on "delphi embedding resource in exe" and you will find plenty of articles to do above.
