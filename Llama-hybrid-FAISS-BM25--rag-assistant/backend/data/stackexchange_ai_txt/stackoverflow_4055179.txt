Out of memory exception ? not enough Virtual address range : not enough physical memory

When will a program get an 'Out of memory exception'. Is it when not having enough virtual address range or because of not having enough physical memory? As per my understanding, it should happen only when not enough virtual address is available as physical storage can be made available by paging un-used sections. Please clarify. Thanks, Suresh.
