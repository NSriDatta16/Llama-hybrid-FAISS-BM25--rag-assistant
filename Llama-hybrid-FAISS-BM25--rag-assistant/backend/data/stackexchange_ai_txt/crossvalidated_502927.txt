What the the Hausman test is doing is testing whether the results (i.e. the estimated coefficients) from a fixed effects and random effects model are significantly different. (I haven't ever seen people talk about it testing whether whether the fixed and "between" effects are different, although because the random effects model is estimated as a weighted average of the between and fixed effects models, you could look at it that way, I suppose.) However, the reason it's used to "decide between fixed vs random effects" is that if the results of the two models ARE different then that's a reason to prefer the fixed effects model. Here's why. A fixed effects (FE) model accounts for ALL omitted variable bias from variables at the higher "group" level, because a fixed effects model is basically just including a dummy indicator variable for each "group." This means that if you run a FE model you don't have to worry about omitted variable bias at the group level. A random effects (RE) model does NOT automatically account for all group level bias (that is, bias due to differences "between groups"), although it allows you to include group level predictors (that is, predictor variables that vary ONLY between groups, but not within groups) that do that. Now, if you were to include ALL significant group level covariates in your random effects model then you would get the same answers (in terms of lower level coefficients) as the FE model (or rather, the two answers will approach each other as sample sizes goes to infinity). But the standard errors of the RE model will be smaller. What all that means is that if the coefficients of a FE and RE model are basically the same, you should prefer the RE ones, because they have smaller standard errors, but if they are different you should prefer the FE ones because the fact that they are different suggests that there is omitted variable bias at the higher level that the RE model has not accounted for (but the FE model has). So that's why we use a Hausman test to see if the coefficients are different, and if the test says they are, we default to the FE model. Now, I'll note that in "real life" there are many other criteria by which we might choose between these two models. Sometimes the independent variables we care about are at the higher level in which case we CAN'T use a FE model, since in a FE model you can't include any group-level predictors (because they are colinear with the dummy variables). So a Hausman test is only appropriate when you have other substantive reason to prefer one model over the other. And I'll also note that in my experience the Hausman test is almost always significant: that is, it almost always tells you that the two models are significantly different even when that difference is so small as to be substantively meaningless. So, as is always the case in statistics: don't just blindly follow the results of the test.
