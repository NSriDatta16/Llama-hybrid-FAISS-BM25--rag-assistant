Stationarity in presence of an outlier

I am working on a bimonthly data where I have customer the customer's sales amount. I tried to plot the original series in python and the plot import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Cust_bimonthly_Data['Customer_Sales'].plot(figsize=(12, 8)) plt.title('Cust Bimonthly Daily') plt.show() I tried to plot the above time series in Python and it looks like this In order to remove this big peak in my data which was an outlier I did log(x+1) transformation on my data i.e. increased all the values to 1 and then did a log transformation Cust_bimonthly_Data['new_Customer_Sales'] = Cust_bimonthly_Data['new_Customer_Sales']+1 taking the log so as to remove the outliers Cust_bimonthly_Data['log_cust_sales']=np.log(Cust_bimonthly_Data['new_Customer_Sales']) **the log transformed series looks like this ** In order to check if my log transformed data is stationary or not I did a ADF test and this is what my results look like Dickey Fuller test to check if the series transformed series is stationary or not from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller Cust_bimonthly_Data_test= Cust_bimonthly_Data_drop.iloc[:,0].values result = adfuller(Cust_bimonthly_Data_test) (-4.8014847417664424, 5.4031369234729222e-05, 0, 63, {'1%': -3.5386953618719676, '10%': -2.591896782564878, '5%': -2.9086446751210775}, 150.10425215395222) question? Since this test is rejecting the null hypothesis that my series is not stationary , should I still go ahead and perform the decomposition and differencing part. I mean will all those things would still be required since I can see the test tells me that my series is now stationary
