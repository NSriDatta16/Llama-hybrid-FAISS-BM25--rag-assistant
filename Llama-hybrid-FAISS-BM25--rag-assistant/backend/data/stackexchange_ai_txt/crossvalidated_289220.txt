Your question suggests you are not familiar with the concept of multiple regression (not to be confused with multivariate regression). Given that, I will provide you a basic answer and clarification addressing the questions. And, I will also suggests other related topics to study so to get a good educated grasp of the overall subject. Multiple regression is one single model with one dependent variable Y and several independent variables Xs (multivariate regression is several Ys with several Xs. But, let's keep to the basics for now). A multiple regression is solved using a closed form math formula using Matrix Algebra. The multiple regression uses your entire time series history and can therefore estimate every single point within your time series. There are no sublinear models. All the variables/regressors are regressed together in one single model as mentioned above. The final point estimate is not derived any differently than any of the other points within your time series. To clarify any confusion regarding multiple regression, I recommend related Wikipedia articles on the subject that will confirm all of the above and also give you greater details in the underlying mathematics. To further understand the topic, I also recommend you study Wikipedia articles on Hold Out samples, cross validation, model testing, etc.
