Finding the inverse of a matrix with neural networks

I have a generic matrix A which is symmetric, positive definite and sparsely populated (it's also quite big, say composed of tens to hundreds thousands rows). I would like to have a neural network learn how to find a matrix B that resembles the inverse of A (ie: that multiplied by A will yeld a minimal spread of the spectral radius) as accurately and as fast as possible. I was wondering if there are some AI branches that are focused on this kind of problems or if not how could I approach it. I know the classical algorithms used to do this, but I would just like to have a look at the possibilities offered by machine learning on the subject.
