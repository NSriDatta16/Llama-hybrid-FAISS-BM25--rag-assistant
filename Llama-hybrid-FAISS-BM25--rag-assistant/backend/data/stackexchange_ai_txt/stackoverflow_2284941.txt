How to organize a ASP.NET MVC solution (DDD)

I am trying to start a new project (asp.net MVC) and I would like to apply some DDD rules I've learned in these last few months. I don't know how to organize my solution though. I would like to use Nhibernate but I don't want to use Fluent Nhibernate cause it must be something like an experiment. I've seen some examples where people keep everything in the same project. Some others tend to create a different project for everything. Do you think I should differentiate the model and the repository or put it in the same project? If someone has some links to articles etc it would be appreciated. thanks Alberto
