How can I extract values out of this array?

Array ( [status] => success [stories] => Array ( [0] => Array ( [name] => John Doe [age] => 23) [1] => Array ( [name] => John Doe_1 [age] => 23) [2] => Array ( [name] => John Doe_2 [age] => 23) ) ) When I try foreach($stories as $story){ } It returns an error. Update: I am trying to pull out the most recent stories from Tweetmeme. Since the json output was long, I shortened it. :) The PHP Code: $json=file_get_contents($url); $data=json_decode($json,true); print_r($data); foreach($stories as $story){ $title = mysql_real_escape_string($story['title']); $url_temp = mysql_real_escape_string($story['url']); $tweets = intval($story['url_count']); JSON Output: Array ( [status] => success [stories] => Array ( [0] => Array ( [title] => Steve Jobs has a Flash enabled iPad!
