opening PDF document from memory

It is possible to create a PDF document in memory with iTextSharp that gives the user a choice to "open" or "save"?, and if it opens then it opens in a browser window. At the moment the only I have save it to disk. EDIT: ok I've got it sussed. I did end up having to write the file to a folder, but it is only temporary as gets overwritten every time. Here is the solution for what it's worth: private void GeneratePDF() { var doc1 = new Document(); string path = Server.MapPath("~/pdfs/"); string filepath = path + "Doc1.pdf"; PdfWriter.GetInstance(doc1, new FileStream(filepath, FileMode.Create)); doc1.Open(); doc1.Add(new Paragraph("A new Document")); doc1.Add(new Paragraph(DateTime.Now.ToString())); doc1.Close(); Response.Buffer = false; //transmitfile self buffers Response.Clear(); Response.ClearContent(); Response.ClearHeaders(); Response.ContentType = "application/pdf"; Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=myPDF.pdf"); Response.TransmitFile(filepath); Response.End(); }
