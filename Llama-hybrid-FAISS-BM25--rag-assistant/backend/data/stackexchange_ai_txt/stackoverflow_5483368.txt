the documentation for getCacheDir() says You should not rely on the system deleting these files for you; you should always have a reasonable maximum, such as 1 MB, for the amount of space you consume with cache files, and prune those files when exceeding that space. However if you use getExternalCacheDir(), you can use as much storage as it is available on the sd-card http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getExternalCacheDir ()
