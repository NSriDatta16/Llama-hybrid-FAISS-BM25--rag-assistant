Sequential Long-Text Classification with Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks

I am thinking to build a model for predicting events from news. Before I start this task I wanted to ask if someone have tried to build something like in the link( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03827.pdf ) but for long text(sequence of news). I can't find any papers or example code for such a problem that's why I am wondering if at least the idea to make a binary text classification model for very long text makes sense and have a future or if it's proven that this kind of classification problem makes no sense. thanks in advance for your help
