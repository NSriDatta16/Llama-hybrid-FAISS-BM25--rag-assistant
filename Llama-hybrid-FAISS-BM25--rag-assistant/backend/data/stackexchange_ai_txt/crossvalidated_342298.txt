You need to distinguish between worst case complexity and average case complexity. When speaking of NP-Complete, NP-hard, etc... people are usually referring to worst case complexity, which can only be confirmed theoretically by coming up with a proof of the algorithm's complexity class. Average case complexity on the other hand is frequently confirmed empirically (i.e. by running simulations). I've seen many papers on optimization and search methods which propose a new algorithms and validate their proposed approach by comparing its average complexity to the average complexity of other algorithms - even if the problem is theoretically NP-hard or NP-complete. By this is usually done for intractable problems - your problem seems to be polynomial, which are considered "easy" from complexity point of view, so why are concerned with it's complexity?
