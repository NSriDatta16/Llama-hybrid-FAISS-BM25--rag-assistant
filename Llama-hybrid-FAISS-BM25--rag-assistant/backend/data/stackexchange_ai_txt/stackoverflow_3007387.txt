There is a great article about truncating , here is the Gist of DB2 stuff Almost follows the standard.(since version 9.7) DB2 requires that the IMMEDIATE keyword be added the the ordinary TRUNCATE TABLE statement, e.g.: TRUNCATE TABLE someschema.sometable IMMEDIATE TRUNCATE TABLE must be the first statement in a transaction. A transaction starting with TRUNCATE TABLE may include other statements, but if the transaction is rolled back, the TRUNCATE TABLE operation is not undone. DB2s TRUNCATE TABLE operation has a number of optional arguments, see the documentation for more on this; especially, the REUSE STORAGE argument may be important for ad-hoc DBA tasks. In DB2 versions On unix-like systems: IMPORT FROM /dev/null OF DEL REPLACE INTO tablename On Windows: IMPORT FROM NUL OF DEL REPLACE INTO tablename IMPORT cannot be abused in all contexts. E.g., when working with dynamic SQL (from Java/.NET/PHP/...â€”not using the db2 command line processor), you need to wrap the IMPORT command in a call to ADMIN_CMD, e.g.: CALL ADMIN_CMD('IMPORT FROM /dev/null OF DEL REPLACE INTO tablename') IMPORT seems to be allowed in a transaction involving other operations, however it implies an immediate COMMIT operation. The ALTER TABLE command may also be abused to quickly empty a table, but it requires more privileges, and may cause trouble with rollforward recovery.
