There is no single correct answer to this problem. Which metric and loss function to use depends on your problem, data, and business case. Each choice has advantages and disadvantages. Using class weight in LogisticRegression affects your loss function, and makes the loss function put equal importance to the classes so that the minority class doesn't get lost in the calculations. The scoring variable in grid search object affects how the test success is measured. The F1 score depends on which class is assumed to be positive, therefore calculating F1 score for both classes and averaging them is a good idea but doing this weighted or not usually depends on your problem. If you want to treat the classes equally, you can do weighted mean. But, if your problem cares more about the positive class, you may do a plain average.
