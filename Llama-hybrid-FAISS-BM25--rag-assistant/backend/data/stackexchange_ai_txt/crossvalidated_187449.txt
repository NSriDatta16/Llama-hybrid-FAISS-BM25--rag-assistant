Likelihood that a given outcome was generated by a Markov model

I am new to the concept of Markov Models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. I would like to take a piece of data and determine the likelihood that it was generated by a known MCMC model/generator that outputs similar data. Is this possible, and if so, what is the term for what I'm describing? Edit: More details as requested in comments So let's say I have a MCMC generator that was initialized on a corpus of text by a certain author. I then have a given snippet of text and I want to know the probability / likelihood that the given snippet could be generated by the MCMC generator.
