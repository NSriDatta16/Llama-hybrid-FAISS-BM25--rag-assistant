Fetch iTunes album artwork without iTunes running

In a Cocoa application, I'm looking for a solution to retrieve album artwork from iTunes without requiring iTunes itself to be launched and running in the background. The usual and perhaps only solution, Scripting Bridge, and inherently AppleScript, will launch iTunes prior to executing any commands. Album artwork is the only information which cannot be obtained from parsing iTunes Library.xml . iTunes obfuscates the storage of artwork in the following manner, for a given track: ~/{Library Path}/Album Artwork/Cache/D989408F65D05F99/04/13/04/D989408F65D05F99-EB5B7A9086F4B4D4.itc . Anyone know of a technique to obtain album art without launching iTunes? I could always go a different route, such as using Amazon's data service, but I'd prefer a local iTunes-based solution.
