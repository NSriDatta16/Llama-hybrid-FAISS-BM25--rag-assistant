I would strongly suggest that you have a look at RCpp and RcppArmadillo packages for R . Basically, you would not need to worry about the wrappers as they are already "included". Furthermore the syntactic sugar is really sweet (pun intended). As a side remark, I would recommend that you have a look at JAGS , which does MCMC and its source code is in C++.
