Generate an array of words like "my" (developing this array will be very important, "my" is the only one in your example given) and strip these out of all the file names. Strip out all numbers and punctuation, also extensions should be long gone at this point. Once this is done, put all of the unique results into an array. You can then use this as a fairly reliable source of keywords to search for any stragglers that the other processing didn't catch.
