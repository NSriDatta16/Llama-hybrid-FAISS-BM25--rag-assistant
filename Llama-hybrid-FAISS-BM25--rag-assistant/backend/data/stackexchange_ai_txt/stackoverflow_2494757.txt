My personal opinion is that creating a checkbox or drop-down menu UI element would be a non-standard approach to how the iPhone UI is supposed to look & feel across all apps. You should consider an approach that uses table views instead, with drill-downs into another table view, and use the checkmark accessory to indicate a selected element out of a set. If you absolutely must use checkboxes and drop-down menus, you should consider embedding an HTML page with those elements instead.
