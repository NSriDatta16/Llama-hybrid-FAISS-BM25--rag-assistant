The following 2 packages are available in R for deep neural network training: darch : Package for Deep Architectures and Restricted Boltzmann Machines. The darch package is built on the basis of the code from G. E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov (available under Matlab Code for deep belief nets). This package is for generating neural networks with many layers (deep architectures), train them and fine tuning with common known training algorithms like backpropagation or conjugate gradients. Additionally, supervised fine-tuning can be enhanced with maxout and dropout, two recently developed techniques to improve fine-tuning for deep learning. CRAN link: http://cran.um.ac.ir/web/packages/darch/index.html deepnet : deep learning toolkit in R. Implement some deep learning architectures and neural network algorithms, including BP,RBM,DBN,Deep autoencoder and so on. CRAN link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deepnet/index.html
