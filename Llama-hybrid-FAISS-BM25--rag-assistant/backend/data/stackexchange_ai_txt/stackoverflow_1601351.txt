As Robert Harvey points out, it would be better if you could hand the settings to the component instead of having the component looking it up itself. This allows you to swap the settings simply by providing another object, i.e TestComponent(TestSettings()) instead of TestComponent(LiveSettings()) or, if you want to use config files, TestComponent(Settings("test.conf")) instead of TestComponent(Settings("live.conf"))
