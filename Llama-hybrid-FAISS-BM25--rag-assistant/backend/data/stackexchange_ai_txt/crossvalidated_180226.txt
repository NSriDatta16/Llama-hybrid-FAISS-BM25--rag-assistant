Markov Chains: regularity and detailed balance

A Markov Chain with state transition matrix $A$ satisfies detailed balance with respect to distribution $\pi$ if for all $i,j$, we have $$\pi_iA_{i,j} = \pi_jA_{j,i}.$$ In such a case, we have $$\sum_i \pi_iA_{i,j} = \sum_j\pi_jA_{j,i} = \pi_j.$$ Isn't this enough to show that if $A$ satisfies the detail balance equations with respect to $\pi$, then $\pi$ is the stationary distribution for $A$? The text I'm reading states the following theorem: If a Markov chain $A$ is regular and satisfies detailed balance wrt $\pi$, then $\pi$ is a stationary distribution for $A$. Why is regularity needed? Above we already showed that $\pi = A\pi$, which is the definition of a stationary distribution for $A$. Edit: As a silly example, if $$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ then, for example, $\pi = [1, 0]$ satisfies the detailed balance equations and is a stationary distribution for the chain, even though the chain is not irreducible or regular.
