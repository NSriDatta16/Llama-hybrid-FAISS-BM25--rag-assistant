Data in Perl are not stored in very effective fashion. It can take in worst cases up to tens (20-80) times more memory. Note that can happen only in worst case. If it would happen with your 1GB dataset you should notice. So I think it is not your case. Perl data structures are very fast, they often trade memory for speed. If memory amount in your case is reasonable you can deal with it and use straight forward approach recommended by Daren Thomas or more likely Storable recommended by daxim . If you measure that memory consumption in your case is too big you can go with some embedded key/value storage. If you will not modify data after loaded you can use CDB_File which is little bit faster than BerkeleyDB but latter allow you modify data on fly. You can chose later also because it is more common and flexible solution.
