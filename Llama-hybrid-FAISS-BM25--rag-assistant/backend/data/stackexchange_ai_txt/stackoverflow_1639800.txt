Iterate through every other point using the distance formula to find the minimum distance from Q (xq,yq). However, you haven't given enough information for a performance-critical answer. For example, if Q is a VERY common point, you might want to calculate the distance to Q and store it with each point. Second example, if you have a huge number of points, you might organize the points into sections and start with points only in the same section and adjacent sections to the section containing Q.
