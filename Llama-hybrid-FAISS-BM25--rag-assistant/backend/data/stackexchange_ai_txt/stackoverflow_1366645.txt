Struts JSP : set textfield value from session information

I have a DLPUser object in my session, this DLPUser is basically a container for Strings, ints and some useful info for me. (this is a fragment of code inside my action class in java) Map session = ActionContext.getContext().getSession(); session.put("logged-in","true"); session.put("user", user); //user is DLPUser user = new DLPUser(); Now I want to show the value of user.getName(); inside a textField in some JSP How can I do this? I am working with Struts tag and the following didn't work. "/> or This is supposed to be simple... but I am stuck and cannot find a good reference about this thing in struts and jsp. Any Help is very appreciated.
