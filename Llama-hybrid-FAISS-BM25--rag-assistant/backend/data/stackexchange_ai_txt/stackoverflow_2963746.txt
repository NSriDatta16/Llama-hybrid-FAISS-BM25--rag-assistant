What should be the output of the above code? Undefined. I don't think you can expect %u to correspond to a pointer type. What if on some platform/compiler a pointer is larger than an unsigned ? If you want to print pointer types you should use %p . And if we make array p as static(static int p[]), output gets changed .Why? Without static , this variable gets placed on the stack. With static , it gets placed in static storage (like a global variable). These regions have different memory locations. At any rate, good code should not rely on treating pointers as numeric values, or doing printf of raw addresses and having that be overly meaningful.
