This answer should likely be a comment because I am not addressing the first two questions, but is too long... You can do a lot of statistical work in Python these days, and with projects like statsmodels and pandas it is getting better and better. For time series analysis I think the best choice currently is using the PyIMSL package , which contains a good selection of functions all written in C for speed (and free for non-commercial use). Documentation can be found here . (Full disclosure, I used to work for Rogue Wave Software). Now then, even though I use Python for most of my analytical work, for time series modeling I have turned to using the excellent forecast package in R by Rob Hyndman . It is hard to beat, especially for exploratory work.
