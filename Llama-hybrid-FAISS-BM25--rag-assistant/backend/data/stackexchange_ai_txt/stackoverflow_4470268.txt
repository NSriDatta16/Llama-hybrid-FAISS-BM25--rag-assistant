Compilers are at liberty to lay out memory as they see fit in the interests of better performance, for example, or whatever it is that is motivating the code generation. On an OS with very limited resources the compiler may elect to pack rather than align for access speed. Perhaps there are some implicit local variables being produced by the compiler. There are lots of possible reasons for this.
