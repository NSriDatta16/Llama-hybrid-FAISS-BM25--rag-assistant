lme in nlme is designed for linear mixed effects models, meaning that the outcome variable at least approximates a continuous outcome. However, what exactly Cookie-Lookup is will determine what package you need to find. Here are a few things to choose from: Does the 0, 1, 2 in the outcome represent a count? If so, then you can use lme4 and model the data as a Poisson distribution. Although using GEE with the gee or geepack packages may be better if you're interested in a marginal, rather than subject-specific, interpretation. Here's a description of the two. If the 0, 1, and 2 are simply different categories without any logical order, then you need to perform multinomial regression that accounts for the multiple observations per subject. Again, a GEE model may be the way to go. I found nomLORgee , but I haven't used it or analyzed this kind of longitudinal data. Lastly, if the two predictor variables are not time-varying, then you could simply take the person-average of his or her outcome, and analyze the data using a cross-sectional multinomial model, such as multinom in the nnet package and some helpful examples . This last method is somewhat crude, but without time-stamps, you would otherwise be attempting to model longitudinal data with a dubious estimate of time.
