SMOTE caused my total nrows in train to fall to a very small proportion

I have a highly skewed dataset with minority class in target being just about 4%. I decided to apply SMOTE using library DMwR in R. Here is my target: >table(data$target) 0 1 9908 222661 >prop.table(table(data$target)) 0 1 0.04260241 0.95739759 Next I Split my data into train and test with a 70:30 split and then run SMOTE() on the train set. > smoted > nrow(smoted) [1] 27640 > nrow(train) [1] 162799 I am unable to understand why the total sample size of smoted data reduced from train. Is there a way to achieve balanced dataset without having to reduce the size of the train set? Also, I was worried if it will affect my model if I end up training it over such small train set? (I am running a Random Forest and GBM to help classify the target).
