On the one hand, from a practical point of view I do agree with Jeromy Anglim's answer. In the end we are most of the time dealing with discrete variables – although from a theoretical point of view they are continuous – and that has a real impact for instance for classification. Recall Strobl's paper indicating that Random Forests is biased towards variables with multiple cutting points (higher accuracy but potentially similar nature). From my personal experience probabilistic neural networks may present also a bias when variables present different accuracy unless they are of the same type (i.e., continuous). On the other hand, from a theoretical point of view the classical classification (e.g., continuous, discrete, nominal etc.) is, IMHO, right. In accordance I think that the source name of Quinlan’s paper describing the M5 algorithm, which is a ‘regressor’, is a great choice. So the definition and the implications of continuous vs. discrete are relevant depending on the ‘environment’. Refs: Quinlan J.R. (1992). Learning with continuous classes.
