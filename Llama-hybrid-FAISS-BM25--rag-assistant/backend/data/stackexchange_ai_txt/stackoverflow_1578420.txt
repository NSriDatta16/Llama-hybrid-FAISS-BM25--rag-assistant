You can call the intern() method on the string to ensure one for the whole JVM. String s = new String(bytes, "US-ASCII").intern(); You won't avoid creating the initial string again, but you will save on the storage. That being said, interned strings have a limited storage space, so use with caution. A better option may be to implement a HashMap with the string as the key and value and check if the string already exists and get it if it does, insert it if it doesn't. That way you won't have such memory limitations.
