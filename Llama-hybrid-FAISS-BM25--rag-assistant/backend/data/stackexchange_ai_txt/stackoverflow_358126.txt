The overhead from JMX is low and you can fix the security by Ãºsing SSL and authentication. Set -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=true and -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true See here for here for more information about setting up certificates etc. The overhead becomes a problem when you start to instrument the code. The overhead can be substantial and the instrumentation might affect the behaviour of your application. You will not see what you get, the so called heisenberg effect . If you want low overhead I would use the tools that come with JRockit . They piggyback on the information the JVM collects all the time. The JVM keeps statistics of which methods are the running the most to decide which methods it should optimize. The JVM also keeps track of memory usage/patterns to decide which gc-stategy to select. JRockit exposes that kind data to the JRockit tools without adding the instrumentation overhead you normally would get from a separate JMVTI -agent.
