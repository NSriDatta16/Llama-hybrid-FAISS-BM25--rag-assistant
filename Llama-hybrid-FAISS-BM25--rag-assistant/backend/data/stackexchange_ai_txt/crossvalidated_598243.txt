Explaining ARIMA forecasts

Currently attempting to interpret the results of my forecast using an ARIMA model that was applied to time series data (Dataset below). The forecast attempted is for a year into the future. The data was fitted to an ARIMA(1,0,1) model after using auto.arima to see what the best model would be. To give a little background on the dataset, it displays the amount of breaking & entering's that happened in Toronto by month between 2014 to 2021.

I can tell that according to the forecast, there will be and upward trend most of the year 2022 but beyond that I'm not sure how to interpret it in depth. I see as well that that there is a relatively large range. (2) Are there any steps that I should've done that I missed? (3) Based on my results, what would be a good next step to choose a better model?
