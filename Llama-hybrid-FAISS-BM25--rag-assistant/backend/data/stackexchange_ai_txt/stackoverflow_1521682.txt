Use std::modf : double intpart; modf(value, &intpart) == 0.0 Don't convert to int ! The number 1.0e+300 is an integer too you know. Edit: As Pete Kirkham points out, passing 0 as the second argument is not guaranteed by the standard to work, requiring the use of a dummy variable and, unfortunately, making the code a lot less elegant.
