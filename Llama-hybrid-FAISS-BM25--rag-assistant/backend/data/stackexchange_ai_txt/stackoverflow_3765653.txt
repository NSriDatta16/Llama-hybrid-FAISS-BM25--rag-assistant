EntityDataModel and Association table

I have an authors -> authorsbooks I want to drag 2 EntityDataSources onto the designer, a gridview of authors, and when a user clicks to select an author another gridview below will show all the books assoiciated with that author. How do I configure that second entitydatasource because when I try to configure it I don't see the authorsbooks association entity in the entitysetname dropdownlist. I'm thinking to set this as the datasource to the books gridview? Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks, rodchar
