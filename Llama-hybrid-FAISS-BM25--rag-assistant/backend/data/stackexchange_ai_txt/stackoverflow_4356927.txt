That's quite a set of requirements... While not meeting all of them (as I'm not sure that any such beast exists - I commend to your attention ICE from ZeroC. Developed in part by Michi Henning of CORBA fame (and ask your friends in telecom, that really isn't a dirty word), ICE is what CORBA would have looked like if it started later and wasn't developed by a committee. Their C++ mapping is everything that CORBA is not, it uses STL types, and is generally newer feeling. It fails the free-function and std::function tests, but given the improbability of finding a product for that entire list, this does a good job of many of the remainder. Good Luck
