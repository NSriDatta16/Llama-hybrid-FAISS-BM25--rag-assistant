SubWebFolder and mutliple bin folders with Website model?

I am looking for some advice on how what is the best approach to subweb folders and having mutliple bin folders in the WebSite Project model. For adding new pages at a later stage without recompiling the core files of a website and without building a full fledged Plug-in framework api. I am aware of being able to drop in the compiled dlls into the main bin folder and to just copy over the new page files to a sub folder but I am looking for a more organized file/folder approach. Here is the how it was done with WAP: Moving the Code-Behind Assemblies/DLLs to a different folder than /BIN with ASP.NET 1.1 Multiple /bin folders in ASP.NET I should also mention that I see that I can still do it the old way with the website project model by making the adjustment to the config section mentioned here but I was wondering if that has any side affects. AssemblyBinding in Web Config and XMLNS
