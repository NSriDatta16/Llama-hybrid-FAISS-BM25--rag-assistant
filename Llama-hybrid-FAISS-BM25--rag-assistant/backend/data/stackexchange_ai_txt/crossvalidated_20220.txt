If you are interested in visualizing an interaction effect specifically, you can subtract main effects (i.e., average factor effect, say $x_i$ and $x_j$) from each treatment mean (combination of factor levels, indexed by $i$ and $j$) based on the relation $$\gamma_{ij} = \bar x_{ij} - \bar x_i - \bar x_j + \bar x$$ This will yield $i$ (or $j$) curves where every value are expressed as deviation from a baseline which is simply the grand mean ($\bar x$). This idea is developed in Howell, Statistical Methods for Psychology . Below is an illustration with one of Howell's dataset (a study on number of words recalled as a function of subjects' age and recall condition, N=100).
