The two predictors are correlated -- housing starts can predict consumer spending well enough that the latter is not needed very much in addition to housing starts to help predict sales. For simplicity you can probably get by with the simpler one-variable model using housing starts. And don't forget to actually look at the results. In my experience, some people get too dazzled by asterisks and p values and don't pay enough attention to the values of their estimates. In this example, the one-variable model is also much easier to interpret. For example, you can draw a scatterplot of the data and superimpose the fitted line. Even for the two-predictor model, you can make a little table showing what you predict for some typical values of consumer spending and housing starts, and give a prediction interval so people know how widely they can expect future results to vary from your predictions. In R, that's done using the predict function, giving a hypothetical dataset in newdata argument, and specifying interval="predict"
