Well, I am not familiar with the DART algorithm, but I thought it might be a good task for ChatGPT, so I took the Latex source of the article you linked, and asked it to generate C# code for it: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; public class Node { public double X; // Input feature value public double Y; // Output label value } public class Tree { public List Nodes; // List of nodes in the tree } public class DARTAlgorithm { public const double Pdrop = 0.2; // Probability of dropping a tree // Trains an ensemble of decision trees on the given dataset public List Train(List dataset, int nTrees) { // Initialize the first tree with a single node at (0, 0) var S1 = new List { new Node { X = 0, Y = 0 } }; var T1 = new Tree { Nodes = TrainTree(S1, dataset) }; var M = new List { T1 }; // Ensemble of trees for (int t = 2; t new Random().NextDouble() (); foreach (var x in dataset) { // Compute the negative gradient of the loss function // with respect to the output label for this input var y_hat = Predict(M_hat, x); // Predict the output for the input x S_t.Add(new Node { X = x.X, Y = y_hat - x.Y }); } // Train the next tree on the new dataset S_t var T_t = new Tree { Nodes = TrainTree(S_t, dataset) }; M.Add(T_t); // Add the new tree to the ensemble // Scale the trees in D and replace them in M foreach (var tree in D) { M[M.IndexOf(tree)] = ScaleTree(tree, D.Count + 1); } } return M; } // Trains a decision tree on the given dataset private List TrainTree(List dataset, List fullDataset) { // TODO: Implement decision tree training algorithm throw new NotImplementedException(); } // Predicts the output label for the given input using the given ensemble of trees private double Predict(List ensemble, Node x) { // TODO: Implement tree ensemble prediction algorithm throw new NotImplementedException(); } // Scales the given tree by the given scale factor private Tree ScaleTree(Tree tree, int scaleFactor) { // TODO: Implement tree scaling algorithm throw new NotImplementedException(); } } I don't know if it works, but it compiles. I hesitated to publish this answer (both because I don't know if it is correct and because I myself think that people posting AI-generated answers is detrimental to the overall quality of SE sites). However, I think this is the kind of task where ChatGPT can be very useful and I wanted to illustrate this use and encourage readers to use AI tools to help themselves understand. I will be happy to remove the answer if people think it is not appropriate here.
