The following is the state transition diagram of the given Markov Chain. Consider state $1$ . As $p_{11}^{(1)}>0$ , state $1$ communicates with itself. State 2 is accessible from state $1$ , but state $1$ is not accessible from state $2$ , and hence, State $1$ itself forms communicating class $\{1\}$ , which is non-closed. In a finite state, homogeneous Markov chain, states belonging to a non-closed communicating class are transient states. State $1$ is transient. Consider state $2$ . As $p_{22}^{(1)}>0$ , state $2$ communicates with itself. As $p_{23}^{(1)}>0$ , state $3$ is accessible from state $2$ . However, if the process moves into the state $3$ , it will never come back to state $2$ . Like state $1$ , state $2$ itself forms a non-closed communicating class $\{2\}$ , and hence, is transient. Consider state $3$ . We note that, it is not possible for the process to move to either state $1$ or state $2$ , once the process occupies the state $3$ . Such a state is called an absorbing state. State $3$ itself forms a closed communicating class $\{3\}$ . State $3$ is a recurrent state. In the given Markov Chain, the states $\{1,2\}$ are transient and the state $\{3\}$ is recurrent.
