Poisson xgboost with exposure

I was trying to model a count dependent variable with uneven exposure. Classical glms would use log(exposure) as offset, also gbm does, but xgboost does not allow for offset until now... Trying to find a drawback this example in crossvalidated ( Where does the offset go in Poisson/negative binomial regression? ) suggested me to model frequency (real number) instead of counts weighting by Exposure. I tried to work aroung some xgboost code to apply the same method on my data but I failed.... Below the code I set out: library(MASS) data(Insurance) library(xgboost) options(contrasts=c("contr.treatment","contr.treatment")) #fissa i Insurance$freq % predict(temp) xgbMatrix Can anybody help? Also, I was wondering if It were possible to run all using caret's train...
