"Frequentists vs. Bayesians" from XKCD (under CC-BY-NC 2.5 ), click to discuss: The general point of the frequentist philosophy illustrated here is a belief in drawing conclusions about the relative likelihood of events based solely ("purely") on the observed data, without "polluting" that estimation process with pre-conceived notions about how things should or should not be. In presenting a probability estimate, the frequentist does not take into account prior beliefs about the likelihood of an event when there are observations available to support computation of its empirical likelihood. The frequentist should take this background information into account when deciding on the threshold for action or conclusion. As Dikran Marsupial wrote in a concise comment below , "The valuable point the cartoon (perhaps unintentionally) makes is that science is indeed more complex and we can't just apply the "null ritual" without thinking about prior knowledge." As another example, when trying to determine/declare what topics are "trending" on Facebook, frequentists would likely welcome the more purely algorithmic counting approach Facebook is shifting towards , instead of the old model where employees would curate that list based in part on their own background perspectives about which topics they thought "should" be most important.
