How to create a cross project source release with Maven

I have a project I need to release the source for. The problem I have is that I need to create a source release for all code that we have developed. The code is across multiple projects, but I want to leverage maven so that only the source for the jars we are actually using is released. For example: core code project (multi module maven project) web app project (multi module maven project). Contains we app module plus some supporting jar modules. Depends on some jars from core code project. Now I want to release all the source for the web app project but only the source for the core code project that the web app uses. Can I do this with maven? I have a feeling it is possible with assembly plugin and source plugin but it is not clear to me how to put this together.
