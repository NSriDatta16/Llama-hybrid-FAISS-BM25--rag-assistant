This is a very generic question and does not take the database backend into account. Firing with 40 or 1000 machines on a database backend that can not handle the load will give you nothing. Such a problem is truly to broad to answer it in a specific way..you should get in touch with people inside your organization with enough skills on the DB level first and then come back with a more specific question.
