Sean Easter provided a nice answer; here's how it's actually done by the R scripts that come with Kruschke's book. The plotPost() function is defined in the R script named DBDA2E-utilities.R . It displays the estimated mode. Inside the function definition, there are these two lines: mcmcDensity = density(paramSampleVec) mo = mcmcDensity$x[which.max(mcmcDensity$y)] The density() function comes with the base stats package of R, and implements a kernel density filter of the sort Sean Easter described. It has optional arguments for the bandwidth of the smoothing kernel, and for the type of kernel to use. It defaults to a Gaussian kernel, and has some internal magic for finding a nice bandwidth. The density() function returns an object with a component named y that has the smoothed densities at various values x . The second line of code, above, just finds the x value where y is maximum.
