You can either debug an application by starting it with GDB %> gdb or what is usually easier is to start your application and then attach the debugger to the process using the PID. %> gdb -p For command line options, just type gdb -h and while running inside of gdb help is always available by typing "help" on the gdb command line. Here is a quick cheat sheet and a tutorial site on some common commands. As Arkaitz mentioned, be sure to compile your code so that it has the necessary debug information included in the executable. If debugging from the command line is a bit daunting, there are some UIs available that use GDB. I do a lot of my debugging in Eclipse using gdb. Once you get started down the gdb path, I'm sure you'll have more questions and I encourage you to ask those more specific questions on SO. Good luck.
