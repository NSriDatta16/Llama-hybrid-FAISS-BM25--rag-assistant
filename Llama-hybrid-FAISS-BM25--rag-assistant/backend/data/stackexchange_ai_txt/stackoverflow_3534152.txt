how to reverse e.preventDefault() from the body?

I have this: function dontMove(event) { // Prevent page from elastic scrolling event.preventDefault(); } & This, on the ipad, stops it from being draggable and does not allow that grey background the ipad has when you drag a whole page around to show up. I have seen on another website that its possible to reverse that in another div, so that div is completely draggable again. Does anyone know how to reverse it? I have also tried using this to prevent it (in the document.ready): document.ontouchmove = function(e){ e.preventDefault(); } & this to enable it: function doTouchMove(state) { document.ontouchmove = function(e){ return state; } } Then I put this to activate it. This didn't seem to work Is there anything wrong with this? Or any other way that might work?
