Creating variogram for a 10,000 set data

I am trying to create a variogram for a data set with 10,000 points. However, if I try to actually calculate the distance of each point with the other then I will have 10,000*9999/2 pairs. Out of these pairs of distances I can round off the distance values to lets say 2 decimal places. Then I can find the distances having equal values. Then I can take the average of the variances having equal distances to find the variance for that particular distance. Then I can get the experimental variogram. This process will definitely be very slow. Is there any efficient way ? I mean instead of creating the variogram from all the observation point, I can only take a subset of it surrounding the point where I want to interpolate the value. I can create a variogram out of this subset. Then I can further take k neighbors of the destination point and use this subset variogram to interpolate. Will this be more efficient and correct?
