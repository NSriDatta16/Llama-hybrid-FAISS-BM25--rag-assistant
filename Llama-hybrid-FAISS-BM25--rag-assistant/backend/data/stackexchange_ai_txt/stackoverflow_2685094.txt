How to get a flat, non-interpolated color when using vertex shaders

Is there a way to achieve this (OpenGL 2.1)? If I draw lines like this glShadeModel(GL_FLAT); glBegin(GL_LINES); glColor3f(1.0, 1.0, 0.0); glVertex3fv(bottomLeft); glVertex3fv(topRight); glColor3f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0); glVertex3fv(topRight); glVertex3fv(topLeft); . . (draw a square) . . glEnd(); I get the desired result (a different colour for each edge) but I want to be able to calculate the fragment values in a shader. If I do the same after setting up my shader program I always get interpolated colors between vertices. Is there a way around this? (would be even better if I could get the same results using quads) Thanks
