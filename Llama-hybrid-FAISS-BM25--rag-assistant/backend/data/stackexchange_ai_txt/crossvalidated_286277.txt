Visualise two quantities in the same data matrix

Question: How to best visualise two observables $(p, q)$ for each pair $(x, y)$ in a data matrix? My current ansatz is to plot $p\in[0,1]$ as the dot size and $q\in [0, 1]$ as the dot color (for $p$ close to one the circle starts to fill out the complete square): However, I am not completely happy because the contrast around the circle edges draws away a lot of attention from the color code. That makes it hard to focus on color-only (observable $q$).
