The posterior distribution has no relationship with the law of total probability, even though they are similar looking. The given $P_X(x)$ is the normalizing constant. The reason that this is hard to compute is because 1). the conjugate property only can be applied for some specific distributions; 2). The prior and the likelihood function can be high dimensional, which is very difficult to integrate; 3). The integral might not be closed form. This is the reason why the resampling method has to play a role in Bayesian approximation.
