Timeseries - How are the window/span size and 'frac' in LOWESS related?

Many software implementations of locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS), such as those in Python and R, require a frac parameter as an input. I am confused as to how frac is mathematically related to the term 'window size'. According to Statsmodels' documentation , The algorithm works by estimating the smooth y_i by taking the frac*N closest points to (x_i, y_i) based on their x values and estimating y_i using a weighted linear regression. The term 'window size' or 'span size' is often used to describe the span of data about which the locally weighted regression is performed. However, I found that while 0 frac 1. For example : Therefore in this work, we set the window width [of the] filter to 20. In the context of time series analysis, what is the mathematical relationship between frac and window size ?
