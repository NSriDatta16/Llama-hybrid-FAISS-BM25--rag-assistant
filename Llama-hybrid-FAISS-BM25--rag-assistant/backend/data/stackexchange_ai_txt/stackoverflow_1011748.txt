As far as I know, answer to your three questions is: no. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Apple documentation does not document inherited methods in subclass documentation. Moreover NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary are not so uncommon to need a reminder of their most common methods. For me a link to existing documentation, as you already have, is sufficient. About your point of specific behaviour of these common methods on your subclass, I would just insert a dedicated section in the Detailed Description chapter. Anyway, a possible workaround would be to give both a declaration and an implementation of your inherited methods. But it is a bit overkill just for documentation purpose: - (NSArray *) allValues { return [super allValues]; }
