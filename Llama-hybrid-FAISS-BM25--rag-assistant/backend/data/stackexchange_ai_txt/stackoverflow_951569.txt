Exclude methods from code coverage with Cobertura

Is there a way to exclude code from inclusion into Cobertura coverage reports? We have some methods that should not be included in the coverage report and therefore not drive down the coverage numbers. I know that Clover has such a functionality, but I have not found anything similar for Cobertura.
