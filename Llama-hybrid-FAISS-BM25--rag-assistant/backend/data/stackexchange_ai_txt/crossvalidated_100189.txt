The answer that your book gives can be computed (almost exactly) from mean +- 1.96 * standard deviation of the population. =AVERAGE(data) 44.5 =STDEV.P(data) 8.237 =1.96 * STDEV 16.144 =44.5 - 16.14 28.356 =44.5 + 16.14 60.644 That's the answer that was given to within 0.01. I am not saying this is right - but I'm pretty sure that's where the author got his/her numbers from. It is not the answer to the question that was asked ("what is the confidence interval of the mean"). I believe your approach to that question was correct, as earlier comments stated.
