It will depend on how consistent the operation timing is. If it's consistent, it would be perfectly reasonable to use the average time of previous operations. If it's not, you're better off timing the current operation and extrapolating. Edit: If the operation is inconsistent from previous runs, and also inconsistent from start to finish, then you have an unsolveable problem. Predicting the unpredictable is always fun :) You might decide ahead of time if you want to underestimate or overestimate, and add a fudge factor to the estimate. For example, if you want to overestimate, and the first 10% takes 6 seconds, you might extrapolate to 60 seconds then multiply by 1.5 to get a total estimate of 90 seconds. As the percentage complete grows, decrease the fudge factor until at 100% it becomes 1.0.
