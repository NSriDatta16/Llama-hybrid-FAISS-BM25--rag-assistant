You should always specify the height and the width of an image if only to help the browser lay the page out even before the image has been downloaded. See 13.7 Visual presentation of images, objects, and applets in the HTML 4.01 spec: The height and width attributes give user agents an idea of the size of an image or object so that they may reserve space for it and continue rendering the document while waiting for the image data. They are recommended and not required but you really, really should specify them ;-) Also, please make sure the dimensions you specify actually match the dimensions of the image. There is nothing worse than waiting for a page to download just because those 400x300 (!) images are in reality more like 4000x3000 at 95% quality.
