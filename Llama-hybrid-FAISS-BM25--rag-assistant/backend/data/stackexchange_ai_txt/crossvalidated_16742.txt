How to explain certain patterns appearing after kernel averaging?

Having a 2D map filled uniformly by random values ( Figure:top-left ), the next maps are kernel averaged with a kernel of sizes 3x3, 5x5, ..., 11x11. The questions are: What are the patterns appeared in the kernel averaged maps? What is the statistical basis of creation of such clusters/pattern? How is the pattern related to the original dispersion model i.e., uniform? Note: To generate the maps a kernel based averaging system kind C was applied on the original data. An answer from a different aspect has been given at this link . If you can develop based on more statistical/spatial statistics please do it.
