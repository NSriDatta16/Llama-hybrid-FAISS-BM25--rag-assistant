How to configure Bamboo such that it pulls automatically the dependent jars from a local repository that is in SVN?

I have configured maven with Bamboo and have a local repository that contains organization specific jars. These jars are stored in SVN. The problem is that when ever I add a jar to the repository (in SVN) and add the dependency to pom xml, Maven does not check it out from SVN. Have a clean build goal configured in Bamboo. What configuration setting am I missing? Help appreciated!!!
