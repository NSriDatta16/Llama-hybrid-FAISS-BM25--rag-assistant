How bad are the last 11 dry years in a row?

How bad are the last 11 dry years in a row? In the following graph there are 61 years of records of the annual energy that could be transformed in electricity using water-driven power plants in Chile: In order to explain there is a trend of dry years, I am comparing that the last 11 years are below the average of the previous 50 years with records, but to give a sense of how bad it is, I would like to take the probability of having these 11 years below the average in a row at the end just for chance (expecting it to be very low, so it tell we have indeed a trend), but I don't know how to do it, since the time variable should have a meaning: the problem is somehow like having 11 tails in a row after 50 random previous results on 61 coin tosses, different of just counting 11 tails out of 61 tosses, but since the average change with each year, it is different from the coin example (which are there plenty of examples in Google). Here you could find the table with the data: Google Sheets , but I preferred as an answer, the explanation of how to get the mentioned probability than just the final number. What I have tried so far (added later) I have test the data visually with a Gaussian distribution by taking the data Empirical Distribution and its look its fit quite good: So since it don't look skew, I think is a good assumption consider that there is a $50/50$ chance of being above or below the average. With this, the problem "looks" similar to having coin tosses, so the total amount of alternative results are $2^{61}$ , and having $11$ results below the average at the end becomes a string of $\underbrace{2\cdot 2\cdots 2\cdot 2}_{50\,\text{times}}\cdot \underbrace{1 \cdot 1\cdots 1\cdot 1}_{11\,\text{times}}=2^{50}$ alternatives fitting the required pattern, so I could estimate the probability of having the shown results just by chance as: $$ P\biggr(\text{the last 11 years below the average in a row}\biggr) = \frac{2^{50}}{2^{61}} = 0.0488 \%$$ Where I used that having exactly the average is a zero-measure point so it can be ignored. But the issue in my line of thought, I think, is that the time variable is not considered, and the obtained probability thinking in coin tosses is valid for 11 heads (or tails) in a row independently of where the row is located, so having it exactly at the end could lead to a probability even lower. So far, I think the result could be used as an upper bound for the real probability, but since I don't know nothing about stochastic time series, I would like to see if what I have done make any sense or not. Added later After the comment by @TickaJules I realize the complications: a change in the average could drop my assumptions since I have implicitly assumed the process is stationary. But in the same line, if I compare the same statistics for the previous 50 years, which looks quite Normal/Gaussian, with the final 11 years were both the average and the standard deviation have decreased, they don't look Gaussian at all, and even when they are too few points to say something meaningful, the first graph kind of show a decreasing tendency, which is somehow supported but their cumulative distribution skewed to lower values: So I think that the previous calculated probability could still be a valid calculation considering it as a measuring a probability of $\mathbf{99.95\%}$ chance that something structural have changed in the last 11 years compared with the previous 50 years ... or it is just too "cherry picking" as an assertion? My arguments are: If I believe that nothing have change in the last 61 years, since the aggregated data looks Normal, then the procedure for taking the probability $p = 0.0488 \%$ is valid, so is far more probable that indeed something "bad" have happened - and ironically this dismissed the assumption that nothing have happened. And if I believe that something have change in the last 11 years, since these dry years in a row skewed the data to lower values, thinking in a moving average, the average now is lower making even harder to these years to be below it, but indeed it still happening. Since all the data is been considered in the analysis, I think is not skewed enough to say it have so much weight to lower values now, than it is more probable to have lower values than above the average, even when it is indeed what is happening so far, which somehow supports the hypothesis that something structural is different now. Following this argument, then the probability $p = 0.0488 \%$ is an upper bound for the "true probability", so considering all the years registered I have that at least with a probability of $99.95\%$ something structural have change on the final 11 years. Does it make sense? or there are still something missing in what could be explaining these 11 dry years?
