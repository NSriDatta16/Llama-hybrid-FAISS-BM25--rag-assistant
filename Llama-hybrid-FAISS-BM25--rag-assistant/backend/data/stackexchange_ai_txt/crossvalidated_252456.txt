Forecast next year from time series data in R

Im just starting using R and have been getting through a number of tutorials on Forecasting as need a forecast for next year. I have been using a seasonality of 7 & 365.25 in order to take account of seasonality. m_tbats = tbats(head(Desktop$Sessions,-1,seasonal.periods=c(7,365.25))) f_tbats = forecast(m_tbats, h=365) plot(f_tbats) As you can see my forecast for next year end in a straight line, what am I doing wrong? Can I get a decent forecast if I only have 1.2 years of data?
