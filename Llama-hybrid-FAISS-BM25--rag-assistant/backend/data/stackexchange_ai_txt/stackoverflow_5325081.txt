Your Publisher will still need to call Publish. What this does is the Publisher then looks into Subscription Storage to find out who is interested in that message type. It then will send a message to each Subscriber. On the Subscriber side you need to implement message handlers to do something with those messages. This is done via implementing the IHandleMessages interface in the Subscriber assembly. NSB will discover this and autowire everything up. Be aware by default, the Subscriber will subscriber to all message types. If you want to only subscribe to certain messages, use the .DoNotAutoSubscribe setting in the manual configuration.
