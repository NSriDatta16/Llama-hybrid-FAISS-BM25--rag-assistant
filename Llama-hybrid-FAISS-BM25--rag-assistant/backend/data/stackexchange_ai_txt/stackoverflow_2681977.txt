How to check connection leak using regular expression?

I have to check connection leak in my application i.e. open connections which have not been closed. After searching, after I found out that a thousands times connections have been opened but I can't manually go to each and every code fragment and check for connection close thing. I think, it could be possible using a regular expression but the fact is, I am not that well versed with regex that I could write one. Please suggest a regular expression for checking in a no of java files that a opened connection has been closed or not. My code pattern is something like this. try { /* Some code goes here */ con = EJBUtil.getConnection(JNDI_NAME); /* Some code goes here */ } finally { /* Some code goes here */ DBUtil.close(con); or closeConnection.close(con); /* Some code goes here */ }
