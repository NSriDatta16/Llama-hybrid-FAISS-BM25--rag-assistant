What to learn for RIA

I am planning to build a RIA about a year from now (when my current contract ends). What technology would you recommend investing time in? I will need good cross browser/platform support for video, music, and canvas. And ideally I would like to leverage my Python skills. Silverlight looks interesting because I could use Python through .NET. But I'm on Linux so I'd always be a 2nd class citizen. And it has a low install base. Flash on the other hand has a large install base. And I'm not sure about JavaFX because of the Oracle deal. Or should I hold my hopes out for HTML 5? Thanks!
