I would not argue (as You requested) if your modeling is correct or not. The procedure to copy an entity is, in general, quite complex, owing to the fact that, besides attributes, you also need to deal with the entity's relationships and copy them. I can not post here a huge amount of source code showing how to accomplish this, however, I can point you to a book where this issue is described in detail, with all of the source code you need. The book is the one from Marcus Zarra, "Core Data Appleâ€™s API for Persisting Data on Mac OS X" by "The Pragmatic Programmers".
