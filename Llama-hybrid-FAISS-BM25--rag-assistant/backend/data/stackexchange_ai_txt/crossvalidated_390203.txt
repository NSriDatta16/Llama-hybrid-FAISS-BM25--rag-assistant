Should I remove ID variable before PCA?

My data has 50 features like... 1. student_num 2. sub1 3. sub2 4. sub3 .. .. 50. hasFailed There's one row for each student. I have 12000 students so 12000 records. My goal is to reduce dimensional. I need to predict if a student will fail. Should I remove student_num before PCA?
