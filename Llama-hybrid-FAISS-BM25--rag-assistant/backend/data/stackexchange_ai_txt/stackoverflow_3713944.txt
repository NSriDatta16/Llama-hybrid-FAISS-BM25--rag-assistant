Multiple composite ids with relations or single field PKs

I've been dealing with composite id's and asked a few questions and I was recommended to replace my composite PK's with a single id column, and to control integrity with indexes... All of this related to the fact that mapping composite id's isn't that simple... On the other side, some people encourage the usage of composite id's that are accord to the domain model... So I decided to ask: When will you encourage using composite PK's in your DB while using Hibernate?
