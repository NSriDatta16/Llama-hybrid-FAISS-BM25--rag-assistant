Include CakePHP components only if the request is not AJAX?

Is it possible to tell CakePHP to load different components/helpers based on whether the request is AJAX or not? Obviously you can't use RequestHandler::isAjax, since RequestHandler itself is a component! My concern is performance - am I right to think that loading up all the components (I have about 4-6 in most controllers) is going to be a drag on speed? One idea I thought of was to create an AjaxController, with minimal components and no helpers, but this seems a bit dirty? Thanks
