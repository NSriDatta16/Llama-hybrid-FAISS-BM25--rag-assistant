Magento Community Edition Capability Questions

I am just starting out with Magento and have two requirements for a private wholesale store. I realize this question is a bit open ended, but I would appreciate any recommendations for extensions or level of complexity from an experienced Magento developer. The store is private. Only available to customers entered within the Magento Admin. Security via HTTP Auth is not an option. I want Magento to handle it. Seems like I would disable new customer registration and then add some custom code to the core. How much code would that require? The customer orders are purchased on credit. This credit is set on a per customer basis within the Magento Admin. Customers do not manage their credit. I found an extension for purchase, so it's possible. However, if I am already in the core to do the above, how much more might this be? Of course, both of the requirements above are features in Magento Enterprise edition, for $13,000/year.
