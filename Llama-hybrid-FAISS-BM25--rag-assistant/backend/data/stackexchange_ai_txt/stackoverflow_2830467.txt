I think you have the right idea with creating the Wtfs directly. I think it will turn out OK if you just set the bars at the same time: def after_initialize Bar.all.each do |bar| wtfs bar, :data_i_need_to_set => 10) # Rails should auto-assign :foo => self bars Rails should save the records correctly because they are the same collection of objects. The only drag might be that if rails doesn't have the smarts to check if a new Bar record in the bars collection already has a Wtf associated, it might create one anyway. Try it out.
