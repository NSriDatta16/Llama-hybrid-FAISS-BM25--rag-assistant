PyRSS2Gen and embedding html in description tag

I want to format the content of the description using html tags. When I try to enclose the content in here]]> it doesn't work properly, as it escapes some of the brackets, displaying O.K. in some RSS viewers, but displaying the ]]> in others. If I try to avoid the CDATA and use escaped characters throughout, this mostly works, but $lt;p$gt; gets displayed as rather than a new code. Any thoughts?
