LINQ query with GROUP JOIN - require additional data in the group

I'm just getting to grips with LINQ and I have the following scenario: I have a database which represents sports matches between teams on various dates, organised as follows: Table MATCH ___________ MatchID MatchLocation MatchDate Table MATCHTEAM ________________ MatchID TeamID HomeOrAway Points Table TEAM __________ TeamId TeamName Now I want to be able to query the database to look at all matches a particular team played in, and the associated team data for each match. So far I've been able to perform a query that does a GROUP JOIN as follows: Using MyMatchEntites As New MatchEntities Return (From M In MyMatchEntites.Match, _ MT In MyMatchEntites.MatchTeam _ Where M.MatchId = MT.Match.MatchId And _ MT.Team.TeamId = inputTeamId _ Select M _ Group Join MT2 In MyMatchEntites.MatchTeam _ On MT2.Match.MatchId Equals M.MatchId _ Into _ MatchTeams = Group).ToList End Using This gives me a list of matches played in by the input team and each record has an associated list of the teams that played in the match. However, I also want to include the team name in this sublist for display purposes. How would I include the TeamName field in the MatchTeams group created in the query?
