The problem was that on line 426 of Simulation.cpp, I tried to delete an event in the EventPQ currentEvents (a.k.a. ce ) container that my recover() function had just deleted. The iterator had obviously been invalidated. Dumb. Lessons: Debug on code that has not been optimized Pay close attention to what the non-std related frames imply And for the future: Trace memory in valgrind I'm still stumped why the debugger referred me to an apparently blank line in stl_tree.h. I've massive appreciation here for the people who have helped me work through this. I'm going to revise my question so it's more concise for any future readers.
