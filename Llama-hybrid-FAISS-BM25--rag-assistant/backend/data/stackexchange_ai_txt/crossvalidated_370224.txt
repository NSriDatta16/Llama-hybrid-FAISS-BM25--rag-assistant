Can a neural network learned function $f$ be used for calculating its derivate $f'$?

$y$ is a scalar value, $x$ is an $m \times 1$ vector. Function $f$ is a map $y = f(x)$ . Say we have $n$ examples { $(y_1, x_1), (y_2, x_2), \cdots, (y_n, x_n)$ }, and we use these examples for fitting a feed-forward neural network. After the NN is optimized, we get a proxy $f^*$ of the underlying function $f$ . Can this $f^*$ be used for calculating the derivate of $f$ ? How can we calculate the derivate using this $f^*$ ? Say we do this by following the definition of the derivate of a function $$f' = \text{lim}_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x ) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$$ However, when $\Delta x$ is a vector, how can we choose this $\Delta x$ for calculating the limit?
