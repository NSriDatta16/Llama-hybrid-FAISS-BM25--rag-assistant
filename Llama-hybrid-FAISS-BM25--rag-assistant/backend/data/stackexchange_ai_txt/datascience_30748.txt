According to sklearn's Logistic source code , the solver used to minimize the loss function is the SAG solver (Stochastic Average Gradient). This paper defines this method, and in this link there is the implementation of the sag solver. This implementation of the solver uses a method to obtain the step size (learning rate), so there is not a way that you can change the learning rate (unless you want to change the source code).
