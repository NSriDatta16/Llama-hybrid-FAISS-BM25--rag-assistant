Can anyone Vertical Align an IMAGE with HTML and CSS?

I'm not sure if there is can be done with CSS, but wanted to confirm it here. This is the code snippet.. http://jsfiddle.net/2CHEb/ HTML: Lorizzle ipsum dolor sit amizzle, tellivizzle adipiscing fo shizzle. Owned sapizzle velizzle, bizzle volutpizzle, nizzle quis, gangster vizzle, arcu. Pellentesque eget tortizzle. Sizzle CSS: .wraptocenter { background: orange; float: left; height: 120px; margin: 0 10px 5px 0; width: 120px; } .wraptocenter img { max-height: 120px; width:120px; } Some tricks like http://www.brunildo.org/test/img_center.html works, but if I float the div, it stops working. I'm Floating the div, so that another div containing Text can wrap around the image like a newspaper article. Also, I'm getting the image from different website, and set the width to 120px. So, it will make height dynamic and different each time. Is this possible? Thank you.
