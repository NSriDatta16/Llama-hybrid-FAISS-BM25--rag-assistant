Random forests for Regression is a suitable algorithm when there are mixed features (both numeric and categorical). I am assuming you are using Python for coding. Python has sklearn library which supports this algorithm. But right now, if I am right, there is no support for categorical variables for Random forests in sklearn. So you need to encode the variables. Below code you may try from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # load the data here X_cat = pd.get_dummies(df[['brand', 'model', 'year', 'title_status','color','state',' country', 'condition'])] X = np.c_[X_cat.values ,df[['mileage']].values] y = df[['price']].values regr.fit(X, y) Now you can know the feature importance's using print(regr.feature_importances_)
