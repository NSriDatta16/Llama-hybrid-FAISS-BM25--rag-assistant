Is there any value in dimensionality reduction of a data set where all variables are approximately orthogonal?

Suppose I have an $N$-dimensional data set where the $N$ dimensions are roughly orthogonal (have correlation zero). Is there any utility in terms of: Visualization Representation (for classifier efficiency) Or other criteria to perform dimensionality reduction on the data?
