Enforcing sparsity on probability

I am trying to induce a probability distribution $Q$ by optimizing an objective function and am wondering how can one encourage sparsity for $Q$ while keeping the optimization convex. In particular, there $m$ distributions: $q_i$ for $i=1... m$, where each $q_i$ lies, say, in a 10-dimensional simplex. Given certain observations, we learn $Q=\{q_1,...,q_m\}$ as $F(Q) = \min_{q_i, i=1...m} \sum_i f(q_i)$ where $f$ is convex. This is all well and good. Now, we also want to encourage sparsity for $q_i$ i.e. we want most of the probabilities within $q_i$ to be zero. I am wondering if it is possible to device a regularization for $q_i$ to achieve this while keeping the optimization convex.
