Using non linear regression model for enzyme kinetics

I need to choose a non linear regression model for this kind of data The experiment was a time course, for a drug, so I get phosphorylation response behaviour in time In enzyme kinetics or a binding non linear regression model, you do not take into account time, instead you plot the substrate concentration Vs Vmax or radio ligand concentration (X) Vs total binding (Y). Here I got time (X) Vs kinase phosphorylation (Y) Could you help me to get a proper model to do the fit?
