Orthogonailty with PHP development

I am reading the "Pragmatic Programmer", I am at the section were they talk about "Orthogonailty" and the approach to take when coding. I was wondering if you can implement the "Orthogonailty" technique with PHP application development because in the book its mainly about software development? Do you know of any articles which talk about PHP and "Orthogonailty" or does any one have a view on this matter?
