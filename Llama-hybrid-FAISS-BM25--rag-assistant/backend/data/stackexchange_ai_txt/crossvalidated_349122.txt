What is the difference between rf$importance and importance(rf) in the package randomForest in R?

I am building a hybrid filter-wrapper model for feature selection. As a filter I select the 100 most important variables based on the output of a Random Forest. However, I noticed that with 2 different ways of calling the importance, the returned values for Mean Decrease Accuracy are different: So my question is what is the difference between using $importance and importance()?
