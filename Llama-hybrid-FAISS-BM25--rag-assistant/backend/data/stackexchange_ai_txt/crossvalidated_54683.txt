How is the intercept calculated in a regression model with two independent factor variables?

I am struggling with a linear regression model of the shape $y = a + b_1\text{month} + b_2\text{year}$. I have 12 months for each year and 10 years. My dependent variable is a log transformed ratio. I have understood that much that when setting such a model up in R, R automatically picks a level for each variable to go into the intercept. March and 2005 goes into the intercept, in order to provide a baseline for comparison for the other factors. As stated my problem is that i cannot really figure out what the intercept represents. Is it simply an average of the ratio of March and 2005 or what is it? Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.90339 -0.16789 -0.00373 0.15472 0.88338 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -3.586154 0.131642 -27.242
