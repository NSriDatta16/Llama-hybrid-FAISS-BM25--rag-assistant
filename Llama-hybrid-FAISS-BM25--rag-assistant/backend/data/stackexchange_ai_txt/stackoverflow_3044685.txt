playing flv in website

my client wants to play a flash video in their website. just to make sure i understand correctly, i need to: 1. create an FLV file 2. use either some flv player or wrap the flv inside swf questions: 1. the player option - will visitor have to download /install it or is it install only once, in the website itself? any FREE player you can recommend the will ensure cross browser compatibility? swf option: will i need the flash application in order to do the wrapping? will i be able to later use something like flashobject library for the actual embedding? what are the main considerations for choosing between the two options , if indeed these are the options? any help would be highly appreciated. have a nice day and let's pray for a lot of goals today :-)
