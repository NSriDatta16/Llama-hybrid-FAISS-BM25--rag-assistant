In scikit-learn, most algorithms (SVM, Decision Trees, SGD, etc.) have a sample_weight argument that you can pass when fitting. In your case, you could provide a different weight based on which of the 3 datasets the data point comes from. If the algorithm you want to use doesn't provide the sample_weight argument, you can always sample with replacement. Simply put, you give each sample weight, and then you create your dataset by sampling them with replacement. This means that instances with higher weights may appear multiple times in your dataset.
