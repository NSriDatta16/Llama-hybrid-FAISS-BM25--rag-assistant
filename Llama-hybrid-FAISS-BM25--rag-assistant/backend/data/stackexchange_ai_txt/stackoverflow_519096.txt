Make labelled FlatIcons draggable?

I'm creating a Google map to display multiple points with each point having a short text label. I found a JavaScript library that lets me label the markers easily. I would also like to make the markers draggable. I'm working from this example. http://gmaps-utility-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mapiconmaker/1.1/examples/createflaticon-simple.html I tried the following, but it doesn't work, at least in Firefox 3.04. var newIcon = MapIconMaker.createFlatIcon({ draggable: "true", label: "12300" }); var point = new GLatLng(43.82589,-79.10040); var marker = new GMarker(point, {icon: newIcon}); map.addOverlay(marker); marker.enableDragging(); Any suggestions?
