The headers are incomplete. You need the following set of headers: response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1. response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0. response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. Escpecially the must-revalidate entry fixes this particular FF issue. See also Making sure a webpage is not cached across all browsers Caching tutorial Unrelated to the actual problem, I've a few comments about this piece of code: You should prefer UTF-8 over ISO-8859-1 to gain world domination . Raw Java code in a JSP page is poor practice . The response headers needs to be set in a Filter and the logout needs to happen (indirectly) in a Servlet . Calling getSession(false) with false may return a null session which in turn can lead to a NullPointerException in certain circumstances. Get rid of false or at least add a nullcheck. Setting attribute to null right before calling invalidate() is unnecessary. The invalidate() call already trashes all the attribtues. Hope you learn something from this.
