Perhaps you can reduce every item by calculating average of adjusted values and then multiply it by the number of elements in collection. However, you'll find a bit different number of of operations on floating point. var items = new long[] { long.MaxValue - 100, long.MaxValue - 200, long.MaxValue - 300 }; var avg = items.Average(i => i / items.Count()) * items.Count();
