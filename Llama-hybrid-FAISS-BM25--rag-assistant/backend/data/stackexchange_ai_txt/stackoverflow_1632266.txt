OpenGL Colorspace Conversion

Does anyone know how to create a texture with a YUV colorspace so that we can get hardware based YUV to RGB colorspace conversion without having to use a fragment shader? I'm using an NVidia 9400 and I don't see an obvious GL extension that seems to do the trick. I've found examples how to use a fragment shader, but the project I'm working on currently only supports OpenGL 1.1 and I don't have time to convert it to 2.0 and perform all the regression testing necessary. This is also targeting Linux. On other platforms I've been using a MESA extension but it doesn't function on the Nvidia card.
