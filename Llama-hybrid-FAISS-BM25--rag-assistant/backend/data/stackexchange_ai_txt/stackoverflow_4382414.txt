The executable needs to be linked with the gcov library: gcc -fprofile-arcs -o foo.o -lgcov EDIT : Starting from gcc 4.1.2, the --coverage option can be used as a synonym for -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage (when compiling) and -lgcov (when linking). Also, it is worth noting the files are created in the same directory as the compilation. This directory shall be reachable from the execution environment. Recent versions of gcc (4-1) introduced environment variables to tune the target directory : GCOV_PREFIX and GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP, see the cross-profiling section of gcc doc.
