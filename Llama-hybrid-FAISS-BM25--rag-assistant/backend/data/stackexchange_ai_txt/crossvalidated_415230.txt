As others here have intimated , scatter plots between the original series can often be useful but of MORE IMPORTANCE is scatter plots conditional on data conditioned for temporal activities. Often one needs to allow for hourly or daily effects (be they stochastic or deterministic ) and latent level shifts/time trends in order to tease out (identify) useful predictor structure for user specified causal variables. Removing seasonality from a dataset where each 24 hour period of a day is normally or bimodally distributed might also be enlightening/informative leading to models that are hourly based BUT incorporating calendar effects (e.f. daily , day-of-the-month , week-of-the=month et al ). Additionally it is usually preferable to use degree days as a predictor as high demand can be related to both cold and hot temperatures/weather. Additionally anomalies need to be identified and conditioned for in order to clearly /identify/measure the effect of user-specified predictors. Take a look at my response to similar questions https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=user%3a3382%20hourly%20data particularly Time Series Analysis for a Newbie . If you wish you can post your data in a csv format , I might be able to help further.
