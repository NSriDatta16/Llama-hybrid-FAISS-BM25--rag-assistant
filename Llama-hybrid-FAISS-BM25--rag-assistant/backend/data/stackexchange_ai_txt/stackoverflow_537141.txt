I would recommend against trying to store stuff like this in the defaults db. SQLite is fairly easy to pick up and use. I have an episode in one of my screencasts ( http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-bdiphone ) about a simple wrapper that I wrote (you can get the code without buying the SC). It's much cleaner to store app data in app space. All that said if it still makes sense to put this data into the defaults db, then see the post f3lix posted.
