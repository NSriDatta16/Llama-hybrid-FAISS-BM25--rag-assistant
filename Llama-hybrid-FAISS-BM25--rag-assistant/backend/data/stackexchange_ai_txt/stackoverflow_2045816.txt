It's more about application level benchmarking than measuring performance of individual features, but it might be possible to learn something from specviewperf , especially if it's possible to discover more about what OpenGL mode each benchmark uses to perform it's rendering. The benchmark seems to include some options to tweak usage of display lists, vertex arrays etc, but I don't think SPECs published results go into any analysis of the effects of changing these from the defaults. They don't seem to have any VBO coverage yet.
