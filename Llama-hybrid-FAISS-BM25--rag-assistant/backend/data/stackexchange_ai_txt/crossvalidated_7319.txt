Two sample t-test for data (maybe time series) with autocorrelation?

I am new to statistics, so pardon any mistakes in my question. I have two time series $X_i$ and $Y_i$. Assuming that they're stationary AR(1) processes with possibly different means, how do I test for difference of means? I found this link (but tests only one sample) which discusses using gls: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2006-May/105495.html So I am wondering how to extend this to multiple samples (use a dummy variable?) or if there are any other methods (preferably in R).
