Here's a Bayesian stab at this problem. This approach requires that you have the number of random games that got you 0.61, 0.52, 0.44, and 0.35. I will assume that you have historical data on random play for 1000 rounds for each game. For example, the random strategy won 610 times and lost 390 times in game 1, to get you 0.61. You can tweak the R code below with your numbers (capita Ls and Ws). Let $\rho_{1}$ be the probability of a win in game 1 while playing randomly and $\pi_{1}$ be the probability of a win in game 1 using strategy. Before we see any data we think a loss is just as likely as a win. This corresponds to a uniform prior, which is the same as $Beta(1,1)$ distribution. The beta distribution is a suitable model for the random behavior of proportions. It has to parameters, $a$ and $b$ , with the mean of $\frac{a}{a+b}$ . So with a uniform prior, you believe that you win 50% of the time. You could have a diffrent prior, and this does not change the logic. Now we get the data for game 1. Players of random version had 610 wins and 390 losses. Players of the other version had 895 wins and 185 losses. We update our priors, and our posteriors are that $\rho_{1} \sim Beta(610+1,390+1)$ and $\pi_{1} \sim Beta(895+1,185+1)$ . Now you can ask, what is the probability that strategy is better than random by at least $\delta$ ? In math, that's $$\mathbf{Pr}(\rho_{1} > \pi_{1} + \delta)$$ This is a gnarly integral, but you can use the following R function to calculate it: # Pr(X > Y + d) where X~Beta(a,b) and Y~Beta(c,d) beta.ineq The last step calculates the overall probability across all 4 games by multiplying. The output is: > # Updated Posteriors with uniform prior = beta(1,1) > (Pr_btr_1 (Pr_btr_2 (Pr_btr_3 (Pr_btr_4 (Pr_btr_1*Pr_btr_2*Pr_btr_3*Pr_btr_4) [1] 2.15419e-23 This means that the probability that strategy beats random in all four card games is basically zero.
