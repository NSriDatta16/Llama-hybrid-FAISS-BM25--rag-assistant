Create a PyGTK GUI with event to reload itself

I'm prototyping GUI layout with PyGTK, sometimes using glade/builder sometimes not, and the following scene repeats endlessly: Modify the code Run the GUI script Judge the result Modify again Run again... So, since I heard that Python allows reloading of modules, I would like to know if it is possible to modify the code WITHOUT CLOSING THE WINDOW, and then, from the window itself, say, clicking on a button, "reload" the window reflecting the changes in code. Since it is a conceptual question, I don't have any specific code to show. Thanks for the attention
