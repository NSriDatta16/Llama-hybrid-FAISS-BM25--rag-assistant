My experience with the External Accessory framework is that it was poorly designed initially, in terms of robustness. Until iOS 4.0, trying to connect to multiple accessories would yield this error message: Cannot use accessory. Only one accessory can be in use at a time. Now it seems that there has not been much attention to what happens to accessories when apps go into the background. I have been assured that the correct behavior is for EASession instances to be released on accessory disconnect. But I don't think that an app going into the background qualifies as an accessory being disconnected. There isn't much to go by if you log the value of the connectedID for your accessories, you will notice that they do not change just for having switched to background and back to foreground. I suspect that the list of connected EAAccessory instances is not refreshed unless EAAccessoryManager is notified of a change (connect/disconnect) of an accessory. I have been trying to teardown and recreate EASession instances and this has failed. I am now going to try leaving the EASession in place throughout the background/foreground transition. My one concern is that my app won't be receiving EAAccessoryDidDisconnectNotification and EAAccessoryDidConnectNotification notifications while in background.
