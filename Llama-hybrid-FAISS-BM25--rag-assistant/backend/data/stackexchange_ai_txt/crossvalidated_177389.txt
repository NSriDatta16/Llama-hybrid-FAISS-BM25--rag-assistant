Simple illustration to know why the linear regression in this case does not work , and what is the logistic regression . First of all , you have to know that your dependent variable $y$ (child becomes bullied ) is a binary variable , that means it takes two outcomes either Yes (becomes bullied ) or No (does not become bullied ).Let us create a dummy variable to indicate if an observation yes or no : $y=1$ if yes $y=0$ if no In the example we want to know what determines that a child becomes bullied , our independent variable in this case is the number of friends $x$ Suppose that we run the regression model: $Yes(y=1) =\alpha +\beta{x_i} + error$ Now suppose we got the following outputs $yes=-1+0.5{x_i}$ Since our dependent variable is binary , that means we want to know what makes it change from 0 to 1 , in other words , we want to know what increase the likelihood of being bullied $Pr(y=1)$ So our model could be $Pr(y=1)=-1+0.5{x_i}$ Now can you calculate the likelihood that a child being bullied who has 25 friends ?.I suppose ,you know that the probability is bounded wherby $0\leq p \leq 1$. If you get a strange result you have to find out a function which satisfies this condition $0\leq p \leq 1$ (squared function or exponential function..etc)
