According to the MySQL documentation , an ENUM column should only take 1 to 2 bytes of storage depending on the amount of options you have in your enumeration. So its impact should be minimum on the row size. However, if you have very long string as possible enum values, it won't affect your row size (since only the index is stored in the row, not the actual string value), but might go above the 64KB limit of the table definition file.
