Be very careful with the statement you choose. "nonrandom" is very different from "observed". In Bayesian statistics everything is a random variable, the only difference between these random variables is some are observed and some are hidden. For example in your case $y$ is an observed random variable and $\theta$ is a hidden random variable, your goal is to estimate the posterior distribution of $\theta$ conditioned on the observed $y$ . That says in Bayesian mindset we shouldn't reat $y$ like a constant as in the traditional sense, instead, it's an instance, or reliazation, of an random variable. (The observed values of the variables are also called "evidence" in most of the Bayesian statistics literatures.)
