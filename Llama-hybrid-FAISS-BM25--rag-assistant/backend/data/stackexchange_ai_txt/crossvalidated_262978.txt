Relation between the number of support vectors and the value of parameter C

Is it right to say that when I increment the C parameter in a SVM, I am incrementing the number of support vectors needed? Where does this relation come from ? Premise: I have understood the influence of C about the bias and variance tradeoff, but I can't imagine how this parameter influence the number of support vectors needed
