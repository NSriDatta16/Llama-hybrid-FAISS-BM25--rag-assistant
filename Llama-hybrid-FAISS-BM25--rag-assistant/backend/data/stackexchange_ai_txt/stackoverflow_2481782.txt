You are using the JDesktopPane incorrectly. The desktop pane "does not" use a layout manager on purpose. This allows you to add multiple internal frames and drag them around individually. Your class should NOT be extending JDesktopPane since you are not adding any new functionality to it. So in general all you logic should still deal with the JFrame. That is: a) you create your toolbar and add it to the NORTH of the content pane. b) you create your desktop pane and add it to the CENTER of the content pane c) your create your internal frames and and them to the desktop pane Read the Swing tutorial for examples of using internal frames.
