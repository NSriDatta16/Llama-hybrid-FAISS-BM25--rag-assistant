One wouldn't ever realistically use a Poisson regression for a binary response. This seems much easier to model with a logistic regression instead, regardless of whether or not the data belongs to a cross-sectional or longitudinal study. Some assumptions for logistic regression include: Independence of errors. Basically you shouldn't have something like autocorrelation or repeated measures type data present. Though even that can be modeled with a logistic regression with adjustments (with a logistic GLMM). No multicollinearity . If for example two variables are almost perfectly correlated, then things like your standard errors will be completely inaccurate. Again, there are ways around this, but something to keep an eye on. Linearity in the logit . This is an assumption that I often see missed from people I have talked to in my field, but logistic regression also requires linearity, just with respect to the logit instead of a raw response like in OLS. If this is an issue, an alternative, like a logistic GAM, may be needed. Enough events per predictor . A very rough rule of thumb is that you should have around 10-20 events (your binary responses) per covariate. Reliability . You face attenuation bias if your predictors are unreliable, so check that this also isn't a serious problem (if for example your measures are a composite variable, say like a test of anxiety with multiple items). A primer on logistic regression can be found here, and I greatly admire the book Practical Guide to Logistic Regression by Joseph Hilbe, which is available for free here .
