As far as I can tell the problem is not in your viewmodel, but in the markup in your view. You have to implement it on your DTO, you just have to tell your view to pay attention to IDataErrorInfo and do something about it. you could do the following: > Note the ValidatedOnDataErrors property. See your viewmodel has to be able to tell the view that something is wrong, so IDataErrorInfo is an interface that WPF inherently listens to, if it's asked. If your binding on the property tells wpf to listen to it then it will. And there are default error templates, but if lets say you want to add a tooltip to tell the user the actual error you would need to do something like this Google wpf error templates to read about error templates like this example. The above will add a tooltip to textboxes that have an error. WPF has several moving parts, so its easy to get lost, but you'll get used to it, it just takes time :) Hope this helps you in your journey.
