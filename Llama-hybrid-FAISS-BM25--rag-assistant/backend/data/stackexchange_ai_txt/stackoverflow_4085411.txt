Vim - indent like Emacs

I use vim (primary so that I can work on plain ssh terminal - still uncomfortable with Emacs non-gui version) but most of my colleagues in the organization use emacs. So using CVS, we face indentation inconsistency issues (tabs becoming spaces, number of tabs/spaces, code layout etc). Is there a way I can make VIM indent EXACTLY as EMACS. (similar to the default emacs profile my colleagues use). (Most importantly, I want vim's C++ and TCL indentation schemes to match that of emacs). regards, JP
