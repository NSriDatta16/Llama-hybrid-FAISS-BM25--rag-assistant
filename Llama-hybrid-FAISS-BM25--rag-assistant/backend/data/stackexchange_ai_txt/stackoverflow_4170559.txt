Android Efficiency: long loading time problem, lots of views

Ok so I am writing a game that has a shop. The shop is where i am having problems because each item in the shop has several stats and then 2 buttons and an edit text for buying/selling. The layout for the shop has 3 tabs with 26 items in each tab and that totals to: 130 ImageViews, 364 TextViews, 52 Buttons, and 26 EditTexts per tab. So if you keeping count that is a total of 1,768 views in one 3 tabbed layout. (I know, " HOLY CRAP! ") I wasn't really thinking about efficiency as I was writing this section and now I find that loading this activity takes on average 3-5 seconds or more. I want it to load quicker but I like the layout and the general "look and feel" of the shop as it is. I have already broke up the listeners so that it is only listening to the elements in the current tab and turns off the listeners for the inactive tabs. This helped a little but i don't think that was a major aspect of the problem. Can anyone suggest anything else I can do to help the loading time on this activity? EDIT: Screenshot. I have heard something about a recycler? What is that and would it apply here to help loading times?
