Batch file for opening one of a list of URLs

I have a list of websites. I want a batch file which will open only the first website in the list when I execute the bat file for first time, and when I execute the batch file for the second time it will open only the second website in the list, and when I execute it for third time it will open only the third website in the list and so on. Someone suggested me the following solution: @echo off & setLocal EnableDELAYedExpansion if not exist %TEMP%\runnum echo 1> %TEMP%\runnum set /p R= %TEMP%\runnum But I don't know what he meant by (myfile) and blabla , because I don't know anything about scripting or programming. How can I do this? Assuming my list of websites are: http://meebo.com http://yahoo.com http://google.com http://orkut.com http://facebook.com http://msn.com http://cnn.com http://myspace.com http://twitter.com
