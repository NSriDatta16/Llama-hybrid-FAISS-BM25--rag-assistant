What Constitutes a Code Block in Visual Studio 2010?

As per MSDN: A code block is a code path with a single entry point, a single exit point, and a set of instructions that are all run in sequence. A code block ends when it reaches a decision point such as a new conditional statement block, a function call, exception throw, enter, leave, try, catch, or a finally construct. With this in mind, I still have no idea why, according to VS2010's code coverage analysis, this method has three blocks: public Type Foo() { return typeof(string); } And this method has two blocks: public void FooTwo() { return; } Code lines are more straightforward. They're the number of lines of code including curly brackets. But what are code blocks? Calvin
