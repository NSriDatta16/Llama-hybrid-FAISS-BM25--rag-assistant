From the Wikipedia article : The following operating systems implement SCTP: AIX Version 5 Generic BSD with external patch at KAME project Cisco IOS 12 DragonFly BSD since version 1.4 FreeBSD, version 7 and above HP-UX, 11i v2 and above Operating systems using Linux kernel 2.4 and newer QNX Neutrino Realtime OS, 6.3.0 and above Sun Solaris 10 and above Various third-party implementations of SCTP exist for other operating systems. FreeBSD contains the SCTP reference implementation. Userspace library: The SCTP library (sctplib), with a Windows XP port . So apparently there is no native support in Windows at all. Only through 3rd-party software or libraries.
