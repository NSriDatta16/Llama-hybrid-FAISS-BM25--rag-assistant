Real-Time Outlier/Anomaly Detection?

My data is the usage/playing statistics for players of a specific game. One data point for a user is aggregated statistics for one week. The goal is: to detect when the player's account was stolen/hacked/anything else went wrong. So my idea is: for each player to have data points that each represent one week and then check whether the latest week is an outlier in the cluster. If it is - something is wrong with the account. I am well familiar with clustering and things like autoencoders , but this doesn't feel very suited to my problem because: I have a few samples for each user, i.e. we can go 25 weeks back, so only 25 samples of what is ' right '. I do n't need outlier detection for all the data . What I need is to tell if the latest sample is an outlier with respect to the other data points. My question is: what algorithm/method would be suitable for such a situation? Currently, I have two ideas: Dixon's Q-test. Simply measure whether the latest sample is further from the cluster center than all the other samples. They could work, but they both sound a little 'hacky'. I feel like there should be a more elegant solution for such a relatively simple problem, but my mind is just blank. What approach would you recommend?
