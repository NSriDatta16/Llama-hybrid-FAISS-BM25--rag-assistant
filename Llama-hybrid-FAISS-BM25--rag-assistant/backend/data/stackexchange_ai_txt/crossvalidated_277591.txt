In the statistical literature there is quite some work on robust change point (aka structural break) tests. For example from the group in Prague/Cologne/... around Hušková, Antoch, Steinebach & Co (see e.g., http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35494-6_11 ) or the guys at Dortmund/Bochum/... around Fried, Dehling & Co (see e.g., http://www.birs.ca/workshops/2014/14w5157/files/Dehling.pdf ). Both of the links provide numerous references in that literature. Having said that, if your sample size is large enough for the central limit theorem to kick in, you might still be ok to use standard tests based on linear regressions. The justification for most of these tests (e.g., sup$F$, OLS-based CUSUM, Nyblom-Hansen, etc.) is asymptotic anyway. So you don't rely on the time series being Gaussian but the methods also work if the asymptotic approximations work.
