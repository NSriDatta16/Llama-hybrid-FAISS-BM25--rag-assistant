Best practices for URL with space and special characters

I'm currently modifying a small web application. This web application allow users to enter / specify a category themselves. I noticed that in the database, there's plenty of category that contain spaces and special characters, like for example Cakes & cupcakes. On the front-end, the database shows all the user defined categories in the form of URL links and user can click on them to further see what's in the category. The front-end category links are encoded using the rawurlencode function and it looks something like this. ./show.php?category= And on the back-end, a function will GET the URL and then decode it before it's being sent to the database for querying. $category = rawurldecode(htmlspecialchars_decode($category)); It works fine but it seems somewhat 'last-minute' and 'unsophisticated'. As such I'm wondering, what is the best practice in PHP for URL special characters and spaces? Thank you in advance.
