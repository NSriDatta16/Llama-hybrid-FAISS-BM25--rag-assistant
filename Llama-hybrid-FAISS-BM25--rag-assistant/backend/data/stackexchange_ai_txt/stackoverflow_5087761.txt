extract date gets a "paragraph" string, in which case, it is "died 27-04-2006: Black Leclère" now your number at just gets a number starting from the nth character of your string input. so int your first number at(numberAt(11,4), it gets the 11th character and the next 4 letters..which in the string "died 27-04-2006: Black Leclère" is '2006'. numberAt(8,2) gives you the 8th character which is 0 and only gets 2 characters so it returns '04'. you subtract 1 from it so it gives you '03' then numberAt(5,2) gives you '27'.
