How can I train ARIMA/ARMA model by taking the previous points only at weekly distance?

I have many time series data-sets with hourly points. The current model in my organisation is using rough coefficients to forecast the value for the current hour using the value at the same hour-same day previous 8 weeks. Say the point to be predicted is $X_t$ The current model uses the following for every series- \begin{align} X_t = &X_{t-168}0.25 + X_{t-336}0.2 + X_{t-504}0.15 + X_{t-672}0.1 + \\ &X_{t-840}0.1 + X_{t-1008}0.1 + X_{t-1176}0.05 + X_{t-1344}0.05 \end{align} This model produces really good results for some of our series but performance is not good on some other series. I want to refactor these coefficients(called as AR coefficients in the current code we have) and have different coefficients for each series. How can I do the training to get new AR or AR , MA coefficients of a model which is the same as ~ ARMA(8,8) where the time grain is 168? I have tried the forecast package in R but it does not support such large seasonality. Can someone please suggest me an approach or a library which supports changing the time-grain?
