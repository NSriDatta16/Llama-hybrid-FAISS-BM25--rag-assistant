Bayesian hierarchical exchangeability assumptions reasonable with a check treatment?

This is information I believe to be true A practical feature of hierarchical Bayesian models is that partial pooling reduces (eliminates?) the need of adjusting for multiple comparisons when comparing groups. ( http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf ) Statistical rethinking 2nd ed page 419 seems to state that this hierarchical modeling can be applied to traditional fixed effects as long as "...the individual units are exchangeable". Bayesian data analysis 3rd ed page 104-106 suggest that having additional information about the relative size of a parameter value invalidates the exchangeability assumption. My problem I work in an industry where correcting for multiple comparisons is standard procedure: it is often the case that pairwise comparisons are performed between 1- ~10 treatments. I would like to use a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows partial pooling for the treatment effects (mainly to avoid the multiple comparisons issue). Stan allows for some additional modeling flexibility that would be useful in my current situation. I prefer the idea of shrinking the effects towards a common mean rather than adjusting p-values, but I don't know that I can articulate why exactly. Probably because, in my experience, large estimates are usually due to chance and I like the idea of inserting a little more skepticism. My questions If I have 10 levels of some treatment (i.e. fertilizer) X and I suspect that treatment Xi (nitrogen fertilizer), will have a larger effect on crop yield than treatment Xj (a check, no fertilizer) then is it inappropriate to use partial pooling to estimate all of the X effects? If it is inappropriate then how exactly would partial pooling ever be justified for traditional "fixed effects"? We usually start an experiment with the assumption that at least some of the treatments will have an effect compared to the check (otherwise why bother?). Thanks very much.
