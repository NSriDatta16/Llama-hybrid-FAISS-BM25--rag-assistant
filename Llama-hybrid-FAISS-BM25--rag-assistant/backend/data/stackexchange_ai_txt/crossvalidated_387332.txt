Predicting whether house is sold: regression or classification

I am new to machine learning (I am currently following the Udemy course machine learning from A-Z). Basically, I would like to reproduce the following analysis ( https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/predicting-house-sales ) My aim is to predict if a house to going to be sold in the coming year. I have an apartment database with the following info: address size owner name sex a few socio-demographic features When the apartment was last sold (date, target prediction variable) I am not sure how to take into account this time component of the variable I am trying to predict: should I consider this as a regression model trying to compute the predicted sales date? should I consider this more of a classification problem with the y value being 1 if the apartment is predicted to be sold in the coming year. If so, how do I have to modify my dataset structure in order to train the model (should I represent I represent 1 apartment for each year and the outcome?). What model would you recommend considering I am trying to model rare events? (sale likelyhood is 5% per year on average). People seem to be using different models to achieve this: Cox (survival analysis), Random forest... I am looking forward to reading your answers.
