Expected Values, Variance and Covariance

I have come across this theorem on bayesian updating. Suppose there is a random variable r of law N (rbar, 1/a). Also, $$x_i = r+\epsilon_i $$ where the error term is distributed N(0,1/b). Then: I have no clue about how to proceed ahead and looking for guidance.
