Can I transform an object and access the private data members in C++?

I want to access a private data member in a class. There is no member function in the class to access the private data member. It is private. I want to take the class and some how crack it open. One method was to copy the declaration of the class, make the private member public and call the new class class something_else. Then I do a reinterpret cast and copy the original object. This works. But I want something more elegant ... or perhaps generic ... or just another way. What options are there? Can I use void*? Can I memcpy the class into another empty class? What are ways to do this?? %
