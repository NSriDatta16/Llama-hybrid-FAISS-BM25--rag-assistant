Here are six samples, of sizes $10,10,10,1000,1000,1000$ and from distributions standard (uniform, exponential, normal, uniform, exponential, normal), respectively. A normal Q-Q plot is shown for each sample, with the Shapiro-Wilk P-value in the upper-left corner of each. It is difficult to judge normality by looking at only ten observations. The Q-Q plots are generally useful for samples of a thousand. And, with 1000 observations, the S-W test often gives helpful results. (The S-W normality test is widely used and many statisticians consider it among the best, but I am not claiming it is best for your purposes.) R code for three panels of the figure is shown below.
