Smooth average of sales data

How can I calculate the average of a set of data while smoothing over any points that are outside the "norm". It's been a while since I had to do any real math, but I'm sure I learned this somewhere... Lets say I have 12 days of sales data on one item: 2,2,2,50,10,15,9,6,2,0,2,1 I would like to calculate the average sales per day without allowing the 4th day (50) to screw up the average too much. Log, Percentile, something like that I think...
