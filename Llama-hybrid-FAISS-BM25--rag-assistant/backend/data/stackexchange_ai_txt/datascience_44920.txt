I have seen a showcase of a commercial company that used a version of GAN-based super resolution to reconstruct a more detailed image of the seabed out of low resolution depth gauge profiles. I could imagine that you could use that to visualize a seabed for VR presentations (I'm not sure whether that is done). However I very much doubt the added value over more traditional interpolation, when applied for deciding whether a fairway should be dredged.
