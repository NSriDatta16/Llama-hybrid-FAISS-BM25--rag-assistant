Rails application architecture to work with RDF storage

I need to make an application, that saves the data in the RDF storage for subsequent processing. I have several solutions and don't know what to choose: Use classical application architecture with AR/Mongoid + RDF rendering + crawler, that agregates RDF data and saves it to the storage. It's comfortable, but I need to create a crawler and feed him data on every save. Use spira ORM and save directly to the RDF storage. Here I don't need to write a crawler, but I need to make backend for auth plugin and to implement everything, that don't support spira. Use classical architecture + additional spira models, so that I would have 2 model classes for each entity, ex: User in AR + UserSpira in Spira, where on save event of User Spira object is saved too. What application architecture to choose? May be some other solutions?
