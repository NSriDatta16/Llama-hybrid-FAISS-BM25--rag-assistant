Regression Output Acuracy

Suppose I have a logistic regression formula that takes x as input and y is the estimated output. The regression is based on a historical set of x and y values. How can I give an accuracy percentage on a y-estimated for a future x value? In other words, the probability that the y-estimated will be correct for a future x value?
