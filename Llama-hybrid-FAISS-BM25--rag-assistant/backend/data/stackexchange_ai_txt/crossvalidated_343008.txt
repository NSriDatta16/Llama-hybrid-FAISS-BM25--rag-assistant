Does a random effects meta analysis produce the mean of population effect sizes?

In a random effects meta analysis of correlation coefficients, is the outcome the mean of a distribution of population correlation coefficients? If so, is this denoted rho symbol (p) with a hat on? I have seen studies refer to it as just an "estimate of the population correlation coefficient," so does this assume the reader will know it refers to an estimate of an average and not a single population effect size? Given the random effects model assumes there is not just one population effect size to find but many different ones?
