I personally prefer the Rundle text-indent technique because it's simple and elegant with no extra markup. If you change the display to inline-block it will work for you. For the browsers that don't support inline-block, use one of the techniques here: http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2009/02/20/cross-browser-inline-block/ (check the comments too, there are some simpler suggestions there). I agree with @Jason that crafting a complicated solution for this just to cover for people with css enabled and images disabled is probably overkill.
