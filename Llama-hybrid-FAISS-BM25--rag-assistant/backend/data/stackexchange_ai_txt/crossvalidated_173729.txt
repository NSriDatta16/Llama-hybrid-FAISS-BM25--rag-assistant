If you can detect via k-means how many distinct groups there are ...In your example 5 then you can estimate each of the interval lengths . If you have 4 interval lengths as in this case say 4,5,4,5 and say ? for the most recent then why not test the hypothesis that the "?" is significantly different from the average of the first 4 previous intervals. This could be done by setting up a pulse indicator (0,0,0,0,1) as a regressor and testing the hypothesis for the significance of this suggested regressor. The whole idea would be determine ? for a particular level of confidence and then sense if the actual interval exceeds ?
