Something like this: lam1 = 0:0.1:4; %lam1 now has 41 elements 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 4.0 lam = lam1; % just to create another array of the same size, could use zeros() lam = 1.6*lam1-0.30*lam1.^2; % note, operating on all elements in both arrays, will overwrite wrong entries in lam next; more elegant (perhaps quicker too) would be to only operate on lam(1:11) lam(12:end) = lam1(12:end)+0.3; but if you've got a bunch of these the Matlab way is to write a function to do them. Oh, and you have lam1==1 in both conditions, you ought to fix that. EDIT: for extra terseness you could write: lam = 1.6*(0:0.1:4)-0.3*(0:0.1:4).^2; lam(12:end) = (1.1:0.1:4)+0.3; In this version I've left 1 in the first part, second part begins at 1.1
