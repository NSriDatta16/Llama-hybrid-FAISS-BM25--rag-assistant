Yes. The first time foo() is called, Bar bar will be constructed. It will then be available until main() finishes, after which point it will be destructed. It's essentially: static Bar *bar = 0; if (!bar) { bar = new Bar; // not "real", of course void delete_bar(void) { delete bar; } atexit(delete_bar); } Note I said "essentially"; this probably isn't what actually happens (though I don't think it's too far off). 3.7.1 Static storage duration 1 All objects which neither have dynamic storage duration nor are local have static storage duration. The storage for these objects shall last for the duration of the program (3.6.2, 3.6.3).
