Use an Expression, e.g. Write(x =>semiNice.y, 0) This technique is used often as a way to avoid magic strings. e.g. public void Write (T source, Expression > lambda, U value) { var body = lambda.Body as MemberExpression; string memberName = body.Member.Name; if (body.Member.MemberType == MemberTypes.Field) { (body.Member as FieldInfo).SetValue(source, value); } else if (body.Member.MemberType == MemberTypes.Method) { (body.Member as MethodInfo).Invoke(source, new object[]{value}); } Console.WriteLine("You wrote to " + memberName + " value " + value); }
