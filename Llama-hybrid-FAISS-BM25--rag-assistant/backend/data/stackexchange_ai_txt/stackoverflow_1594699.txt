How to find the row index of a UIButton is a TableCell? (iPhone)

In my app, I have a table displaying a cell in each row. In Interface Builder, I dragged a button onto the cell, styled it as a Dark Info button, and connected it to a IBAction. That is working fine. Only, I want the button to behave differently, depending on the row of the table where the cell of the button is. How would I get that row index? I realize that I might display a lack of basic understanding of the object hierarchy, but I hope you guys will forgive me Thanks Sjakelien
