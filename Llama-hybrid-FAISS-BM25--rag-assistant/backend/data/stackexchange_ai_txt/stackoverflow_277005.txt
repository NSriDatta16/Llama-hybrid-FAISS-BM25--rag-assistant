I would suggest the best solution is not to give a specific "no response" but to give a more discouraging standard http error message. Whenever I am attempting to discourage unauthorised users I issue a page/url not found message as follows: throw new HttpException(404, "File not found - " + Request.AppRelativeCurrentExecutionFilePath); I think that this is very effective at convincing the person at the other end to give up and go away.
