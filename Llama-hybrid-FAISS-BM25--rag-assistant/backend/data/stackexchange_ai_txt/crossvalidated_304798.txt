Algorithm that preserves the order of the predicted variable

Hi all, I need some advice on possible algorithms that I can apply to the following problem (if possible with pointers to implementations of these algorithms). The dataset : I have some dataset about boreholes drilled in the earth. For each of the boreholes we know that there are some intervals which contain a certain mineral that we would like to mine (see the blue squares above). A start end end point of the interval. Some measurements (mainly continuous features) The task : Predict the mapping between different mineral-layers of different boreholes. In other words: Predict that the first interval in Borehole1 and Borehole 3 belongs to layer ‘A’. The first interval in Borehole 2 is split up and the first one belongs to “A” (that name “A” is arbitrary and can be any category. Supervised training data is available (presumably not enough for big neural networks). The specific properties of the problem: Intervals must not cross . So interval A might never continue below interval B. Intervals might stop . Interval “C” does e.g. not continue in Borehole 3. One borehole might have multiple intervals that are mapped to one mineral layer (not in the graphic!!!) So for example the large blue A layer in borehole 3 might occur in 3 subsequent intervals. My question : Which machine learning algorithm could I use. Or more specifically: Which algorithm allows to specify constraints on the predicted value (like that intervals must not cross)? I am keeping that question pretty open on purpose since I would like to keep my mind open to new ideas from you guys! Thanks for any help.
