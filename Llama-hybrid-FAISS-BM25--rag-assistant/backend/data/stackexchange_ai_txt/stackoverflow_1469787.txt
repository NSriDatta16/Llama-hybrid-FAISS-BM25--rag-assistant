Has anybody tried doing this problem with just awk. Specifically 'mawk'? It should be faster than even Java and C++, according to this blog post: http://anyall.org/blog/2009/09/dont-mawk-awk-the-fastest-and-most-elegant-big-data-munging-language/ EDIT: Just wanted to clarify that the only claim being made in that blog post is that for a certain class of problems that are specifically suited to awk-style processing, the mawk virtual machine can beat 'vanilla' implementations in Java and C++.
