Covariance and indicator function relations

Let $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ be two (sub) sigma-algebras of some probability space. Rio (2017), pp. 4 defines the coefficient: $$\alpha(\mathcal A,\mathcal B)=2\sup\{\lvert Cov(1_A,1_B):(A,B)\in\mathcal A\times \mathcal B\rvert\}, \quad (a)$$ where the function $1_W(x)$ stands for the indicator function given a measurable set $W$ . After some paragraphs, he states that "clearly", $$\alpha(\mathcal A,\mathcal B)=\sup\{\lvert Cov(1_A-1_{A^c},1_B):(A,B)\in\mathcal A\times \mathcal B\rvert\},\quad (1)$$ and $$Cov(1_A-1_{A^c},1_B)=E((P(B\lvert \mathcal A)-P(B))(1_A-1_{A^c})).\quad (2)$$ I cannot get the relation between $(a)$ and $(1)$ and cannot see the equality $(2)$ . Can someone help me to clarify these points?
