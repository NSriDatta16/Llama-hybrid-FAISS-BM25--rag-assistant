Role of the bias term in regression

I was trying to understand the role of the bias term in linear regression which is given by, y=w^T. phi(x)+b From what I understand it allows for any fixed offset in the data. To be more specific, it compensates for the difference between the averages (over the training set) of the target values and the weighted sum of the averages of the basis function values. What are other uses for this bias term?
