Elastic Transformation worked really well on my defect detector: https://github.com/nyck33/defect_detector_CNN_Keras/blob/master/ElasticTransform.ipynb It's on Kaggle too: https://www.kaggle.com/bguberfain/elastic-transform-for-data-augmentation It's used for medical imagery because it retains the position of pixels relative to an underlying grid while distorting the image but it works for pretty much any dataset I think.
