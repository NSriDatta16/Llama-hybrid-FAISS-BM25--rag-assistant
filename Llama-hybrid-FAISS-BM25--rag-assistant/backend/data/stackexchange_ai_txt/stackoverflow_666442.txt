PIVOT sucks. It has horrible syntax and isn't a PIVOT in the pivot table sense i.e. you have to know exactly how many columns will result in advance. It's probably easier to do a cross-tab report. SELECT OrganizationName, OrganizationID, SUM(CASE WHEN ReceivableStatus = '30-60 days' THEN InvoiceFee ELSE 0 END) AS [30 - 60 Days], SUM(CASE WHEN ReceivableStatus = '60-90 days' THEN InvoiceFee ELSE 0 END) AS [60 - 90 Days], SUM(CASE WHEN ReceivableStatus = '90-120 days' THEN InvoiceFee ELSE 0 END) AS [90 - 120 Days] FROM v_InvoicesFreelanceOutstanding GROUP BY OrganizationID
