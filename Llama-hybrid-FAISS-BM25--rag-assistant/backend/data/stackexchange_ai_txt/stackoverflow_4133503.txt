Is there such a thing as a valid HTML5 fragment?

I obviously can't determine whether a fragment of HTML is valid without knowing what the rest of the document looks like (at a minimum, I would need a doctype in order to know which rules I'm validating against). But given the following HTML5 fragment: My header My text I can certainly determine that it is invalid without seeing the rest of the document. So, is there such a thing as "provisionally valid" HTML, or "valid providing it fits into a certain place in a valid document"? Is there more to it than the following pseudocode? def is_valid_fragment(fragment): tmp = " " + fragment + " " return my_HTML5_validator.is_valid_html5_document(tmp)
