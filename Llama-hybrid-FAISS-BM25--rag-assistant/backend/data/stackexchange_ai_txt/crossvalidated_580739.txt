First, I want to reinforce two caveats from comments: (a) Per @Dave: $n = 100$ may be too small to see a clear pattern. If you have one defective part among 99 good parts in a sample of size 100, then the number $X$ of bad parts you get in 100 individual draws with replacement would be $X \sim\mathsf{Binom}(100, .01).$ Thus the number of bad parts in one experiment with 100 draws might be that I never see the bad part. set.seed(1234) x = rbinom(1, 100, .01) x [1] 0 But in 100,000 such draws of 100 parts, the average number $Y$ of bad parts seen in $100\,000$ draws is $1.$ Then I might see a number near to $1.$ set.seed(1235) y = mean(rbinom(10^5, 100, .01)); y [1] 1.00104 Second, per @MichaelLew: your goal is to get a confidence interval for the population mean $\mu,$ not for its estimate $\bar X.$ Finally, to look at a particularly simple case, suppose you are taking samples of size $n = 100$ from the normal population $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu, \sigma=1).$ Then, the z confidence interval for $\mu$ based on $n = 100, \sigma=10$ is of the form $\bar X \pm 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ or $\bar X \pm 1.96.$ Then you would hope to find that the CI covers (includes) the population mean $\mu = 85$ in about 95% of the $100\,000$ experiments, as illustrated by the simulation (using R) below. set.seed(2022) mu = 85 a = replicate(10^5, mean(rnorm(100, mu, 10))) summary(a) Min. 1st Qu.
