What does ICA return?

I am confused with ICA. With PCA I understood that it always gives the components with maximum variance. What does ICA return? Does it return components with maximum independence? How to find best number of components that describe the data? Someone told me about Kurtosis . The more kurtotic, the better. I am not sure what it meant. What could I interpret from the ICA plot that was generated by running ICA with 2 components?
