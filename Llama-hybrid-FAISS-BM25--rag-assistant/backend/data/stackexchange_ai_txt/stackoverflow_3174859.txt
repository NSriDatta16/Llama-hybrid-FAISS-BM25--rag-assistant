The usually fastest and most elegant method to duplicate a row that I know of is: Duplicating the row: INSERT INTO tablename SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE id = 1; querying the ID of the new record: SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() AS lastID; Storing that ID in a PHP variable (not shown here) and then updating the key in dependent tables: UPDATE related_table_name SET key = '$lastID' ( id needs to be an auto-increment column for this to work, and LAST_INSERT_ID() should be used immediately after the insert.) Reference: LAST_INSERT_ID() INSERT ... SELECT
