Likelihood ratio tests are statistical hypothesis tests that are based on a ratio of two likelihoods. Their properties are linked to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). (see e.g. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in layman terms ). In your case (see question) you want to ''choose'' among two nested var-covar models, let's say you want to choose between a model where the var-covar is $\Sigma_g$ and a model where the var-covar is $\Sigma_s$ where the second one (simple model) is a special case of the first one (the general one). The test is based on the likelihood ratio $LR=-2 (log(\mathcal{L}_s(\hat{\Sigma}_s)) - log(\mathcal{L}_g(\hat{\Sigma}_g) )$. Where $\hat{\Sigma}_s$ and $\hat{\Sigma}_g$ are the maximum likelihood estimators. The statistic $LR$ is , asymptotically (!) $\chi^2$. Maximum likelihood estimators are known to be consistent, however, in many cases they are biased . This is the case for the MLE estimators for the variance, $\hat{\Sigma}_s$ and $\hat{\Sigma}_g$, it can be show that they are biased. This is because they are computed using a mean that was derived from the data, such that the spread around this 'estimated average' is smaller than the spread around the true mean (see e.g. Intuitive explanation for dividing by $n-1$ when calculating standard deviation? ) The statistic $LR$ above is $\chi^2$ in large samples, this is just because of the fact that, in large samples, $\hat{\Sigma}_s$ and $\hat{\Sigma}_g$ converge to their true values (MLE are consistent). (Note: in the above link, for very large samples, dividing by n or by (n-1), will make no difference) For smaller samples, the MLE estimates of $\hat{\Sigma}_s$ and $\hat{\Sigma}_g$ will be biased and therefore the distribution of $LR$ will deviate from $\chi^2$, while the REML estimates will give unbiased estimates for $\Sigma_s$ and $\Sigma_g$, so if you use, for the selection of the var-covar model, the REML estimates then the $LR$ will for smaller samples be better approximated by the $\chi^2$. Note that REML should only be used to choose among nested var-covar structures of models with the same mean, for models with different means, the REML is not appropriate, for models with different means one should use ML.
