A framework for multi-valued categorical attributes

In the scenario in which I'm working each entity could be represented in terms of N distinct properties that I will call p1 , p2 , ..., pn . For each of them, an entity, can have its specific range of values for a single property. An entity's property couldn't have any value associated to it. Formally speaking, given an entity e and calling pk a specific property associated to e , it can have nk values associated ( nk >= 0). This is a brief example: director: Tarantino distributor: Miramax producer: Bender starring: Fox, Hannah, Dreyfus, Thurman director: Tarantino distributor: Miramax producer: Bender starring: Travolta, Jackson, Thurman I'm not able to understand how to represent these entities in order to be used by a machine learning algorithm. I have seen some others that transform multi-valued categorical attributes in multiple binary attributes. I think that in this case is fundamental to analyze each property exactly as it is, with all its values. After the creation of this method, I will be able to represent all the entities in my dataset. Supposing that, in this scenario, there are users that express a preference towards some of the entities (only a binary preference e.g., Tom likes entity 1 and so on). Using a machine learning algorithm, I would like to generate a model for each user in order to be able to understand if a new entity (a new film) could or not be liked by that user (this can be expressed with a value in a range between 0-1). At this point I have two distinct questions that I will report here: What could be a proper way to represent the dataset entities? What could be a proper machine learning algorithm which is able to generate a model using the entities that I have?
