How to get to the IronPython Lib directory from embedded engine?

I am embedding IronPython in a C# program. I understand that I need to call ScriptEngine.SetSearchPaths with a list of search paths so that my Python code can import modules. In particular I have to let it know where the standard library modules are, which in my case are here: C:\Program Files (x86)\IronPython 2.0.2\Lib My question is, how can that path be found programatically? It evidently can be done because the IronPython Console knows about it: >>> import sys >>> sys.path ['C:\\Windows\\system32', 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IronPython 2.0.2\\Lib', 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IronPython 2.0.2', 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IronPython 2.0.2\\lib\\site-packages']
