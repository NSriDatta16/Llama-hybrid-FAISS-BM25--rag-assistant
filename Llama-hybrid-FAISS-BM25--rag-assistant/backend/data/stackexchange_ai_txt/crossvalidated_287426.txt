I think your statement of the randomization inference null hypothesis is incorrect. Or at least, you're confusing two methods to test hypotheses versus two different hypotheses. The randomization test aka the permutation test considers the exact or approximation distribution of test statistics obtained when "labels" are randomly swapped between treatment/control subjects. This can be used to test the weak null hypothesis of no average treatment effect by calculating the t-test statistic for each permuted dataset and evaluating the proportion of these exceeding the one obtained in the unpermuted dataset. In this working article they frame the hypothesis of treatment effect variation as one of homogeneity where the average treatment effect is considered a nuisance parameter: basically "I don't care whether this drug works, I just want to know if it works differently in some people than it does in others." The effect for the first hypothesis, tested using usually analysis of parallel design, is called average treatment effect (ATE) and the second hypothesis here has been called treatment effect variation (TEV). Testing for TEV smells of a test of effect modification, in the absence of a known effect modifier, and resembles subgroup analysis. Using randomization tests for TEV is a novel and interesting method to consider and is worth reading this article in depth to understand how exactly they formulated such a test. To summarize how the two hypothesis might agree or disagree in a $2 \times 2$ table: Case 1: ATE no TEV: the drug works and it has the same potential outcome in everybody regardless. Solution: do not recommend if harmful, consider effect size before recommending approval/use. Case 2: no ATE no TEV: the drug does not work in anyone. Solution: conclude drug is futile relative to standard of care. Case 3: no ATE, TEV: the drug works in individuals in such a contrived way that the harm in some and the benefit in others is completely balanced. Solution: identify indicators/contraindicators of harm/benefit subgroups and conduct follow-up study if predicted benefit is of clinical significance. Case 4: ATE, TEV: the drug shows some average effect but this effect is not the same in everyone. Solution: identify harm groups if any and establish contraindications, predict benefit in remaining group and conduct follow-up study if it is of clinical significance.
