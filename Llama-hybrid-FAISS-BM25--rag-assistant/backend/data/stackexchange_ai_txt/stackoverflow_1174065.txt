I would suggest using the Non Virtual Interface idiom. All public functions are non-virtual. All virtual functions are protected or private. Public members delegate the calls to virtual members and are usually implemented as inline functions. This is the way IOStreams are implemented in STL. You can read more about it at C++ Wikibooks . Intent: To modularize/refactor common before and after code fragments (e.g., invariant checking, acquiring/releasing locks) for an entire class hierarchy at one location. Regards, Ovanes
