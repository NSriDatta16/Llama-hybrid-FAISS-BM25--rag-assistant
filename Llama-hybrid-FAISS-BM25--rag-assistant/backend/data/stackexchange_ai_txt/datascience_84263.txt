What you are looking for is training a classifier with data augmentation . In the context of image classification, this may refer to changing the pose of the object by skewing or rotating the image. In the context of text classification, this can be imagined as classifying different versions of the same sentence with an alternating word sequence (some languages allow it more than others, e.g. the Greek language allows it whereas the German language is stricter). More interestingly, this has found groundbreaking impact in the context of de novo drug design , where molecules are described by alphanumerical literals (strings) which can then be augmented by changing the sequence of their constituting characters in a chemically meaningful way. This is called randomization but essentially it is a remix of the original string and, thus, data augmentation. Finally, after you have decided on a data augmentation strategy, you apply it to your training dataset. All augmented versions of a data point maintain the same original label. Then, you are ready to train any classifier, such as a Random Forest or a Support Vector Machine on augmented and tokenized text data.
