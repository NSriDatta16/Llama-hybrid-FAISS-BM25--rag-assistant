Can this be modeled by a two-sample t-test?

Here is the question: A claim is made that men from two income families earn less than men who are the sole income earners in their household: To support this claim, data from a random sample of 22 married men was gathered. For this sample, the mean and standard deviation of salaries for 11 married men in two-income families was \$95,000 and \$15,000 respectively. The mean and standard deviation for the remaining 11 married men who were the sole source of family income was \$124,000 and \$18,000 respectively. (a) What are appropriate null and alternative hypotheses to test this claim? (b) State an appropriate test statistic to test this hypothesis and the null distribution of this test statistic, stating any assumptions that you use. (c) Calculate the test statistic chosen in (b), the corresponding p-value and form an appropriate conclusion. Here is my answer: (a) Essentially the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between married men from two income households versus one. So, I have: $H_{0} : U_{x}=U_{y}$, the alternative is that men who are sole earners do earn more, $H_{1} : U_{x} (b) Since the pop. variance is unknown, I use a pooled variance - a test statistic following a t-distribution is used : $\tau = \frac{\bar{X}-\bar{Y}}{S_{p}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{x}}+\frac{1}{n_{y}}}} \tilde{} t(n_{x}+n_{y}-2) = 20 $ My assumptions are that the samples have been obtained from a normal distribution population and that the populations have equal variance. (c) For the men from two income households we have: $\bar{x} = \$95,000 $ and $S_{x} = \$15,000 $, and the sole earners: $\bar{y} = \$124,000 $ and $S_{y} = \$18,000 $ The pooled variance is: $s_{p}^2 =\frac{(n_{1} - 1)s_{1}^2 + (n_{2} - 1)s_{2}^2}{n_{1}+n_{2} -2} $ $ = \frac{(11 - 1)15,000^2 + (11 - 1)18,000^2}{11+11 -2} = \$274,500,000$ so $ s_{p}= \$16,584.04$ Therefore the observed test statistic is: $\tau_{obs} = \frac{95,000-124,000}{16,568.04 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{11}}} \approx -4.10$ With a 5% level of significance, the critical value is: $t_{0.05,20} = -1.725$ Since $-4.10 The alternative hypothesis is $H_{1}: U_{x}-U_{y} Since the p value is less than the level of significance we can conclude that we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level of significance. I.e. the average salaries of men who are sole earners are higher than those men in two income homes. Have I done this correctly? Also, what exactly is the 'null distribution' of this test statistic? I read somewhere that it is the distribution when the null hypothesis is true. So is that just the assumption that the samples are from a normal distribution? I don't quite understand this concept. Many thanks for the feedback in advance!
