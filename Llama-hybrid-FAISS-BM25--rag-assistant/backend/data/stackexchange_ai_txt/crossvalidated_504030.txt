I see four abstract ways to do so from simplest to more complex. By applying $k$ -NN in different Random Projections latent space or other (eg Neural network autoencoder latent space) and combine them. that is: $Ensemble(kNN_{raw},kNN_{projected}) $ apply different colaborative filtering scores eg. average distance, mean distnace, max, or any other linear combination eg: $ score = w_1+d_{k_1} + w_2+d_{k_2} ...$ (for unseuprvised learning only), ann similarly combine them. use different bins of neighbors eg the bin_1: 1st-10th k neighbors, bin_2: 10th-20th. and combine the score from bin_number $k$ -NN. different distance definition (minkowski, manhatan etc) Hope it helps
