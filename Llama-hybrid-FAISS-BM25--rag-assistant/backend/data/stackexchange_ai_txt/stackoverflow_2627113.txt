Well, as you've noticed - WCF only ever conveys data across the server-client link - and that's absolutely intentional. WCF handles serialized messages - data only. Think about it for a second: WCF is totally interoperable - your client could be a PHP site calling you - how would those guys be able to execute your .NET code?? So basically the design recommendation is: make sure your data contracts are just that - pure data, no behaviors, no methods, nothing like that. If you need to do something on a piece of data - define a service method for it! That's what the whole service-oriented architecture is all about. So basically: there's really no elegant or proper way to achieve what you want - except for making your methods into service methods that operate on simple data contracts.
