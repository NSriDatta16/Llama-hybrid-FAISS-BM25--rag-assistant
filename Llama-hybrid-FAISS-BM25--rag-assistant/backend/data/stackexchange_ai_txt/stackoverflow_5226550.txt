Can I override the Javascript Function object to log all function calls?

Can I override the behavior of the Function object so that I can inject behavior prior t every function call, and then carry on as normal? Specifically, (though the general idea is intriguing in itself) can I log to the console every function call without having to insert console.log statements everywhere? And then the normal behavior goes on? I do recognize that this will likely have significant performance problems; I have no intention of having this run typically, even in my development environment. But if it works it seems an elegant solution to get a 1000 meter view on the running code. And I suspect that the answer will show me something deeper about javascript.
