I believe you can find some material in David Barber's book Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning . Check out chapter 22 for 'rankings from pairwise comparisons'. The book has a MATLAB toolbox with a Rasch model function implemented there. Ranking models such as the Bradley-Terry-Luce are modifications from the Rasch model, so I believe this code can provide you a head start. The routines are small, so converting from MATLAB to Python will not be very difficult.
