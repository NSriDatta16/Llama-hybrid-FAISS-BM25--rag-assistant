In my experience of using the methodology DSDM to drive the development of a mobile phone application, I utilised UML diagrams within the functional-prototyping stage(before the development began). I found that they gave me a much clearer understanding of how the application should look, how it is interacted with amongst people and other systems and began to show me how the code should be structured. For example, a class diagram would be created before you begin developing an application, as it allows you to think about what classes and attributes you might need.
