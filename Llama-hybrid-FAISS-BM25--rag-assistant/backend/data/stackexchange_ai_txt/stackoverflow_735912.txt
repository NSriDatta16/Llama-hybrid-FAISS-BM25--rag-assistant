It is possible that doing the joins is much faster than your object approach (although it is more elegant). With the joins you have only one db request, with the objects you have many. (Or you have to retrieve all the "possible" data in the first request, which could also slow down things) I recommend doing the joins. If there is a problem about the sql you can ask at stackoverflow :D Another idea: If you make urls like "/beatles/whitealbum/happinesisawarmgun" then you would know the artist in the begining of the request and could get the permission at once without traversing - because the url contains the traversal information. Just a thought.
