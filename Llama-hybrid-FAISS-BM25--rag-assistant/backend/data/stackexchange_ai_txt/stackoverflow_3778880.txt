I'd simply use an oldschool "touchesBegan" and "touchesEnded" and there check the x and y delta, if both of them is greater then some minimum constant, then this swipe should be a diagonal one. Correct me if I wrong but UISwipeGestureRecognizer available from iOS 3.2 only, and if so that is not an advantage.
