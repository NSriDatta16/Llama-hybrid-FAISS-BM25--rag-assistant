Does the order of features affect the solution model classifier accuracy in an SVM using RBF kernel?

Is it possible that the order of features will change the accuracy of an SVM RBF kernel based classifier? I'm also interested in whether this would affect other ML classification algorithms, if applicable? For example, if you have 5 features, and you order the columns differently: 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 1 5 2 4 3 Will all of these always produce the same result?
