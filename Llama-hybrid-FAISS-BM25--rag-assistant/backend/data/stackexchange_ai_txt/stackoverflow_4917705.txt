You can use a plugin called Tabularize which you can get from https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular . In the case you listed you could do :Tabularize /(.* and it will change your text file to look like this: user 1: chris (05/04/1984) user 2: robert (11/12/1991) user 3: ben (5/25/1993) Then you can simply use visual block to pull the text. It's a great plugin that saves an incredible amount of time.
