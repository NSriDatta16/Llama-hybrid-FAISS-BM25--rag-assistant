Location and Time Fixed effects in ML models

I am developed a model to estimating the value of a real estate asset. My model includes a bunch of property and location related features and I am planning on adding more variables for improving the model and controlling effects. Particularly, I am interested in adding economy data such as jobs, earnings etc and measures that capture market demand. In econometrics theory, this would fixed effects model that are "fixed" for the time period and location. How would I use them in Machine Learning context? Do they behave in a similar way as controlling for average differences across locations of observable and unobservable time-invariant features?
