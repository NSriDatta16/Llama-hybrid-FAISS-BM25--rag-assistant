Linear mixed effects model on physiological parameter as function of time

I have 1000 individuals with measurements of plasmatic HDL levels over the last 15 years. The number of measurements per individual ranges from 1 to 15, and were not taken in the same dates. I would like to compare the HDL levels (quantitative trait) over time in the individuals and make a ranking of those individuals whose HDL levels are consistently the highest over time. I want to adjust for sex and Tanner (categorical variable related to puberty development, it can be 1,2,3,4 or 5). I have a data.frame (data) with 5 columns: ID ( individual ID ), HDL , Age (at the time of measurement), Sex and Tanner . This is a data frame with a toy example: ID HDL Age Sex Tanner 1 50 12.3 M 2 1 52.1 15.4 M 4 1 55.3 17.1 M 5 2 45 12.1 M 1 2 46.3 13.1 M 1 3 60 14.3 F 3 3 55 16.2 F 5 ... ... ... ... ... This is the model I figured out: library(lme4) model = lmer(HDL ~ Age + Sex + (1|Tanner) + (1|ID), data) Age and Sex are my fixed variables and I expect to adjust for variation between Tanner . Individuals of the same Tanner should have more similar HDL values for reasons other than Age and Sex . After running the regression, I extract the intercept and slope from each individual using coef(data)$ID . Then, I multiply each intercept by the corresponding slope and get the final value I will use for the ranking. Is my reasoning correct?
