Why have my items loaded under "wrong" (non-hypothesized) components in PCA/FA?

I have conducted PCA as a variant of EFA to develop a scale. I'm a student of applied linguistics and the method of rotation was promax. A questionnare of 60 items has been answered by 200 participants. The items of the questionnaire were prepared based on 15 components extracted from interviews and literature reviews. There are two problems. First, some items have loaded under wrong components. So I prepared the item for component one but it is loaded under component 3. What do I do with the chaotic findings? Second, there are 4 components with only 2 loaded factors. Should I discard that component? Now that the items appear to be disorganized how can I make sure that component 3 on SPSS output is component 3 on my own list of themes?
