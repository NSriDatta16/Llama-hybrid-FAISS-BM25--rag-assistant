The pragmatic programmer has a good section on text editing that hits home for me. The core principle is that once you learn a powerful (and extensible) editor then you can slice and dice code with efficiency, very little effort, and without regard for language you happen to be working with at the time. A good IDE can be a good editor providing that it supports the various languages and text formats you routinely edit. On that note I'm a bit disappointed that Visual Studio doesn't have built-in support for file types such as .ini, .cmd, .bat, .reg, and so on. seems like this would be trivial to add and would make developers more likely to rely on that editor for everything. (aside: this is very different from relying on an IDE as a crutch. every developer should understand every bit of code in their project and not rely on wizardry.)
