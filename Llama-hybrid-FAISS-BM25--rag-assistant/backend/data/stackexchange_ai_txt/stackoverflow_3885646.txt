#pragma once is not guaranteed to be supported on all compilers, use include guards instead. Furthermore, you have cyclic includes: "Agui.h" includes "AguiBaseTypes.h" and vice versa. That's not the way it's meant to be. A global include file might be okay to reduce boilerplate code in source files, but in header files, you should include exactly the necessary headers, or else you get the problem that you described.
