What does a wedge-like shape of the PCA plot indicate?

In their paper on autoencoders for text classification Hinton and Salakhutdinov demonstrated the plot produced by 2-dimensional LSA (which is closely related to PCA): . Applying PCA to absolutely different slightly high dimensional data I obtained a similarly looking plot: (except in this case I really wanted to know if there is any internal structure). If we feed random data into PCA we obtain a disk-shaped blob, so this wedge-shaped shape is not random. Does it mean anything by itself?
