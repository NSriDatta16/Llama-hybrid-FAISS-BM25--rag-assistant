Is it required that the header contain the name of this variable? If you are using a global variable named "new", then of course that would be a reason it is required that you have a globally visible variable name. On the other hand, if this is something like a function argument named "new", simply delete the name from the declaration of the function. If the name is a member of a structure or union, changing it in the header file will not harm the .C code as long as the .C code sees a "private" definition with the name matching that source code. Since the .C files should be compiled in C syntax and thus will be able to cope with the variable named "new," fixing the header files ought to be a valid work-around. For the long-term, yes you should bring this to the attention of the library developer. As a final, somewhat hacky, solution, you could change the header file from "new" to something, e.g., "was_new." And when compiling the C files of the library use compiler switches to enforce #define new was_new .
