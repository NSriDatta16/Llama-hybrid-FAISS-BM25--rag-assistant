References for tiny sample statistics

There are multiple fascinating problems and approaches connected to really small samples . It is possible to estimate confidence intervals using a single point , or there are well known problems such as German tank problem (or similar here ) etc. I recently asked about forecasting with short time series . The problem is also that most of the statistical methods are designed for large samples and many theorems are described in context of "$n \rightarrow \infty$" what makes it troublesome to generalize them to really small samples. Because in general it is hard to find literature dealing with the topic of tiny samples I wanted to ask if you could suggest any?
