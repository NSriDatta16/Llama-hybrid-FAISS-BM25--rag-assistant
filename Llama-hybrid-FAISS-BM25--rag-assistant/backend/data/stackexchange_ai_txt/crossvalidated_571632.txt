What type of Markov Chain is a random walk of a Knight on a chessboard?

Assume we have the following chessboard and we have a knight that starts at the top left corner of the board. On every move the Knight chooses reachable square (i.e. a valid chess move a Knight can make to that square so moving in the shape of an L for the Knight.) Consider a Markov Chain that represents the random walk of the Knight. What kind of Markov Chain is this? Irreducible, reducible, aperiodic, periodic? My educated guess is that'd it be irreducible since given at state the Knight has the guaranteed possibility to get back to a state it started at by reversing it's actions. Then it'd have to be aperiodic because it's irreducible. Is this correct?
