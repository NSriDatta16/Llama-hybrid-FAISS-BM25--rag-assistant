Is it meaningful to reduce dimension from 300 to 100 by PCA?

as I have only learned PCA for a short while, some problems occured when I faced practice. I am willing to accept solution or advice for the following content and great many thanks for anyone's kindly help. Edit: the dataset will be used in a prediction model. Supposed that there is one dataset with 300 characteristics and they are grouped by two different collecting methods, each of which has the same 150 characteristics. As these 2 collecting methods have much in common, the observations between them should be similar. Correlation matrix of the whole dataset lies below, The lower left part (part 1) of the matrix can be viewed as the correlation matrix of the characteristics within method 1, and the upper left part (part 2) of the matrix describes the correlation of the characteristics across the two methods. Here's my first question: what can we infer from the similar pattern between part 1 and part 2 in light of dimensionality reduction? Is it possible to cut the number of characteristics by half with the information given in this graph? Moving on to the next stage, I performed PCA to the whole dataset. The result showed that in order to obtain 90% of the information of original dataset, I needed to keep 67 dimensions. Screeplot and biplot of the result lie below, And my second question is just like the title of this question: is it acceptable to reduce dimensions from over 300 to 67? Since 67 is still a great number, I don't quite know whether it is useful or not to perform such a PCA. Or might there be any way of enhancing the effect? My third question is that: what can one infer from the pattern of this biplot with first two dimensions? Thanks so much for reading my questions, and they lie below, What can we infer from the similar pattern between part 1 and part 2 in light of dimensionality reduction?
