Let $x_1, â€¦,x_n $ be a sequence of vectors (e.g., word vectors). Applying a convolutional layer is equivalent to applying the same weight matrices to all n-grams, where $n$ is the height of your filter. E.g., if $n=3$, you can visualize it as follows: For a slightly more mathematical explanation, you can check out Ji Young Lee, Franck Dernoncourt. " Sequential Short-Text Classification with Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks ". NAACL 2016 . section 2.1.2:
