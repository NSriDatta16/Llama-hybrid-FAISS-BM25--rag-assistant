If I want to combine those 5 measures into a single value, would it make sense to represent them as the magnitude of a 5D vector? Absolutely, if result suits you. Is there a way to put more "weight" on certain measures, such as the PNL? You can introduce constant weights SQRT(wa*A^2 + wb*B^2 + wb*C^2) Is there a better way to combine them? That depends on your requirements. In particular, there's nothing wrong with using simple sum |A| + |B| + |C| , that would favour 'average' properties better. I.e., with your formula (0, 0, 9) gives much better total than (3, 3, 3) , while with the simple sum they would be equivalent. Generally speaking Oli is right: you'll have to make the decision yourself, no algorithm book can evaluate the requirements for you.
