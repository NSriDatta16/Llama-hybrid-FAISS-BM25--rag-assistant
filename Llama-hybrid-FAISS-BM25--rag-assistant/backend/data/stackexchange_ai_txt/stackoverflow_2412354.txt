Eclipseâ€™s Ctrl+click does not work and indexer does not seem to update?

I am running Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers (Ganymede) and I have recently encountered a problem with it. I can no longer get Ctrl+click navigation to work! I went to my project and tried to rebuild the index, but the rebuild command of the indexer does not work either. I did not do anything to my knowledge that may have caused this bug and so I was wondering if it could be a corrupt index or something else weird like that. Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
