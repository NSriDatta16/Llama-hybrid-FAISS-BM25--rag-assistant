DataGrid SelectionChanged happens too often

As I have a DataGrid as another DataGrid's RowDetailsTemplate, I've got a strage effekt. If I Change selection in my inner DataGrid, the SelectionChanged-Method in the outer Grid is automatically caled, too. I don't know why, but I would like to know, what I can do against this. Thx
