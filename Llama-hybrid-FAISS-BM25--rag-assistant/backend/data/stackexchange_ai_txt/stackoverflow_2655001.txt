Is there a way to use sharepoint as the back-end versioning and storage for my custom document management website?

I want to build a custom document management web application that ties in with sharepoint for the actual document versioning and storage. I'm hoping for something like a sharepoint widget that I can plug into my web application that would allow me to tie in with sharepoint and download documents, make edits to them, and upload them back to sharepoint, with sharepoint handling all of the versioning and storage. Basically I'm looking for a sharepoint API. If WSS is the answer to this, are there licensing issues that I need to consider? Thanks.
