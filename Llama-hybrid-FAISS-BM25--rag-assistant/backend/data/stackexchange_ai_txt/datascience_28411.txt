How to plot cost versus number of iterations in scikit learn?

One of the recommendations in the Coursera Machine Learning course when working with gradient descent based algorithms is: Debugging gradient descent. Make a plot with number of iterations on the x-axis. Now plot the cost function, J(θ) over the number of iterations of gradient descent. If J(θ) ever increases, then you probably need to decrease α. Do gradient descent based models in scikit-learn provide a mechanism for retrieving the cost vs the number of iterations?
