Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test # of Lags

as part of a time series analysis for my master thesis I want to test whether a time series is stationary with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test in Python. I attached the result for one time series. While I do understand that this result means that the series is stationary, I do not get what the # of lags are. Does this mean that the series is only stationary if 13 lags are used? Do I need to transform the data? Help would be highly appreciated! import statsmodels from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller import pandas as pd import statsmodels.api as sm from statsmodels.tsa.filters.hp_filter import hpfilter class StationaryTests: def __init__(self, significance=.05): self.Significance self.pValue = None self.isStationary = None def ADF_Stationarity_Test(self, timeseries, printResults = True): #Dicky-Fuller tests: #adfTest = adfuller(timeseries, maxlag = 1) adfTest = adfuller(timeseries, autolag='AIC') self.pValue = adfTest[1] if (self.pValue
