compare returns true if and only if all three iterators point to the same object. If the iterators pointed to objects of different types, there could be a compilation error. The iterators point to different objects, because the arguments are all different, so compare returns false . This result is thrown away. Then the program prints a unique string identifying the type std::vector ::iterator . This might be a long string mentioning the fragments std , vector , and iterator , or it might be simply pi for "pointer to integer," if the implementation uses typedef T *iterator . Finally it prints 10 because that is the first value in v2 .
