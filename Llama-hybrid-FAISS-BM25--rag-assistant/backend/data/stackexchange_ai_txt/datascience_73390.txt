Is my loss function right? WGAN

I am new to GANs, but I was able to train a DCGAN decently. I decided to try a WGAN (not the improved one). I seem to get outputs, but my loss doesn't seem to converge for the generator. I am using the loss function from keras import backend as K def wasserstein_loss(y_true, y_pred): return K.mean(y_true * y_pred) for both the critic and generator. I am labelling real images as -1 and fake ones as 1. Here's my loss over time: Is the generator loss supposed to behave like that? Even though the discriminator loss seems to behave as expected, is a swing that large normal?
