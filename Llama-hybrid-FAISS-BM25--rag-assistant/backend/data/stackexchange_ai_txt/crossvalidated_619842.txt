Those are, in all sense, legit estimators. What is probably confusing you is the employment of what you termed " some kind of supporting random variable ". The most conspicuous thing to be noted is you are working with a finite population: you are aware of the sampling frame. The "supporting random variables" that you are referring to are nothing but inclusion indicators - $\mathbb I_i(s) $ indicates whether the index $i$ is present in the sample $s.$ In fact the random vector $\mathbf d:=\langle \mathbb I_i\rangle_{i=1}^N; N:=\operatorname{card}(U),$ plays a pivotal role in probability sampling as $\rm[I]$ writes: The probabilistic behavior of functions of the sample depends on the probability distribution of $\bf d$ . Any design linear estimator can be expressed as $\hat{\theta}=\sum_{i\in S} w_iy_i, ~w_i$ being independent with respect to the random mechanism generating $y_i$ s. The $Y_i$ s in a sample is random. But you can take advantage of the finiteness of the population to assess the moments in that $\hat{\theta}$ is basically $\sum_{i\in U} w_iy_i\mathbb I_i(s). $ Of course, when you operate $\mathbb E[\cdot], $ it would be on $\mathbb I_i(s) $ (which would yield the inclusion probability $\pi_i$ ) that is you are averaging over all possible samples based on the finite population. Just because you are utilizing the advantage of having a finite population using the inclusion variables doesn't make $\hat{\theta}$ any less of an estimator - it is still a (measurable) function of the sample $s. $ Reference: $\rm [I]$ Sampling Statistics, Wayne A.
