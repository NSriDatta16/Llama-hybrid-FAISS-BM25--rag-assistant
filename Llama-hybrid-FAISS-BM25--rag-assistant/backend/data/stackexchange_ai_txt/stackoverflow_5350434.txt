MongoDB troubleshooting on Windows (C#) (What to do?)

I have trouble with MongoDB on Windows 7 (32 bit). I make some tests with adding/deleting data. So after some time (i do not know how much, maybe 10 minutes of non-stopping requests) MongoDB server still works but not answers! From console shell I tried command "show collections", but it stucks! The size of storage at this moment was only 160 MBs. This trouble was yesterday and it was before not always, but from time to time. And only after restarting MongoDB works fine before next such trouble. Help me please what to check, profile, etc. Finally MongoDB will work on 64 bit machines, but I am afraid, because I do not want to restart it every 10-60 minutes!!! I use official C# driver. Thank you for advices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Closed
