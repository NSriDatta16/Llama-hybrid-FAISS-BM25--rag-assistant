What is this lag plot telling me?

I am working on predicting power consumption. I have been struggling to identify autocorrelation in my time series data. The lag plot created below is for power consumption over 5 minute intervals. I created it using the lag_plot function. 1.Is there something wrong with my data? What is this plot saying?
