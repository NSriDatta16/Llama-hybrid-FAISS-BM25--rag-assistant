How to perform nested factor repeated measure MANOVA

I have 3 independent variables - Game (3 groups) Noise Type (2 groups - SNM (Sequential Noise Model), ZMGN(Zero Mean Gaussian Noise)) Noise Level (5 groups - AL-AverageLow, AM-AverageMedium, N-None, L-Low, M-Medium) Noise Type and Noise Level are nested factors such that - SNM - AverageLow, AverageMedium ZMGN - None, Low, Medium That is: Noise Level ZGMN | SNM Game none low medium | Ave.low Ave.Med ST TT Pass My observations include Player Experience (PX) under different conditions. So, I'm interested to find out the interaction between the Noise Type and Game that is, Does the PX vary under different type of noise for different games. I'm finding it hard because under Noise Type (SNM and ZMGN), I have another nested factor Noise Level. SNM has 2 Noise Levels (AverageLow, AverageMedium) and ZMGN has 3 Noise Levels (None, Low, Medium). PX contains multiple factors - Competence, Enjoyment, Tension/Pressure, Effort. Also my comparisons are within subject means - One participant has gone through all the conditions. Can I perform repeated measure MANOVA with nested factors?
