(disclaimer: I work at Sun and I am in the GF team) I agree that Seam works fine on GlassFish; see https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/tags/seam GFv3 is quite different than JBoss 5; in particular: GFv3 is based on OSGi while JBoss 5's kernel is based on JMX. GFv3 supports JavaEE 6; JBoss 5 supports Java EE 5. GFv3 is designed to be very modular; services start on demand, there is an update center repository, etc. GFv3 is significantly smaller than JBoss 5 and will start much faster. JBoss 5.1 GA is listed as 130MB; GFv3Preview is 50MB. GFv3 starts in a couple of seconds; JBoss in tens (you should try the startup for your own platform). There are other differences, some inherited from GlassFish v2 like the graphical admin console, or the admin CLI. A more direct comparison for JBoss 5 would be the GlassFish v2 releases, which are based on Java EE 5. The latest release in that family is GFv2.1, with a GFv2.1.1 release scheduled in October (see https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/schedule_for_glassfish_v2_1 ). Sun also provides patch releases of GlassFish (akin to RedHat's support for JBoss); see https://blogs.oracle.com/glassfishforbusiness and sun.com/glassfish.
