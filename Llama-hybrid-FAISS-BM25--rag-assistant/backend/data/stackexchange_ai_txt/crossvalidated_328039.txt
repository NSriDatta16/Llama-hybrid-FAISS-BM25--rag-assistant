Not only the (weak and strong) laws of large numbers hold for averages of iid random variables $X_i$ with no assumption on the existence of a variance, but the weak [and only the weak] law of large numbers may even occur without the existence of an expectation of $X_i$, as detailed on the corresponding Wikipedia page . Remember that the weak law of large numbers states that there exists $\mu$ such that$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(|\bar{X}_n-\mu|>\epsilon)=0$$for every positive constant $\epsilon>0$. And that the strong law of large numbers states [informally] that $$\mathbb{P}(\lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{X}_n=\mu)=1$$In the event the expectation $\mathbb{E}[X_i]$ exists, then $\mathbb{E}[X_i]=\mu$. Counter-examples provided in Wikipedia are $X=\sin(Z)\exp\{Z\}/Z$ when $Z\sim\mathcal{E}xp(1)$, with $\mu=\pi/2$ $X=2^Z(-1)^Z/z$ when $Z\sim\mathcal{G}(1/2)$, with $\mu=-\log(2)$ $X\sim F(x)$ with $$F(x)=\mathbb{I}_{x\ge e}-\frac{e\mathbb{I}_{x\ge e}}{2x\log(x)}-\frac{e\mathbb{I}_{x\le-e}}{2x\log(-x)}+\frac{\mathbb{I}_{-e\le x\le e}}{2}$$with $\mu=0$ [in the sense that the rv's have no expectation but there exits a limit $\mu$ for the sample mean].
