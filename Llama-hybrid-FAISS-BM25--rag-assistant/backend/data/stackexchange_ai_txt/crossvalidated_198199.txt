How different is Support Vector Regression compared to SVM?

I know the basics about SVM and SVR, but still I don't get how the problem of finding a hyperplane which maximizes the margin fits into SVR. Second, I read something about $\epsilon$ used as margin of tolerance in SVR. What does it mean? Third, is there any difference between decision function parameters used in SVM and SVR?
