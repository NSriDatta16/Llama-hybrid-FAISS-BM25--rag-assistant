jquery ajax ignores 500 status error

I'm making some GET requests to an App Engine app, testing in Chrome. Whilst I can see in javascript console that some calls result in a 500 server error, I can't seem to find anyway of capturing this error in my jQuery code despite reading a number of similar SO threads. I understand that it indicates a server side error, but I'd still like to be able to capture such an error from my javascript. I need to capture the error so that I can count the number of responses (successful or otherwise) and trigger another function when all call responses have been received. Chrome console output: GET http://myapp.com/api?callback=jQuery12345&params=restOfParams 500 (Internal Server Error) My call: function makeCall() { var count = 0; var alldata = $('#inputset').val(); var rows = alldata.split('\n'); var countmatch = rows.length; for (i=0;i I've tried some of the following: Adding: statusCode: {500: function() {alert('err');}} to the call. Using: $().ready(function(){ $.ajaxSetup({ error:function(x,e) { if(x.status==500) { alert('Internel Server Error.'); } } }); }); Would anyone have a suggestion regarding how I could catch the 500 response? Thanks Oli UPDATE: Based on responses, my jquery code appears to be correct, but for some reason it would only catch certain 500 responses received from my app. This is possibly a problem with how App Engine returns the error(I don't know a lot about this), or how jquery handles errors with jsonp - this point is briefly discussed in the last paragraph of this article. I got this to work by using jquery-isonp which caught all of the 500 status's thrown by the app.
