Most elegant way to implement animated "sliding panels"

I'm attempting to implement a similar animated "sliding panels" effect as the Aveda website. I'm a little overwhelmed by all the options and Javascript libraries that are available. And a little confused after examining the Aveda website code. Any recommendations as to how to approach this task please? Which Javascript/Effects library would be most suitable? I don't have any allegiance or greater experience in one library over the other. My requirements are: Cross-browser compatibility (of course) Simple & Elegant implementation Don't want to re-invent the wheel Ability to animate and to be activated by mouse-clicks (like the Aveda front page) Dynamic (don't want to have to modify javascript as more 'panels' are added) My first impressions would be to use Scriptaculous - Effect.Move, but I'm aware that there are ready-made implementations like Spry's . Any words of wisdom and suggestions would be greatly appreciated by this Javascript newbie. Prembo.
