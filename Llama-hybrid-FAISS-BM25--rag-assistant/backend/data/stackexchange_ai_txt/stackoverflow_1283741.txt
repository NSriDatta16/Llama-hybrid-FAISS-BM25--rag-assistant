Download all the source files listed on the page: CameraSource, GenuineCamera, HttpCamera, SocketCamera, BitmapCamera, and WebcamBroadcaster. Create a package in your project called com.tomgibara.android.camera and place the first 4 source files inside. Download JMF from here and install it. Compile WebcamBroadcaster using the following command: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_15\bin\javac.exe" -classpath "C:\Program Files (x86)\JMF2.1.1e\lib" WebcamBroadcaster.java or what's equivalent to it. Run it with the following command and keep it running: java "-Djava.library.path=C:\Program Files (x86)\JMF2.1.1d\lib" WebcamBroadcaster Use the following code in your program: CameraSource cs = new SocketCamera("192.168.0.100", 9889, 320, 240, true); if (!cs.open()) { /* deal with failure to obtain camera */ } while(/*some condition*/) { cs.capture(canvas) //capture the frame onto the canvas } cs.close(); PS: I haven't been able to test this because I'm getting an error when I run WebcamBroadcaster . PPS: I just started experimenting with Android today so all this could be wrong.
