Help me understand Bayesian prior and posterior distributions

In a group of students, there are 2 out of 18 that are left-handed. Find the posterior distribution of left-handed students in the population assuming uninformative prior. Summarize the results. According to the literature 5-20% of people are left-handed. Take this information into account in your prior and calculate new posterior. I know the beta distribution should be used here. First, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values as 1? The equation I found in the material for posterior is $$\pi(r \vert Y ) \propto r^{(Y +−1)} \times (1 − r)^{(N−Y +−1)} \\ $$ $Y=2$ , $N=18$ Why is that $r$ in the equation? ( $r$ denoting the proportion of left-handed people). It is unknown, so how can it be in this equation? To me it seems ridiculous to calculate $r$ given $Y$ and use that $r$ in the equation giving $r$ . Well, with the sample $r=2/18$ the result was $0,0019$ . The $f$ should I deduce from that? The equation giving an expected value of $R$ given known $Y$ and $N$ worked better and gave me $0,15$ which sounds about right. The equation being $E(r | X, N, α, β) = (α + X)/(α + β + N)$ with value $1$ assigned to $α$ and $β$ . What values should I give $α$ and $β$ to take into account prior information? Some tips would be much appreciated. A general lecture on prior and posterior distributions wouldn't hurt either (I have vague understanding what they are but only vague) Also bear in mind I'm not very advanced statistician (actually I'm a political scientist by my main trade) so advanced mathematics will probably fly over my head.
