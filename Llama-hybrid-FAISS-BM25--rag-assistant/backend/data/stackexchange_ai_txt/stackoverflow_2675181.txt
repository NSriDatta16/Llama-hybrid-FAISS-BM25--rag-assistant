Pragma statements can not be used within other statements (there are no references to pragma-stmt from other statements). But you can use the user_version value by making two requests: querying pragma and using the selected value as literal in the next query. UPD : if you are interested in PRAGMA syntax, it is rather simple: sqlite> pragma user_version=10; sqlite> pragma user_version; user_version ------------------------------ 10 sqlite> pragma user_version='12.3.124'; sqlite> pragma user_version; user_version ------------------------------ 12 That is the result will come as a row with a single value. If you are interested in a way to issue statements to SQLite in objective-c, try looking at neighbour questions : example . Unfortunatelly, I've never coded in objective-c.
