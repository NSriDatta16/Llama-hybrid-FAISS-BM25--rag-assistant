How to properly normalize multivariate time series data?

My data has three kinds of features, with different distributions and ranges, and I am going to use RNN to model such data. In the process of normalization, my initial thoughts are: compute z-score for features with normal distribution. min-max scale non normal features into range [-1,+1] (align with the output of relu function). Transform binary features from [0, 1] to [-1, 1]. However, since z-score is in unit of one std, its not in range [-1, +1] as in other two cases. Would this causing any problems? If so, what is the best strategy to normalize?
