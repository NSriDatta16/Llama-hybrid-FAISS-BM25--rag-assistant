First approach: use before_filter . upd: it won't work for you (I will leave it here for educational purposes) class CitiesController [:asian, :western, :middle-east] def show ... end def western end def middle-east end def asian end private def spots_and_city(type) @city = City.find(params[:id]) @spots = Spot.paginate( :conditions => ["(city=? or state=?) and country=? and shop_type=?", "#{@city.name}", "#{@city.name}", @city.country, "Accommodation"], :page => params[:page], :per_page => 20, :order => 'rating_average DESC' ) end end Second approach use helper method : updated class CitiesController ["(city=? or state=?) and country=? and shop_type=?", "#{@city.name}", "#{@city.name}", @city.country, type], :page => params[:page], :per_page => 20, :order => 'rating_average DESC' ) end end Third: use Decent Exposure http://railscasts.com/episodes/259-decent-exposure In my opinion I prefer to use helper_method for such job.
