I think you have indeed over-confused yourself! You have one Markov chain $(X_n)_{n \geq 0}$ with a transition matrix $P$ . That means, this generates the process $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots$ . Define $Y_n = X_{kn}$ . The notation $X_{kn}$ means $X$ at times $kn$ , for $n \geq 0$ . So, this generates the process, $X_{k}, X_{2k}, X_{3k}, \dots $ . This has now been defined as $Y_n$ , so that $Y_1 = X_k, Y_2 = X_{2k}, Y_3 = X_{3k} \dots$ . Thus, $Y$ just picks out every $k$ th time point of $X$ .
