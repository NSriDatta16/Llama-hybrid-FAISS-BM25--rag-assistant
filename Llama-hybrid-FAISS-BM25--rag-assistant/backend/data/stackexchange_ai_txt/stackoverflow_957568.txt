How can I count this when there are no rows?

I am trying to count the number of days of the current week that do not have an event associated with them, but I don't know how to do it. For example, I count the number of events happening this week with this query: SELECT COUNT(e.event_id) FROM cali_events e LEFT JOIN cali_dates d ON e.event_id = d.event_id WHERE YEARWEEK(d.date) = YEARWEEK(CURRENT_DATE()) But I only know how to count the days by counting each individual day and summing up the days that return 0, but that's not very elegant. How could I do it with one query?
