I usually like to stick to the 1 class, 1 file rule, but when it comes to EventArgs, I actually like to declare them in the same file that I define the delegate or event. Unless, the args are used by more than one class hierarchy, which doesn't tend to happen to me often. As for the cache, I would put in the folder of the classes in which it supports. As much as I like good organization, one can get too anal with it.
