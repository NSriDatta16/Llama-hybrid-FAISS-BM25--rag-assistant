Dependency Walker is your friend for examining the dll dependencies of compiled binaries. The principal problem is of course, you have added glut.lib or glut32.lib to your project someplace. Its probably in the Project Properties > Linker Settings > Additional Libraries, or some source file contains a #pragma something like this :- #pragma comment(lib, "glut32.lib")
