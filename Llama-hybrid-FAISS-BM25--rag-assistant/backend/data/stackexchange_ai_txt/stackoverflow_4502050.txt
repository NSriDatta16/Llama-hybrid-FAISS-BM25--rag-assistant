Alternative to Rhino for expression parsing in Java

In my java program I use rhino expression evaluator to parse an expression from a table into keys and values which is matched against a given java object . The performance of this evaluator is not that good and on an average takes about 50ms per evaluation. Is these a better / faster version of rhino or any other js interpretor that I can use. Using compiled js interpretors like spiderMnkey as the whole code is Java.
