Embedding MySql query in Excel, varchar column

I'm trying to embed mysql queries into excel and I've been mostly successful so far. I'm using the odbc and Import Data External.............From a database query. Problem is that when I return text columns they show in the query and in the msquery browser but they won't return to the sheet. How do I have text columns return do the sheet using this method.
