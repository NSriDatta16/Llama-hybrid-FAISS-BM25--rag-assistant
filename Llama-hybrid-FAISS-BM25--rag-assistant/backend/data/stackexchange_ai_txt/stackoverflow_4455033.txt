How to set up TeamCity/NAnt/Gallio/PartCover to show test results?

This is my first time setting up teamcity and I am running into some issues displaying results. I want to have a build step that runs an NAnt script. The script should run my unit tests through PartCover and display results. The results should be: Tests that pass/Tests that fail Coverage report But I don't really know how to set up the script or the settings or even where I should view these results (the artifacts section I'm guessing?). Using the following script below, everything runs ok but I am not able to view any reports. One or more tests failed. Please check the log for more details For the .Net Coverage section, I have PartCover (2.2 or 2.3) selected but I don't have anything in the PartCover Arguments (should I?) Thanks for your help!
