A module is a higher level of organization than a subroutine or function. Function "x" should be able to use the module useful. I think it more likely that program "main" is having difficulty correctly accessing "x". You would do better to also place function "x" into the module after a "contains" statement. In this case remove the "use useful" statement from "x". Then the program main would have full knowledge of the interface ... in Fortran nomenclature, the interface is explicit. This ensures that the passing of arguments is consistent. It would help if you showed the error messages from the compiler. Fortran 95/2003 is much more than FORTRAN 77 with a few extra useful features. The changes are much larger. Trying to learn it from the web is not a good idea. I suggest that you find a copy of the book "Fortran 95/2003 Explained" by Metcalf, Reid and Cohen.
