How do I create custom fields like mobile number in customer registration form without modifying magento core files?

How do I create custom fields like mobile number in customer registration form without modifying magento core files? I tried but the mobile number is not saved in the DB I override the Mage_Customer_Model_Entity_Setup class with Myown_Mage_Customer_Model_Entity_Setup by creating Model/Entity/Setup.php in my modules folder and added the following code to the array in getDefaultEntities 'mobilenumber' => array( 'label' => 'Mobile Number', 'visible' => true, 'required' => true, ), also my config file contains following code Myown_Mage_Customer_Model_Entity_Setup Also i have this field in template/customer/form/register.phtml htmlEscape($this->getFormData()->getMobilenumber()) ?>" title=" __('Mobile Number') ?>" class="required-entry input-text" /> Is there any thing I miss in this configuration? I want to save the mobile number in the DB and retrieve it afterward.
