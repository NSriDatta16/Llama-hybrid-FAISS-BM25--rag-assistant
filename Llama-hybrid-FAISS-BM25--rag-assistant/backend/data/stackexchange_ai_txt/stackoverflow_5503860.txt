I'd recommend do your own library. So you don't mess the code up. You can make a simple catalog, something like this: $pages_includes = array( 'index' => array( 'script1.js', 'script2.js', 'style1.css', 'style2.css', ), 'contact' => array( 'script1.js', 'style1.css', 'style2.css', ) ); Then, in your "library" you could make something like this function myImport($page_name){ $includes = $pages_includes[$page_name]; foreach(includes as $k=>$v){ include_once($v); } } And, in your page you can do something like this: myImport($_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]); Those are simple ways to organize your code and make it modular. If you have to change any imports you can do it in your Catalog ($pages_includes) and not in the code. Even you can read your catalog from a XML file. A simple lesson of scalability and extensibility ;)
