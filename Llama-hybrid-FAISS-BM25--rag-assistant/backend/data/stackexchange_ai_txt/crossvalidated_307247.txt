k-fold crossvalidation: how does MSE go with k?

I'm trying to get an intuition about choosing the right "k" for K-Fold validation. Is the following right? Average of the OOS MSEs should generally decrease as k increases . Because, a bigger "k" means the training sets are larger, so we have more data to fit the model (assuming we are using the "right" model). Variance of the OOS MSEs should generally increase as k increases . A bigger "k" means having more validation sets. So we will have have more individual MSEs to average out. Since the MSEs of many small folds will be more sparse than MSEs of few large folds, variance will be higher. Thank you! :)
