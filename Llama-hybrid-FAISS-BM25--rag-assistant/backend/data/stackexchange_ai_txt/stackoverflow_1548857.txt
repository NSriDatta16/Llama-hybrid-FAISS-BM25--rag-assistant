Efficient storage of and access to web pages with Python

So like many people I want a way to download, index/extract information and store web pages efficiently. My first thought is to use MySQL and simply shove the pages in which would let me use FULLTEXT searches which would let me do ad hoc queries easily (in case I want to see if something exists and extract it/etc.). But of course performance wise I have some concerns especially with large objects/pages and high volumes of data. So that leads me to look at things like CouchDB /search engines/etc. So to summarize, my basic requirements are: It must be Python compatible (libraries/etc.) Store meta data (URL, time retrieved, any GET/POST stuff I sent), response code, etc. of the page I requested. Store a copy of the original web page as sent by the server (might be content, might be 404 search page, etc.). Extract information from the web page and store it in a database. Have the ability to do ad hoc queries on the existing corpus of original web pages (for example a new type of information I want to extract, or to see how many of the pages have the string "fizzbuzz" or whatever in them. And of course it must be open source/Linux compatible, I have no interest in something I can't modify or fiddle with. So I'm thinking several broad options are: Toss everything into MySQL, use FULLTEXT, go nuts, shard the contact if needed. Toss meta data into MySQL, store the data on the file system or something like CouchDB, write some custom search stuff. Toss meta data into MySQL, store the data on a file system with a web server (maybe /YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM/SS/URL/), make sure there is no default index.html/etc specified (directory index each directory in other words) and use some search engine like Lucene or Sphinx index the content and use that to search. Biggest downside I see here is the inefficiency of repeatedly crawling the site. Other solutions? When answering please include links to any technologies you mention and if possible what programming languages it has libraries for (i.e. if it's Scala only or whatever it's probably not that useful since this is a Python project).
