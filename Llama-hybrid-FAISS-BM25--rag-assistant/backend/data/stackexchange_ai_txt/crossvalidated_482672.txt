Model between-subject condition as population effect or random intercept?

I have an experiment where participants were assigned to one of four conditions (between-subject), and I want to predict a binary outcome ( is_correct ). Each participant answered one question so no repeated measures. So far I have come up with two models written in lme4 -style formula syntax: # condition as population effect is_correct ~ condition # condition as random intercept is_correct ~ 1 + (1 | condition) Which formulation should I use if I want to compare those conditions and determine which condition helps participants get more answers correct? I plan to fit a Bayesian GLM in brms .
