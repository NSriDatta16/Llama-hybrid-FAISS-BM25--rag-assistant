Random Forest - Need help understanding the rfcv function

My current data set has about 900 records & 10 features. I am trying to use random forest to classify some data. My current model is terribly over fitting the data hence I am trying to use the rfcv function. I am having some trouble understanding the output of this function. Here is some sample code data(fgl, package="MASS") tst I can print some output from this but I am not sure how to interpret this? 9 6 4 3 2 1 0.2102804 0.2196262 0.2429907 0.2523364 0.3551402 0.5607477 I also have the log of the importance function MeanDecreaseGini RI 23.358203 Na 15.901377 Mg 25.923452 Al 24.587295 Si 12.586816 K 13.731823 Ca 19.680839 Ba 14.206922 Fe 6.774196
