You can make a score by doing an average. And since the values are not in the same unit, you can use a geometric mean that will make them compatible by raising them to higher dimension. We got 2 components here, 1 is the rate of conversion and second is the amount of buyers. You simply multiply the factors (or divide by the ones where the smaller value is the better). Since you're interested in ranking, then no need to compute the negative power. The multiplication is enough. score = buyer / viewer x buyer = b^2 / v Higher score will mean higher ranking. You could even take the log of the scores for easier reading because the log pulls back the too large and too small values to better interval.
