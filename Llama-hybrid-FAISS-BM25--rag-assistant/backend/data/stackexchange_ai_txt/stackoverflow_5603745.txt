jquery draggable revert is not pixel perfect

I'm experimenting with jQuery draggable. When dragging then reverting, the revert does not always position the draggable object exactly back to where it started - it can be several pixels out. html: I am draggable2 jquery: $(".formsection").draggable({ grid: [20, 20], revert: true, zIndex: 9700, }); css .formsection{position:absolute; top:20px; left:20px; width: 220px; height: 80px; padding: 5px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; font-size: .9em; background-color:#eee; border:solid 1px green; } It seems to work first time, but if a drag a second time it is always out, but inconsistently so. Anyone know how to fix?
