Data scientists are in high demand now and appear to be in the near future so looks like you're thinking in the right direction! A recent McKinsey study predicts there will only be 200,000 data scientists to fill the 490,000 data science jobs by 2018. While the vast majority of data scientist now have an advanced degree in a quantitative field such as mathematics, computer science or econometrics, it is not necessary . One of my best friends is a leading data scientist at a Fortune 500 company without earning an advanced degree. You can find his personal story here http://bit.ly/2aA6PHk . I would recommend checking out The Open Source Data Science Masters site at: http://datasciencemasters.org/ Clare Corthell has done a masterful job of curating a list of free or inexpensive resources to learn the topics of data science, including statistics and data analysis. Best of luck!
