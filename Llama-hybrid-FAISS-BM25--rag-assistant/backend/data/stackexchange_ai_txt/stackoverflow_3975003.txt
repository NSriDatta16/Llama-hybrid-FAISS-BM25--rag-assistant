right now what happens is they sprawl horizontally. In addition to @tulskiy's and @Andrew Thompson's suggestions, it may be useful to note that the default layout of JPanel is FlowLayout , which arranges components in a horizontal row. Addendum: change JPanel 's FlowLayout to BorderLayout or some other layout? Choosing a layout is partly a matter of taste, but I'd combine the suggested approaches, as shown in How to Use Tool Bars . Note how ToolBarDemo extends JPanel and then invokes the superclass constructor to specify BorderLayout() : public class ToolBarDemo extends JPanel implements ActionListener { ... public ToolBarDemo() { super(new BorderLayout()); ... JToolBar toolBar = new JToolBar("Still draggable"); addButtons(toolBar); ... setPreferredSize(new Dimension(450, 130)); add(toolBar, BorderLayout.PAGE_START); add(sometable, BorderLayout.CENTER); } ... } Absent extension, just use the constructor directly: JPanel panel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout()); Alternative, use the setLayout() method inherited by JPanel . JPanel panel = new JPanel(); panel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
