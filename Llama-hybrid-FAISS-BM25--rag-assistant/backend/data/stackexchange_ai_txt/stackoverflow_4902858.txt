Ias is an old App server. And like all app servers, there are default descriptors like web.xml and vendor specific files like ias-web.xml . This comes from the fact that the JavaEE standard specifies a lot, but still leaves room for vendor specific enhancements. And those enhancements are controlled by the vendor-speficic descriptors. The counterpart of ias-web.xml on JBoss would for example be jboss-web.xml Have a look at this guide about migration hints.
