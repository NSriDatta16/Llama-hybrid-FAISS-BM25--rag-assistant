If you are truly looking to grow your skills as a developer and make the transition into the world of web development. I strongly recommend starting with the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ASP.NET AJAX route. There are many reasons for this, but more than anything these are the fundamentals of web development. Everything in the end is rendered to the user in HTML, and Javascript/CSS are things that we have to deal with on a regular basis. CSS and cross browser functionality is still and issue and understanding how that works is a fundamental piece to being able to be a proficient developer. Then the JavaScript/JQuery piece, this is also a now fundamental requirement in many ways as people expect rich, functional User Interfaces and understanding how to leverage these technologies is key. Sliverlight is great to learn as well, however, I think that the base knowledge and getting experience with general web development techniques is needed first. Especially since silverlight in most cases is just a small portion of a website.
