Getting Spring Application context from a non bean object without using Singleton

I need to get the spring application context from a non bean object. In another thread in SO, the accepted answer suggests to use singleton to get the application context. Getting Spring Application Context But using singleton makes my code more coupled and less testable, the usual problems discussed in many threads (e.g. What is so bad about Singletons ) The question, is there an elegant way to get the application context from a non bean object without using singleton?
