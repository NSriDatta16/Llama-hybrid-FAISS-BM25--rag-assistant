Edit: As some people pointed out, Eclipse does not use the javac compiler. Oh well, we live to learn. That does not change the rest of my answer. You have to realize that Eclipse uses javac to compile the source code. So, if you can't do it, chances are Eclipse won't do any good either. It's highly unlikely that all the files are part of the same package/component. You have to figure out (based on the errors), what is the packages organization and the build order. However, I would suggest you to look around for a build.xml or a Makefile somewhere close to the top of the tree. If you fidn the former, you could try using ant (automated build tool) with it; if you found the latter, try make on it.
