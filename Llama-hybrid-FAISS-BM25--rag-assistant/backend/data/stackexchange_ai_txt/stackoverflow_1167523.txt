C++ Compilation Problems with Microsoft Visual Studios 2010 Beta 1

Well, I just got the new MSVS 2010 Beta 1, and just like with 2008 express, I just can't figure out how to compile anything, not even a simple hello world program. Anyone have any pointers? I usually just get a blanket fail message. No real information. Edit: Sorry about that #include using namespace std; main() { cout I go to build and I get: 1>------ Build started: Project: forkicks, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------ 1>Embedding manifest... 1>.\Debug\forkicks.exe.intermediate.manifest : general error c1010070: Failed to load and parse the manifest.

I create a win32 project, name it, etc. Right click on source file, add a C++ file with no headers or anything. Just a blank document.

How exactly would I go about changing it to multibyte?
