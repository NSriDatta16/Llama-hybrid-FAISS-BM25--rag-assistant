Averaging bang for the buck

I'm building a table/graph to compare multiple video cards according to a given benchmark. The benchmark consists of multiple measurements using games. For each benchmark measurement, I build a performance per cost metric. I want to average all the performance per cost metrics for given a benchmark. For instance, consider this: Video Card: GeForce GTX 1070 Data for the arithmetic average of the: Average FPS for 15 games at 1080p, medium quality = 100 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 1080p, medium quality = 90 Average FPS for 15 games at 1080p, high quality = 80 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 1080p, high quality = 75 Average FPS for 15 games at 1440p, high quality = 65 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 1440p, high quality = 60 Average FPS for 15 games at 2160p, high quality = 50 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 2160p, high quality = 40 Note: FPS = Frames per second Suppose price = $350 Now I can calculate a bang for the buck for each benchmark measurement: Average FPS for 15 games at 1080p, medium quality = 100/350 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 1080p, medium quality = 90/350 Average FPS for 15 games at 1080p, high quality = 80/350 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 1080p, high quality = 75/350 Average FPS for 15 games at 1440p, high quality = 65/350 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 1440p, high quality = 60/350 Average FPS for 15 games at 2160p, high quality = 50/350 Minimum FPS for 15 games at 2160p, high quality = 40/350 While the multiple numbers may be useful in some circumstances, I need a more compact representation using a single number to represent the bang for the buck for all measurements of this benchmark. So I need some function like: SomeAverage(100/350, 90/350, 80/350, 75/350, 65/350, 60/350, 50/350, 40/350) = ??? FPS/$ This single number will be used to compare different video cards, creating a ranking. It may also be normalized into a cost-benefit rating (like from 0 to 5 stars). What type of average/mean (e.g arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, median, etc) should use to create this rating? And, most importantly, why?
