Understanding the Delayed Rejection Metropolis algorithm (Mira, 2001a)

I'm having trouble understanding the algorithm as briefly described here , and I can't find the original paper by Mira since it seems to be from some obscure print journal (Metron Volume 59). The first stage is typical, $$\alpha_1(x,y) = \min\left(1,\frac{N_1}{D_1}\right)$$ Where, $$N_1 = \pi(y)q_1(y,x)$$ $$D_1 = \pi(x)q_1(x,y)$$ $$x = \textrm{current value}$$ $$y = \textrm{proposed value}$$ $$\pi = \textrm{target distribution}$$ $$q_1(x,\cdot) = \textrm{distribution from which y is drawn}$$ The second stage is $$\alpha_2(x,y,z) = \min\left(1,\frac{N_2}{D_2}\right)$$ Where $$N_2 = \pi(z)q_1(z,y)q_2(z,y,x)[1-\alpha_1(z,y)]$$ $$D_2 = \pi(x)q_1(x,y)q_2(x,y,z)[1-\alpha_1(x,y)]$$ Thanks to @Xi'an, I realized that I have to pay attention to the distributions $q_1$ and $q_2$ even if I assume the proposals are symmetric, because $q_1(z,y)$ is likely not equal to $q_1(x,y)$. The second thing that I realized is that "the second stage candidate is computed so that reversibility of the Markov Chain...is preserved", so I still don't get the intuition but I understand how this form came about. Questions: If somebody has some intuition I would appreciate it. I'm playing around with toy distributions now, things like what if $z = x$ and what if $z = x\pm \epsilon$. Also is $q_2(z,y,x)$ also not necessarily equal to $q_2(x,y,z)$ if we assume $q_1 \neq q_2$? The paper uses a smaller covariance for the second stage proposal. Is it like $q_1(y|z)q_2(x|y)$ vs. $q_1(y|x)q_2(z|y)$?
