C# Split String and Use in If Statement

Is there a more elegant way to accomplish this. I have a string, where I would like to split and use individually in an if statement. For example: string people = "John;Joe;Jane;Mike"; string[] names = people.Split(';'); if(person == "John" || person == "Joe" || person == "Jane" || person == "Mike") { .... } else { .... } There's a better way of doing this, I guess. Thanks.
