The answers suggesting the use an MVC pattern are 100% right, and I encourage you to embrace it too. More specifically, the kind of technology usually employed to obtain what you are seeking is the use of a templating system (such as Smarty if you use php, for example). A web application framework (such as Cakephp , Rails or Django ) can help you get started and achieve proper separation, usally with little effort. The only drawback is that a change in approach and/or mentality may be required :)
