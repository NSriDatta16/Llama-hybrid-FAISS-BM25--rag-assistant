The original question asked for ignoring SVN and CVS directories, which can be done by adding -prune to the find command. E.g to ignore CVS: find . -name CVS -prune -o -exec mv '{}' `echo {} | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'` \; -print [edit] I tried this out, and embedding the lower-case translation inside the find didn't work for reasons I don't actually understand. So, amend this to: $> cat > tolower #!/bin/bash mv $1 `echo $1 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` ^D $> chmod u+x tolower $> find . -name CVS -prune -o -exec tolower '{}' \; Ian
