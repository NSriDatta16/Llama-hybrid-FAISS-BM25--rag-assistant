Converting a VB.NET Project to a C# Project

I'm looking for a tool (paid or OSS) to convert a mid-sized VB.NET project to a C# project. I've searched StackOverflow and have found a few questions/answers, but most suggest .NET Reflector or online copy/paste single file tools. Reflector doesn't seem to fit the bill as it will convert an assembly, but we're looking for a whole-sale project converter which will maintain the project including file names, comments, etc. We're fully willing to manually address items that cannot be automatically converted, but would like to start off with a fairly comprehensive converted project. One recommendation we found is Elegance Technologies' CSharpener for VB.NET - http://www.elegancetech.com/csvb/csvb.aspx . Based on their site, it hasn't been revved since pre-VS 2008. Recommendations will be appreciated.
