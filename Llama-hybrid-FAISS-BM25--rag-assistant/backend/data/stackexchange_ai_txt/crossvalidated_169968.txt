Consider the following methods: The autocorrelation of a time series for a given time delay $τ$ is nothing but the cross-correlation of a time series with a respectively delayed version of itself. The autocorrelation is 1 for $τ=0$ and also for $τ=θ$, if the time series is perfectly periodic with a period length $θ$. To quantify the periodicness of a time series, consider the height of the highest non-trivial maximum of the autocorrelation function. ( Non-trivial means $τ≠0$.) Periodograms such as the discrete Fourier transform yield, roughly speaking, to which extent certain frequencies (in sinusoidal form) are present in the time series. To quantify the periodicness of a time series, you can measure the area under the most prominent peak in the periodogram and the corresponding subharmonics. (Without the latter your measure would be biased, yielding higher periodicness for sinusoidal time series.) Periodogram-based approaches are more robust to certain effects like frequency drifts (which only broaden the peaks in the periodogram but may destroy the autocorrelation). Whether that’s a good thing for your application is something you have to decide. Note that the above methods come with all sorts of caveats and open parameters and thus I would strongly advise against blindly applying them and for looking into the literature.
