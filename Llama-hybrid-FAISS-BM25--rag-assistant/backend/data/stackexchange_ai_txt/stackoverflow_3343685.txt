I have used IEtester etc in the past. but for me there is no better alternative than viewing the applicationd in VM's set up as possible client setups. IETester is good, but I found that not all script issues were necessarily raised or reported. So in the interest in being thorough the VM solution is the best. @Esko - surprisingly there are still a number of organisations who have standardised on IE6 and won't allow upgrades, as they still have legacy applications running that still require IE6. strange but very true :-)
