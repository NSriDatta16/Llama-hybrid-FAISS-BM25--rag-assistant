Chosing Predictor and Response Variable

I understand that response variables are dependent on predictor variables. For an easy case like Baking a cake, we know that Baking time, oven temperature are predictor variables while Moisture of the cake, thickness of the cake are dependent variables. However in the following example, I find it very tricky to distinguish between Predictor and Dependant variables. I state the problematic statement below. Ten sales staff in a large company were given a creativity test (scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater creativity) and were evaluated regarding sales growth performance (a score of 100 indicates an average performance, and larger scores indicate better performance). The creativity scores and sales growth performance scores are given below. The manager wants to investigate whether creative people tend to perform better with regard to sales growth. Could you please help me figure the dependent variable and predictor variable in the above example?
