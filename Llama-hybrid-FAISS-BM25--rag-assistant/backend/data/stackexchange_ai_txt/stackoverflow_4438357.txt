I also use TeamCity and WatiN. Here is what I did to make sure TeamCity can run as Administrator, but not as Local System (because it is better to have a real user when you run IE). Create a new user (for example "TeamCity") Add this user to Administrator group Open the service console window (http://media.techtarget.com/rms/misc/admintools7.jpg) and look for the teamcity agent: "Team City Build Agent Service" Right click on it, and go to "log on" tab. Enter the newly created user Hope this helps
