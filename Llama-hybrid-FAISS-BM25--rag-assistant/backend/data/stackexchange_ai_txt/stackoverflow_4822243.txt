html text output compression from rails (or apache/passenger)

i have a quite strange request: i want to "compress" all the output from a rails app; with this i do not mean gzip or any similar compression, i mean to reformat the whole output (preferably with apache/passenger but can also be a rack middleware or rails plugin) anyone knows if something like this exists? any apache module out there? if not, what would be a good way to implement something like this? just to be more clear what i want: page title info! should become page title info! ideally, also comments and other shenanigans are removed, so ideally it would look like this page title info! again, just to avoid having mod_deflate or gzip discussions again: i know that such things as gzip compressors exists. i am specifically searching for a way to text-filter with apache or rails (rack). thanks for any pointers!
