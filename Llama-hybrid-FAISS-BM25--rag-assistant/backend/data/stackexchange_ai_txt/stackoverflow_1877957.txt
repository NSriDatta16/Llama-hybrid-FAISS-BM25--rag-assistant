Edit Looking at the rest of the code you have posted, is AJAX really required for this? surely you are just updating the existing page with data already present on the page, the server has no real part to play in this? Sorry to dive into jQuery again, but this should allow you to get the values into "div2" without an ajax request. $(document).ready(function() { $("input").click(function(e) { $("#div2").html($(this).attr("id")+" clicked "); updateList(); }); }); function updateList() { $("#div2").append($("#lista").val() + " selected"); } In plain English this code says "if an input element is clicked, update the value of div2 with the input variables id, and append the selected value from the list to the result". Hopefully that makes sense to you :) If you need an easy, elegant way to solve this with AJAX, use the jQuery library's ajax and post methods. For more information take a look here , it will significantly cut down on the size and complexity of your code.
