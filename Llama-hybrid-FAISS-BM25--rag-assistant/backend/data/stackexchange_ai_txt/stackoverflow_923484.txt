From Visual Studio, if you have no solution open, you can select File->New->Project From Existing Code Select the project type Put the directory you want the solution and project file to be in as the "Project file location" field. Finish the wizard and you'll have a project file and solution file in the same directory. If the "Project from existing code" option is not available Make a custom keyboard shortcut, toolbar button or menu item by using the customization features of VS. Tools->Customize Select the "Keyboard" button to add a keyboard shortcut or select the "Command" tab to add a toolbar button or menu item. The command you are looking for is: File->New Project From Existing Code Assign whatever keyboard shortcut or drag an icon to whichever menu/toolbar you want.
