How to run a CPU Hogging Program on Remote Server?

I am about to run a machine learning program which might take a day or two to complete; I do not want to run it on my laptop, but on a remote server. Now I am thinking if I ssh into the machine and run the program there, and close the ssh session, how will I know next time I ssh into the machine if the program is still running or completed?
