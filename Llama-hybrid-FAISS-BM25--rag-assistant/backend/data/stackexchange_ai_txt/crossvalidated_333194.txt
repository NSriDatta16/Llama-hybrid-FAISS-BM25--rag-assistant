The normalisation you propose is fine. So is the suggestion on the other page, to centre by sample mean and divide by sample standard deviation (by the uncorrected or the corrected one). Additional clarifying comments by OP made the following two points redundant for their particular task of finding an optimum in a time interval such that one possesses all the data for the period. The remarks are relevant for on-line detection of some optimum in an ongoing process. Be aware that just because your samples are currently all in $[0,1]$, they won't necessarily always be because a record (e.g. a temperature record) can be broken in the future. I would also warn you that what you want to do with your normalised variables afterwards is not straightforward. Hitting the minimum or maximum value of a time series is in general not a stopping time ; you never know what the future will be. E.g. if we knew that, then a stock trader could always buy stocks at their minimum price and sell them later at their maximum price. I would additionally compare the current value to historical data (and the time of year) to trigger that decision.
