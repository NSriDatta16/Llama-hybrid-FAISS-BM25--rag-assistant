You should be able to join, for sake of argument, 10 tables with the biggest table(s) having rows in the multiple millions and upwards, and you should be able to get results fast. Assume that there is something up with the indexing strategy or the query operation or the query plan. It has nothing to do with SQL per se; it might be related to MySQL, or the particular storage engine you are using in MySQL. Did you know that the SQL standard doesn't define anything related to indexes? You could argue that anything related to indexes is non-standard, though 'extra to the standard' might be a better way to look at it.
