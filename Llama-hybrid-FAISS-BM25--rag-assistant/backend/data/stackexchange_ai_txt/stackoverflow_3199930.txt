I found a way to do it, but it's far from elegant and I would prefer another solution, like using some kind of inheritance or Annotations, if possible. The way I got it to work is to @eval every constant I need from defines.css in the appStyle.css stylesheet, but that leads to a lot of code duplication and it's a mess to mantain. @eval formInputBackgroundColor Resources.INSTANCE.defines().formInputBackgroundColor(); @eval formInputBorderColor Resources.INSTANCE.defines().formInputBorderColor(); If you have a better solution, please share.
