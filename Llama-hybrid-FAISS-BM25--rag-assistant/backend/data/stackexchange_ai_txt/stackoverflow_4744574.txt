As Eugene points out circular interface unit references are not possible in Delphi. There are a few possible solutions: Move the shared struct to a third unit and let the other two units include this unit. Move one of the unit references to the implementation section (if this is possible). Keep all in one file as you mention Note that the fact that Delphi forces you to think about circular references is not a bad thing IMHO. In many cases, these circular references draw your attention to a flaw in your design.
