In the context of your previous question , a "random walk" is one realization $(x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ of a binomial random walk. Autocorrelation is the correlation between the vector $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})$ and the vector of the next elements $(x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n)$. The very construction of a binomial random walk causes each $x_{i+1}$ to differ from each $x_i$ by a constant. After running the walk for a while, the values of $x_i$ will have wandered away from the initial value $x_0$ and thereby will usually cover a good range, typically proportional to $\sqrt{n}$ in length. Thus the lag-1 scatterplot of the $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ pairs will consist of points lying only on the lines $y=x\pm 1$, on average being close to the line $y=x$. The residuals will be close to $\pm 1$. Therefore, in the vast majority of realizations, the variance of the residuals (about $1$) compared to the variance of the values (roughly on the order of $(\sqrt{n}/2)^2 = n/4$) will be small. We would expect $R^2$ to be approximately $$R^2 \approx 1 - \frac{1}{n/4} = 1 - \frac{4}{n}.$$ Here is a picture of $n=1000$ steps in a random walk (on the left) and its lag-1 scatterplot (on the right). Color coding is used to help you find corresponding points in the two plots. Notice that $R^2$ is very close indeed to $1 - 4/n$ in this case. Here is the R code that produced the images. set.seed(17) n
