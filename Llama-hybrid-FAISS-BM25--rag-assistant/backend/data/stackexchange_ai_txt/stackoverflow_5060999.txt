You are using HTML5 field with the DnD file upload aren't you?, I don't know what kind of functionality the JS provides, but usually when you drop a file it will automatically upload it. I suggest you might want to mimick YouTube upload function. For example: Once file is uploaded, return a json with a generated ID of the file so when you save records you can relate it to the file you just uploaded. When I was playing with it usually the javascript will open a new POST request, that request you must get it from request.body which is an InputStream , use that InputStream with IOUtils to save the file, once saved return a JSON object with the filename or path of the file. Thing is, I don't think it will never pass through File files[] because the javascript opens a new POST request so it will always return Incorrect value since it's never filled when you submit the data to the server-side. You could try this: create two routes, one that uploads the file, one that saves the meta-data of the file, with the one method you do all the file processing, the other one grabs the json return and relate it then save :) I also posted some sample codes here to a similar question: PlayFramework: Ajax + Drag n' Drop + File Upload + File object in controller? Cheers, sorry if I sound a tad redundant, kinda tired but I hope this helps you :)
