I can not find an optimal hyper-parameter for all seeds That's the stochastic nature of machine learning. We don't have all the data, so any inference/training is vulnerable to noise. The model complexity, dataset size, your search, properties of the data all can affect this. Each seed is a separate snapshot that the real world represents. It's not expected to come up with the same set of optimal hyper-parameters for each seed. The most sensible way is the do multiple random experiments and use commonly selected hyper-parameters as your best and report accordingly; though not every research paper does that.
