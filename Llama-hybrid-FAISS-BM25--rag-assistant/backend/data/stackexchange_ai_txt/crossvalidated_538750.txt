Feature importance interpretation in logistic regression

I am using the feature importance of logistic regression to rank the most influential features. My problem lies that I do not how to exactly interpret the results of the feature importance. I know that positive and negative values push the classifier towards the positive and negative class respectively. If I get a positive value equal to 2, I do not know what that exactly means. Does the influence logistic or linear and how much is the influence numerically?
