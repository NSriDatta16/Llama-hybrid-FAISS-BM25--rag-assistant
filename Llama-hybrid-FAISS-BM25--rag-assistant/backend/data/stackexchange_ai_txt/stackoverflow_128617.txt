Select * is a poor programming practice. It is as likely to cause things to break as it is to save things from breaking. If you are only querying one table or view, then the efficiency gain may not be there (although it is possible if you are not intending to actually use every field). If you have an inner join, then you have at least two fields returning the same data (the join fields) and thus you are wasting network resources to send redundant data back to the application. You won't notice this at first, but as the result sets get larger and larger, you will soon have a network pipeline that is full and doesn't need to be. I can think of no instance where select * gains you anything. If a new column is added and you don't need to go to the code to do something with it, then the column shouldn't be returned by your query by definition. If someone drops and recreates the table with the columns in a different order, then all your queries will have information displaying wrong or will be giving bad results, such as putting the price into the part number field in a new record. Plus it is quick to drag the column names over from the object browser, so that is just pure laziness not efficiency in coding.
