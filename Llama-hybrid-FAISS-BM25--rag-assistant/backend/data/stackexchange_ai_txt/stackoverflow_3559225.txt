Visual Studio 2010 Document Formatting Rules

I know that in the Tools > Options (Text Editor > CSS > Format) menu I can choose between three types of document formatting for CSS files (compact, semi-expanded and expanded) as well as capitalization. A decision has been made in my organization to implement a formatting structure in XML files, where the attributes for an element line up on successive lines like this: Is there a way to define custom formatting rules for XML files so that when I format the document with Ctrl+K, Ctrl+D I get the desired result? Is there a way to define a "rule" that will insert the correct number of spaces on the second line after I finish typing the first attribute? Is there a way to have code snippets follow these rules when pasting in the snippet? Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Scott.
