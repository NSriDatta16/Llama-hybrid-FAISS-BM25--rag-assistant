MySql table locking

If I have an operation as follows: begin transaction (auto commit = false) select * from foo; iterate above result set: insert into bar (insert the values from the above result set into bar); commit In the above operation will the table foo be locked until all the inserts into bar are done? Also, while the inserts are going on, will the table bar be locked, as in, will no one be able to read bar (not bothered about inserts)? Assume the db is using isolation level, REPEATABLE READ and the storage engine is InnoDB.
