That method could work but would not be a good idea. There are many inline scripts throughout Magento that depend on the Javascript libraries being loaded in advance. Some modules add their own scripts for certain pages and if items were unset they would fail. If your aim is to improve page load times then script concatenation - as provided by "Merge Javascript Files" setting, Fooman Speedster and previously mod_pagespeed (although the combine feature was buggy and removed) - will significantly reduce the round trip times of having scripts in the head. To effectively move all script to the bottom you would need to override Mage_Page_Block_Html to filter all script tags then replace them before the tag. The before_body_end block will already have been rendered by this point so you could not rely on that. I wouldn't want to try it as there is still much that could go wrong.
