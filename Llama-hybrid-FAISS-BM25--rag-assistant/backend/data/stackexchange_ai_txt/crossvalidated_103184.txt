If you want to get an exact fit, use Lagrange polynomials. In your case, this will fit a 7th-degree polynomial through your data. However, I think that's probably not what you want to do. If you want to "learn" how to predict $y$ given the $x_i$s, look into gradient descent algorithms. The Coursera machine learning course has a good introduction.
