I would remove the table and replace it with a series of div's instead. Inside each div you put the image and a paragraph tag, something like this: Image text goes here Image text goes here Image text goes here Using some CSS you will be able to make these div's line up and if you remove all padding and margins you can position the div's with the images side by side without any gaps.
