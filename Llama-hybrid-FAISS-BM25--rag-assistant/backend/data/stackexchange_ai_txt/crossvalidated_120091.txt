Firstly, it is worth pointing out that what you're looking to do is called multinomial logistic regression in the statistics literature. Since you're reading a machine learning book, however, I'm going to suggest an alternate source: read the Neural Networks chapters from David Mackay's textbook, which you can view online for free (but not print) here: http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf . Why neural networks? Because with just input and output layers (no hidden layers) they are equivalent to logistic regression. The chapters take you through the binary case, what the objective function is, what the gradient and update rule for the weight vector is, and then in Chapter 44 there's material on 'Multi-class classification networks' which do exactly what you want. The treatment is quite practical which might be useful for someone without a lot of background. You can then go back and read about (multinomial) logistic regression in a stats textbook to get a more formal appreciation for it if you want to.
