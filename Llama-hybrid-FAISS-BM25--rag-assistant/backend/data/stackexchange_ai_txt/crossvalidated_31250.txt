You are getting some good responses here. I will see if I can organize some of this information and add some other bits to create a fuller picture for you. Your project appears to be entirely descriptive rather than inferential , so I think you don't have to worry about as much. For the most part, as several others suggest, I think you can probably just average the ratings from the 9 questions regarding utility (since that's what you're interested in) for the 16 participants. People are often concerned about Likert items being ordinal rather than interval in nature, but when combining lots of Likert items into a scale, it can often be reasonable to consider the scale as roughly interval. Is yours truly interval? We'll never really know, but it probably doesn't matter in this context. ( Here's a great discussion of the issues on CV.) Furthermore, you can calculate the standard deviation , from that the standard error (i.e., $SD/\sqrt{16}$), and then a 95% confidence interval can be approximated by multiplying the SE by 2 and adding (& subtracting) the product from your mean. This interval can serve as a measure of how much the mean might be likely to bounce around if you were to do this again. Of course, be sure all your items are scored the same way before you do all of this. As for the rest of your topics, it sounds like you are less interested in them. You could always follow this procedure with them anyway, but you really need to have several items for this approach to be reasonable. Four seems like a bare minimum, and I definitely would not want to combine two items. If you haven't administered the survey already, consider coming up with other items to probe people's assessments of those topics. I would generally prefer 5-8. In the long run, if you wanted a more sophisticated approach to developing an instrument that would allow you to measure satisfaction with the program, you should look into factor analysis and related methods.
