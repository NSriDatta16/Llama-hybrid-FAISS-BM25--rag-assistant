Model for classifying time-series data with distinct features?

I've heard about time-series classification being done with TCN's and CNN's combined with LSTM's very often, citing that CNN's would provide insight both forward and in the past since you already have all the information for that time period. For my application, there is a distinct shape and I'd like to classify whether it exists or not. For example, I want to detect whether the data looks like this or this Of course, there would be noise involved and the feature would be much less obvious making the problem worthy of using machine learning. Is there some way I can exploit this knowledge of there being a single important feature (this hump) to use a different architecture or do anything differently?
