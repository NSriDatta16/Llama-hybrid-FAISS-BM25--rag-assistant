Are "empirical distribution function" and "empirical fraction" the same thing?

"Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Patrick Murphy" in chapter 1 says A simple example of a non-parametric classifier is the K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. This simply “looks at” the K points in the training set that are nearest to the test input x, counts how many members of each class are in this set, and returns that empirical fraction as the estimate, as illustrated in Figure 1.14. More formally, which looks like the empirical distribution function $${F}_{n}(t)={\frac {{\mbox{number of elements in the sample}}\leq t}{n}}={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {1} _{X_{i}\leq t}$$ I never heard the term empirical fraction , and I cannot find any other reference talked about empirical fraction . Are "empirical distribution function" and "empirical fraction" the same thing?
