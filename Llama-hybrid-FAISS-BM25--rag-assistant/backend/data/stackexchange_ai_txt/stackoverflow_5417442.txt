JSTL support in Weblogic

Im trying to start working with Java EE using Weblogic, and i cant make JSTL tags work, in simpliest code i get the following errors when deploying my application: index.jsp:1:4: No tag library could be found with this URI. Possible causes could be that the URI is incorrect, or that there were errors during parsing of the .tld file. ^----^ index.jsp:1:4: No tag library could be found with this URI. Possible causes could be that the URI is incorrect, or that there were errors during parsing of the .tld file. ^----^ index.jsp:2:4: No tag library could be found with this URI. Possible causes could be that the URI is incorrect, or that there were errors during parsing of the .tld file. ^----^ index.jsp:2:4: No tag library could be found with this URI. Possible causes could be that the URI is incorrect, or that there were errors during parsing of the .tld file. I downloaded taglib files from this website: http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/taglibs/standard/ and put two jars(standard.jar and jstl.jar) under my WEB-INF directory. I also put there all the tld files from the arcihve. Ater that i tried referencing them in my web.xml file and after validation i get the following error: XML validation started. Checking file:/C:/Users/Brodyaga/Documents/NetBeansProjects/Eshop1/web/WEB-INF/web.xml... Referenced entity at "nbres:/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/ddloaders/catalog/resources/XMLSchema.dtd".

[12] XML validation finished. My web.xml goes as following: 30 index.jsp http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt /WEB-INF/fmt.tld http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt-rt /WEB-INF/fmt-rt.tld http://java.sun.com/jstl/core /WEB-INF/c.tld http://java.sun.com/jstl/core-rt /WEB-INF/c-rt.tld http://java.sun.com/jstl/sql /WEB-INF/sql.tld http://java.sun.com/jstl/sql-rt /WEB-INF/sql-rt.tld http://java.sun.com/jstl/x /WEB-INF/x.tld http://java.sun.com/jstl/x-rt /WEB-INF/x-rt.tld I believe that xml schema specified in the beginning of web.xml doesnt allow taglib tags, but i have no idea what schema i should use. I'd really apprectiate some step by step tutorial for adding jstl support to weblogic. Thanks in advance. UPDATE Removing those 's from web.xml ends up with erros such as following: index.jsp:18:14: The tag handler class was not found "org.apache.taglibs.standard.tag.rt.core.ForEachTag". and by the contents of c.tld file its clear that weblogic understands that forEach corresponds to org.apache.taglibs.standard.tag.rt.core.ForEachTag, but cant find the class. But i can manually find this class in standard.jar.
