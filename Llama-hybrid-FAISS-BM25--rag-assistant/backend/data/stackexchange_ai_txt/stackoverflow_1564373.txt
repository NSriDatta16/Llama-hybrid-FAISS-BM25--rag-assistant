Wikipedia says, In computer science, an object file is an organised collection of named objects, and typically these objects are sequences of computer instructions in a machine code format, which may be directly executed by a computer's CPU. Object files are typically produced by a compiler as a result of processing a source code file. Object files contain compact code, and are often called "binaries". A linker is typically used to generate an executable or library by amalgamating parts of object files together. Object files for embedded systems typically contain nothing but machine code but generally, object files also contain data for use by the code at runtime: relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments, program symbols (names of variables and functions) for linking and/or debugging purposes, and other debugging information. Another great site has much more detailed info and a useful diagram, here :
