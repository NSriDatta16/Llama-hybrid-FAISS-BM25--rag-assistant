It looks like you stumbled on the answer to this yourself , but I'll post the answer to this question anyway for posterity: Implement Google's AJAX crawling specification . If links to your page contain #! (a URL fragment starting with an exclamation point), Googlebot will send everything after the ! to the server in the special query string parameter _escaped_fragment_ . You then look for the _escaped_fragment_ parameter in your server code, and if present, return static HTML. (I went into a little more detail in this answer .)
