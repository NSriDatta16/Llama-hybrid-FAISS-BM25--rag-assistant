How can I understand my standard deviation?

I have some (2749) sensor output values. They range from 0 to 1769. With google spreadsheet I put it thru some calculations to get the (mean) average and standard deviation. With this I created two columns BINS and NORMDIST to create a chart. Please look at the attached image. Mean is 53.35. Standard deviation is 61.23 What can I extrapolate from this? A) Is one deviation 61.23, two deviation 122,46? Two deviations gives me ~95%. B) So since my mean is 53, 95% is a effective range from 0 to 122 (as I don't have negative data)? My chart shows while the range is from 0 to 1769, its mean is 53. C) Is my data bad? The form of the curve the data makes is very "typical" distribution, but a little skewed to the left?
