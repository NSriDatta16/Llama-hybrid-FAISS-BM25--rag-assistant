I think you're mixing up two things. The code you have shows you are trying to integrate via Intent, in which case you do not need any project code in your application at all. The source in android/ is a complete stand-alone app (Barcode Scanner) and it is not written for you to copy (although the Apache License permits it). What you are doing is not supported, recommended, or encouraged -- integrating via Intent is much easier. Write your own app, perhaps looking to the Android source code for inspiration, and that uses the core/ library for scanning. The core scanning happens in DecodeThread .
