The answer from @generic_user should be very helpful. I just want to suggest ways to minimize the number of variables for which you include truly non-linear terms, and to discuss a bit when to use a nonlinear model function versus polynomial regression. The relations between the dependent variable and each of the independent variables don't have to be exactly linear for linear regression to work. Changes in the dependent variable with changes in each of the independent variables just have to be well enough represented by linear relations over the range of interest. This is like doing a Taylor expansion of a function and only keeping terms up to first order: sometimes a linear approximation is good enough. You can do linear regression with non-linearly transformed variables. For example, you already list $pH$ as an independent variable, which can be used directly in linear regression even though it is related logarithmically to the underlying hydrogen-ion activity. Such a non-linear transformation doesn't rule out a linear regression, as the "linear" part of the name only refers to the relation (in this case) between changes in Height and changes in $pH$, regardless of whether you consider $pH$ to have been obtained by a non-linear transformation. That's why regression against polynomials, as suggested by some here, is also linear regression. So for variables which you expect to have a monotonic relation to Height (over the range of your data), an appropriate transformation of an independent variable will typically allow linear regression. Variables with a peak or a trough in the relation to Height (as you suggest may be the case for temperature) require additional attention, if such a peak or trough occurs within the range of your data. Including polynomial terms in your linear regression can capture such relations (analogous to higher-order terms in a Taylor expansion), but they will be hard to interpret in terms of biological processes. I suspect that in your field there are some general formulas for relations of plant height to temperature, which include as parameters the temperature for peak height and how quickly height drops off with temperature on either side of the peak. If you find such formulas, your analysis can be set up in a way that identifies the peak and drop-off parameter values that best match your data. That may be easier to interpret biologically than a generic polynomial regression.
