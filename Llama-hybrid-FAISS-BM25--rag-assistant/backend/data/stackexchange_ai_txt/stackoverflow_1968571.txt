Have a look at some of the project floating around the net: Neural Network Handwriting Recognition Applet Handwriting Recognition in Java Technology Handwriting recognition To list just the three first links Google spits out for " java handwriting recognition " Some hints to get you started: If you can, work with vectors instead of bitmap graphics. Ideally, you should have the speed and direction of each stroke. It's often more simple to recognize a letter by the way in which a curve bends plus the speed at which it was drawn instead of the form. Attack the problem with several approaches. Use neural networks, shape recognition, size, previous and next letter, dictionaries. All of them will give you different results with different error levels. This can help greatly to improve the results. Good luck!
