According to the documentation NSFileProtectionComplete dictates that the file cannot be read from or written to while the application is in the background (or not running). You should be fine to read / write the SQLite store while the application is running, however you will not have access to it while it is in the "background". This means that operations which leverage the iOS background APIs like: Push notifications Background Audio / Location Task completion (Background) Voice Over IP Will not have access to your SQLite store. When the app is running however you should be able to access the NSPersistentStoreCoordinator as you normally would. I suspect that a device side test would result in a failure to create the persistent store coordinator from one of the background APIs.
