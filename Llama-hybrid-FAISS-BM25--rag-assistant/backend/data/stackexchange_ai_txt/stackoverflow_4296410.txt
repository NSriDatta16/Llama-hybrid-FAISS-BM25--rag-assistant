Also, would you know a way to validate your hypothesis on linux, e.g. number of interrupts while doing IO intensive operations. To do with interrupts, I'm guessing that caf's hypothesis is: many interrupts per second; interrupts are serviced by any/all CPUs; therefore, interrupts flush the CPU caches. The statistics you'd need to test that would be the number of interrupts per second per CPU. I don't know whether it's possible to tie interrupts to a single CPU: see http://www.google.com/#q=cpu+affinity+interrupt for further details. Here's something I don't understand (this is the first time I've looked at this question): perfmon on my laptop (running Windows Vista) is showing 2000 interrupts/second (1000 on each core) when it's almost idle (doing nothing but displaying perfmon). I can't imagine which device is generating 2000 interrupts/second, and I would have thought that's enough to blow away the CPU caches (my guess is that the CPU quantum for a busy thread is something like 50 msec). It's also showing an average of 350 DPCs/sec. Do high end hardware suffer from similar issues ? One type of hardware difference might be the disk hardware and disk device driver, generating more or fewer interrupts and/or other contentions.
