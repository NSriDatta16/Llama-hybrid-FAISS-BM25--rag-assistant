I've been looking for the same thing, and unfortunately it seems like there isn't one at this time. Some suggestions for how to proceed can be found in this previous question . Alternatively you could look into some R libraries eg segmented, SiZer, strucchange, and if something there works for you try embedding the R code in python with rpy2 . Editing to add a link to py-earth , "A Python implementation of Jerome Friedman's Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines".
