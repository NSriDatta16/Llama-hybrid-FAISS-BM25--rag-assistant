SVMPerf - only one vector in the model file?

Am I missing something? When I use SVMLight, there's always a lot of vectors in the model file. But when I create one with SVMPerf - there's only one vector in the file? (?) But still, it works fine. Am I missing something? Also the number of documents that it supposedly used is way smaller than I provided him with ( I supplied 400,000 examples and it says it used 165 training documents? )
