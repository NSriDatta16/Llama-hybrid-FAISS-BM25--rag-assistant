How to automatically resize the table inside a datagridview?

I've an application I'm working on that places a dataset into a datagridview on the mainform. When the datatable shows up on the datagridview there is a bunch of remaining grey space on teh view, and it has to be manually dragged to resize it in order to fill the entire view. Is there a way I can force it to fill the entire view as it is rendered on the form?
