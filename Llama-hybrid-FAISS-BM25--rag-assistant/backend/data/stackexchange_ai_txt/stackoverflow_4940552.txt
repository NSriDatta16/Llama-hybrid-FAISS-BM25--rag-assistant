Programmatically invoke the JSP parser

I would like to invoke the JSP parser programmatically. That means that I want to be able, in Java, to 'run' a jsp page and get its output, without sending it back to the client (I actually want to save the output to a file). I don't want to 'forward' the request to the JSP page. I want to be able to do that on several JSP pages in a row. What is the best way of doing this? I have found this question , but BalusC doesn't really answer the question directly. In case you are wondering, I need to do this is because I want to 'precompile' the JSPs for using on other platforms than a Java servlet container. EDIT What I need is not the .class file, but the HTML output. Indeed, that will be static once generated but I have some custom jsp tags and I want to leverage the JSP parser to expand them.
