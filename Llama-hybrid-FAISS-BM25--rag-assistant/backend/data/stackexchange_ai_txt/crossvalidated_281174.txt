If X is ordinal, you can try applying a PCA transform after the dummy coding. Retain only the first PC coordinates as a single continuous variable instead of the untransformed dummies. Plot the three dummies along the first two PCs first to check whether they follow any interpretable or meaningful order. If so, then this approach, which is slightly different from what you've requested, will provide a seamless impact of each category or even a subgroup of categories on Y. While you will only use the more abstract PC as a regressor, you can always trace back its meaning to the dummy variables. E.g. If you have 3 dummies taking the values, very happy , happy , unhappy , the reference being very unhappy , then the 1st PC could translate the degree of happiness or unhappiness or other, depending on their order along the said PC. More details on this approach can be found in Gordon Linoff's Data Mining book.
