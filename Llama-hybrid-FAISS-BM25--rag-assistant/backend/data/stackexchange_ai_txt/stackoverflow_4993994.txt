Image sorting problem

I am trying to sort some images using jQuery. I refered to http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#display-grid and it's working. But the problem is that when I try to sort the images by dragging them from left to right, my form gets moved to left (but when I do the opposite it works perfectly). I have tried setting up margins and all but it's not working. How can I get the behavior I want?
