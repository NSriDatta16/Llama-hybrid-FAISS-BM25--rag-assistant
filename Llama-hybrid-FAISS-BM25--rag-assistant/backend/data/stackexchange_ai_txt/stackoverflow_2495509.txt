How to balance number of ratings versus the ratings themselves?

For a school project, we'll have to implement a ranking system. However, we figured that a dumb rank average would suck: something that one user ranked 5 stars would have a better average that something 188 users ranked 4 stars, and that's just stupid. So I'm wondering if any of you have an example algorithm of "smart" ranking. It only needs to take in account the rankings given and the number of rankings. Thanks!
