First thing to notice it that you are talking about time-series data, so good thing to start would be to start would be some handbook on this topic like Forecasting: principles and practice by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos that is freely available online. As about your question, ordinary regression for time-series data is rather a bad idea since regression assumes independence of errors and in case of time-series data they would be auto-correlated . But there are models designed especially for time-series. Your description of model fits AR(1) model $$ X_t = c + \varphi X_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t $$ Of course, you can apply machine learning methods for such data, but the "traditional" time-series methods often outperform them (e.g. check Timeseries forecasting using extreme gradient boosting post recently linked on r-bloggers.com) As about validating the model, using classic cross-validation is a bad idea because it destroys the structure of the data, so you should rather think of sampling whole blocks of data , or techniques as one-step-ahead forecast to estimate errors (i.e. $x_1,\dots,x_t$ data to predict $x_{t+1}$, next using $x_1,\dots,x_t, x_{t+1}$ to predict $x_{t+2}$ etc.).
