Automatic insertion of line break in a paragraph

Is it possible to insert line breaks automatically in the middle of a paragraph, by CSS? ----- HERE THE TEXT FLOWS ----- ----- HERE THE TEXT FLOWS ----- ----- HERE THE TEXT FLOWS ----- My background image is of 242px height and looks like this: http://tinypic.com/r/2nvz2c8/7 Now, I need to insert a break, before the image repeats. CSS is preferred, but, JavaScript suggestions are also welcome.
