is it pointless to stack models of different data types/structure?

I am studying ensemble methods machine learning, in particular I am focusing on stacking. In stacking different models are used to get an output. Then all the outputs are 'combined' together to build a model. So, first of all, I guess the models MUST be different between each other (does it make sense?). Once we have these models, does it make sense to apply them to different data types/structures? UPDATE: For “data structures” I am just saying different methods that learn different models (e.g. a degree 2 polynomial, a degree 4 polynomial, a KNN classifier, a SVM, etc.).
