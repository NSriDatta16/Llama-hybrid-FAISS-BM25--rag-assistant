comparing predictive model with hold out set

In Rapid Miner, I created a predictive model (SVM) with Kernel type = polynomial, c= 10, and obtained 80.77% accuracy using cross validation. When compared to hold out set my accuracy on the test set was: 71.54472%. That is 9.23% difference. My questions are 1) Is my SVM model overfit? 2) I created other models like k-NN, decision trees, Naive bayes etc but they all gave accuracy of less than 70%. Will the difference against the hold out set be less than 9.23% ?
