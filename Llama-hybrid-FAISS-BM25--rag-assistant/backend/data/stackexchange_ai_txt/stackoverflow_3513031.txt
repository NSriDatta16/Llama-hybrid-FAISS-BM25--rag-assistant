magento configurable product behaviour

I am having the following issue with my magento, custom unfortunately, development. The scenario is that the client wants the price of a configurable product to be calculated using a specific formula that involves multiplications, while magento has only sums. for example one of the attributes is "material" and the other one is number of occurrences so these two have to be multiplied. I have programmed and created through scripting new products for every possible combination and assigned them to a configurable. But when I go to "add to cart" at the end the price that I have is not the one of the final product, but the one magento calculates. Has any one been across a similar scenario? Any possible solutions? Because I might have been to abstract, I will also write my usage example: The store is about selling jewellery. Attribute : stone material Attribute : number of stones Price : Base Value + (number of stones) x (price of stone material)
