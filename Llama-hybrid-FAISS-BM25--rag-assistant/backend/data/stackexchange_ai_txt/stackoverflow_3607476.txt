The .NET Framework is not specific to any programming language. Programming languages from Microsoft, like c# , vb.net , visual-c++ CLI, and f# , as well as many other languages from other vendors, all use the same .NET Framework. The .NET Framework includes a large library of functions as part of the Base Class Library (BCL) , including those related to user interface design, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, development of web applications, mathematical algorithms, and network communications. This extensive library simplifies development and makes it easy to rapidly develop new applications. As such, questions like "How do I do file I/O in C#?" should really be "How do I do file I/O with .NET?". Because such a question concerns the file I/O libraries provided by the .NET Framework, it should be tagged with both the .net tag, and with the c# tag, to indicate that you'd like the answer to be written in the C# programming language. See also: mono , .net-core (do NOT use the .net tag for questions about .NET Core). Getting help What are some useful online resources for .NET developers?

Easy syntax, working nicely, actively developed. No Microsoft Office necessary. Excel XML Writer allows creation of .XLS (Excel) files. No Microsoft Office necessary. It has been a while since it has been updated. It also provides a code generator to create code from already created XLS file (saved as XML). Haven't tested this but looks very promising. The author hasn't updated this in awhile. Excel Reader allows creation/reading of .XLS (Excel) files. No Microsoft Office necessary. It has been awhile since it has been updated. Excel Package allows creation/reading of .XLSX (Excel 2007) files. No Microsoft Office necessary. The author is gone, so it's out of date. EPPlus is based on Excel Package and allows creation/reading of .XLSX (Excel 2007). It is actually the most advanced even comparing to NPOI. NPOI is the .NET version of POI Java project at https://poi.apache.org/ . POI is an open source project which can help you read/write Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files.
