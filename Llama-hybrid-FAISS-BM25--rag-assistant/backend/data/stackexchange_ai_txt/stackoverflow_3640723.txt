I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but since the example you provided uses hard-coded strings to index the data, it seems like you know what data you want to group together. If that's the case, then a Map is probably not a good choice. The better approach would be to make a class out of the commonly grouped data: public class SavedStuff { private int index; private String symbol; public SavedStuff(int index, String symbol) { this.index = index; this.symbol = symbol; } public int getIndex() { return index; } public String getSymbol() { return symbol; } } This allows your client code to do this: SavedStuff savedStuff = ... String symbol = savedStuff.getSymbol(); Rather than this: Map savedStuff = ... String symbol = savedStuff.get("symbol"); The former example is much less fragile because you're not indexing data with String constants. It also gives you a place to add behavior on top of your grouped data, which makes your code much more object oriented.
