I successfully managed to migrate the several source safe repositories into SVN using vss2svn script. My suggestions are, do it in small chunks - we had a lot of little projects and a couple of medium side projects, which all managed to be moved successfully to SVN. I had a couple of problems: Big files failed to be written in to the SVN dump file format, I submitted a patch to make it work, I think someone wrote it a bit more sophisticatly after I was done. The root directory structure was not copied across correctly. The VSS repository was organised as $/client/project. The svn repository ended up being organised as svn://server/randomdirectory/anotherrandomdirectory/client/project. So I fixed these by editing the dumpfile before importing it (I think it was find replace "/randomdirectory' with ''.
