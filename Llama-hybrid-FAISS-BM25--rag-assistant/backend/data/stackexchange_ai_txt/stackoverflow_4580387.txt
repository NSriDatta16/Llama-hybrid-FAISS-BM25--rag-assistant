You can use Guava: Files.readLines(new File("myfile.txt"), Charsets.UTF_8); Or apache commons io: FileUtils.readLines(new File("myfile.txt")); I'd say both are equally elegant. Depending on your exact use, assuming the "default encoding" might be a good idea or not. Either way, personally I find it good that the Guava API makes it clear that you're making an assumption about the encoding of the file. Update: Java 7 now has this built in: Files.readAllLines(Path path, Charset cs) . And there too you have to specify the charset explicitly.
