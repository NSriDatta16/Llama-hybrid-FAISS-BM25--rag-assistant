Supervised clustering

I have a subset of the original dataset as follows: Families GH1 GH2 GH3 GH4 GH5 GH6 sp1 23 21 34 23 12 5 sp2 5 19 17 12 90 76 sp3 54 32 13 19 9 0 sp4 1 3 0 12 0 78 sp5 45 24 2 34 21 4 I selected 20 important variables using random forest algorithm. Now, I would like to cluster the families based on these 20 selected variables. I already know that sp1 and sp2 belong to a particular region. Could that information be used in the training set? Could someone explain how to do a supervised clustering? I would prefer an example in R.
