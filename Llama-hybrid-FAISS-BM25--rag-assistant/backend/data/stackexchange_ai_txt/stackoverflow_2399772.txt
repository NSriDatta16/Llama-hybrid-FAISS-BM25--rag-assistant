Ruby on Rails deployment, on "thin" server with lot of attachments

A lot of PDFs are stored inside MySQL as a BLOB field for each PDF file. The average file size is 500K each. The Rails app will stream the :binary data as file downloads, where there is a user click on the download link. Assume there is a maximum of 5 users downloading 5 PDFs concurrently, what kind of deployment setup parameters I should be aware of? e.g. for the case of thin: thin start --servers 3 whether --servers 3 is good enough (or 5 or more is needed) for the above example? The 2nd question is whether 'thin' a capable solution? Thanks!
