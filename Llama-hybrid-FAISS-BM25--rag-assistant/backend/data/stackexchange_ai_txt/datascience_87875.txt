Machine Learning is not something that can be mastered or learnt in a short time, and you need at least 3-4 months familiarize yourself with the basics and even after that you need at least 6-7 months to get to a good place with your ML knowledge. To get started you can first go through this course ( Python for Everybody - Full University Python Course ) to familiarize yourself with python and learn the basics of programming. After this, you need to know basic statistics, linear algebra and basic differential calculus. You can learn these 3 subjects from this course on Linear Algebra from Khan Academy , this course on Statistics from freecodecamp and this course on Calculus from Khan Academy Leave the "Integration" sections you won't need them much. Now the above 2 points only cover the pre-requisites to get started with machine learning. From here to get started with ML follow the following list of courses: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Stanford University) Link : To get to know the inner workings and inner maths of all the major machine learning algorithms. The only downside of this course is that the implementation of all machine learning algorithms is on Matlab. Machine Learning A-Z (Udemy) Link : This course will explain the implementation of machine learning algorithms in python. And would help you to create basic machine learning projects. The above courses will get you started in machine learning, and you will have good knowledge of how ML learning algorithms work. After this comes, Deep Learning, currently most research work is being conducted in deep learning, deep learning algorithms offer highly efficient mathematical and statistical method the get good accuracy from your data. To get started with deep learning these 2 specializations of Coursera are more than enough to give you a working mathematical and implementational knowledge in Deep Learning. The 2 courses are as follows: Deep Learning Specialization from Deeplearning.ai Link : This course will give you a good mathematical knowledge related to deep learning. Tensorflow Developer Specialization from Deeplearning.ai Link : This course will teach you how to implement basic neural networks and teach you the implementation of deep learning in Tensorflow framework. PS: Please pardon my English if it is not up to the mark. This is my first answer so please go easy on me XP.
