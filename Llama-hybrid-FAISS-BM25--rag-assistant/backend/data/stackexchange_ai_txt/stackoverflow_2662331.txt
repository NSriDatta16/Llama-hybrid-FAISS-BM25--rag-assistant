NSDragOperationGeneric is a bit-mask — probably a power of two — meaning that only one bit in the number is set. A bit-wise & with sourceDragMask will produce a non-zero output if and only if the corresponding bit is set in sourceDragMask . Hypothetically (I don't know the actual value of NSDragOperationGeneric ): sourceDragMask: 00011010 NSDragOperationGeneric: 00001000 a & b: 00001000 In short, the if statement will succeed if sourceDragMask has the `NSDragOperationGeneric' bit set.
