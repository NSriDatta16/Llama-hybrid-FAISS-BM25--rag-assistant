How to move reinforcement learning model into production?

I have trained reinforcement learning agent on a custom environment using the DQN technique. The custom environment is a simulation of a real production environment. Now I have trained NN model with in the .h5 file format and want to move this model into production. I do not need it to learn and improve in production, just act according to the policy it learned in the simulated environment. But I don't have clear idea of doing this. Are my custom environment and agent classes are still required while making the prediction about the action using the saved model? If not, what is the best way to move RL models into production?
