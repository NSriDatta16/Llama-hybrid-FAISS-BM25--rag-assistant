remove UIView subview based on tag?

I am creating a view like this: UILabel *qty = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 20)]; qty.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; qty.text =[NSString stringWithFormat:@" Qty: %@", currentQty]; qty.alpha = 0.5; [qty setTag:999]; [self.view addSubview:qty]; [qty release]; This can happen multiple times in this view controller so before I create a new view like this I want to remove any that might exist with this tag, I am trying this: UIView *removeView = [self.view viewWithTag:999]; [removeView removeFromSuperview]; This is not working for some reason, anyone see my problem here? I guess i could loop through all the views and check the tag but would rather have a more elegant and direct solution.
