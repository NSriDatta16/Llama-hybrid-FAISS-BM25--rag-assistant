Magento static pages menu

I want to make a menu that will dynamically show the active static pages from CMS; for example if in my CMS I have these pages: About Us (enabled) Shipping & Refund (disabled) Terms and Conditions (enabled) Contacts (enabled) then the menu would look like: About US | Terms and Conditions | Contacts I need just a few tips on how to get started; maybe somebody has already done this before?
