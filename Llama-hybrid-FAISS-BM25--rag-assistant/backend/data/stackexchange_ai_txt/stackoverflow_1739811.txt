Point* array[10] creates an array with ten slots for pointers, numbered 0..9. You are both wrong - no initialisation takes place in C++ with such a statement, unless you are running a special memory allocator which zeros memory, such as SmartHeap (or C++/CLI) or if the array is outside of a function (eg: just within a .cpp file as global), in which case all the pointers are zeroed. Absolutely no instances are created. Respectfully disagreeing with strager's point, there is no such thing as an instance of Point* and it would be dangerous to think of such a thing existing. There is only space for a pointer and compile-time checking to ensure you can only assign a pointer of that type, or pointer to a subclass, into that pointer.
