Not only is there no problem to using break , I'd say anyone saying it is "considered harmful" is downright wrong. break is a language feature used to abort a loop - you could use goto , but then you incur the (appropriate) wrath of the XKCD comic below. You could use a flag in the condition, but that hampers readability. break is not only the easiest, but also the clearest way many times to bust out of a loop. Use it as it was meant to be used. Edit: To get at a larger picture here: When you're writing code, the guiding principle to "should I use language feature X or Y" should be "which way will result in the more elegant code"? Elegance, in code, is pretty much an art, but I'd lay it down as a fine balance between readability and algorithmic (read: not micro-optimizations) efficiency. Readability is going to be determined by length, complexity of the code, etc. A one-line boost::bind may very well be harder to read & understand than a 3 line loop. If a language feature can help you write code that is easier to understand while getting the job done, then use it. This applies to break , goto , C++ exceptions, etc. Don't follow a "X is (evil|considered harmful)" blindly - apply common sense and logic each time.
