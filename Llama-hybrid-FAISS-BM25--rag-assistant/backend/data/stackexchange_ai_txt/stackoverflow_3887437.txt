Several people have mentioned the FFT, which you'll want to do, but to then detect white noise you need to make sure that the magnitude is relatively constant over the range of audio frequencies. You'll want to look at magnitudes only, you can throw away the phases. You can compute an average and standard deviation for the magnitudes in O(N) time. For white noise, you should find the standard deviation to be a relatively small fraction of the average. If I remember my statistics right, it should be about (1/sqrt(N)) of the average.
