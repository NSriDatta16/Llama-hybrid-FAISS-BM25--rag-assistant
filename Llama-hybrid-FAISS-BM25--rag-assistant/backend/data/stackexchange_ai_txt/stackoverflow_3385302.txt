In your code, your span and li ids don't match up. Is that intentional? Either way, you don't need all the span IDs and individual onClicks. The following will insert a blank line before any LI (including blank LIs) whenever they are clicked, without the need for any onClicks. $('#ml_organize li').live('click', function() { $(this).before(' 0 '); }); I'd also look at simplifying the markup -- all the repeated classes seem a bit wasteful when you could just use the parent class for CSS styling.
