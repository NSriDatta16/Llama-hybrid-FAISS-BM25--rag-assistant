I just found the reason it did not mount. I had a leftover file from earlier udev version. File 60-persistent-storage.rules existed in both /etc/udev/rules.d and in /lib/udev/rules.d . The former overruled the last one. When removing the one in /etc/udev/rules.d the USB drives mounted correctly again.
