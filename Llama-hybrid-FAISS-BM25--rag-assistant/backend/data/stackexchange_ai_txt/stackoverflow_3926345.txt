Although I haven't found a reasonable debugging solution, I did find that this was related to updating nant. An old buildscript that worked began to break on a "duplicate target" error. This was because a taskfile was included by 2 other taskfiles already included in the project. nant found two different paths to the same task, and thought it was two distinct tasks and consequently flipped.
