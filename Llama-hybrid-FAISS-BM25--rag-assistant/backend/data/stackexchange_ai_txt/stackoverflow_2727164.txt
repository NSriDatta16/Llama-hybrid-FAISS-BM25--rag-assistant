Compute bounding quad of a sphere with vertex shader

I'm trying to implement an algorithm from a graphics paper and part of the algorithm is rendering spheres of known radius to a buffer. They say that they render the spheres by computing the location and size in a vertex shader and then doing appropriate shading in a fragment shader. Any guesses as to how they actually did this? The position and radius are known in world coordinates and the projection is perspective. Does that mean that the sphere will be projected as a circle?
