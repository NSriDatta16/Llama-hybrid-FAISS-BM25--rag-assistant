Finding events related to a specific feature in a noisy dataset

I am working on a tool that has to discover the most likely events related to the presence of a feature. I have a two dataset containing events. The first contains the observations presenting the feature I am interested into and the other contains the observation that should not be related to the feature. You can think at my data as a single set of events with attached a FEATURE/NON FEATURE label. As I mentioned in the comment, an event may appear multiple times in the dataset. Each event represents is discrete and represents a categorical value. Not all the events labeled with FEATURE actually relates to the feature. They are simply noise due to the fact that I cannot observe the feature in isolation. Is there any method to find which are the events that are most likely to be specifically related to the feature I am interested into? I was thinking at some sort of correlation analysis or at a Bayesian analysis but I am not really into statistics and I'd like to have your opinion.
