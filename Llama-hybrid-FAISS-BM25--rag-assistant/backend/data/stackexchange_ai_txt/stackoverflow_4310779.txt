Android Opengl ES dark pixels on edge of objects

I would like to draw you attention to the following pictures First the original image then how it is rendered on the screen as you can see on the original everything is nice and yellow, the edges have a slight transparency to look smooth. but when I render I have some darkened pixels that appear. To avoid the usual answer I get I use gl.glTexImage2D(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_2D, level, GL10.GL_RGBA, width, height, 0, GL10.GL_RGBA, GL10.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixelBuffer); and not the glutil tool also gl.glEnable(GL10.GL_BLEND); gl.glBlendFunc(GL10.GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL10.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); Anybody has a solution for that ? Thanks Jason Edit I did some digging. in the original image my background is already the same color as the coin and I use an alpha mask. I've also checked, when I load the bitmap it seems that all the bitmap who have an alpha 0 are automatically set to 0,0,0,0. this might be the problem. edit actually it seems to be the issue. I checked the values of the bitmap I open, the values for transparent pixels are 0,0,0,0 instead of the color I set. Is this a problem with Bitmap or how I created my image? // Load up, and flip the texture: Bitmap temp = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), resource, opts); Bitmap bmp = Bitmap.createBitmap(temp, 0, 0, temp.getWidth(), temp.getHeight(), flip, true); temp.recycle();
