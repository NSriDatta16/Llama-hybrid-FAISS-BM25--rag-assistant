WebView doesn't load my HTML String in iPhone

This doesn't load my HTML string in the WebView. NSString *htmlString = @" My First Heading My first paragraph. "; //I have a very large HTML content here.. For sample I have given a small content [teaserWebView loadHTMLString:htmlString baseURL:nil]; Do I need to use some encoding? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks
