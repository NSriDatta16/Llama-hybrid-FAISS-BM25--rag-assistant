I usually use SQLAlchemy . It's pretty powerful and is probably the most mature python ORM. If you're planning on using CherryPy, you might also look into dejavu as it's by Robert Brewer (the guy that is the current CherryPy project leader). I personally haven't used it, but I do know some people that love it. SQLObject is a little bit easier to use ORM than SQLAlchemy, but it's not quite as powerful. Personally, I wouldn't use the Django ORM unless I was planning on writing the entire project in Django, but that's just me.
