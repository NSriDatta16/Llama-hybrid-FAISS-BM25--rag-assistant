Problems with embedding youtube with xslt transforms

I have multiple video links from youtube stored in an xml file, I have added code that will allow these to be embedded, xml element is video. Each element is stored in an outer element with an id, and only sections with each id are only visible one at a time. The pblem is that only 1 section has all of its videos embedded while others will either have none or will have the other sections videos. Code is shown below Video Is there another way to get this to work? EDIT - Below is a sample xml file in the format of what I am transforming. http://www.youtube.com/embed/0iCFi14Glbk http://www.youtube.com/embed/rMCh4etBbkU These embedded videos should be displayed in a table as shown in the xsl above. http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/web_graphics/article.php/3480061/How-To-Add-a-YouTube-Video-to-Your-Web-Site.htm The link above shows the way in which i want this to work with the embeded video displayed
