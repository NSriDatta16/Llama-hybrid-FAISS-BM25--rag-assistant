How to retrieve unicode data stored directly in non-unicode field as varchar format in sql server

I have to create a C# application which displays unicode data in a textbox. But the SQL server column storage has varchar data which contains unicode data. But since varchar is non-unicode based it displays character strings like "????????". Well the problem i am facing is i cant change the column type as there are other dependent application running on it.
