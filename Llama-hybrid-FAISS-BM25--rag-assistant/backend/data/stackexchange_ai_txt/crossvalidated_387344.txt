@Maarten Buis has done an excellent job explaining your logistic regression questions, but I figured I'd supplement his answer with some sample R code so you can see the calculations performed in a statistical analysis program. In the first part of your question, you asked about the computation of: $$ log( odds(B=1|A) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A $$ We can get this model ( log-odds of $B=1$ given $A$ ) as follows: > A B > #view dummy table in table form > table(B,A) A B 0 1 0 443 95 1 44 27 > > #run log(odds(B=1|A)) > mylogit_BgivenA mylogit_BgivenA Call: glm(formula = B ~ A, family = "binomial") Coefficients: (Intercept) A -2.309 1.051 You can see from the coefficients the -2.309 here, corresponds to the log odds of B being equal to 1 given, all the values of A are equal to 0. This also corresponds to Maarten's approximate value of -2.3. Moving on to your second question, we can find the probabilities and log odds of A by regressing A onto a constant value of 1: > mylogit_Aonly > mylogit_Aonly Call: glm(formula = A ~ 1, family = "binomial") Coefficients: (Intercept) -1.384 > > exp_b0 #probability of event A given no explanatory variables > #calculate the probability of p_A > exp_b0/(1+exp_b0) [1] 0.2003674 Lastly, note that $log(odds(B=1|A)) \ne log(odds(A=1|B))$ . You can verify this by running another logistic regression and comparing the results with the first output above: > #run log(odds(A=1|B)) > mylogit_AgivenB mylogit_AgivenB Call: glm(formula = A ~ B, family = "binomial") Coefficients: (Intercept) B -1.540 1.051 Note that the value of the intercept (-1.54) is different than that calculated in the first output shown (-2.309).
