Splitting a multipage TIFF image - With .NET and IronPython

I had a scanned multipage TIFF image and needed to split each page out into individual files. This is easy to do in by leveraging the .NET framework and C#, but since I did not have all the development tools installed on the machine I was using, I instead opted to use IronPython (via ipy.exe) to quickly script the processing logic. Using Stack Overflow as a 'blog' engine, I'll provide an answer to my own question. Comments, suggestions, alternatives, etc. are welcome!
