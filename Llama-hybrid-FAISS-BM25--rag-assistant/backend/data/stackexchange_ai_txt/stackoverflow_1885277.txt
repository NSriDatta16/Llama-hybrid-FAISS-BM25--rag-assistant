I'd suggest you to take a look at QFileSystemModel for good practices. The model should update itself using a separate thread for UI responsiveness, keeping a cache and so on. A well behaved model should also make your work on the editor easier. I'd also would go for deriving QObject for creating your TreeItem classes. A shared data aproach with QSharedData for a base class would be nice. I'd also have a property for it's order. This way when user drags and drops or change the order in any other way you have a way to keep control. Since the data is shared, keeping your own list of objects in your order for performance would have little cost. Also, take a look at ModelTest .
