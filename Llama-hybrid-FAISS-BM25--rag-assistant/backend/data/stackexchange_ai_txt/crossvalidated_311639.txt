multinomial logistic regression with preceding factor analysis

Currently I am planning to analyze a large dataset containing nominal, ordinal as well as ratio variables using R. My goal is to predict the outcome of a certain variable X (nominal, ordinal or ratio) using all the other variables I have in the dataset (100+). So far I came up with the following plan: to reduce the size of the dataset and prevent to get too many predicting variables, I would first run a latent factor analysis to extract certain factors correlating with the outcome (see: http://web.archive.org/web/20130502181643/http://www.statisticalinnovations.com/articles/bozdogan.pdf or http://factominer.free.fr/ ) depending on the scale of the dependent variable, I would either run a (multinomial) logistic regression, an ordinal logistic regression or a GLM if the dv is a ratio (see: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/1190/type-of-regression-with-nominal-ordinal-interval-and-ratio-data ) with the extracted factors of step one Do you think that I am on the right track? Is the latent factor analysis the right choice to extract the most important factors or are there better methods? Are the any restrictions to using the proposed regression methods with a preceding factor analysis?
