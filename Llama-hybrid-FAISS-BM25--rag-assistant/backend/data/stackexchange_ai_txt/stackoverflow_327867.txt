Shared file storage for a Rails Application

I have a rails app that accepts file uploads and I wanted to know the best way to have common storage between servers. Since we have a number of windows applications we have used samba in the past, but as we build pure linux apps I would like to do this the best possible way. We are expecting large amounts of data, so would need to scale this across multiple file servers.
