This is about configuring ssh, not git. If you haven't already, you should use ssh-keygen (with a blank passphrase) to create a key pair. Then, you copy the public key to the remote destination with ssh-copy-id . Unless you have need of multiple keys (e.g. a more secure one with a passphrase for other purposes) or you have some really weird multiple-identity stuff going on, it's this simple: ssh-keygen # enter a few times to accept defaults ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@host Edit: You should really just read DigitalRoss's answer, but: if you use keys with passphrases, you'll need to use ssh-add to add them to ssh-agent (and obviously start up an ssh-agent if your distribution doesn't already have one running for you).
