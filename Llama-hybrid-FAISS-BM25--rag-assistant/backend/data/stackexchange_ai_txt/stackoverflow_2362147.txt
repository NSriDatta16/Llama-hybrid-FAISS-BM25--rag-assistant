I want to thank both responders so far for their effort but their responses are pretty far from my question. I'll try to respond myself based on the things that I've learned. A quote is a concept related to the order , only that is previous to that in terms of work flow in Magento. A real world concept is something like a preorder , like a postIt on which you place your asked dishes in a restaurant without being an order or a bill. I was monitoring an event (checkout_cart_product_add_after) that is sending me the $product and the $orderItem. I understand now that is sending both in order to get information about the product and information about billing and the representation of that product in the future order. In the case of the grouped products for example where the $product is Tshirt with various associated sizes, the $product will contain the SKU of the main grouped product and the $orderItem will contain the instance of the Tshirt that was selected ( medium size SKU ). FYI: So in order to update the information of a product at cart update you have is better to get the product info from the $item if is a complex type ( bundle, configurable or grouped )
