Problems with Xalan using XPATH (unclosed tags)

Greetings, I'm facing a problem with the following tech-stack: JWebUnit -> HtmlUnit -> Xalan. I'm trying to find an element by XPATH, but the HTML document is pretty malformed. Xalan stops finding elements when I reach the /body element on XPATH. I believe it's because the document contains two tags and one being unclosed. Everything works for /html/head or /html . But when I try /html/body (or /html/body[1] , //body[1] , or anything inside those tags) I get only null from Xalan. Is there any way to get around with that? I just can't change the html document istself. Thank you kindly for your attention. Best regards, Thiago
