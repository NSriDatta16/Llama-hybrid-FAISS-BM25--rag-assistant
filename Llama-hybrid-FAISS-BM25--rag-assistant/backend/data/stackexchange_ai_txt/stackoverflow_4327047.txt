How to calculate average date occurrence frequency in SQL

I'm trying to produce a query on the following table (relevant portion only): Create Table [Order] ( OrderID int NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1), CreationDate datetime NOT NULL, CustomerID int NOT NULL ) I would like to see a list of CustomerIDs with each customer's average number of days between orders. I'm curious if this can be done with a pure set based solution or if a cursor/temp table solution is necessary.
