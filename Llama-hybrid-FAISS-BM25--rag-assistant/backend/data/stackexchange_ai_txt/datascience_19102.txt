Using word2vec with mixed language data

I scraped my Facebook chat history and wanted to try out some basic machine learning stuff with word2vec. However, the data has all sorts of stuff - links, emoji, Cyrillic alphabet, etc. Even if I manage to clear some of those, would it be possible to process the Cyrillic alphabet with word2vec?
