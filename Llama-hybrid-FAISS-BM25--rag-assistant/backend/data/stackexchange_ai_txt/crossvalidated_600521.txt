The main problem here seems to me to be about defining and finding the (dis)similarity between different graphs . The 'graph edit distance' (defining distance in terms of number of operations neccesary to convert one graph into the other) is a common way that has been described here on stack overflow. In section 4.2 of "Exact and inexact graph matching: methodology and applications" you find alternative methods for inexact graph matching. These are: artificial neural networks, relaxation labeling, spectral methods and kernel methods. Riesen, Kaspar, Xiaoyi Jiang, and Horst Bunke. "Exact and inexact graph matching: Methodology and applications." Managing and Mining Graph Data (2010): 217-247. Then, after solving that problem, to perform clustering you can use any clustering method that uses a distance matrix . See this question: Clustering with a distance matrix
