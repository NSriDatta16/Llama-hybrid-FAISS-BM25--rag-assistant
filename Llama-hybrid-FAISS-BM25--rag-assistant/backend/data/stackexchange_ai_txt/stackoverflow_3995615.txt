There's the Domino .NET assembly from Notes version 6.5 and above which provides you with fairly easy ways to use Lotus Notes object model in your .NET application (so you can write C# code), however some general knowledge is needed about the object model itself and how to program Notes classes. However you can find many answers on the DeveloperWorks of IBM for Lotus (http://www.notes.net). You can also put your data to the HDD and create LotuScript local agent to pick it up and send over via email. For this you need some LotusScript knowledge. Local agents can be scheduled easily but Notes client needs to run on that machine all the time. Server address is not needed when you send emails from Notes code (either .NET app or LotusScript code). All addresses are configured in Notes configuration documents called Locations and Connections. These documents are to be found in the local Address Book application, in the Advanced section. You can also manage locations via the File menu (starting from version 8 I assume). It's rather simple but not "Microsoft style" and that's why you call it "not intuitive". But normally Notes client is not used to send automated mails unless it's done during the user interaction with Notes application itself. If you need to send mails over you can integrate with the Domino server and send mails from there using scheduled agents. But in case you use .NET code it could also use the client API to do this but you'll need to have Notes client installed on the machine where you run your application that sends mail. The final option would be to send it over SMTP. This will require SMTP relaying configuration on the server and will not support encryption that is provided "out of the box" by Lotus Notes/Domino.
