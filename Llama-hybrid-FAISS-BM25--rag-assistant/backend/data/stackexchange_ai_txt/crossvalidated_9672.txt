I have yet still not found the time series book which I like. Here is the list of books which I found very useful: Time Series Analysis by J. D. Hamilton. This is the book which contains practically everything. Applied econometric time series by W. Enders. Classical reference Introductory econometrics for finance by Ch. Brooks. I use this book for teaching time-series to students with little mathematical background. Nevertheless it is a good book for getting the ideas without too much mathematical detail.
