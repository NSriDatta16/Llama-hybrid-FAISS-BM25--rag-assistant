Is the popup serving content from a different domain than the parent? If so, the short answer is you can't. The long answer is that you can sent the popup's href fragment (i.e. the part after the # in protocol://server/path?query#fragment). If the content in the popup knows to check its fragment for changes, then you can pass data to it. If it's from the same domain then your code should work, as long as an element with that id exists.
