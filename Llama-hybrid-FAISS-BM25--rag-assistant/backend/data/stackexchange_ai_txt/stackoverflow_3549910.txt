Project Gutenberg Python problem?

I am trying to process various texts by regex and NLTK of python -which is at http://www.nltk.org/book- . I am trying to create a random text generator and I am having a hard time with a problem. First, here is my algorithm: Enter a sentence as input -this is called trigger string- Get longest word in trigger string Search all Project Gutenberg database for sentences that contain this word -regardless of uppercase lowercase- Return the longest sentence that has the word I spoke about in step 3 Append the sentence in Step 1 and Step4 together Repeat the process. Note that I have to get the longest word in second sentence and continue like that and so on- So far I have been able to do this for first two sentences but I cannot perform a case insensitive search. Entire sentence database of Project Gutenberg is available via gutenberg.sents() function but regex - case insensitive search is practically impossible since the gutenberg.sents() outputs the sentences in books as following -in a list of list format-: EXAMPLE: all the sentences of shakespeare's macbeth is called by typing import nltk from nltk.corpus import gutenberg gutenberg.sents('shakespeare-macbeth.txt') into the python shell command line and output is: [['[', 'The', 'Tragedie', 'of', 'Macbeth', 'by', 'William', 'Shakespeare', '1603', ']'], ['Actus', 'Primus', '.'], .......] with [The Tragedie of Macbeth by William Shakespare, 1603] and Actus Primus. being the first two sentences. How can I find the word I'm looking for regardless of it being uppercase/lowercase ? I'm desperately in need of help since I have been tinkering with this for the past two days and it's starting to wear on my nerves. Thanks a lot.
