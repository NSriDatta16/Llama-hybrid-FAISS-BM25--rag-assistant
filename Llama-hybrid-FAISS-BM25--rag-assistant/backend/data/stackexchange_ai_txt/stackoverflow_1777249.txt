The first sample is configurable. You simply change the contents of the hashtable and you can change the accelerators at runtime letting the user configure them. Here the hashtable is used not exactly for the uniqueness constraint. Its value comes from the ability to do quick retrievals of data based on a key (in this case, literally). Are you using .NET 2.0? If so, you should use a Dictionary , instead of an Hashtable, because you get strong-typing.
