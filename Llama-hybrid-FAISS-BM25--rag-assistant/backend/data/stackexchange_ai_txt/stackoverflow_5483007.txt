I haven't tested this, but just looking through some of the source code, the dragged ghost is obtained via an TreeNode element clone, so you can't tell it explicitly not to add your class, but the first chance you get to delete the class is in the TreePanel.startdrag event: removeClassOnStartDrag = function(tree) { tree.dragZone.proxy.ghost.removeClass('some-class'); } ... treepanel.on('startdrag', removeClassOnStartDrag, this);
