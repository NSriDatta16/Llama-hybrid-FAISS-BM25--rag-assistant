How do you setup a handler for the dragover/dragdrop events in the MDI client area?

Using C# and the .Net framework 2.0. I have an MDI application and need to handle dragover/dragdrop events. I have a list docked to the left on my application and would like to be able to drag an item from the list and drop it in the MDI client area and have the correct MDI child for the item open. I can't seem to figure out where to attach the handler. I've tried attaching to the main form's events and the MdiClient that is part of the form, but neither event handler seems to get called when I expect them to. I'm also using an Infragistics Tabbed MDI Manager, so I'm not sure if that's affecting it.
