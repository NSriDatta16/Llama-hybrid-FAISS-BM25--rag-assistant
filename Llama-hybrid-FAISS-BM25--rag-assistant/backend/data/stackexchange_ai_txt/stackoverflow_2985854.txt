Custom calendar drag drop event: Find date dropped to

I've been working in silverlight to do a date-oriented application. I started off with changing the calendar template to contain a listbox on every date, and I created a listbox containing simple items. I implemented an easy drag drop on both those elements, so now I can drag from the listbox containing the items to the listbox on a date and have an event. Downside is: In the event, I don't know which date it was dropped to. How can I figure this out? Please note: The date dropped to is not necessarily the date currently selected...
