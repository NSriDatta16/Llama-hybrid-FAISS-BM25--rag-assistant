Customizable Authencation backends not followed by Django's own login testcases. Why?

I learnt that using Customizable Authencation backends philosophy , one can create a website which accepts email addresses as usernames. But after building the corresponding logic and testing that my code is working fine, I found one issue with Django's own testcases. They were failing to follow the Customizable Authencation backend philosophy. Meaning, the testcases were actually having hardcoded values('username': 'testclient') for testing the "login" process. Why is that? Django always discourages Tight Coupling. But whats happening here? I am not bashing Django by any means! I am a big fan and I will be, for years to come. Just want to know the reason behind this! Update: As @dmishe pointed out those testcases should validate Django's own functionality. I understood that. But how do I let those "failing testcase" errors NOT show up when I run my testcases or run the whole project test suite?
