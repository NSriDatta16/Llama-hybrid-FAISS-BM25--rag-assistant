You can try to use javascript not like a pure object oriented language(which isn't) but something that use functions and closures which are its specificity. function _class(init){ var _private = init; return { _method:function(param){ alert(_private + param); } }; }; _class('Stack')._method('Overflow'); If you have the courage to read/debug it, the source code of jQuery is a very good example of javascript usage.
