How to differentiate two constructors with the same parameters?

Suppose we want two constructors for a class representing complex numbers: Complex (double re, double img) // construct from cartesian coordinates Complex (double A, double w) // construct from polar coordinates but the parameters (number and type) are the same: what is the more elegant way to identify what is intended? Adding a third parameter to one of the constructors?
