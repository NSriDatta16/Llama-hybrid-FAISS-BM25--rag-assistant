WPF 4 Embeding Report Designer

Is it possible to embed the Visual Studio 2010 report designer functionality into my WPF application? Initially I was considering the use of Report builder, but for providing ad-hoc reporting capability from within application, I need to teach users too many steps before they start creating a simple report. So I am now thinking of simplifying it by embedding the report Designer (if it is possible), and do all the basic steps programatically and show the design surface and Data objects on the left. Any help is appreciated.
