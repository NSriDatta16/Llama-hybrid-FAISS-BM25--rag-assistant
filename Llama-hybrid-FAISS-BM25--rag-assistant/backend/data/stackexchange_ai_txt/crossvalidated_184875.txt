Are you interested in proportion of A among all Android phones ? Or are you interested in proportion of A among all Android models ? The difference between these two is that each model has many actual physical phones. If your answer is "among models", then you do a simple average. If your answer is "among phones", then a weighted average, where the weight is the number of phones for each model.
