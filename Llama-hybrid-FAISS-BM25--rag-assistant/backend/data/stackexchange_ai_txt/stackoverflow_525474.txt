It's quite possible to write a web application using only javascript. One the key benefits of that is that since all code runs locally, you can make an application which doesn't require online connectivity. The main detractor though, is that you can't hook it up to a database. But there are alternative data storage hacks you can use. One example of such a javascript application is TiddlyWiki which is a personal wiki, contained in a single html file. The javascript application rewrites that html file, so you can carry it with you on a USB-drive or something.
