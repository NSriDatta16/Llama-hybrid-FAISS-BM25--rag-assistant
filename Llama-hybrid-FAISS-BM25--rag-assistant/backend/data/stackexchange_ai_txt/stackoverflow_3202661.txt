CSS problem with Chrome

I am having a problem with margins / line-height in one of our websites. I am using a Jquery script to create a Drop Cap effect in the first letter of each sections, that adds a class to them. There are two types of dropcaps, as you can see. Google Chrome is not rendering the smaller ones correctly. You can compare with other browser and see the difference. Any idea about why is this happening? Is there a fix / hack for this?
