One way to go about it is to create a "SecurityContext" class that holds username, remote ip address, etc. Then create an Agent class that acts as a proxy class to your WCF services. In the Agent class you can create the security context with a static class. You can then pass this SecurityContext along to the other tiers on all service methods that need security. This way it is flexible enough to do the authentication on the front end and auditing, etc on the domain/business logic layer.
