How to determine the frequency from Wavelet coefficeints

I created a Time series signal of 1024 values based on combination of sine waves Y=Sin(2pi*50*t) +Sin(2pi*300*t) with t incremented in milliseconds (i.e) f=1000Hz. I used R Discrete Wavelet package to get the Wavelet Coefficient using Daubechies transform with number of levels=4 . The output were the coefficients W1,W2,W3,W4 and an approximation V4 How to determine the frequency of input signal (50 and 300) from these coefficients ?
