How to search a HTML page for an item in a given list

I have a list of schools schools = ['Harvard Law School', 'Stanford Law School', 'Yale Law School', 'Columbia Law School', 'NYU School of Law', 'University of Chicago Law School'] and bios of lawyers that contain one of these schools: html = "page that contains one of these schools" like this " Education JD, Columbia Law School, Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar, Parker School Recognition of Achievement in International and Foreign Law, 2005 BM, BM, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, summa cum laude , 1997 " I've been extracting the school info with regex. But I thought it would be better to have a lookup list of schools and search each page for the matching school. I'm new to Python so I was searching about how to do this and I found difflib.SequenceMatcher . I've been playing with it, and it's fun but I don't think it is the right tool for what I want to do. Can anyone direct me to the right way of doing this? Thanks!
