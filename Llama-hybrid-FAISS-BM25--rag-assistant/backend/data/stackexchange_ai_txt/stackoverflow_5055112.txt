designing classification problem of weather data

In normal 2 or multi class classification problem, we can use any famous machine learning algorithm like Naive Bayes or SVM to train and test the model. My problem is that I have been given weather data where the label variable is in the format of "20 % rain, 80 % dry" or "30% cloudy, 70% rain" etc. How should I approach this problem? Will I need to covert the problem into regression somehow? In that case, if there are three labels (rain, dry, cloudy) in data, what may be the right approach to convert percentage information to continuous values? Thanks for your time
