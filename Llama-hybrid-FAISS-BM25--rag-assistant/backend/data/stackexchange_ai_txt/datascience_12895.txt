Machine Learning or Survival Analysis?

I am working on building prediction model for disk failures (time taken to occur a disk failure and what parameters could strongly affect disk failures). I am bit confused on- What data preprocessing steps should I perform. The dataset is highly imbalanced (500 failures and ~40000 non-failures) What type of Machine Learning models should I take into consideration as data is highly imbalanced? Few days back, I read about Survival Analysis and now I am in conundrum whether the problem would be of Survival Analysis or Machine Learning? I am currently working with dataset provided by BackBlaze( https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html ). It would be really great it I could get some direction :)
