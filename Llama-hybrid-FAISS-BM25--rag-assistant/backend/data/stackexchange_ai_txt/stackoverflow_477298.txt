I thinks that is unlikely your problem will be fixed by switching from fstream to FILE*, usually both are buffered by the C library. Also the OS can cache reads (linux is very good in that aspect). Given the size of the file you are accessing is pretty likely it will be entirely in RAM. Like PolyThinker say your best bet is to run your program trough an profiler an determine where the problem is. Also you are using seekg/tellg this can cause notable delays if your disk is heavily fragmented, because to read the file for the first time the disk have to move the heads to the correct position.
