Approach for multivariate outlier detection when treating missing values with FIML

Iâ€˜m calculating a simple regression with one predictor and one dependent variable. Missings treatment is done with full information maximum likelihood (FIML). Should I do outlier detection, i.e. Mahalanobis distance and leverage points, with complete cases only or is there a need (and a way) to do it with estimated values as well?
