I built an Universal Tween Engine for Java: http://code.google.com/p/java-universal-tween-engine/ Tweens can be applied to every object (no just graphics objects, everything!), every object attribute can be tweened, and it supports every Robert Penner easing equation too. Also, the engine is optimized to not instantiate anything at runtime (except during initialization), so it can be used for Android games without fearing the garbage collector.
