learning the architecture of convolutional networks

I am learning the convolutional networks, and I see cnn diagrams but I don't understand why they are getting smaller and smaller. I have an image where it shows that they are called feauture maps but my doubts are. * because there are 3 feature maps what are those features maps I've heard that cnn learn more complex areas but I don't know in what order it does if it's from iqz to right or vice versa
