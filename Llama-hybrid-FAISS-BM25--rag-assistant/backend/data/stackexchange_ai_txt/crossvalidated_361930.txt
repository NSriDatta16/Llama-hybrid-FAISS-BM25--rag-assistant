The kind of analysis for finding such shifts is called changepoint analysis (see other questions tagged like this). This can be achieved my using maximum likelihood estimation, where for $m$ changepoints the likelihood function is $$ L(m, \tau_{1:m}, \theta_{1:(m+1)}) = \prod_{i=1}^{m+1} p(y_{(\tau_{i-1} + 1):\tau_i}\mid \theta_i) $$ where $y_1,\dots,y_n$ is your data, $1 In your case, you will be dealing with changes in the mean, but in the last segment there is a visible change in mean and variance. As about software, there is the changepoint package for R. If you need to forecast given the series as well, there is the Prophet package for both R and Python, that automatically detects the changepoints and uses them as a part of the time-series model.
