Do I need to standardise variables when computing an index of interest?

Suppose I have to create an "index of interest" for the products of an e-commerce. By index of interest I mean a $parameter$ which, based on some variables, tells me which products are the most interesting to my customers. For each product in the e-commerce I have: number of $visualizations$ ; number of $clicks$ on the "info" button of the product; $time$ spent on the page of the product; number of times the product has been added to the $basket$ ; "conversion $rate$ ", calculated as (number of times the product has been added to the basket) / (number of visualizations) Now, to create this index of interest I thought I could compute a weighted average, after having decided which weights to assign to each variable. For example: number of $visualizations$ [ $w_1: 0.05$ ] number of $clicks$ on the "info" button of the product [ $w_2: 0.2$ ] $time$ spent on the page of the product [ $w_3: 0.15$ ]; number of times the product has been added to the $basket$ [ $w_4: 0.3$ ]; "conversion $rate$ ", calculated as (number of times the product has been added to the $basket$ ) / (number of $visualizations)$ [ $w_5: 0.3$ ] So my $parameter$ could be: $parameter = visualizations \cdot w_1 + clicks \cdot w_2 + time \cdot w_3 + basket \cdot w_4 + rate \cdot w_5$ Obviously those variables have different scale, so my question is: do I have to standardise those variables? At first I thought it would be normal to standardise, but I'm not too sure. Maybe if I compute a weighted average I already take into account the different importance that each variable has on the final index. Also, if I have to standardise, do I have to standardise also the $rate$ ? Since it is a ratio maybe I don't need to standardise it.
