You can read a tutorial on how to use Python in the web. http://docs.python.org/howto/webservers.html In few words, mod_python keeps python interpreter in memory ready to execute python scripts, which is faster than launching it every time. It doesn't let you integrate python in html like PHP. For this you need to use a special application, like PyHP ( http://www.pyhp.org ) or another (there are several of them). Read Python tutorial and documentation pages, there's plenty of info and links to many template and html-embedding engines. Such engines as PyHP require some overhead to run. Without them, your python application must output HTTP response headers and the page as strings. Mod_wsgi and fastcgi facilitate this process. The page I linked in the beginning gives a good overview on that. Also you may try Tornado, a python web server, if you don't need to stick to Apache.
