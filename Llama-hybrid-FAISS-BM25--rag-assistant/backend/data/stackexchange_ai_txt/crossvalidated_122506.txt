Interpretation: Let $K$ denote the iteration at which the second six is obtained. Determine $E[K]$ . Answer: Let $K_0$ denote the time when we reach the first six. Then $E[K_0]$ is $\frac{1}{1/6}=6$ since it follows a geometric distribution. When we arrive at the first six, there is a 1 in six probability that we will arrive at the second in the next roll. If we fail to do so, the game starts over. That is, $E[K] = E[K_0] + 1 + \frac{5}{6}E[K]$ Simplifying gives $E[K] = 6 E[K_0] + 6 = 42$ . Other versions: Standard probability theory: First by the tower-property, $E[K] = E[E[K\mid K_0]]$ . Computing the inner expectation gives \begin{align} E[K\mid K_0] &= \sum_{k=K_0 + 1}^\infty k P(K = k) = \sum_{k=K_0 + 1}^\infty k\big( P(K = k\mid K = K_0+1)P(K = K_0 + 1)\\ &+ P(K = k\mid K \neq K_0+1)P(K \neq K_0 + 1)\big) \\ &=\frac{K_0 + 1}{6} + \frac{5}{6}\sum_{k=K_0 + 2}^\infty k P(K = k\mid K \neq K_0+1) \\ &=\frac{K_0 + 1}{6} + \frac{5}{6}E[K]. \end{align} The last equality follows from that we can put $s=K_0+2$ to obtain \begin{align} E[K] &= \sum_{s=1}^\infty k P(K = s) = \sum_{s=1}^\infty k P(K = s\mid K \neq s-1) \\&=\sum_{k=K_0 + 2}^\infty k P(K = k\mid K \neq K_0+1), \end{align} and the one before from $P(K = K_0 + 1) = \frac{1}{6}$ . Markov theory: This is a Markov chain with three states, $K$ , $K_6$ and the absorbing state $K^*$ . The states are for the last two dice-throws. Let $x$ be any integer $1\ldots 5$ and $y$ any integer $1\ldots 6$ . Then the three states represent $(y,x)$ , and $(x,6)$ and $(6,6)$ respectively. There is a theorem which states that the time to absorption is given as the solution to the equation system: \begin{align} K &= 1 + \frac{1}{6}K_6 + \frac{5}{6}K\\ K_6 &= 1 + \frac{5}{6}K. \end{align} Solving for $K$ gives the solution $K_6 + 6 = 42$ . That is, once we are in state $(x, 6)$ we expect $36$ additional rolls. To get the total we have to add six rolls to reach state $(x, 6)$ .
