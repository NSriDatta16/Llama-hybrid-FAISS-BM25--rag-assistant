SELECT * FROM reservation WHERE roomnum = {$room['roomnum']} AND roomtype = {$room['roomtype']} AND NOT ( datein BETWEEN '$start' AND '$end' AND dateout BETWEEN '$start' AND '$end' ) Having NOT x OR NOT y is essentially the same AS NOT (a AND b) . This axiom is part of De Morgan's law . So if you are unsure about grouping use these and other boolean logic. EDIT As others pointed out before, the error seems to be an empty variable. So, to guarantee that your query won't break in case an empty roomtype or roomnum is given, you could single quote these paramaters which would result in a comparison against an empty string (NOTE: I do NOT recommend this strategy. Please check your variables BEFORE they're used in statements).
