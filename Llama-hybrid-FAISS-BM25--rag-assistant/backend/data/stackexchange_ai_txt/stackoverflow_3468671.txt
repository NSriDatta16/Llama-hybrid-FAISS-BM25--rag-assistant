Database design: Plot storage

I'm new to database design and I considering implementing something that will be time consuming, so I wanted to ask here first if it is the best thing to do. Facts: For my purposes here, let's define a plot to be a set of x,y pairs. Plots can have different numbers of x,y pairs. Furthermore, for a particular plot, x,y pairs can be added or removed. I will have thousands upon thousands of plots, each of which will potentially have hundreds of pairs. In application I will have to regularly have to collect thousands of plots and integrate the plots over a known domain, sum the integration, and present this value to the user. I need to design a way to store this in a database so that retrieval, modification, and storage of plots is fast. Idea 1: Create a Plot table that holds a text list of x vals and a text list of y vals and parse them within the program. (I actually asked about this in an earlier question and this idea was summarily executed by the SO community! I think I understand why now.) Idea 2: Create a Plot table that holds a the metadata of the plot (meaning, units). But then create a table of Pairs where each row holds an x val a y val and a foreign key that points to the corresponding row in the Plot table. When attempting to draw a Plot , I would have to query the DB for all the corresponding Pair s, and order them before I could plot them. Is there anything foolish, time-consuming, or memory-consuming here? Idea 3: None of the above... come up with one that's better than what I've thought of so far. Note: I'm forced to use the Microsoft SQL Express, and I'm not sure when I will hit against the wall of what SQL Express can do. Also, I kinda spoiled myself by learning Linq-to-SQL right after I started learning the fundamentals of databasing... therefore I'm really still in a object-oriented design mentality.
