Mod-rewrite shenanigans

I have this rewrite rule RewriteEngine On RewriteBase /location/ RewriteRule ^(.+)/?$ index.php?franchise=$1 Which is suppose to change this URL http://example.com/location/kings-lynn Into this one http://example.com/location/index.php?franchise=kings-lynn But instead I am getting this http://example.com/location/index.php?franchise=index.php Also, adding a railing slash breaks it. I get index.php page showing but none of the style sheets or javascript are loading. I'm clearly doing something very wrong but I have no idea what despite spending all day R'ingTFM and many online primers and tutorials and questions on here.
