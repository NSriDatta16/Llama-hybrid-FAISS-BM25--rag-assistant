A way to automatically organize #imports in Xcode

I love the "Organize Imports" command in Eclipse to implicitly add and remove classes imported into a source file (as in Java or ActionScript). Is there a command in Xcode to update the #import directives at the top of.m Objective-C files based on the classes referenced within the file?
