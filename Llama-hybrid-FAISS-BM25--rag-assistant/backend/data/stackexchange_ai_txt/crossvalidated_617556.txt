How to implement Girardi & Ergun's (2013) three-step multivariate GARCH estimation of CoVaR in R?

I'm trying to calculate multivariate GARCH estimation of conditional value-at-risk, by adopting a three-step model from Girardi & Ergun (2013) paper entitled "Systemic risk measurement: Multivariate GARCH estimation of CoVaR". I'm using R and up until now I can't find any good references as to how to construct the model. For your reference, this is the three-step calculation from Girardi & Ergun (2013): Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 I have tried to put some prompt into chatGPT, and this is what it gave me. # Install and load required packages install.packages("quantmod") library(quantmod) library(rmgarch) # Step 1: Compute VaR of each stock using univariate model # Define the stock symbols and date range symbols returns[, i], nrow = nrow(returns), ncol = ncol(returns))) CoVaR[, i] I have tried run those code, somehow it work, but I'm not 100% convinced. I have tried to calculate step 1 in Excel and step 2 using Eviews, the result from step 2 is quite different. Calculation in step 2 was supposed to bring out the conditional variance series from the model GARCH(1,1), then calculate the VaR from there. Now what I have in mind is: Is there any way to prove that those output chatGPT gave me, is the similar calculation following Girardi & Ergun (2013)? And if Q no. 1 is correct, I'm sure that calculation in step 3 is wrong, because from Girardi & Ergun (2013), I have to calculate double integral from joint PDF functions of 2 different stocks. How can I construct the function to calculate step 3? P.S: I'm apologize in advanced if my question seems messed up, I'm a beginner in here and this is only my 1st time asking around.
