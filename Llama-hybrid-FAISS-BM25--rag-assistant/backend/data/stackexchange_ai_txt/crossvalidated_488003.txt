It's logistic regression with different penalization/regularization (LASSO=L1 regularization, or ridge=L2 regularization, or elastic net = LASSO & ridge = L1 and L2 regularization). It is a regression model, but the predicted probabilities can then be used for categorization (if that makes sense). I assume the name glmnet comes from Generalized Linear Model (generalized = using link functions & other distributions to generalize regression to binary and other outcomes such as Poisson etc.) and elastic-net. By the way, the package also has some other options like averaging a penalized with a non-penalized for the non-zero coefficients, but that's still logistic regression.
