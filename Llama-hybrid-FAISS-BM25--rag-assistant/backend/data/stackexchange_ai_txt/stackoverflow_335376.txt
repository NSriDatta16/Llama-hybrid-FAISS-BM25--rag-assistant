The problem is that it's not actually a redirect. When you type 'www.example.com' into your web browser, the browser generates an HTTP request like the following: GET / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 (i686-pc-cygwin) libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/ 0.9.8h zlib/1.2.3 libssh2/0.15-CVS Host: www.example.com Accept: */* Note that it's requesting a document named literally / . There are two possible responses by the server: HTTP/1.1 200 OK (more headers) Content... And HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Location: (location of redirect) (more headers) (Optional content) In Case #2, you can get the redirect location since it's actually a redirect. But in Case #1, the server is doing the redirection: it sees a request for / and instead serves up the content for whatever its index page is (e.g. index.html , index.php , default.aspx , etc.). As far as your browser is concerned, that's just the content for the document / . It doesn't know it's been redirected.
