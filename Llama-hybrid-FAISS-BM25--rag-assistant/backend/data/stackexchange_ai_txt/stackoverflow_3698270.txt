First off, it's impossible to tell without any source. "Out of memory" could be an infinite loop. I really don't know. But you state that you're " ... trying to execute PHP code. " In that case make sure that line 12 is really what you think it is. If you've got PHP and HTML in the same file remember that you're looking for line 12 on the client (i.e., in the rendered output), not in the PHP file. EDIT We don't need your PHP code. Actually we're only interested in the rendered output (i.e., the resulting mark-up - HTML & JavaScript - sent to the browser). If the error is caused by an included JS file, please post this file. Furthermore, a few comments on your question is worth noting. Not least @strager's comment; remove JS inclusions until the error disappears. This will probably help you identify the cause.
