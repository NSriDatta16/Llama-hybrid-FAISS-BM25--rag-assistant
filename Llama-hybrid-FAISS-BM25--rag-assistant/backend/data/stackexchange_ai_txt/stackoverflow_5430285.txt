It means that the compiler should pack struct/class/union members so that they're aligned on a 2-byte boundary. struct Foo { char c1; int i1; }; With pack(2), the struct will have: 1 byte for the char 1 unused byte, padding 4 bytes (assuming 32-bit) for the int Note that all pragmas are compiler specific - this one works on both VC and gcc though.
