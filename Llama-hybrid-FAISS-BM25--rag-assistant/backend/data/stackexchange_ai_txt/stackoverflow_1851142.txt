You can bind to any public property, so one option might be to have a property that simply returns the concatenated strings? Something Along the lines of : public string ConcatenatedValues { get { return wId1 + wId2 + wId3; } } And then bind to that. Would be interesting if there were a more elegant way, but this should get the job done.
