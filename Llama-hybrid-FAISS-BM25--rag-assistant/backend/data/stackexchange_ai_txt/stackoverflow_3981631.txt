Our family of Test Coverage tools can tell you which tests exercise which parts of the code, which is the basis for your answer. They can also tell you which tests need to be re-run, when you re-instrument the code base. In effect, it computes a diff on source files that it has already instrumented, rather than using commit diffs, but it achieves the effect you are looking for, IMHO.
