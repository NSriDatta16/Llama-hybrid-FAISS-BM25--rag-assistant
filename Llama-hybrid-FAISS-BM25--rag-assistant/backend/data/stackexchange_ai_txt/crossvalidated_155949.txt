Visualizing a regression with 1 DV and multiple IV

I am working on a paper, attempting to explain the effects of certain influences on terrorist organizations with regards to politicizing. Using VISREG I am able to create visualizations to depict each regression when I have 1 DV and 1 IV. When I attempt to visualize the script below, I get an error. Any suggestions? Also, I am very new to R and R studio. I have only been working with this program for 3 months. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. #Ended Through Politics model m5
