I would still stick with using a CNN for that specific application. Think about CNNs being used to detect various types of cancer in noisy images with an insane precision ( Stanford , Google ). This type of input is actually very similar to yours with cancer cells hiding in a cluster of healthy ones. And yet the models are performing as good as cancer experts in some cases. CNN have shown to work best when trained with a HUGE amount of data. If possible try to provide more training data with a decent class distribution (roughly the same number of positive and negative examples). Moreover, apart from tuning hyperparameters you could also experiment with different CNN architectures. You will fin plenty of inspiration in the litterature .
