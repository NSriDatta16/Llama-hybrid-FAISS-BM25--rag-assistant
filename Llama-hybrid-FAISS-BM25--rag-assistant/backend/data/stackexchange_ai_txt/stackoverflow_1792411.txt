using jquery, you can simply wrap the contents of a certain tag with HTML with the wrapInner function. If you put an inline element (span for example) around the contents of the paragraph $("p").wrapInner(" "); you would only need to apply the CSS to that certain inline element, for example like this. p span { background-color: black; color: white; } Using this solution there is no need to edit the HTML in any way.
