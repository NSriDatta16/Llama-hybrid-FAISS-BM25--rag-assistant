PCA compression: Am I supposed to center the data? Project the centered data or the original?

I am trying to use PCA to compress pictures and audio. For example in the case of audio, the audio is cut into blocks and then the blocks are fed into the data array as new cases. Question: The data matrix for PCA is generally centered, sometimes even normalized. For compression application, should this centering and normalization be done, given that I want to store the original data and not a transformed version? If the centering is applied should I project the centered data or the original data?
