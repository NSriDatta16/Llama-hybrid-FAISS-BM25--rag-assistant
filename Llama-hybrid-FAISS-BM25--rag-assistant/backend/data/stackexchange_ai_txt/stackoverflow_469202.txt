Best way to remove multiple items matching a predicate from a .NET Dictionary?

I need to remove multiple items from a Dictionary. A simple way to do that is as follows : List keystoremove= new List (); foreach (KeyValuePair k in MyCollection) if (k.Value.Member==foo) keystoremove.Add(k.Key); foreach (string s in keystoremove) MyCollection.Remove(s); The reason why I can't directly Remove the items in the foreach block is that this would throw an Exception ("Collection was modified...") I'd like to do the following : MyCollection.RemoveAll(x =>x.Member==foo) But the Dictionary<> class doesn't expose a RemoveAll(Predicate<> Match) method, like the List<> Class does. What's the best way (both performance wise and elegant wise) to do that?
