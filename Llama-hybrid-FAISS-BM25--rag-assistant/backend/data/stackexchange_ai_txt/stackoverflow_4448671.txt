Making things unselectable in IE

Here is my chart I've been writing in JS: http://jsfiddle.net/49FVb/ The css: -moz-user-select:none; -khtml-user-select: none; Works fine for Chrome/FF, but in IE all the elements are still selectable which looks weird when dragging the bars around. How can I make this unselectable in IE?
