Solution for long-term electricity prices forecasting

I'm trying to adopt a solution for long-term electricity annual prices forecasting (depending on past electricity prices, past oil prices, past consumption data, etc.) I'm considering some solutions: off-the-shelf specific software: Alyuda, Aleasoft, ... already-built modules of known software (Excel, MatLab, R): neuroXL for Excel, modules for Simulink, ... code from scratch (Python, R) by using known models and Machine Learning: scikit-learn, Weka, regression, ... I would like to find more solutions to test and, if possible, some experiences using them.
