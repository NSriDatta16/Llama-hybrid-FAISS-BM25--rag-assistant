I'm sure someone might whip out the MSIL analysis, but practically there is no discernible difference in execution or performance. The only thing you're affecting is the storage of an object reference. I say keep it clean and simple; declare the variable inside the loop. This provides the open/closed principle in practice, so you know the scope the variable is used and is not reused elsewhere. On the next loop, the variable loses scope and is reinitialized automatically.
