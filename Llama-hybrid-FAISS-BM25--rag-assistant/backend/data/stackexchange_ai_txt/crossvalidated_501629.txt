L2 regularization: large value of coefficient large variance overfitting

For the loss function with L2 regularization: $$Loss\ function + \lambda||w||^2_2.$$ I think following three things are equivalent with large probability: large estimation value of $w^i$ large estimation variance of $w^i$ large probability of overfitting. Is there any intuitive way to explain above conclusion? One way is from the Bayesian's point, L2 regularization corresponds the $(0,\sigma^2)$ -normal priority distribution of $w,$ to appear the large value, we need the large variance $\sigma^2.$ I cannot guarantee the statement is correct and definitely is not intuitive.
