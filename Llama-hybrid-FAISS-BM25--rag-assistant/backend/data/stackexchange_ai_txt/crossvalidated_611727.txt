Estimated standard deviation of a phenotype prevalence that is derived from several studies

I have allele frequencies from two independent studies Study Number Sample Allele 1 Freq Allele 2 Freq Allele 3 Freq A 20 .45 .475 .075 B 34 .72 .28 NA The weighted average of each allele frequency is as follows Allele 1 Freq avg: .62 Allele 2 Freq avg: .355 Allele 3 Freq avg: .075 The estimated diplotype frequency using hardy Weinberg equilibrium is: Allele 1/Allele 2: 2 * .62 * .355 = 0.4402 Allele 1/Allele 3: 2 * .62 * .075 = 0.093 Allele 2/Allele 3: 2 * .355 * .075 = 0.05325 Lets say that I know that: Allele 1/Allele 2 and Allele 1/Allele 3 are the only known diplotypes that can produce phenotype x Allele 2/Allele 3 is the only diplotype known to produce phenotype y Thus I estimate that the frequency of phenotype x is 0.4402 + 0.093 = 0.5332 and the frequency of phenotype y is 0.05325 . What I wonder is if I can compute the standard deviation of the phenotype estimates. Usually I would estimate this by âˆš[p(1-p)/n] where n is sample size and p is the population proportion, but I think it is a little weird here because of the missing data, not sure what value to use for n or if I can even do this. Any help is appreciated.
