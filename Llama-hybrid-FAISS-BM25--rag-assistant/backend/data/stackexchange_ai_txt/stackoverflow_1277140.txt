There's no such thing, directly. You would have to tell javascript to wake 'something' up after some time using setTimeout . This 'something' would be the code that you plan to execute after the sleep, of course. From an example I found on the internet : function dothingswithsleep( part ) { if( part == 0 ) { alert( "before sleep" ); setTimeout( function() { dothingswithsleep( 1 ); }, 1000 ); } else if( part == 1 ) { alert( "after sleep" ); } } But that's fragile design. You better rethink your business logic to really do something after a second: call a different function instead of using these contrived helper variables.
