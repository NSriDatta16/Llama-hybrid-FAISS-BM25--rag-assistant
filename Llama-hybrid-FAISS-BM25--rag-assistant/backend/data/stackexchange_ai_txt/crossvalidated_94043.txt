Asking if there's a correlation, and asking about the origin of that correlation are different. There's a (negative) correlation in the population between hair length and height. That's because of gender - women have longer hair (on average), women are shorter (on average). The fact that this is correlation is because both are causally related to gender is irrelevant to whether or not there's a correlation.
