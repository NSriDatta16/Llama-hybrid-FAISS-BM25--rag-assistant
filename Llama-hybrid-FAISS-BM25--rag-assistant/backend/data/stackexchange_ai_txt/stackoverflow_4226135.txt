PartCover 4.0 Only Reports NUnit Libraries

I'm using PartCover 4.0 (from the sourceforge page , latest dev build) with NUnit 2.5.8 on Windows 7 (x64). PartCover runs ok (using the -x86.exe), but it only shows me coverage for various NUnit packages -- not my own source-code. I originally didn't use CorFlags.exe since I didn't get the COM error; I tried it anyways, and it didn't make any difference. I've looked at all the other questions on Stack Overflow, and none seem to apply; I'm using PartCover 4.0, there are no spaces in any of my names, my coverage rule is the most broad ( +[*]* ), and I've run CorFlags.exe. What am I missing?
