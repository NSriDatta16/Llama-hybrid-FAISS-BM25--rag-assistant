The quantity and price of a good is a nice, simple, and hands-on example of what it means for variables to be "codetermined". I wrote this down mostly for my own benefit, but I think it is fairly relevant to post as an answer. Consider linear supply and demand $$ Q_D = (\alpha + u) + \beta P $$ $$ Q_S = (\gamma + v) + \delta P $$ , where $u$ and $v$ are independent random variables with mean zero. In other words, the intercepts of the supply and demand curves have a constant component and a random component and will therefore shift randomly up and down. The price that we observe ( $P^\star$ ) is determined in equilibrium $Q_D=Q_S$ $$ \alpha + \beta P^\star + u = \gamma + \delta P^\star + v $$ $$ P^\star = \frac{1}{\beta-\delta}\left(\gamma +v-\alpha-u \right) $$ If we regress $Q^\star$ on $P^\star$ , the regression has two interpretations. Either we are estimating the slope of the demand curve, in which case $$ \hat{\beta}_{OLS} \overset{p}{\to} \beta + \frac{Cov\left(P^\star, u \right)}{Var\left(P^\star\right)} = \beta + \left(\delta - \beta \right) \frac{Var(u)}{Var(u)+Var(v)} $$ or we are estimating the slope of the supply curve $$ \hat{\delta}_{OLS} \overset{p}{\to} \delta + \frac{Cov\left(P^\star, v \right)}{Var\left(P^\star\right)} = \delta - \left(\delta - \beta \right) \frac{Var(v)}{Var(u)+Var(v)} $$ Since theory dictates that $\beta and $\delta > 0$ , we know that we have a positively biased estimator for $\beta$ and a negatively biased estimator for $\delta$ . Alternatively, say that we are agnostic about what we are estimating and simply run the regression $$ Q^\star = \lambda + \theta P^\star + \varepsilon$$ ,then regardless of whether we consider $\varepsilon = u$ or $\varepsilon = v$ $$ \hat{\theta}_{OLS} \overset{p}{\to} \omega\delta + (1-\omega)\beta $$ $$ \omega = \frac{Var(u)}{Var(u)+Var(v)} $$ , the result will not correspond to any theoretical parameter of interest. Rather, a weighted average of the two parameters that we could potentially be interested in. It is evident that the bias disappears (we get something theoretically meaningful) only when either demand is constant, $Var\left(u\right)=0$ , or supply is constant, $Var\left(v\right)=0$ , since variation in the intercept of the one curve will trace the slope of the other. Here is a numerical example (note that the plot below, unlike usually, has quantity on the y-axis) alpha If we assume $u$ and $v$ are normally distributed, and draw a random sample of 100 observations we get something like this (here, I've added a $\pm1$ standard deviation band to the curves. For teaching purposes, we could also plot just a few observations and the equilibria that generated them). In this example, the bias we should get from simultaneity is bias_beta bias_beta [1] 1.2 > bias_delta [1] -10.8 > beta + bias_beta [1] -0.8 > delta + bias_delta [1] -0.8 We can simulate to confirm n mean(res$p) [1] -0.8003049
