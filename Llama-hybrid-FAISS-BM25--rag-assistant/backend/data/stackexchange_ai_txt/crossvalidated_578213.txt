Car rental time series forecasting

I have the time series of car rentals/demand in a location. The time axis is every hour for 3 months. The y-axis is number of car rentals/demand. I want to do prediction for future hours given this information. I would like to know the prediction models for this type of data. I am not sure about the performance of ARIMA or other time series predicion models given low values of car rentals at each hour (close to zero). The maximum is only 5 car rentals. What are the typical and high accuracy methods? It could be statistical or machine-learning based models.
