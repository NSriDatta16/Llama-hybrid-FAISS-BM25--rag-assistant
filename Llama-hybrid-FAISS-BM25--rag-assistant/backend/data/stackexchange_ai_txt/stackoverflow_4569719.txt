How is it Cloud storage if it's on your 2TB hard drive? Why do you think your own service will be more secure when accessible through the internet then a service run by people who specialized in doing it. I guess Amazon has probably more experience than anybody else in terms of HTTP accessible file storage (S3). If you want to make sure nobody can look at your stuff I suggest you look into encrypting it before saving it into S3. That would make it harder to access on the client side, because you always need the right tools to do the encryption stuff but that is the price you'd have to pay.
