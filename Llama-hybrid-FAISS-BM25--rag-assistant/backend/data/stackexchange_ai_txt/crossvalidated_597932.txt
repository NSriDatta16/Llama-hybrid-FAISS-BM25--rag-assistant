How do we know if the RMSE values are reliable?

The root-mean-squared error(RMSE) values should be close to zero. Although the optimal value of RMSE is known as 0, we can say that it is low when RMSE =10 for the data set with high average (let’s say 300-1000 in average). However, in a data set with a low average (such as 5, 7 etc), the value 2 may be low. How can an acceptable level of RMSE value be determined in this case? For example, is comparing the standard deviation(SD) with the RMSE using the right approach? Can an approach such as the following be proposed?: • SD/RMSE • SD/RMSE>0.5 is not acceptable??? I am curious about your opinion on this topic.
