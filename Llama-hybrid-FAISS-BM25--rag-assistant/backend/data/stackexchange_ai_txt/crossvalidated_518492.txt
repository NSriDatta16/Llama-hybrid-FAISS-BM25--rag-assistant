Are the important factors given by gradient boost more arbitrary compared to random forest

I compared the output from the two approaches using rfsrc() and gbm() in R respectively. The important factors given in the output from the two approaches are totally different. Since the importance of factors in gradient boost depends on the order of the trees, are they somewhat arbitrary? How do we interpret the important influencers from gbm()?
