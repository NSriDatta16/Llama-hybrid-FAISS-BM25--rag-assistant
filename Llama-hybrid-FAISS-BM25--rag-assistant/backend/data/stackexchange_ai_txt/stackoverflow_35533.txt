They are generally Electrical circuits that tend to pass parts of analog signals. High pass tends to transmit more of the high frequency parts and low pass tends to pass more of the low frequency parts. They can be simulated in software. A walking average can act as a low pass filter for instance and the difference between a walking average and it's input can work as a high pass filter.
