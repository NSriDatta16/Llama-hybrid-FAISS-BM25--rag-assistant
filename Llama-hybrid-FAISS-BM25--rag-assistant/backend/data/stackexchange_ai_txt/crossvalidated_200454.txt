Binary logistic regression: interpretation of explanatory variables

I have performed a binary logistic regression in R using the glm command and family=binomial. The dependent variable (DV) is not re-contracted = 0 or re-contracted = 1. The final model has 8 predictors. My question is regarding the interpretation of the regression coefficients. My understanding is that each regression coefficient indicates the change in the log odds of the DV due to a one unit change in the predictor variable with all other explanatory variables held constant. What does "all other explanatory variables held constant" mean? Are they held at their mean? If so, what does this mean for dichotomous predictors coded as 0 and 1? How are they held constant? Thank you in advance for your help.
