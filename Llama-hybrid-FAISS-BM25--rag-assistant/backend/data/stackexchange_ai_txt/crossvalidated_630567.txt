Factor Analysis: how to distinguish cross-loadings from correlated latent factors

Factor analysis can allow the factors to be correlated in 'oblique' rotations. But this seems underdetermined. How would (explanatory) factor analysis distinguish the two cases below (using the data only, not bringing any background knowledge about the items? Case 1: "items A and B are both caused by factors 1 and 2" and Case 2: "Item A is caused by factor 1 only and B by factor 2 only, but factors 1 and 2 are positively correlated"? Fwiw I've asked ChatGPT several times, e.g., here and it doesn't seem to come to a consistent answer, sometimes 'admitting' that it is 'hard to distinguish' these cases. This is important for me because I come from an econometric and causal inference background, not a psychometrics background, and I am struggling to understand what factor analysis adds to principle component analysis.
