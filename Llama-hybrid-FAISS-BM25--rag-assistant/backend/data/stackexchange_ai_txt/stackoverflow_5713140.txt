How to restrict the drag and drop area in a canvas

I have a canvas,lets say of dimensions 500x600.I have some controls inside that canvas.User can rearrange the controls by drag and drop.But I want to restrict the drag and drop within that canvas. For example:There is a button in the canvas.User can drag and drop the button anywhere inside the canvas.But if the user tries to drag the button out of the canvas boundaries,it should stick in the canvas boundary. How to achieve this?
