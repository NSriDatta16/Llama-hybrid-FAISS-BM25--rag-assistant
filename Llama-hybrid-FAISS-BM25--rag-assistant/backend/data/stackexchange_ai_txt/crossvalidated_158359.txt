The problem that you have in hand is called outlier detection in time series in analysis. There are three three major forms of outliers: Level Shifts (permanent shift in the level of series) Additive Outliers (temporary outlier pulse) Temporary Changes. There are several methods and tools that will be able to do this. Two classic approaches within ARIMA framework are: Tsay's Approach Chen and Liu's Approach Chen and Liu's approach is implemented in tsoutliers package in R. Other software packages such as SPSS/SAS/Autobox have automatic outlier detection algorithms. Below is an example in R and tsoutliers package using a dummy data similar to your example and the sample data plot is from expsmooth package: library(expsmooth) library(tsoutliers) data Running the above code, the tsoutlier package was able to identify inflection point at 13 and 37. See below for the results and plots. Series: data ARIMA(1,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 intercept LS13 LS37 -0.2834 266.9890 52.0028 -75.9691 s.e. 0.1044 4.5006 5.5221 3.8625 sigma^2 estimated as 386.3: log likelihood=-369.41 AIC=748.83 AICc=749.6 BIC=760.98 Outliers: type ind time coefhat tstat 1 LS 13 2001:01 52.00 9.417 2 LS 37 2003:01 -75.97 -19.668 You could also try structural time series analysis such as Unobserved Components Model, which can detect outliers and level shifts in data.
