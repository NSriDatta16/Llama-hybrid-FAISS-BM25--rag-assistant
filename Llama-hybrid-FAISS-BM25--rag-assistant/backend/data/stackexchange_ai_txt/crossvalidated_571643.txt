There's a simple solution assuming the conjugate Poisson-Gamma model. Sprints have fixed lengths, you are counting the number of done stories per those intervals, so this can be modeled using the Poisson distribution . Gamma is a conjugate prior for Poisson, so if your counts $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ from $n$ sprints follow the Poisson distribution with unknown rate $\lambda$ $$ X_i \sim \mathcal{P}(\lambda) $$ then you can assume the Gamma prior for $\lambda$ with hyperparameters $\alpha$ for the count assumed a priori $16 \times 5$ and $\beta$ for the assumed number of sprints $5$ . In such a case, the posterior distribution for $\lambda$ follows the Gamma distribution $$\begin{align} \alpha' &= \alpha + \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\ \beta' &= \beta+n \\ \lambda &\sim \mathcal{G}\big(\alpha',~\beta'\big) \end{align}\tag{1}$$ with expected value $$ E[\lambda] = \frac{\alpha'}{\beta'} = \frac{16 \times 5 + 8 + 8 + 12}{5 + 3} = 13.5 $$ But that's "on average", while you are interested in the posterior predictive distribution of the $X_i$ counts, that is negative binomial with parameters $$ \tilde X | X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n \sim \mathcal{NB}\big(\alpha', \tfrac{\beta'}{1+\beta'} \big) $$ It has the same mean as the posterior, but a bigger variance. To learn the upper and lower bounds, just check the quantile function. > qnbinom(c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95), (16 * 5 + 8 + 8 + 12), (5 + 3)/(1 + 5 + 3)) [1] 7 13 20 There's 5% chance that the team would be doing not more than 5 stories per spring and 95% chance that it would be no more than 20 stories, with the median and average around 13 stories. If you need to do 80 stories, this gives between 4 and 11 sprints: > 80 / qnbinom(c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95), (16 * 5 + 8 + 8 + 12), (5 + 3)/(1 + 5 + 3)) [1] 11.428571 6.153846 4.000000 Given the simple update rule (1) between previous estimates $\alpha, \beta$ , and the newly observed counts, this can be updated each time the new data arrives. Finally, with statistical software, you can easily run a Monte Carlo simulation to find out what is the chance that you'll manage to the 80 stories in 5 sprints, by simulating the five draws from the negative binomial distribution. > mean(replicate(100000, sum(rnbinom(5, (16 * 5 + 8 + 8 + 12), (5 + 3)/(1 + 5 + 3))) >= 80)) [1] 0.0868 and it's around 9%. As you can see, most of the math is rather straightforward and things like expected values can be calculated using pen and paper, but for the quartiles (the worst 5% case) you would need statistical software.
