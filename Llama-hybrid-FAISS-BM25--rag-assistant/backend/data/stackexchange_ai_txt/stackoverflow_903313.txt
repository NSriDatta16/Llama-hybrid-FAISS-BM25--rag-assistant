How many is a "large" data set?

Assumed infinite storage where size/volume/physics (metrics,gigabytes/terrabytes) won't matter only the number of elements and their labels, statistically pattern should emerge already at 30 subsets, but can you agree that less than 1000 subsets is too little to test, and at least 10000 distinct subsets / "elements", "entries" / entities is "a large data set". Or larger? Thanks
