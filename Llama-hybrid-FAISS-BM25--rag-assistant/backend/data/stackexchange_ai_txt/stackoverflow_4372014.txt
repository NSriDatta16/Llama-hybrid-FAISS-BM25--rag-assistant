If you are considering using Django as your framework, here are just some basic points about it you might find helpful to consider: Firstly, the Django libraries are written in Python. Therefore, at least a basic knowledge of python is required to develop a site using Django. Secondly, Django includes its own template system that is useful for integrating with html - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/ . Thridly, as you've stated that you are more concerned with data models (which I am assuming means you are going to want to store information in some way especially considering it is related to social networking ?) Django also provides for a way to integrate with databases like MySQL and SQLite and the tutorial even walks you through how to set one up if you haven't already - http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter05/ - and how to integrate with a legacy database if you have - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/legacy-databases/?from=olddocs . Lastly, Django enables you to run your site off of their development server which can be really useful for testing and running your site locally before deploying it to the web via Apache or another web server of your choosing - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#the-development-server . I would really encourage you to do the online tutorial - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/ - or take a look at Holovaty and Moss's "The Definitive Guide To Django" (available on http://www.djangobook.com/ ). Hope this helps!
