Closed-form expression for autocovariance of random walk with drift

I am working through slides hosted at Basic Time Series Models , and am not sure how to mathematically derive a closed-form expression of the autocovariance of the "random walk with drift" model. The model specification is $x_t = \delta + x_{t-1} + w_t$ with $E[w_t] = 0$, $var(w_t) = \sigma^2 Autocovariance is given as $\gamma(t, t + h) = E[(x_t - \mu_t)(x_{t+h} - \mu_{t+h})]$. After algebraic manipulation, I am able to represent autocovariance as $E[(x_tx_{t+h} - x_t(t+h)\delta - x_{t+h}t\delta + (t^2+th)\delta]$, but I don't see how to reach the suggested closed-form expression $\gamma(t, t + h) = (t+1)\sigma^2$. NOTE: This is not homework. I am attempting to learn time series modeling and forecasting on my own time.
