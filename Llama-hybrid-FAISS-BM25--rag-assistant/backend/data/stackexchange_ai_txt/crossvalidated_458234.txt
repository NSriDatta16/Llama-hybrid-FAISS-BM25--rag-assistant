"Why is this variance reduction considered as a bad thing?" As an oversimplified example: imagine, for a moment, that you have an extremely small economy on an island somewhere, with just 5 people. Their Annual Incomes are as follows: Person 1: ♦10,000 Person 2: ♦10,000 Person 3: ♦12,000 Person 4: ♦13,000 Person 5: ♦25,000 A car company seeking to "break into the market" decide to price their vehicles based on the Average Annual Earnings. Mean: ♦14,000 Median: ♦12,000 Mode: ♦10,000 As you can see, using the Mode could exclude 80% of the population from buying their product, which makes it a very bad choice for building a business case!
