I do not use Word for this when I can avoid it. It's simply not very good at keeping the formatting and doesn't provide really good-looking prints. The line-breaking isn't program-aware. The paragraph breaking isn't program aware. The keeping of the formatting from VS doesn't do structure-based markup, does it? The typesetting engine of Word is a lot worse than TeX or Quark/Indesign
