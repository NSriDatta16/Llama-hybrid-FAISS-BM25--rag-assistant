It depends on what the SmartPointer does on destruction. If you can specify free as a deallocator, that could work. For example, boost::shared_ptr allows you to specify a deleter. I didn't pay enough attention to your reason for wanting this. I agree with the other answers that using the nothrow new is a much better idea.
