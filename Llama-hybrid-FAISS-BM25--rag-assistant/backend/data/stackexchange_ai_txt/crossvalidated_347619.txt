Section 3 in the LightGBM paper is valid for the MSE loss function for which hessians reduce to 1. In that case the formula from Definition 3.1. coincides with formulas (6) and (7) from the XGBoost paper (where they are derived in an understandable way). Also, you can find in the LightGBM code (goss.php, line 110) that in GOSS data instances are actually sorted with respect to gradients multiplied by hessians, not gradients (as written in the paper), which are the same for MSE only.
