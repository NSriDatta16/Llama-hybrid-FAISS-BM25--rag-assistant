Firstly, make sure you know about the behaviour of ThreadStatic in ASP.NET applications: http://piers7.blogspot.com/2005/11/threadstatic-callcontext-and_02.html The same thread that started your request may not be the same thread that finishes it. Basically the only safe way of storing Thread local storage in ASP.NET applications is inside HttpContext. The next obvious approach would be to creat a wrapper client to manage your WCF client proxy and ensure each IO request is thread safe using locks. Although my personal preference would be to use a pool of proxy clients. Whenever you need one pop it off the pool queue and when you're finished with it put it back on.
