If I were your manager, and heard your argument (above), I'd assume that you're just resistant to change. I'd challenge you to show me the data. You haven't really made a case against virtualization. You say that your product "was not designed to be run in a virtual environment". You're in good company, very few apps ARE designed that way. It usually "just works". And if it's too slow, they just throw more resources at it. If they need to move it, make it fault tolerant, expand or contract, it's all transparent. Poorly-behaved apps can be firewalled from other environments, without having to have dedicated hardware. etc., etc.,. What's not to like about that? You should prepare a better argument, backed up with data from testing. Or you should prepare to be steamrolled by an organization with a lot of time, $$$, and momentum invested in (insert favorite technology here).
