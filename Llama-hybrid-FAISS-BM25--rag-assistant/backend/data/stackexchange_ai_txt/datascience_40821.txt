Random Forest are built by using decision trees, which are sensitive to the distribution of the classes. Other than stratification method, you can use oversampling, undersampling or use greater weights to the less frequent class to mitigate this effect. A detailed response you can study is in Cross Validated . You might want to consider other metrics to measure your classification model other than accuracy, since your data are really unbalanced.
