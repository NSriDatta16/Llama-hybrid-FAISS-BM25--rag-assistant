Multivariate time series forecasting with the extended Theta method

I am looking for an implementation (better if in Python) of the extended Theta method for multivariate time series forecasting, presented in the following paper: D. Thomakos, K. Nikolopoulos, Forecasting Multivariate Time Series with the Theta Method, J. Forecast. 34, 220â€“229 (2015) Any suggestion?
