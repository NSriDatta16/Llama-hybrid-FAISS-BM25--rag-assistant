Adding on the previous answer, when solving the problem, you get the values for $\alpha_{i}$, that is, you know which samples are the support vectors, and the offset $b$. But also you are talking about implementing SVMs. Generally, you do not want to ask for those parameters, as a user, but: for a given sample, what label does the SVM assign to it? what are the support vectors? the value of the decision function. This gives you the margin plus the sign (depending on what side of the hyperplane the sample lies), and can be use to generate confidence values for the predictions of the SVM.
