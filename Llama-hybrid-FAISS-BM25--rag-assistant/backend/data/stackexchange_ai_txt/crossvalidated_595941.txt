Logistic regression: How to improve the pseudo-$R^2?$

Firstly, I would like to ask you opinion about my model: I have a logistic regression model where the dependent variable is late payments (1=late/0=not late) and diesel prices and interest rates as the independent variables. I have checked for the VIF factor which less than 2 for each feature. These give p-values 0.000. Secondly, would anyone know how could I improve the model? The pseudo $R^2$ value is just $0.02511.$ My goal is to find explanatory variables that could explain the late payments, and I tried several others, but they resulted with high VIF scores.
