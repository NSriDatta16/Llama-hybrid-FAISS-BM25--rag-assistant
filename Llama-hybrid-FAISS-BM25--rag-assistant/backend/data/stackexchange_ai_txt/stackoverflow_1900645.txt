I can't pin point the exact answer, but Unhandled Error in Silverlight 2 Application Value does not fall within the expected range is going to be a reference (probably binding) to an item that does not exist. If the lists are dynamic perhaps the Visual Tree does not have a reference to the item you are dragging? You might get over this using an MVVM pattern, and binidng your lists to ObservableCollection properties in your VM. Can you post a more complete code repro?
