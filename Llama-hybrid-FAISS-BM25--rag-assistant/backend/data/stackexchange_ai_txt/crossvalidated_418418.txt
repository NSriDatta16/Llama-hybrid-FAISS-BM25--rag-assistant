The transition to Q-methods : SARSA, Q-Learning, Expected SARSA is unclear to me. Which gaps is filled by Q-methods, what is the rational behind their use rather than TD methods ? There isn't really such a thing as "Q methods" in the sense that you are using it. All of SARSA, Q-learning and Expected SARSA are TD methods. Specifically they are using TD approach in the context of action values , which is necessary for value based model-free control problems, because if you just used state values $V(s)$ then you have no way to generate your best guess at the optimal policy. Using $Q(s,a)$ immediately gives you $\pi(s) = \text{max}_a Q(s,a)$ . Model-free Monte Carlo control likewise must use estimates of $Q(s,a)$ which is why there is not really a clear class of methods called "Q methods", although it is a matter of convention what all these things are called and they are all inter-related in any case.
