Global Minimum solution for the Generator step in the original GAN formulation

I am going through the proof in Goodfellow's original GAN paper . Specifically, I'm at the stage where he did the discriminator step (solve a maximization problem) and now he is doing the generator step, that is $\min_{G} C(G)$ which is $\min_GV(G,D^{*})$ . He nicely shows that $p_g=p_{data}$ achieves the minimal value, $-\log(4)$ . I get the proof. But then for fun I try to evaluate $C(G)$ with choosing $p_g := 0.5 \cdot p_{data} $ . So, plugging that into $$ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}} \lbrack \log{ \frac{p_{data}}{p_{data}+p_g}}\rbrack + \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{g}} \lbrack \log{ \frac{p_{g}}{p_{data}+p_g}}\rbrack $$ we get $$ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}} \lbrack \log{ \frac{p_{data}}{p_{data}+0.5\cdot p_{data}}}\rbrack + \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{g}} \lbrack \log{ \frac{0.5\cdot p_{data}}{p_{data}+0.5\cdot p_{data}}}\rbrack = $$ $$ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}} \lbrack \log{ \frac{1}{1.5}}\rbrack + \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{g}} \lbrack \log{ \frac{0.5}{1.5}}\rbrack = \log{\frac{2}{3}}+\log{\frac{1}{3}} = $$ $$= -1.5041 ( So it seems to me that if the generator optimizes for $p_g =0.5 \cdot p_{data} $ it actually achieves a better minimum for the target of the minimization problem. To add further to my confusion, I ran the numbers in MATLAB (ignoring the expectation since I assume I'm taking it in a way such that $p_{data}$ cancels out, like before) and got the $-\log4$ is actually the maximum and not the minimum. [x,y] = meshgrid(0.01:0.001:1); f = log(x./(x+y))+log(y./(x+y)); max(max(f)) ans = -1.3863 min(min(f)) ans = -4.6251 I'll add that in my numerical experiment, the minimum was indeed achieved along the axis $x=y$ . The minimum there collapses to the boundaries. Why is this problem somehow minus-flipped in my head? I mean, we are trying to minimize it and not maximize it. I follow the proof that it is a global minima, so I don't see why am I getting lower values. is my choice somehow not permitted? Thanks.
