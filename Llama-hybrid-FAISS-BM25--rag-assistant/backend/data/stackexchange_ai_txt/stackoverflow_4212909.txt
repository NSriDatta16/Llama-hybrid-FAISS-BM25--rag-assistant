Can CSS force a line break after each word in an element?

I'm building a multilingual site, with the owner helping me with some translations. Some of the displayed phrases need line breaks to maintain the style of the site. Unfortunately, the owner isn't a computer guy, so if he sees foo bar there's the chance he'll modify the data somehow as he's translating. Is there a CSS solution (besides changing the width) to apply to an element which would break after every word? (I know I can do this in PHP, but I'm wondering if there's a nifty trick I don't know about in CSS to accomplish the same thing, perhaps in the CJK features.) EDIT I'll attempt to diagram what's happening: ---------------- ---------------- | Short Word | | Gargantuan | | | | Word | ---------------- ---------------- The long word breaks automatically, the short word doesn't. I want it to look like this: ---------------- ---------------- | Short | | Gargantuan | | Word | | Word | ---------------- ----------------
