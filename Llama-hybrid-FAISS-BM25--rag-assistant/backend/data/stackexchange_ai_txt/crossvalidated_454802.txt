Batch Bayesian linear model learning with multivariate normal distribution

I have multivariate normal distribution (MVN) and Bayesian linear model based on it. I understand what's going on here: So I have a posterior x|y , where from prior knowledge x and observation y I estimate e. g. location of point from radar echo (posterior). I used sequential update, i. e. using posterior after first estimation as a prior for the next one, and so on for all observations (with a simple for loop). I have to get an equation for batch update and prove it, i. e. use all observations at once (as a vector of e. g. radar echos). I've only managed to get recursive formula, which I think is still sequential (and probably even more ineffective than a loop): Sigma_0 = Sigma_x u_0 = u_x Sigma_(x|y)_n = [Sigma_(x|y)_(n-1) + (Sigma_y)^(-1)]^(-1) u_(x|y)_n = Sigma_(x|y)_n * [(Sigma_y)^(-1) * y + Sigma_(x|y)_(n-1) * u_x] Can you give me equation or some hints for the batch form? I know I'm missing some small detail here. I want to prove it through induction.
