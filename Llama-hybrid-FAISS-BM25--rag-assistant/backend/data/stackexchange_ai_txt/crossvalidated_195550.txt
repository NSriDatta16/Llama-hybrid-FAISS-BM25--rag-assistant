Ranking features in logistic regression

I used Logistic Regression. I have six features, I want to know the important features in this classifier that influence the result more than other features. I used Information Gain but it seems that it doesn't depend on the used classifier. Is there any method to rank the features according to their importance based on specific classifier (like Logistic Regression)? any help would be highly appreciated.
