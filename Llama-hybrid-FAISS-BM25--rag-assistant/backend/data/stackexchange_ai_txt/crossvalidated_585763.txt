Accuracy of coefficients on log-linear regressiosn

Consider the following two regression models using data from the table below. $ln(wage)=\beta_0+\beta_1 female+u$ $ln(wage)=\gamma _0+\gamma_1 male+v$ wage female male 10 1 0 20 1 0 30 1 0 40 1 0 50 1 0 15 0 1 30 0 1 45 0 1 60 0 1 75 0 1 I believe $\beta_1$ in the first model can be interpreted as the percent by which average wages differ for female employees relative to male employees. Likewise, $\gamma_1$ in the second model can be interpreted as the percent by which average wages differ for male employees relative to female employees. The estimates for $\beta_1$ and $\gamma_1$ using OLS are $-0.4055$ and $0.4055$ respectively. Here is my source of confusion. In this dataset, females have an average wage of $\$30$ and males have an average wage of $\$45$ . This means that men on average earn $50\%$ more than women (not $40.55\%$ more) and females earn $33\%$ less than men (not $40.55\%$ less). Why is there such a great discrepancy between the OLS estimates and estimates using the means for male and female wage? Are my interpretations for $\beta_1$ wrong, or is there something else I do not understand about this regression method?
