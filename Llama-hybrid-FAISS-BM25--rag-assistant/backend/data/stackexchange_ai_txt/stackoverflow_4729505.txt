Any solution to this problem must run in Ω(n) time and make Ω(n) comparisons, since if this isn't the case for some sufficiently large array you wouldn't be able to look at all the elements to check that they have the same value. Doing a linear scan of the array looking for any values different from the first one is perhaps the absolute best way to solve this problem. It makes a total of (n - 1) comparisons, which asymptotically matches the lower bound, and is both elegant and easy to implement.
