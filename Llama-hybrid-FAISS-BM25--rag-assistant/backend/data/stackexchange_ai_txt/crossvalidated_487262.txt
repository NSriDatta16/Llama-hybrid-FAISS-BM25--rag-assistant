It depends on your modelling goals: if you are thinking of causal inference then in the first model, you are either estimating the effect of the average results in other subjects while controlling for the possible confounder (or competing exposure) Gender; or you are estimating the effect of Gender on the outcome, while controlling for the possible confounder (or competing exposure) of average results in other subjects. In the 2nd model you are estimating the effect of Gender on the difference in results if you are only interested in prediction, then you are predicting different things, although it is easy to see that the predictions in both models are related, so you could argue that they are essentially the same.
