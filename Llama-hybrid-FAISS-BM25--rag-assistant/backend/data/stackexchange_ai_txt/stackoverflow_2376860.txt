Hmm. This is almost certainly a bug. I would encourage you to file it as one; I certainly will. I tried to come up with a sample app to test this and I confirmed the behavior you’re seeing. Interestingly enough, in the UITabBarControllerDelegate protocol, there is this method: - (BOOL)tabBarController:(UITabBarController *)tabBarController shouldSelectViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController But that method isn’t called when you select a view controller from the “More” tab bar item. For now, the only way I can see this working is if you remove view controllers that would appear in the “More” view controller, therefore making them impossible to select by virtue of not being present.
