Clustering a binary matrix

I have a semi-small matrix of binary features of dimension 250k x 100. Each row is a user and the columns are binary "tags" of some user behavior e.g. "likes_cats". user 1 2 3 4 5 ... ------------------------- A 1 0 1 0 1 B 0 1 0 1 0 C 1 0 0 1 0 I would like to fit the users into 5-10 clusters and analyze the loadings to see if I can interpret groups of user behavior. There appears to be quite a few approaches to fitting clusters on binary data - what do we think might be the best strategy for this data? PCA Making a Jaccard Similarity matrix, fitting a hierarchical cluster and then using the top "nodes". K-medians K-medoids Proximus ? Agnes So far I've had some success with using hierarchical clustering but I'm really not sure it's the best way to go.. tags = read.csv("~/tags.csv") d = dist(tags, method = "binary") hc = hclust(d, method="ward") plot(hc) cluster.means = aggregate(tags,by=list(cutree(hc, k = 6)), mean)
