What may be more useful is to not pad (you can pad, whatever gives you better results but padding will mess with your features) your series and use libraries like tsfresh tsfel (python) to extract numerous features from each series and cluster on those with DBSCAN. Seems like you care a lot about trend so you could also just extract a few important features yourself like linear trend, maybe a coefficient or two of a second order polynomial regression, average, a max and min value and so on if you care a lot about them visually being close.
