The thing that tends to make a differences average size of source file. Some lanuages and coding styles tend to lead to 10000+ line code files. In that case, you absolutely need a merge-based, branching tool. With smaller code files, there is much less chance someone else will be making an unrelated change in the same file, and so a tool/policy that works mostly by locking, with only occasional merges, works well.
