If $\alpha + \beta t$ are not random then $y_t$ is a completely deterministic function (i.e. this is just some line with intercept $\alpha$ and slope $\beta$. The next equation is also not random (as long as $\beta$ and the initial value $y_0$ is not random) The next set of equations are what people might more typically refer to as regression and time series regression respectively.
