Where to start debugging, when you get the "Activity is not responding, Force Close, Wait"?

I have worked on a simple application. It application includes diffrent levels that can be solved by placing some components inside a canvas, dragging them to the right place and so on. The application is working fine, but when trying it on my HTC Desire 2.2, I sometimes get the warning message: Sorry: Activity xxxxx is not respoding. Force Close - Wait If I press the wait-button and let it be for some seconds (up to ~30 sec sometimes), then it runs without any problems. I donÂ´t know where I should start debugging the code, since it happenes only once in a while. I have read the stuff in google developer site and it was just mostly very general stuff that did not really help. any ideas? since, I was not able to debug the problem myself, I am going to post the most important parts of the application. Please check and let me know If I need to post more classes. //Evrything else Bitmap bitmap; GraphicObject.Coordinates coords; for (GraphicObject graphic : _graphics) { bitmap = graphic.getGraphic(); coords = graphic.getCoordinates(); canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, coords.getX(), coords.getY(), null); } // draw current graphic at last... if (_currentGraphic != null) { bitmap = _currentGraphic.getGraphic(); coords = _currentGraphic.getCoordinates(); canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, coords.getX(), coords.getY(), null); }
