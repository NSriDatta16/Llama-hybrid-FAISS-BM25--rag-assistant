Convert continues number to integer number in optimization algorithms in MATLAB

I'm using a continuous optimization algorithm for optimizing neural network's number of neurons in first and second layers besides feature selection so I used this structure for converting continues output (between 0 and 1) to positive integer values in MATLAB: Neuron_Layer_I=(min(floor(1+21*Neuron1),21))+3; For example in above equation Neuron1 is output of optimization algorithm so if we have 0 for Neuron1 , number of neurons in first layer is 3 and if we have 1 for Neuron1 , number of neurons in first layer is 24 . I have [0 24] range for second layer too. My questions : Is this equation is best equation for converting my values? My system tendency is toward using 24 neurons in first layer and 24 neurons for second layer. when I change (decrease or increase) ranges for number of neurons in layer 1 and layer 2 my system tendency is toward maximum values of that ranges. Why? I have a binary classification problem and using patternnet function in MATLAB. I'm using Imperialistic Competitive Algorithm (ICA) for optimization. Some times ago I have optimization of early stopping (max iterations) in my system besides this structure and the best early stopping max iteration was towards maximum optimization rage as we discoursed above, so I removed it. Now I have same problem with number of neurons. Besides above questions, What is your recommendation for improving my system. My system doesn't have a specific sample-size, In my testing cases it is between 200~700 . This is a financial problem. Thanks.
