What mean should I use when few big values?

for a project I need to calculate several means, I then compare each of these means to a distribution under the null hypothesis H0. However sometimes some values (few) are much larger than all the other values, so if I use a basic arithmetic mean these values will greatly impact the final mean . Here is an example Here if I do an arithmetic mean I get about 90, while in reality we can see that the vast majority of values on the axis are around 50. Do you have an idea of an average that would be used in this kind of case?
