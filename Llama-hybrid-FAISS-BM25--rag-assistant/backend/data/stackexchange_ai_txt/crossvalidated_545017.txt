Rationale behind ignoring the "denomintator" in Bayes Rule

In the context of MCMC sampling, we often say that the posterior distribution is only proportional to the numerator of Bayes Law. We tend to say that the "denominator" (i.e. the normalizing constant) is irrelevant. Just to clarify, is this because the denominator term in theory is a "constant number" (i.e. a scalar), and the likelihood when multipled by a scalar doesn't really change anything? Or is there another reason? Thanks
