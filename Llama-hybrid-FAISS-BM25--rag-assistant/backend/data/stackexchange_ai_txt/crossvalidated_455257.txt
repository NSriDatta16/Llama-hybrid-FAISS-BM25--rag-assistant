The simple answer to your question is that you pick an $\alpha$ , pick a method to correct for multiple testing (Bonferroni in your case), and then report the tests with adjusted p-values at it below $\alpha$ as giving significant results. In more complicated forms of adjustments, you will not be in the situation where you can just divide $\alpha$ by the number of tests and compare that value to the test p-values, so the p.adjust function adjusts the p-values for you to compare to compare to an unadjusted $\alpha$ . Iâ€™ll add to this as we discuss in the comments to your question, but that first paragraph (sentence) tells you how to perform your tests.
