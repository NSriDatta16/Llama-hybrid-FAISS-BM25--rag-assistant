If you absolutely wanted this to be triggered, I would only have the trigger just queue an action in a table which was monitored by a maintenance job, since a trigger should not, in general, perform extended operations - they should get there stuff done and return control so that the transaction can complete or fail as quickly as possible. Note that there are situations where triggers have gotten disabled and you would not be able to have your maintenance run. If someone drops your trigger it might not be as obvious as a job which isn't showing up on a regular report. I would recommend a job run by the SQL Server Agent regularly looking for situations where it needs to take action performing the actions and reporting them appropriately to whatever reports or system management software you are using.
