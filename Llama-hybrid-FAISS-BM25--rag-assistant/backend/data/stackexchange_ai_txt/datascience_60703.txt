How to treat Compass data in random forest regression

I'm working on a project where two of the features are entryHeading and exitHeading. Both state the direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W) of a vehicle at multiple points. My question is how would i go about pre-processing this? My first thought would be to circularize it like I would a 24 hour period but I'm not sure I should go about it in the same way. The data will eventually be used to train a Random forest regression
