The IMDB ratings example is a simple one, so you are right that in many cases they get more complicated. Actually, the answer to your question is already given in the Wikipedia entry : Note that $W$ is just the weighted arithmetic mean of $R$ and $C$ with weight vector $(v, m)$. As the number of ratings surpasses $m$, the confidence of the average rating surpasses the confidence of the prior knowledge, and the weighted bayesian rating ($W$) approaches a straight average ($R$). The closer $v$ (the number of ratings for the film) is to zero, the closer $W$ gets to $C$, where $W$ is the weighted rating and $C$ is the average rating of all films. So, in simpler terms, films with very few ratings/votes will have a rating weighted towards the average across all films, while films with many ratings/votes will have a rating weighted towards its average rating. So in the formula $$ W = {Rv + Cm\over v+m} $$ $m$ is prior information or belief . Saying it in plain English: by default the movies are rated closer to overall average of votes for all of the movies $C$, but as they grab more votes, they get closer and closer to average of their votes $R$. By specifying $m$ you decide about the threshold. There is no "good", or "bad" choices since it is a subjective choice based on how heavy you want the overall average $C$ to weight on your estimate. You simply state that one real vote counts as $1/m$ pseudo-votes based on overall average. It is called prior because it is based on a priori , out-of-data information -- it may be based on your beliefs, some previous experiments that suggest so, expert opinions, etc. It is one of the core aspects of Bayesian approach that you include such out-of-data information in your model. There is simply no objective criterion saying something like "4 ratings are not trustworthy, but 5 are", stating something like this would be ridiculous, so you are forced to make some arbitrary decision on it. This estimator is designed to have threshold that can be flexibly adapted to your needs. For example, if your site has on average 1000 ratings per item, you do not want to threat items with 5, 10, or even 100 ratings as equally reliable as the majority. Of course, you can always try to find optimal $m$ that maximizes some optimality criterion, e.g. correlation of ratings with movie theater's ticket sales, but then it would be hard to call it prior since it'd be just some unknown parameter to maximize. Then it also wouldn't be a Bayesian estimator. If the subjective aspect of this method does not appeal to you, you can always use arithmetic mean of the ratings, i.e. $m=0$. This does not use any arbitrary threshold.
