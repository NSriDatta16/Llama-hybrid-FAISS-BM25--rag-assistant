Unfortunately, temperature depends upon much more than latitude; elevation counts for a whole lot, as well as forestation and nearby bodies of water and local geography. Similarly with rainfall, which depends enormously upon local geography, for example, the Hoh rainforest in Olympic National Park gets ~150 inches of rain a year, but 30 miles due east gets ~15 inches of rain a year. Having said that, if you have a collection of particular sites, you could try fitting a cosine with period 1 year to a multiyear series of daily mean temperatures - different fits for each site. I recall I did something like this some years ago, and it worked pretty well. IIRC, the minimum temperature date (the point at which the argument to the cos function should equal $\pi$) is Jan 7th over pretty much the entire U.S., including Alaska, but you should estimate this too. Something like this: $Temp_i = a + b*cos(c + 2*\pi * i/365.25)+e_i$ where $i = 1$ on Jan. 1 and 365 (or 366) on Dec. 31. The $a$ and $b$ coefficients will vary with location. $a$ will be the mean annual temperature at the location, and $b$ will equal, more or less, 1/2 the difference between the average max and average min temperatures. Something like this may provide you with a model that will allow you to remove the systematic component due to earth tilt and the varying distance of the earth from the sun (minor) of temperature at a given site. Of course, the errors will be autocorrelated due to persistence of local weather patterns, e.g., high pressure systems. Also of course, it doesn't really help with your stated goal, but may get you part way towards your underlying objective.
