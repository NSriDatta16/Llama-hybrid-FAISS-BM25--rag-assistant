Any page that doesn't have it's content stashed away in Flash or similar is SEO'able. The web crawlers tend to strip everything and read the page as a text stream. Some pay attention to your keywords, their use in the body text, H1 & H2 tags, page title and even domain name but I don't think they are affected by the order of page structure.
