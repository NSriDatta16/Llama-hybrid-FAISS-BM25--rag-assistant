Is it correct to retrieve Model data in a View, or just in the Controller?

I have an MVC application and I typically have the controller pass everything needed by the view. But when my views are nested inside of other views it's a pain to have to forward these variables on to the nested view. Is that just how it is, or should I allow my partials/fragments nested inside my views retrieve data from the Model? As an example, I have a list of states that I use in several nested partials/fragments. I have to pass this list through my views every time I want to use them only on nested partials/fragments in those views. Seems like it's prone to error and it feels not very DRY.
