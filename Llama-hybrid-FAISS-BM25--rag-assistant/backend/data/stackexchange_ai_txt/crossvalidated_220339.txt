Your data basically cannot be learned with an RNN trained that way. Your input is $\sin(t)$ is $2\pi$-periodic $\sin(t) = \sin(t+2\pi)$ but your target $\sin(t/2)$ is $4\pi$-periodic and $\sin(t/2) = -\sin(t+2\pi)$ Therefore, in your dataset you'll have pairs of identical inputs with opposite outputs. In terms of Mean Squared Error, it means that the optimal solution is a null function. These are two slices of your plot where you can see identical inputs but opposite targets
