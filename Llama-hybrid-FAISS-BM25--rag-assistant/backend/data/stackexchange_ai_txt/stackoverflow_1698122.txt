How can I use Clojure's distinct? function on a collection?

The Clojure distinct? method doesn't take a collection, but rather a list of args (distinct? x) (distinct? x y) (distinct? x y & more) So (distinct? 0 0 0 0) correctly returns false , while (distinct? [0 0 0 0]) returns true. How can I use distinct? on a collection so that passing it a collection [0 0 0 0] would return false since the collection contains duplicates? I do realize that the function is performing correctly, but I'm looking for a trick to apply it to the contents of a collection instead of a list of args. As a workaround, I currently have (defn coll-distinct? [coll] (= (distinct coll) coll)) but I feel like I'm missing a more elegant way reusing distinct?
