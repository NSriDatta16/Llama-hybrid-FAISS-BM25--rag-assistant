It is always best to approach a problem using the simplest possible tools. In your case there is no need to use a machine learning (AI) model to detect the word sale. To find the word sale within a long datastream, I would do the following: parse through the entire String while looking at segments of size 4 at a time, convert the substring to lowercase. Determine if this substring is "sale". If it is save the index of the "s" into a list. Return the list which will include the index of each start of the word sale within your text. public ArrayList getIndexSale(String inputString){ ArrayList indexes = new ArrayList<>(); String[] queue = new String[4]; queue[0] = 0; queue[1] = 0; queue[2] = 0; queue[3] = 0; for(int i = 0; i As mentioned by Dan Carter: if you do not care about the indices of the word "sale" within your string then it is simpler to use: public boolean getIndexSale(String inputString){ if(inputString.toLowerCase().contains("sale")) return true; return false; }
