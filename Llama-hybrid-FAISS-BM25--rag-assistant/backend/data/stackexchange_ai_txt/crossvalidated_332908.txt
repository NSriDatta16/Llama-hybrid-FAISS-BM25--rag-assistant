Consider the standard Bayesian conjugate model: $$\theta \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta),$$ $$X | \theta \sim \text{Bin}(n, \theta).$$ The posterior distribution for this model is: $$\theta | x \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha + x, \beta + n-x).$$ In this model, the value $n_0 \equiv \alpha + \beta$ in the prior is a measure of prior strength that is sometimes called the number of pseudo data points . Observation of the count value $x$ from $n$ trials adds to this to the posterior strength $n_0 + n$, so this is like you had $n_0$ pseudo data points and then added $n$ actual data points.
