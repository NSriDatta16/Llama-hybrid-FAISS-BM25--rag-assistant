HI, FInally got able to rid of this, The problem is [firstColumn setWidth:25]; So drag was working only upto 25 pixel form the left, and i commented this, then its working time, but strange to see, my outline view has only one column , for drawing, its not checking the restriction but for drag-n-drop its checking, Thanks Joshua
