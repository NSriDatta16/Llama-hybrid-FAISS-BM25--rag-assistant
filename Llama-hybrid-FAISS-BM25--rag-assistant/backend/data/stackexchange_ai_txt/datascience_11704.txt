Reshaping of data for deep learning using Keras

I am a beginner to Keras and I have started with the MNIST example to understand how the library actually works. The code snippet of the MNIST problem in the Keras example folder is given as : import numpy as np np.random.seed(1337) # for reproducibility from keras.datasets import mnist from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Activation, Flatten from keras.layers import Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D from keras.utils import np_utils batch_size = 128 nb_classes = 10 nb_epoch = 12 # input image dimensions img_rows, img_cols = 28, 28 # number of convolutional filters to use nb_filters = 32 # size of pooling area for max pooling nb_pool = 2 # convolution kernel size nb_conv = 3 # the data, shuffled and split between train and test sets (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data() X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 1, img_rows, img_cols) X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 1, img_rows, img_cols) X_train = X_train.astype('float32') X_test = X_test.astype('float32') .......... I am unable to understand the reshape function here. What is it doing and why we have applied it?
