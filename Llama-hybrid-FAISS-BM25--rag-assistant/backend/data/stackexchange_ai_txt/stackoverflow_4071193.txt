What Policies do Dev Teams use to Distribute ReSharper/CodeRush Licenses?

I've been tasked to create a policy for our organization to determine which developers receive a license of ReSharper (this could apply to other tools like CodeRush, etc.). For example, if the organization owns 10 licenses but the team has 20 developers, how to determine which 10 developers get the licenses when maybe all 20 want them. What policies have other people created in their organization to address this? Based purely on seniority? Based on skill/experience level? How do you address taking away licenses (if necessary)? I know there is no code in this question but (per SO guidelines ) it relates to software tools commonly used by programmers and matters that are unique to the programming profession.
