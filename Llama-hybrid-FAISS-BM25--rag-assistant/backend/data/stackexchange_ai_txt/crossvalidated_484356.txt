Likelihood of getting a certain sum after rolling several six-sided dice

Do you believe your friend whom claims to achieve a sum of $400$ after rolling $100$ six-sided dice? I was asked this question in a data science interview, and I was wondering if someone can please explain if my reasoning understanding is correct now. I think the answer is no, I shouldn't believe them. By the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, I found that the probability of getting a sum of 400 which is less than 1/501, which is the "average" probability of the 501 outcomes. Is my reasoning okay? Or is there something wrong with it.
