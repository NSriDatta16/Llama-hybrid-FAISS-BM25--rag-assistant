Sorry this is prob not the answer you are looking for but you mention that a simple insert / update could take 1-2 minutes or even fail with timeout / network error. This to me sounds like there may be another problem rather than the network itself. If your working on a corporate network there would have to be insane levels of traffic for this sort of behavior. I would do everything in your power to look at improving the network before proceeding. Can you post the result of a ping to the db box? If your going to architect your application around this type of network it will significantly alter the end product and even possibly result in a poor quality product for other clients. Depending upon the nature of the application maybe look at implementing an async persistence queue and caching data on startup or even embedding a copy of the db into your application.
