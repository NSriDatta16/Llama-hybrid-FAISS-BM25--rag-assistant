There are a few ways you can make this process more resource-efficient. Idea 1: 20ms works out to 50 FPS. Your average Hollywood film runs at 24-30 FPS (I forget the exact frame rate). Try an interval of 33 - 40ms. Idea 2: Use absolute positioning where possible to minimize the amount of reflowing required for the rest of the document. Idea 3: Consolidate all of your animations into a single timer. I imagine most good frameworks will take care of this for you. Ultimately, either you or your framework will be iteratively setting the CSS properties for each selector, so I think you will realize your gains by looking elsewhere.
