As a language, REALbasic is cleaner than most and has idioms that C# has only just added in recent versions (such as extends methods). The cross-platform framework is very easy to use and well-integrated into the IDE. The integration is so smooth it tends to obscure the true OO nature of the framework and elegant way in which events have been designed into the language - some people dismiss it as a VB6 clone but are very wrong. The IDE lacks some features compared to Visual Studio but is also far easier to use and with less visual noise. It has a few features, especially the history and navigation, which are superior to Visual Studio and make it surprisingly easy to get around a large project. The one major point I'd hold against it for hobbyist programming is that it can be quite memory-intensive, running poorly on machines with less than 1GB RAM. Having said that, I use it quite happily on a 1.5GHz, 1.25GB PPC PowerBook 12" (my traveling machine) provided I'm careful what else I'm running at the same time. I also work in Visual Studio and XCode - neither compares to the ease of being able to fling programs together in REALbasic.
