In a situation like this, is it possible to do predictions on the first observation of the test set? Yes, it is. This is done routinely in time series cross validation and is not a problem. You are not leaking any relevant information between the training and the validation set this way. See e.g. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3r edition)" . See some more in Hyndman's blog posts "Time series cross-validation: an R example" and "Cross-validation for time series" and his and coauthors' paper referenced therein. Also note that your AR(4) model lacks the error term at the end.
