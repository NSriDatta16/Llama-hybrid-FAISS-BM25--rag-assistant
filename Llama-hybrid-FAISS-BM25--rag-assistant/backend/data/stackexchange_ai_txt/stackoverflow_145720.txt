What techniques do you use to maximise code reuse?

Some years ago I was told about a study into code reuse. Apparently it was found that, on average, programmers have a 7 minute window when searching for code to reuse. If they don't find code that suits their needs within that window they'll write their own. This was presented in the context of needing to carefully manage your code for reuse to ensure that you can find what you need within the window. How do you (individuals and organisations) manage your source to make it easier to reuse? Do you specifically maintain a reuse library? And if so, how do you index it to maximise your hit rate?
