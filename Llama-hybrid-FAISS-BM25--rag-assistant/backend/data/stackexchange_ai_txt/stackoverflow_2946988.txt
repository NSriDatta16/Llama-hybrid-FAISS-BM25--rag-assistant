Is there such a thing as an "elisp bundle" for TextMate?

I started using Code Collector Pro to organise and save my Emacs codes, and this software requires TextMate bundles for syntax highlighting. They have a lisp bundle, but not an elisp bundle, at least not that I can see. I would think that the syntax highlighting would work under the lisp bundle, but for some reason it isn't happening. I have never even seen any lisp code with syntax highlighting, so it is possible that the thing is working and I don't know, but I honestly don't think so, because the ;; before a line seems to me to be a comment thing, so anything after that should be in the color defined for comments which in my case is green. Here is a picture of my code collector screen with a piece of code written by huaiyuan answering my question posted here : Is this looking as it should or is there something wrong? Back to the initial question: is there a textmate bundle for elisp or a bundle like the ones from textmate I can download to get syntax highlighting?
