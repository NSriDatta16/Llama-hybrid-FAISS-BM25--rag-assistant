How can I efficiently select several unique random numbers from 1 to 50, excluding x?

I have 2 numbers which are between 0 and 49. Let's call them x and y . Now I want to get a couple of other numbers which are not x or y, but are also between 0 and 49 (I am using Objective C but this is more of a general theory question I think?). Method I thought of is: int a; int b; int c; do { a = arc4random() % 49; } while ((a == x) || (a == y)); do { b = arc4random() % 49; } while ((b == x) || (b == y) || (b == a)); do { c = arc4random() % 49; } while ((c == x) || (c == y) || (c == a) || (c == b)); But it seem kind of bad to me, I don't know, I am just trying to learn to be a better programmer, what would be the most elegant way to do this for best practices?
