I took the liberty of formatting your code. This is how the method looks: double suma (int num [ ]) { int i=num.length; int j=0; int s=0; for(j=0;j I suspect you attempted to write a sum-method, started with a stub, and didn't get it to compile. This is probably what you had in mind: double suma (int num [ ]) { int i=num.length; int j=0; int s=0; for(j=0;j The Java compiler can only deduce that a statement (such as a return ) is reachable in very simple cases. (To illustrate: this method does compile. Still not very useful though!) double suma (int num [ ]) { int i=num.length; int j=0; int s=0; for(j=0; true; j++) { return (double)(s); } }
