Dealing with high dimension in principal component analysis

Does PCA work well or does it work at all in extremely high-dimensional problems, i.e. when the number of dimensions $p$ is larger than the sample size $N$ ? By 'work' I mean if it works mathematically. If it can work mathematically, does it make any sense to use it for high-dimensional problems? If PCA works, how does it work in discrimination analysis? "PCA in discrimination analysis" means it tries to keep the most discrimination power rather than keep most variations as more variation does not necessarily mean the separation between groups of data is maximum. So Chang (1983) in his paper " On using principal components before separating a mixture of two multivariate normal distributions " suggests using Mahalanobis distance in some way to measure it.
