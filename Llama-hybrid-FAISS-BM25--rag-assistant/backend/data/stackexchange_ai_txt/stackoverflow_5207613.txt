How to output ${expression} in Freemarker without it being interpreted?

I'm trying to use Freemarker in conjunction with jQuery Templates. Both frameworks use dollar sign/curly brackets to identify expressions for substitution (or as they're called in freemarker, "interpolations") , e.g. ${person.name} . So when I define a jQuery Template with expressions in that syntax, Freemarker tries to interpret them (and fails). I've tried various combinations of escaping the ${ sequence to pass it through Freemarker to no avail - \${ , \$\{ , $\{ , etc. Inserting a freemarker comment in between the dollar and the curly (e.g. $ {expression} ) DOES work - but I'm looking for a more concise and elegant solution. Is there a simpler way to get a Freemarker template to output the character sequence ${ ?
