Looks like a UNION could help, e.g. (depending how your table's organized, of course): SELECT itemname, SUM(percent) AS pc FROM items GROUP BY itemtype HAVING SUM(percent) >= 0.05 UNION SELECT 'Other', SUM(*) FROM (SELECT SUM(percent) FROM items GROUP BY itemtype HAVING SUM(percent) If you don't have a percent field but only (say) a value field (so the % needs to be dynamically computed as 100 times the fraction of an item's value to the grand total) you can get the grand total from yet another nested SELECT, but at some point it may be worth switching to procedural approaches as other respondents hint.
