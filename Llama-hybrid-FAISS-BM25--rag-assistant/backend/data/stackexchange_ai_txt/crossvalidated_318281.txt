Choosing informative priors for Bayesian ordered logistic regression

What are some guidelines for choosing weakly informative priors in a Bayesian ordinal regression? Consider the following model from the Stan manual (version 2.17.0, section 9.8, page 138): data { int K; int N; int D; int y[N]; row_vector[D] x[N]; } parameters { vector[D] beta; ordered[K-1] c; } model { for (n in 1:N) y[n] ~ ordered_logistic(x[n] * beta, c); } We specify the likelihood as ordered_logistic , but improper flat priors are left on all beta and c . I can reason how to specify more informative priors on beta , because it is simply how much how much the log odds change for each unit increase in each predictor in x . These, for instance, could simply be beta ~ normal(0, 3) or something, depending on how the predictors are scaled. However, how does one specify priors on the cutoff points c ? They have to be ordered, but I am not sure how to specify that. Also, I am not sure how to think about them being distributed. Anybody know of guides for informative priors for ordinal regression? The Stan community very briefly touches on it on their GitHub , but it isn't a fully-realized or explained section.
