Seasonal time series prediction formula

I've got this prediction problem for daily data across several years. My data has both yearly and weekly seasonality. It's also stationary. I tried using the following recurrence:(which I just came up with, from nowhere if you like) x n = 1/4(x n-738 + x n-364 + x n-7 + 1/6(x n-1 +x n-2 +x n-3 +x n-4 +x n-5 +x n-6 ) Basically, I am taking into consideration some of the previous days in the week before the day I am trying to predict and also the corresponding day a year and two years earlier. I am doing an average over them. I got the following histogram of residuals: Why or Why not would such a formula be a good idea and can I improve this FOR example by adding some terms sampled from a distribution or in another way? Thanks!
