Code golf: "Color highlighting" of repeated text

(Thanks to greg0ire below for helping with key concepts) The challenge: Build a program that finds all substrings and "tags" them with color attributes (effectively highlighting them in XML). The rules: This should only be done for substrings of length 2 or more. Substrings are just strings of consecutive characters, which may include non-alphabetic characters. Note that spaces and other punctuation do not delimit substrings. Character casing cannot be ignored. The "highlight" should be done by tagging the substring in XML. Your tagging should be of the form theSubstring where # is a positive number unique to that substring and identical substrings. The priority of the algorithm is to find the longest substring, not how many times it matches within the text. Note: The order of the tagging shown in the example below is not important. Its just used by the OP for clarity. An example input: LoremIpsumissimplydummytextoftheprintingandtypesettingindustry.LoremIpsumhasbeentheindustry'sstandarddummytexteversincethe1500s,whenanunknownprintertookagalleyoftypeandscrambledittomakeatypespecimenbook. A partially correct output (OP may NOT have completely replaced perfectly in this example) LoremIpsum issimply dummytext of the print ingand type setting industry . LoremIpsum hasbeen the industry 'sstandard dummytext eversince the 1500s,whenanunknown print ertookagalleyof type andscrambledittomakea type specimenbook. Your code should be able to handle edge cases, such as the following: Example Input 2: hello!TAG! Example Output 2: hello ! TAG ! hello . TAG . The winner: Most elegant solution wins (judged by others comments, upvotes) Bonus points/consideration for solutions utilizing shell scripting Minor clarifications: Input can be hard coded or read from a file The criteria remains "elegance", which admittedly IS slightly vague, but it also encapsulates simple character/line counts as well. Comments by others and/or upvotes are also indicative of how the SO community views the challenge
