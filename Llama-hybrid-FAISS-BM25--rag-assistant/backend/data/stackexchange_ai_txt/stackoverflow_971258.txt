I think you need all three methods. When building a tree, the AddChild method would seem more natural. There are two reasons to remove a node. One is to get rid of it, and the other is to reorganise the tree (move a subtree to another branch). When deleting, RemoveChild works well. But reorganisation could use the SetParent method to avoid making two calls. SetParent could also become a transaction of sorts.
