Generally, it is a good strategy to use a model so that - after accounting for any structural breaks - the model fits well in each of the segments. Thus, in your case the linear trend plus AR(1) effect would be appropriate because this model will fit well in both parts even if the slope of the trend will be zero in the second segment. Of course, this is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem because for finding the breaks you need a model that fits well after accounting for the breaks. But possibly some guidance for the model is known from the literature or prior data etc. Finally, if you hadn't mentioned that you simulated trend-stationary time series with AR(1) effects my first intuition would have been that this is a non-stationary series. So I probably would have modeled the first differences $\Delta Y$ rather than original levels $Y$ . Then you don't need to include the trend as a regressor. The change in slope for $Y$ will correspond to a change in intercept for $\Delta Y$ .
