This is not the main difference. Cox regression deals with time-to-event data, especially where there is censoring. So, with Cox regression, you are interested in how long it takes for something to happen. Logistic regression deals with whether something happens at all and does not account for censoring so if you have censored data, you will be looking at "has it happened yet ", which may get quite different answers. By "simple" regression I'm assuming you mean ordinary least squares. This deals with a continuous dependent variable but does not deal with censoring and it does not give either a risk ratio or an odds ratio.
