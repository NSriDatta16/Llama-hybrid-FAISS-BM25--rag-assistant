Based on your comment, I see that you just take the average of, let's say cluster 1 centers, to come up with the mean of cluster 1 center, i.e. $$\bar{C_{1}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{n=1}^{20K} C_{1}^{(i)}$$ which makes your analysis invalid if I'm not missing anything because, even if the k-means algorithm assigns the exact same clusters to your data (i.e. exactly same means), they may come in different order . So, cluster numberings don't possess a specific ordering, which in turn means that their average doesn't make much sense. There are methods for computing cluster similarities using comembership measures as in cluster_similarity , however even if you get an aligned ordering for iterations $i$ and $j$ , they might differ in subsequent iterations. I can't seem to find a straightforward way to mean these cluster centers. Typically, the best one is chosen.
