Supposedly you can download Linux VM additions for Virtual Server from http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/downloads.aspx , and transfer them to VMs to use in VirtualPC. This is “not supported” for Ubuntu or VirtualPC, but may work. Personally I'm using VirtualBox for Linux guests; its additions work well under Intrepid. Still no drag-and-drop though unfortunately, that's certainly one feature I miss from VPC.
