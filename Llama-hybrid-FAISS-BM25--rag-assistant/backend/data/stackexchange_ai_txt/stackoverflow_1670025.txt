I wanted to try my meager linq skills here... I'm sure there is a more elegant solution, but here's mine: string pattern = ".SUMMARY."; string[] awesomeFiles = System.IO.Directory.GetFiles("path\\to\\awesomefiles"); IEnumerable sum_files = from file in awesomeFiles where file.ToUpper().Contains(pattern) select file; IEnumerable other_files = from file in awesomeFiles where !file.ToUpper().Contains(pattern) select file; This assumes there aren't any other files in the directory other than the two, but you can adjust the pattern here to suit your needs (i.e. add "Awesome.File" to the pattern start.) When you iterate the collection of each, you should get what you need.
