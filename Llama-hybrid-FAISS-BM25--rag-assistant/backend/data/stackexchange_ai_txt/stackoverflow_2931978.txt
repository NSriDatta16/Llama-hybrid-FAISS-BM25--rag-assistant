Typing my next to last sentence caused the answer to occur to me, though I would still be interested in hearing if there are more elegant solutions. Basically I stored the results of the transform in a string in VB, then string replaced the vbcrlf with vbcr before outputing: xmlTrans.Load(xsltDocPath) 'load the xslt xmlTrans.Transform(xmlDoc.CreateNavigator(), Nothing, sw) xform into a stringWriter outString = sw.ToString().Replace(vbCrLf, vbCr) 'replace the crlf with just a cr HL7Writer.WriteLine(outString) 'output the results Again, if anyone has a more elegant XSL based solution, I would interested in hearing it. Thanks.
