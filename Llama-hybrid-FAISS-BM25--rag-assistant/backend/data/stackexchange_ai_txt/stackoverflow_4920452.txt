How to use CSS3 orphans and widows properties with xhtmlrenderer (flying saucer) R8?

I read in this bugfix description that xhtmlrenderer should support the "orphans" and "widows" properties of CSS3 since Version R5. Using R8, it seems not to work. div.textContent { orphans: 5; widows: 3; } But it looks like this: The paragraph (a div block element) is broken into two pieces although it must not. Any ideas or experience with this? Thanks!
