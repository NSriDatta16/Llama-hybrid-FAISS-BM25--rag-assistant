Bootstrap t confidence intervals are not normally used in OLS regression. They can be used when the noise term is very non-Gaussian. For variance estimation with heavytailed distributions all bootstrap confidence intervals have slow convergence. The higher order bootstraps like bootstrap t and BCa converge faster but are not always superior to the percentile method in small samples.
