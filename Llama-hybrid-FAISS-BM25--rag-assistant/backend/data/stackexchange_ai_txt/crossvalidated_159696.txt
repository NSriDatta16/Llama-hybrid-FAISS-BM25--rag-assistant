If you have the constraint that your DAG is indeed a tree, then the searched distribution appears to be the one you can learn with the Chow-Liu algorithm . In the most general case I guess there is no closed form solution and it can be tackled with Bayesian Network structure learning algorithm when what you have is a dataset of observations for $X$.
