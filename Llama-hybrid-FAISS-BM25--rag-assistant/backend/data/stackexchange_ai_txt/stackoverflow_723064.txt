You can create a role for those people and name it something like organizational-admin, though that's a bit long, you catch my drift :). And give those the power to create users with a regular user role. At least that's how i did it in one of my applications. Ofcourse you'll keep the admin to yourself or to the person who is in charge of this particular site. Gu's blog has a small example of how to implement the roles in an action filter.
