I have used both NUnit and MSTest. Yes, there are differences. NUnit is an older, more established unit testing framework designed to do exactly one thing - unit testing. MSTest is newer so it does not have the same level of maturity in its API. For example, NUnit offers more Assert methods than MSTest. (See Link for more information. To add some of the missing Assert methods, see Link ). I have not really found performance to be an issue with either framework. Some of the bigger differences are: MSTest requires a Visual Studio instance on the build server in order to run. It does not contain a standalone test runner like NUnit. MSTest provides test results and code coverage results directly within Visual Studio. NUnit provides test results in its own UI and requires additional tools to perform code coverage analysis.
