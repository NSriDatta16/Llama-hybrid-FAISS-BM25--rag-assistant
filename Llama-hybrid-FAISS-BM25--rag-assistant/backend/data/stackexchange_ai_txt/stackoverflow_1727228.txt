You cannot seek by line. It's pretty obvious once you think about it. But you can do a sort-of binary search on a text file. What you do is: Stat the file to get the length or seek to the end and get the position. Memory map the file. (This is best, I think, but you can use lseek and read if you must.) Seek to the middle of the file, minus your average line length. Just guess. Scan forward for a newline, unless you are at position 0. Read your line and compare. Repeat for 1/4th or 3/4ths, 1/8th, 1/16th, etc.
