t-SNE output graph rotation/flip/transformation

As I understand it, the output of a t-SNE graph has arbitrary axis directions. That is, the axis can be easily flipped by multiplying one/both of the output coordinates by -1, and the output graph can still be visually interpreted equally validly. This article , in section "Materials and Methods" > "PCA vs. t-SNE", describes t-SNE as using a "method/optimization-criteria [that] is rotation and scale-invariant", which suggests that t-SNE outputs can also be rotated by, say, 45 degrees in either direction. This could be carried out by any algorithm for rotation about a point. Is this accurate, and if so, does it matter which point is chosen as the center of rotation of a t-SNE map?
