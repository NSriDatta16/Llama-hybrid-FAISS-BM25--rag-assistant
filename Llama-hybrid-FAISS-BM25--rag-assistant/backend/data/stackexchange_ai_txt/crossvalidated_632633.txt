Agree with most of the points from Elsa12. To be able to test whether two measurements for the same individual are significantly different from one another, you would need repeated measurements absent treatment and absent any other changes. This would tell you how much random measurement error there is associated with the outcome and allow you to estimate whether two values differ by an amount greater than we would expect by chance alone. As you can't do that, I would recommend the following: Firstly, make an average conclusion for the sample using whatever test you prefer. i.e., on average, the duration participants can hold their breath significantly increases 1.7 fold. Second, choose some cutoffs that make sense and say something like: 75% of respondents saw increases in their time by at least 20% (FI of at least 1.2). You could also report how many had FIs below one. Thirdly, you could create a plot showing the range of FIs across the sample. This is essentially calculating and plotting a treatment effect for every individual and would show the reader how much variability there is in the effects of the program. Finally, if you wanted to, you could take those individual treatment effects (FIs) and regress them on sample characteristics to see which characteristics predict stronger and weaker effects (treatment effect heterogeneity analysis). Hope some of that is helpful!
