Since the cache, in its current form, is stored in memory then the data is naturally cast into oblivion when the page refreshes - that's a new instance of the application starting there. You might, however, be interested in utilising isolated storage in order to persist data per-user. With isolated storage you essentially have a contained file system into which you can store data and then further retrieve it. One step in the right direction could be to make a class you want to represent a 'piece' of cached data, make it serializable, then using your static class as the cache controller you can read and write these objects from and to isolated storage.
