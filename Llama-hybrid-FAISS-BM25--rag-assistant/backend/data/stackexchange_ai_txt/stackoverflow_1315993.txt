I certainly agree with the comments that it would be "good" to separate things. But in practice, that's very rare. Assuming that you must work in an environment which has not been separated, there's another organizational strategy, and it's what I've seen used. Since your question refers to both build and run dependencies, you don't appear to be talking about processes, but about classes and jars. The simple solution for that is to have the complete set of built, integration-tested (or integration-test-ready, for that matter) dependencies up on a shared server. Then developers build in their local environments the portions of the system on which they're working, using a classpath which references first their development and then the appropriate shared server.
