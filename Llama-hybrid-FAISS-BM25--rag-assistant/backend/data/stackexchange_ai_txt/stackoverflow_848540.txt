Plan on developing some type of website. If your code involves web software, people really marvel if you are using it as part of your site. Developers love good documentation and lots of samples. I have seen projects that have lots of powerful code but 0% documentation fall hard. Having a wiki setup to let people write ideas and recipes is a definite plus. (I recommend mediawiki). A forum to post ideas, threads of discussions, i.e. a community forum is also good. Setup a mailing list and encourage people to join. Post real updates to your mailing list, wiki site, and also as news on your main site to show you are really working on things. Encourage participation. Make yourself available. This all generates a sense that you are interesting in chipping in, and that you are open to input from others.
