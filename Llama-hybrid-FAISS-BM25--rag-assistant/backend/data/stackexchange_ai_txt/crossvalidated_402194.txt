Well, since the response variable you are modeling is not numeric but an ordered categorical variable, ordinary multiple regression cannot be used, so this seems a case of ordered regression, like ordered logistic regression. The variable types of the explanatory variables do not matter, all types can be used as explanatory in all kinds of regression models. If you want some more specific advice we need much more context!
