All panels but Canvas use some kind of constraint to position their children. Only Canvas lets you use absolute positioning. That's why I think it is the only way to implement drag and drop . Feel free to use a Canvas on top of your existing panel. Just remember to remove the dragged element from its original parent and put it in the Canvas (or drag some kind of copy) and do the reverse on mouse up.
