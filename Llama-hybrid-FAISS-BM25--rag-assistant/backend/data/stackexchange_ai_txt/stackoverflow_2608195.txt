C# embedding images, reports, schemas

I've seen some examples, but trying to better understand how "Resource" files work, such as embedding images, reports, schemas, etc. If building an application, I want to make sure everything is available when deployed, but for things like reports and schemas, I don't want anyone accidentally deleting, renaming, or otherwise mucking around with the content of things. So, embedding these types of items appears to make sense. Then, I just access via the dll via the resources manager. Since I have not done this yet... Am I correct in the assumption that my final deployed stuff will be a bunch of dlls, and I can check to make sure all required exist before continuing the app. Then, all the reports and schemas I can get out of the "resource" dll assembly. Additionally, since I already have some samples of about 5 reports, and their corresponding schemas that are NOT in a "resource" file, what is involved with adding these existing elements into a "resource" file and being able to run them. I know they all appear to have some embedded pathing things themselves, such as the report knowing where it's schema is coming from. If the actual files are not part of the deployment, just extracted from the "resource", will it choke? Hope this is all making sense as this area of utilizing resource files is relatively new to me. Thanks
