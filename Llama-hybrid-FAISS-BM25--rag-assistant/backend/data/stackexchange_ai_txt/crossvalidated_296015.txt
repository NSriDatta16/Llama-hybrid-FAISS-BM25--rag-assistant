Residuals in a Machine Learning with forecasting

I'm affraid to confuse something. Here's my assumption : I have a timeseries that I split in 2 parts Learning data and test data . A residual in forecasting is the difference between an observed value and its forecast based on other observations: ei=yi−y^iei=yi−y^i. I want to see how good my model is so I want t know the residuals. But which data are my observations ? For me, it's my learning data + my test data. Because i had prediction on all my data. (On the learning data and the most important on my test data) EDIT : So i'm calcutating the residuals on all my data. EDIT 2 : Paper Am I right ? Thanks for your help.
