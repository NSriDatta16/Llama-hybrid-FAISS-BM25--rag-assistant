Not sure if this constitutes a "study" but I have investigated using PCA to decompose the MNIST dataset to visualize in 2D: pca = PCA(n_components=2) pca.fit(ziptrain[:, 1:]) Z_train = pca.transform(ziptrain[:, 1:]) fig, ax = plt.subplots() for digit in np.unique(ziptrain[:, 0]): x = Z_train[ziptrain[:, 0]==digit, 0] y = Z_train[ziptrain[:, 0]==digit, 1] ax.scatter(x, y, label=int(digit), alpha=1.0, edgecolors='none', marker=' ${}$ '.format(int(digit))) ax.legend() This yielded the following plot: Visually I would say that 1's and 0's are very different. I'm sure you could continue the study by clustering them & measuring the cartesian distance from the centroids of their respective clusters. It is important to note though that your definition of what "different" means will change the outcome of such an investigation and that this is simply one approach.
