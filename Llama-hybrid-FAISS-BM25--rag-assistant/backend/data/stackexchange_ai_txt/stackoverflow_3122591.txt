As to whether this is a best practice in Python is up to debate: hash = {} hash['element1', 'sub1', 'subsub1'] = 'value' if ('element1', 'sub1', 'subsub1') in hash: print "found value" But, it certainly works and is very elegant, if it works for you. The major drawback is that you don't have intermediate access. You can't do: if ('element1', 'sub1') in hash: print "found value"
