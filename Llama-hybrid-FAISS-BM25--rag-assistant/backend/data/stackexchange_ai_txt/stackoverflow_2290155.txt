How to check a thread is done, then fill progress bar in C# / WPF

I am just working on my first GUI application on Windows. I have a WPF GUI to a small C# utility which copies files. When the button is clicked to copy, I obviously don't want the GUI to hang. So, I fire off a new thread to run the method which copies the files. I assume I'm on track so far and there's no "better" way of doing it in C#? Now, I have a ProgressBar which I want to appear filled when the thread is done. (It's fine running as indeterminate for now). How do I check when the copying is done? So, so far I have: Thread t = new Thread(delegate() { po.Organise(inputPath, outputPath, recursive); }); t.Start(); PBar.IsIndeterminate = true; And I want something after that that works like: if (t.Done) { PBar.Value = 100; }
