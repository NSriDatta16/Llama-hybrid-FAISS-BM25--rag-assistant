If you want the new text to be vertically aligned with the second paragraph, then you add a before the second paragraph, and then do another float like you did originally. If you just want to float a whole panel at the left, then you would just add it to the floated content. But looks like your new text is vertically aligned with the second paragraph, so the method listed above would be it.
