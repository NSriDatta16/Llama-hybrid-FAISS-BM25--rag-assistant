In addition to Sacha's suggestions , you can use the SharePoint SOAP web services. Each SharePoint site exposes a bunch of web services via the path http:// /_vti_bin/ . In your case, you probably want the Lists web service ( http:// /_vti_bin/Lists.asmx ). You can grab the WSDL from http:// /_vti_bin/Lists.asmx?WSDL . The WSS 3.0 SDK has details on how to use the web service (you'll probably want to use the UpdateListItems and AddAttachment methods). All that said, Sacha's first option (mapping a document library to a drive) is probably the easiest way assuming you can get around the NTLM issues. If you're using Windows you can simply navigate to a UNC path for a document library. For example, if the browser URL for your document library is: http:// /Foo/BarDocs/Forms/AllItems.aspx you can simply type the corresponding UNC path in the Windows Explorer address bar: \\ \Foo\BarDocs and then drag and drop files to this location. If you'd like you can map this location to a drive letter using Windows Explorer or the SUBST.EXE command-line utility.
