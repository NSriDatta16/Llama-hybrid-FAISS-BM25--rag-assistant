You need to enable OpenMP support in the C++ project properties (this is a compiler option). You also need to #include in any source file where you are using OpenMP pragmas and/or library calls. This bit me, as the documentation says the include is only needed when making library calls, but not for using pragmas alone. But the documentation is wrong. The omp.h header updates the manifest of your executable so the run-time library can be found (vcomp.dll).
