How does the Price Trends feature in eBay work in IE?

When looking at a listing for eBay, for example: http://catalog.ebay.com/Apple-iPod-classic-5th-Generation-Black-30-GB-/60655662?_pcatid=39&_refkw=ipod&_trkparms=65%253A12%257C66%253A2%257C39%253A1%257C72%253A4030&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14 The Price Trends chart shows up as iframe apparently using HTML 5 canvas. But IE does not support canvas element but still it shows up correctly in IE. How does it works in IE? Also it appears the src attribute of iframe is empty but there is HTML content within the iframe. How is this happening? But my main question is how it is working in IE?
