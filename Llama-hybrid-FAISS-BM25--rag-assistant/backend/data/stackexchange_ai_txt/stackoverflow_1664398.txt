If you're willing to have them "sign" using their finger as a pen then yes, on both counts. For the first, you'll probably use a canvas tag and the custom touch events generated by Mobile Safari. As the user drags the touch around, you maintain a list of touch points. You draw these as a line list on the canvas for feedback, and submit the list (encoded) as an AJAX postback. Apple gives information on Mobile Safari touch events; the capture, drawing and transmission, I guess you can handle. You can suppress various Mobile Safari accoutrements with custom Webkit CSS properties . The second, well, it's much the same - only you use a native application, rather than JavaScript. You'll probably get greater touch fidelity, and a smoother user experience.
