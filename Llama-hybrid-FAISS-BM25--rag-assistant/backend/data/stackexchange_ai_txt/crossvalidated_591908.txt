It doesn't really make sense (IMO) to treat birth order on its own as a random effect, as the levels are not exchangeable : that is, it wouldn't really make sense given birth order "first"/"not first" to switch the labels (whereas if you have families "Jones", "Smith", "Woodward", relabeling the families won't change anything in the interpretation). Therefore, I would go with (1|family:BIRTH_ORDER) , which says that birth order within family matters. In fact, you might want (BIRTH_ORDER|family) (or (BIRTH_ORDER-1|family) ), which would allow for a correlation in the effects of different birth orders within families. (Furthermore, since BIRTH_ORDER only has two levels, it wouldn't really be practical to treat it as a random effect - unless you have strong Bayesian priors it doesn't really work to fit factors with fewer than 5-6 levels as random effects.)
