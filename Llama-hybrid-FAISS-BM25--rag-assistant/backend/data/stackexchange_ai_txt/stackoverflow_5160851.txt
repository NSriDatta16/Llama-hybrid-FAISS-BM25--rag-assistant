Facebook js sdk: "select a friend" dialog, then post to their wall?

Needs to resolve that procedure. Now using the new javascript sdk, inside my "iframe tab". Select friend(s) Post in their wall. 1: not solved I couldn't find a way of poping a "select a friend" dialog, trough the new api. The only mention in FB.ui is about a "friends dialog" used to "invite a friend". Maybe I need a dialog ( which one ) to select a friend and than post? Ideally multi-friend selector so I can post to as many friends as a user can choose? 2: solved ( any other solution is welcome ) To post in a friends wall, I can simply fill the "to" param of the "feed dialog" as explained here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/ Some not so elegant solutions I found: ask access to manage user friends then: Do the multi selection pop up by myself looks like redoing the wheel, some FBML pages solved that problem with a simple feed dialog with friend selector, as you can see here: http://www.facebook.com/chanel Use a jquery plugin that parses the friends list and do the dialog for me looks like a overkill / not working very well I feel like I'm missing something ( this is my second work with the new js sdk ), such a easy task should be pretty straight forward to solve.
