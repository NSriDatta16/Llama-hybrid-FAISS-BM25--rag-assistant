First, OLS regression does not require that the variables be normally distributed. It makes assumptions about the residuals. Second, if those assumptions are violated, my view is that it is better to use a different method rather than to transform the data (e.g. Quantile regression or robust regression). Third, by including both open and close price as IVs, you will surely have colinearity. Finally, you seem to have time series data. You should use time series methods.
