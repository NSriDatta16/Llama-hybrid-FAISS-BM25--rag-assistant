I recommend Eclipse TPTP (Test & Performance Tools Platform). It offers a feature-rich profiler and is free. It's part of the Helios release, you can download it using the Helios update site. The Tracing and Profiling Tools Project is a project in the Eclipse TPTP Top-Level Project, it addresses the tracing and profiling phases of the application lifecycle. The Tracing and Profiling Tools Project provides frameworks for building tracing and profiling tools by extending the TPTP Platform. The framework contains views, dialogs and action items that support the capability of collecting and analyzing application performance information. The project includes exemplary profiling tools for both single-system and distributed Java applications through monitoring agents that collects trace and profile data. A generic tool kit for customizable probe insertion is also available.
