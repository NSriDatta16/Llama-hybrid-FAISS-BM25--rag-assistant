Which kind of analysis could be made to associate a set of genes to clinical values?

I have a set of 5 genes that can be mutated or not, so therefore are intended as dichotomous yes/no vars. I want to identify the effect of the mutation of this genes on a continuous response var. The tests I thought about are these: Regression analysis using the genes as covariates to assess the independent effect of a single mutation. Regression analysis using an association var which describe every possible combination of status (pattern) for the five genes. This var has 21 levels. Regression analysis using simply the number of mutated genes, independently from which gene is mutated. Thus a ordinal factor with 5 levels. Any other ideas? Next I'd like to use some clustering technique to group mutation patterns in 3/4 groups related to the continuous response. Plotting the average of my response var for every pattern, I can see that it's possible to identify groups of response. Which technique can be used to cluster the pattern in group that maximize the difference in the response var? UPDATE I thought of a solution and I'd like to hear your opinion. I aggregated the response data into the different patterns by averaging (like you see in the picture above). Then I used kmeans to divide the 21 patterns using the averaged response var. This way I obtained group 1 which contains patterns 1 to 3, group 3 contains patterns 20 and 21 and group 2 contains the rest. This seems a good solution. What troubles me is that by averaging, I eliminated all information about variability and numerosity in every pattern. Any comments?
