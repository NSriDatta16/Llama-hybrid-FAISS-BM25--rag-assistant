Advice on time series data analysis

I would like some advice on how I should analyze my time series data. I have hourly measurements of water temperature data for 12 months across 5 sites. I have summarized my data in following way: Site (5 sites) Day (0-150) Month (June-October, 5 levels) Daily Mean Temperature (Response variable 1) Daily Max Temperature (Response variable 2) Daily standard deviation, or some other measure of variation (Response variable 3) So I have 5 x 150 = 750 observations. I want to test the following: Are my response variables significantly different between sites. Are there a monthly interaction? For example in month 1 all sites have similar response and in month 2 one site will have significantly higher response than other sites. I am planning to do a time series or a mixed model analysis by specifying an temporal autocorrelation structure. For fixed effect I want the explanatory variables to be: Option 1: month (as factor), site(as factor) and interaction of these two. Option 2: day (as a continuous variable) and site (as factor) and interaction of these two. Since this is a time series data, I am expecting significant temporal autocorrelation. So when I do this analysis for mean and max temperature I should add a correlation structure. But I am not sure which variable I should use for correlation- month or day? Also I want to do an anova/ancova on standard deviation of daily temperature, so for this do I still need to add a correlation structure? Or since it is a deviation, the values become independent? Thank you.
