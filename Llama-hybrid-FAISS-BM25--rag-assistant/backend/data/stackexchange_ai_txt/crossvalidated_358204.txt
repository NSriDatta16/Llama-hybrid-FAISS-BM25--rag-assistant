Interpreting coefficients for logistic regression with effects coding

As far as my understanding of logistic regression goes, only dummy coding is readily interpretable for this type of modelling. How to explain coefficients when effect coding is used in logistic regression? Here is a simulation example for illustration: podatki Specifying an effects coding matrix: X $X=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & -1\\ \end{array}\right)$ Appending the matrix to data: tmp Running logistic and regression model: summary(model summary(model While results of linear regression are easy to interpret: Intercept here represents unweighted mean $\bar{Y}=\frac{\bar{Y}_A+\bar{Y}_B+\bar{Y}_C}{3}$, while $b_1$ represents $\bar{Y}_A-\bar{Y}$ and $b_2$ represents $\bar{Y}_B-\bar{Y}$. Results of logistic regression are not readily interpretable:
