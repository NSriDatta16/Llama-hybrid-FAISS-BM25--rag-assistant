Note that due to various problems (eg. unknown behavior of cache servers) this kind of thing is always going to be inaccurate and a balance between various factors. However, for a rough vaguely-secure counter, using a separate table as Karl Bartel and others suggest is a decent solution. However, depending on how seriously you take this problem, you may want to leave out "user_agent" - it's far to easy to fake, so if I really wanted to inflate my hit counter I could rack up the hits with a script that called my page with user-agent="bot1", then again from the same IP with "bot2", etc. But then, 2 users behind one IP will be only counted as 1 hit so you lose accuracy - see what I mean about a balance between various factors?
