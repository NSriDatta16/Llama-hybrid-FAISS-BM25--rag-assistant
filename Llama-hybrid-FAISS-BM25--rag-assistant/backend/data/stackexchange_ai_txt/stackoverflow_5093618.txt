Mystery solved! The problem turned out to be that I was trying to 'Refactor > Rename' while in the Resource perspective. Once I switched to the Java perspective , this (inconsistent) behavior didn't repeat itself and I was even able to check the Update references checkbox. Wow! (thanks @Sankar Ganesh for posting the snapshots, because that allowed me to notice that there is an "Update references" checkbox and that the text on your caption bar is different than mine)
