I've been working on a business app in silverlight for the past couple of months, so I'm biased more towards that direction. These are my problems with 2 beta 2, I have no idea if they will be solved with the final version. Printing. Some kind, any kind, I don't care, as long as I have some control over it. A business app without printing is a hard sell, and no, the print from the browser is not good enough. Ability to deploy updates. Currently I can't easily post a new version of the xap and expect the users to get it. That's very nearly a show stopper. All the suggestions to make this work I've had don't seem to work or make things worse. Adding a query string did nothing. Renaming the xap with a version number will wipe the iso storage and adding a no cache header to the website breaks PDF's in IE which is part of my work around for #1. Right Click, double click and scroll wheel. Where are they? Sure I can hack on it and make it work, but that stuff should just work. The only excuse I've heard is some mice don't have a second button. I hope that's not the reason. If so, let's get rid of everything but the text box so the lynx guys don't feel bad.
