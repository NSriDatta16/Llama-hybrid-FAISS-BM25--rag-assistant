How do I store TIFF files in Oracle?

I have an ASP.NET application (vb.net codebehind) that has serious performance problems because of its storage of TIFF files in one server share. There are over a million .TIF files there now! The application tracks the scanned images of property with a corresponding row in an Oracle database table. We have this idea that it might be better to store the images themselves in a new Oracle table. How can this be done? The alternative solution we are thinking of is to split up the server share into multiple folders by State (an OH folder, a WV folder, a VA folder, etc.) Seems like the database option might make more sense long-term, but how do we do it? Can a TIFF be stored in a BLOB column and then extracted back into TIFF format using .NET? Anyone know how?
