I'm not sure if I'm following what you are asking, so I'll do my best to answer the question. It appears that what you are after is selecting weights based on time series cross validation or rolling forecast and using regression coefficients as weights on the hold out data. Check out Diebold's forecasting book and a chapter on forecasting combination. What you may be after is called time varying combining weights. See the below for a section from the above referenced book. If you have more than 3 or 4 methods to combine then you are better off using simple averages as opposed to optimal weights. You could also use trimmed means or Winsorized means to remove outliers in place of simple averages. Several research actually supports using averages, which can be thought of an extreme form of regularization or shrinkage estimators. Check out these two articles and several references in those articles. Combining forecast by Scott Armstrong in Principles of forecasting .
