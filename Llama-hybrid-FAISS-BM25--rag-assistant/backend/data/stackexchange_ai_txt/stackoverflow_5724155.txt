You can have the url go trough a redirector that is blocked in robots.txt. If you want to link to google.com then you'll open yoursite.com/blocked.php?url=google.com , and have the url yoursite.com/blocked.php blocked in robots.txt. blocked.php will then redirect to the specified url parameter, but will be blocked for crawlers. F.ex: User-agent: * Disallow: /blocked.php Source
