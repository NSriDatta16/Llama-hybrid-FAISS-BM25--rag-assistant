First, try to use a tool like IEdebugBar - it will show you all sent and received headers in a clean way. Second, have you verified that the cooky doesn't get send to the server? Since it seems you are trying to 'steal' a facebook session,I would assume that facebook will ignore a session-cookie coming from a browser with a different IP, UserAgent etc. Have you taken this into consideration?
