Flash AS3 - Click, drag and spin - check direction of spin

I'm using greensock tweenlite to click, drag and rotate a circular movieclip and have the following so far. What I need to do is determine the direction of the rotation and the speed, i.e. if the user is spinning the wheel to the right, store this direction in a string variable say and the rotation speed in a number variable. I've tried numerous different things with the mousestart and move coordinates and with the vinyl_mc rotation coordinates but can't get anything reliable. Is there a way I can determine the direction and speed and store these in variables? The app can be viewed at: http://s46264.gridserver.com/dev/dave/rotate/rotate.html and source fla is at: http://s46264.gridserver.com/dev/dave/rotate/rotate.fla.zip if this helps at all. Thanks. import com.greensock.*; import com.greensock.easing.*; import com.greensock.plugins.*; import flash.events.*; TweenPlugin.activate([ShortRotationPlugin]); var oldRotation,ax,ay,bx,by,thetaA,thetaB,delTheta,newTheta:Number; var direction:String; function dragger(evt:MouseEvent) { if (evt.type == MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN) { stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragger); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dragger); oldRotation = vinyl_mc.rotation; ax = stage.mouseX - vinyl_mc.x; ay = stage.mouseY - vinyl_mc.y; thetaA = Math.atan2(ay,ax) * 180 / Math.PI; if (thetaA
