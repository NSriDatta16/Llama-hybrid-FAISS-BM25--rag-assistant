The covariance matrix for the error should be small but not zero, since this may cause convergence problems in the filter (See, for example, Särkkä, 2013, Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing ). The interpretation of the mean and covariance matrix of the parameter is that they are the prior parameters of the Gaussian in the Bayesian sense. You should put a large covariance if you do not have a good guess for the value of the parameter, otherwise the filter will take much time to converge to the correct value of the parameter (a small covariance matrix will put much weight on your prior guess).
