If you look at the function rmarkovchain , meaning you simply type rmarkovchain , you can spot the lines for (i in 1:n) { sampledValues 1) { for (j in 2:dim(object)) { pos2take that are those where simulation takes place. They rely on markovchainSequence and if you type again markovchainSequence , you can see that the simulation part is for (i in 1:n) { rowProbs which means there is nothing surprising in the way the Markov chain is simulated: given the current state (or state ), take the row of the Markov transition matrix rowProbs and sample (or sample ) one state according to the probability distribution on the states defined by that row outstate
