Is There A Better Way To Organize My Plist

I am making an iPhone app. Table view has 3 views:(1) muscles -> (2) exercises (for that muscle) -> (3) exercise's detail Here is the plist I currently have, its organized how it is because I followed a tutorial on how to make it work with tables and that is the format they used. Here are a couple pictures of my .plist. I have two pics so you can see the name tag for the muscle is still in the same list (just after the child items). http://www.box.net/shared/static/4i3yyjg0iq.png http://www.box.net/shared/static/b1kkep55vd.png Thanks! Edit: Here is the plist from text edit. (sorry for some reason I can't get the spacing right in for the post). ItemChild name Ab Roller name Ab Crunch Machine name Advanced Kettlebell Windmill name Abdominals name Abdominals
