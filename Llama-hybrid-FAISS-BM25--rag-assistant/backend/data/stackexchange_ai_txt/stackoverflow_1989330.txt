how to denormalize ranges and store them in a data warehouse?

My custom web servers report session information in the form of a wall clock timestamp (start of session) and the number of wall click seconds the session lasted. I want to store this information in a data warehouse (MySQL + start schema) in a way that will allow me to for example query the number of sessions for a particular entity at a specific time. A requirement is that we must be able to extract time series data that will be feed to a graph. Is there any other way to store the data than to insert a row for every absolute second of the session?
