How can I access the file I downloaded in the Internal Memory of my Android device. Since you used openFileOutput() to write it, you read it with openFileInput() . Meaning, I downloaded a file from the server on my device but I can't find it. You won't be able to see it, because you have no rights to view files on internal storage. The point of internal storage is for applications to store files, not for users to view files.
