Negative coefficients of regressors in arimax,should be positive

I have two years of daily time series inbound call centers data starting from Jan 2018 to Nov 2019. I am doing arimax and regressors are mainly promotional flag along with day of the week (sun, mon ...) and months taken after one hot encoding So I have six weekdays and 11 months. In the series every year in aug and nov, dec there is a peak in incoming call numbers as compared to any other months. So I was expecting +ve regressors coefficients for the three months but to my surprise all months are having negative coefficients. However if I took only these three months (Aug, Nov and dec) ignoring all other months then it becomes positive which is what it should be. Can anyone please suggest why the coefficients of these three months are negative?
