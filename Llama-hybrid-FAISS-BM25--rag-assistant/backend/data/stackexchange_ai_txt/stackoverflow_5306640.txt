How to set Bullet colors in UL/LI html lists via CSS without using any images or span tags

Imagine a simple unsorted list with some items. Now, I have defined the bullets to be square shaped via list-style:square; However, if I set the color of the items with color: #F00; then everything becomes red! While I only want to set the color of the square bullets. Is there an elegant way to define the color of the bullets in CSS... ...without using any sprite images nor span tags! HTML Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 CSS li{ list-style:square; }
