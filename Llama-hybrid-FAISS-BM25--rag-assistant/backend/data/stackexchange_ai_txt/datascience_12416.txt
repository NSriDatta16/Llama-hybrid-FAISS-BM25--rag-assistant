Cost functions in the context of Machine Learning often calculate some kind of metric that signifies how well your model is performing. A common one is for example the mean squared error, where you look at all your test examples where you know the true value and the predicted, take the difference between that and square it. By minimizing this error (cost function) you assume your predictions will be better.
