Since concentration is presumably a proportion value, between zero and one, a standard linear regression is probably inappropriate here (unless the outcome values are very tightly packed away from the boundaries). For this kind of response variable, it is common to use a transformation-based regression model such as logistic regression or beta regression. The details of these methods are beyond the scope of your question, which pertains to the adjustment for confounding factors. For this issue, you need to decide whether you just want to add terms for baseline effect for these factors, like this: ~ age + gender + healthy or whether you want to also include interaction terms, like one of these: ~ age + gender + age:gender + healthy ~ age*gender + healthy ~ age*gender*healthy The last case is the most general form, since it includes interactions between all of the explanatory variables. This will give you a more complicated interpretation, but it will allow differences in th effect of the healthy variable for people of different age and gender.
