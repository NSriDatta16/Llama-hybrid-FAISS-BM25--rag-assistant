My acid interpretation is: Believing that a mathematical model describes exactly all the factors, and their interactions, governing a phenomenon of interest would be too simplistic and arrogant. We do not even know if the logic we use is enough to understand our universe. However, some mathematical models represent a good enough approximation (in terms of the scientific method) that are useful to draw conclusions about such phenomenon.
