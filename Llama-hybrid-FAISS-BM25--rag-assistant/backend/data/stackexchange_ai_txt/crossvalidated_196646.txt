What is the significance of the number of convolution filters in a convolutional network?

What does the number of filters in a convolution layer convey? How does this number effect the performance or quality of the architecture? I mean should we always opt for a higher numbers of filters? whats good of them? and How does people assign diffrent number of filters for different layers ? I mean looking at this question : How to determine the number of convolutional operators in CNN? The answer specified 3 convolution layer with different numbers of filters and size, Again in this question : number of feature maps in convolutional neural networks you can see from the picture that, we have 28*28*6 filters for the first layer and 10*10*16 filter for the second conv layer. How do they come up with these numbers, Is this through trial and error? Thanks in advance
