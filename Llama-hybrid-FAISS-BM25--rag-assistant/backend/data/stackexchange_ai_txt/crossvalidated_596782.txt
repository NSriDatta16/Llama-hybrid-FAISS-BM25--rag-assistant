Calculate the daily standard deviation for time series (stock market) in R

I´m modeling with diffrent GARCH-Models the daily standard deviation of a stock market. That includes a rolling forecast model of the daily standard deviation. This works pretty well so far. To compare the rolling daily standard deviation I have to calculate the daily standard deviation of my underlying time serie (the stock market). When I use the shortcut sd(x) I only get one value. I´m looking for a time serie of every daily standard deviation that allows me to compare it with every day of my rolling model. Can anybody help me to model this in R?
