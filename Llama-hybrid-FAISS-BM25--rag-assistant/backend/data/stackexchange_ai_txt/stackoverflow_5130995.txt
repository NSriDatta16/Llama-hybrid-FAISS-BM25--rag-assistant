JSON Parser Error

I keep on getting a JSON parser error for the following data: [{"data":"Aerospace and Defense"},{"data":"Agriculture"},{"data":"Business Services"},{"data":"Chemicals"},{"data":"Construction"},{"data":"Consumer Goods and Services"},{"data":"Education"},{"data":"Electronics"},{"data":"Energy and Utilities"},{"data":"Environmental Services and Equipment"},{"data":"Financial Services"},{"data":"Food and Beverage"},{"data":"Healthcare Goods and Services"},{"data":"Industrial Goods and Services"},{"data":"Information Technology"},{"data":"Metals and Mining"},{"data":"Security Products and Services"},{"data":"Software"},{"data":"Telecom"},{"data":"Tranportation and Storage"}] Can anyone please identify what the error is? I was originally using "Aerospace & Defense" and thought that the special character might be the issue. But it doesn't look like it. I use the ASP.NET MVC JSONResult to pass this back to jQuery. FireFox and IE show the data being created correctly, but the jquery parser throws an error. I have heard that the parser has been modified significantly in the new jQuery. Any help would be highly appreciated.
