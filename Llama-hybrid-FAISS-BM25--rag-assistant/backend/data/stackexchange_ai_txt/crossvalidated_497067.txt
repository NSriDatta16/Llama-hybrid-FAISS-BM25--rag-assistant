Uncertainty and distribution of a percentile

In a Bayesian analysis (Normal case), it is possible to obtain a posterior distribution of the mean and variance. We can also obtain quantiles, median,... of these distributions. My question now is: is it possible to obtain the quantiles of the model itself (so not of the model parameters, but of the model using those parameters). And is it possible to obtain a distribution of a quantile (for instance, a 95% quantile) taking into account the uncertainty of the mean and the variance. $$ y \sim N(\mu, \sigma) $$ $$ \mu \sim N(0, 10000) $$ $$ \sigma \sim G(0.0001, 0.0001) $$ So I want to calculate the percentile of the Gaussian model of $y$ , taking into account the variability of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , and I want to explore the uncertainty about that percentile.
