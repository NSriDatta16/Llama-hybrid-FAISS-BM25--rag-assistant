First off, never allow more than one instance of MySQL to use the data files at the same time. It's a recipe for disaster. Second, why do you need MySQL's server on both machines? Why not just use the client on the linux machine to connect via the network to the server on the windows machine? Third, if you really must do this, I'd suggest enabling master-master replication between them. So each server would have its own storage, and would communicate the changes back and forth automatically. Edit Ahhh, wait... Are you dual booting? If so, you need to make sure the entire /var/lib/mysql directory is readable by the mysql user. It's not enough for you to just chmod the my_db folder. Oh, and how did you link the mount point to the data directory for MySQL (That's not in your list of commands)...
