How can I safely change listeners?

I have an application where I need to change font sizes frequently. A question posted a year ago on this forum ( Change just the font size in SWT ) gave me some of the information I needed, but I've still got some unknowns I haven't figured out yet. In particular, someone signing as hudsonb offered a helpful code fragment which I'd like to reproduce below: FontData[] fontData = label.getFont().getFontData(); for(int i = 0; i Suppose I used code like this to change font sizes frequently. Aren't I creating a whole sequence of DisposeListeners, and adding them to the label's listener queue? Don't I need to remove the previous listener each time before adding a new listener? Or is there some mechanism I don't understand that makes this unnecessary?
