If your form has become so big and complex that you suddenly desire to organize it in some way it is a strong hint towards the need of refactoring, which will improve readability, testability and maintainablity of your code. How you actually refactor depends upon your actual code. Is it a form that has a lot of controls? Think about splitting it up in separate UserControls where each of them displays a certain aspect of your domain data. Do you have a lot of interaction logic, reacting to a lot of events? Maybe introduce a some sort of Controller or EventAggregator. There are a lot of well known patterns that can help you organize your UI and domain code. This series talks about just that and introduces you to patterns MVC, MVP, EventAggregator and much more. It discusses the patterns in the context of windows forms just as you need it.
