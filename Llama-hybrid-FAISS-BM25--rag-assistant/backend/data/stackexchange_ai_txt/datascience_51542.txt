Using Matplotlib

I am new to data science. I use Anaconda on windows 7. I plotted a sine curve by doing the following on iPython: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000) y = np.sin(x) plt.plot(x, y) And I got this: But when I got ready to name the axes, the curve disappeared. I wrote this code: plt.xlabel("Time") And I got this: I also wrote this: plt.ylabel("Speed") And got this: The lecture video I use as a guide does not display images until the tutor enters the code "plt.show()". That gives me the impression that iPython adds all the information together behind the scene and displays the final result on request. But as you can see, my iPython displays the image without the "plt.show()" code and does not add previous instructions. So, what should I do? (i.e. how can I plot a curve with labelled axes?)
