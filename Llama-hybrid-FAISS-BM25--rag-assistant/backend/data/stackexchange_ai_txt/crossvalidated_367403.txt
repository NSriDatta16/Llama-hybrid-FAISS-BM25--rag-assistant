Handle Categorical Variables in Machine Learning in Python

I have $4$ variables in the data-set, each has more than $50$ levels in them. I want to include all these variables in my predictive model. How should I handle these categorical variables? If I do label encoding, $0\dots n-1$ numbers will be assigned to the levels in the variable, but won't this going to make the levels ordinal? I want to try models like K-NN, Random Forest, Deep Learning, SVM. I am using Python for model building.
