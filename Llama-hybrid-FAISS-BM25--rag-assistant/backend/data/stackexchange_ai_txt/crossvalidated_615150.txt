There's no “the” linear classifier, but there are different linear classifiers. Wikipedia mentions examples of a few of them. Linear probability model is one of them and the simplest one. It is just linear regression fitted to data with binary labels. Other models like perceptron, logistic regression, LDA, etc don't have closed-form solutions, but we have efficient algorithms for fitting them.
