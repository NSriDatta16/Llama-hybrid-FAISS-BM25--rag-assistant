Replace curly-braced placeholders containing dot-delimited values with values from a 2d array

I have a paragraph of text like: $paragraph = "Hello there {Customer.name}, You are {Customer.age} years old. You were born in the year {Customer.birthdate}"; I want to replace this with contents of an array such as array('Customer' => array('name'=>'Tom', 'age'=>8, 'birthdate'=>'1980-01-01')) My question is what is the best way to go about doing this? If you have a suggestion on how to format the text that would also be helpful. I am guessing you would have to use some kind of regular expression, maybe preg_filter() or preg_replace() .
