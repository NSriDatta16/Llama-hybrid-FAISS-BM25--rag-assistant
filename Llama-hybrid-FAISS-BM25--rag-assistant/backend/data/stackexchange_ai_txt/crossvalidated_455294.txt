They are telling you whether the correlation at that lag is significant. Imagine if you have your samples all independent in the time series (which is the null hypothesis), the correlation at that lag will be calculated as $ var( Corr(x, y) ) = var( \frac{Cov(x, y)}{\sigma_x * \sigma_y} ) = var( \frac{\mu_{xy}- \mu_x * \mu_y}{\sigma_x * \sigma_y} ) = var( \frac{\mu_{xy}}{\sigma_x * \sigma_y} ) = \frac{ (\mu_x^2 + \sigma_x^2)*(\mu_y^2 + \sigma_y^2) - \mu_x^2 * \mu_y^2}{n * \sigma_x^2 * \sigma_y^2} $ When $x$ and $y$ are with mean 0, you get $ var( Corr(x, y) ) = 1/n $ . Thus, if you are looking for the 95% confidence interval, you have $ [ -1.96/\sqrt{n}, +1.96/\sqrt{n} ]$ .
