Time series models are statistical models where data is an ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals. (See: NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods ) LOOVC or k-fold CV are not appropriate for time series as they do not opperate within the constraints of the definition of time series models. In LOOVC or k-fold CV, you would shuffle your data (shuffle past values with future values) and split the data into partitions. Each partition would loose order of sequence and thus lose significance as values occurring over time. Simply, LOOCV and k-fold CV are appropriate for models that assume data is identically and independently distributed ( iid ). An alternative to LOOCV and k-fold CV are time series CV methods. After a quick search, I believe this is post describes the methodology Choosing inner cross validation strategy for modeling time series data Also, you can see that depending on the tools you use for modeling, there may already be time series specific CV tools. See the following example: sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit Note that unlike standard cross-validation methods, successive training sets are supersets of those that come before them.
