renewed certificate and app provisioning profile, but it still said provisioning profile expired

My certificate had expired, so I renewed the certificate and created the new provisioning profile with same app bundle id(app identifier). I added the certificate file to 'keychain access' and added the provisioning profile to 'xcode'. I could see the new provisioning profile in Organizer but when I installed the ad hoc version to my ipod, it still reported provisioning profile expired :-( Welcome any comment Thanks
