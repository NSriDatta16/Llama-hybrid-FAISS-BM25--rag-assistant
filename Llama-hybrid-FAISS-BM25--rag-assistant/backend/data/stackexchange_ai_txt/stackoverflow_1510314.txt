No, you can not. An example definition of select list for Sybase can be found here , you can easily find others for other DBs The reason for that is that the standard methods of selection - "*" (aka all columns) and a list of columns - are defined operations in relational Algebra whereas the exclusion of columns is not Also, as mentioned in Joe's comment, it is usually considered good practice to explicitly specify column list as opposed to "*" even when selecting all columns. The reason for that is that having * in a joined query may cause the query to break if a table schema change introduces identically-named fields in both of the joined tables. However, when selecting without a join from a very wide and often-mutating table, the above rule may not apply, as having "*" makes for a good change management (your query is one less place to fix and release when adding new columns), especially if you have flexible DB retrieval code that can dynamically deal with a column set from table definition instead of something specified in the code. (e.g., 100% of our extractors and loaders are fully working whenever a new column is added to the DB).
