Jquery UI sortables clone "not working"

hope you can help with this one (or even improve it - which won't be difficult!) I am using UI sortables and tabs. What I can do is drag drop from column to column and manipulate the array/s to serialize it/them. In short I have 2 cols. "col_a" and "col_b". col_a has 2 tabs Items. Can move from col_a to col_b but if you move "back" from col_b to col_a I want the draggable to ONLY go back into it's "parent" tab if you understand that one. That is really what I would like to do OR only drag a clone of the draggable from col_a to col_b leaving the original in col_a. Then somehow (best way not sure yet) to "destroy" the draggables in col_b if they are "returned" to col_a. $j(function() { $j("#col_a,#col_b").sortable({ connectWith: '.column', helper: 'clone' stop : function () { var result = $j('#col_b').sortable('toArray'); } $j(".column").disableSelection(); }); Both col_a and col_b have the CSS class .column
