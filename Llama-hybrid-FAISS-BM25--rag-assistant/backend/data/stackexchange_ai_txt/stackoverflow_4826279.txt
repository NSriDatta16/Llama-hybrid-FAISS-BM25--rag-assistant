if the question is how to bind the switch in IB to your function -(void) switchforSounds:(id)sender the answer is declare it like this: - (IBAction) switchforSounds:(id) sender in your .h and .m file respectively. right click on the switch in IB, you will see all events it can respond to. Choose changeValue event. Click in the hook near it and drag to the File's Owner element in your IB'c controller file. When you leave the mouse it's supposed to show you all IBAction selectors you've defined in your controller class. Choose switchforSounds. Done. Hopefully i understood your question right.
