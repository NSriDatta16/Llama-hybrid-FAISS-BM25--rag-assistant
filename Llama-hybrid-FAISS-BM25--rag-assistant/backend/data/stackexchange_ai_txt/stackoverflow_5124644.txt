Magento remove & synchronize google base items by script in magento

I am using magento 1.3.2.4 and my problem is that sync & deleting google base items one by one takes a long time using the control panel. So I want to know how to create a script that I can use in command line that sync & delete all items listing on google base in magento. I need to be able to relist items too.
