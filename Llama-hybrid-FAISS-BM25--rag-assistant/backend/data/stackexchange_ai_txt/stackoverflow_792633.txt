yuku was going along the right lines but what you want to do is get the contents of the loaderInfo which is actually the clip that is loaded in. something like private function onComplete(event : Event) : void { var loadedClip : MovieClip = LoaderInfo(event.target).content; loadedClip.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, function(event : MouseEvent) { loadedClip.startDrag(); }); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, function(event : MouseEvent) { loadedClip.stopDrag(); }); }
