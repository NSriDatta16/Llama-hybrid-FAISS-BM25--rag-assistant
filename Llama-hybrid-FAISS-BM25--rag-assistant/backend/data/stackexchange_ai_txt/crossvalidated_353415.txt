Seasonal ARIMA estimate with non-significant variance

I'm trying to fit a seasonal ARIMA model for a real data time series, 300 samples long, sawtooth looking. I'll write down a resume of my work trying to be clear without many plots. The ACF of the original data slowly tapering towards 0 and the value PACF(1)=0.8 both suggest a non-seasonal differencing of order 1. As a consequence, both ACF and PACF correlations of the differencied data fall in the 95% confidence interval except for ACF(43)=+0.5 and PACF(~40)=-0.3. This value roughly corresponds to the period of my spikes in the signal. I therefore applied a seasonal differencing for seasonality=43 multiplied by the non-seas. differencing. The correlograms follow: What are the negative correlations at lag=1 telling me, now? Maybe differencing is too much and an AR(1) should be employed? However, I tried some models with combinations of AR(1), MA(1), SAR(1) and SMA(1) and I got from minimization of AIC and BIC the following best models: $$(1,0,0)\times(0,1,1)_{43}$$ $$(1,0,1)\times(0,1,0)_{43}$$ $$(1,0,0)\times(0,1,0)_{43}$$ For example, the residuals correlograms for the latter: which look not bad to me even though some significant spikes around the lag of seasonality remain. Can be this due to the imperfect seasonality (data are from extremely fine sampled measurements!)? Anyway, I have other two concerns: the estimated variance of the model is $\sigma=1.7\times 10^{-10}$ with st. error$=4.6\times 10^{-8}$ which gives a t-statistic$=0.002$ really low! the qq-plot of residuals shows a non-agreement with the Gaussian distribution: In conclusion, how much can I trust my estimated model given these two problems?
