There's no mock implementation for Hibernate criteria at the present time. You'll need to use integration tests. However, Burt's recommendation of making this a static finder method is a good one for code organization. You should also look at named queries, described at http://www.grails.org/1.2+Release+Notes , for a nice syntax for this.
