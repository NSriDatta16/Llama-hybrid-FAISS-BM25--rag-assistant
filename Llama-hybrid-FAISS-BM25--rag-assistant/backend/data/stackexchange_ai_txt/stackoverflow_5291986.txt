How do you draw a circle around something?

Using html, css, javascript and jQuery, I would like to present the user with a paragraph with the directions: "Read the story. Then, circle all the nouns." Q: How would I draw a circle around a word when the user clicks on it? It's ok if every word has to be in its own span tag.
