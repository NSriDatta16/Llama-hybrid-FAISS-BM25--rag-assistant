Request all titles by actor using LINQ to Netflix OData

I'm experimenting with LINQPad to use LINQ to query the Netflix OData. I'm trying to search for all films with a particular actor in. For example: from t in Titles from p in t.Cast where p.Name == "Morgan Freeman" select t.Name this results in: NotSupportedException: Can only project the last entity type in the query being translated I also tried: from p in People from t in p.TitlesActedIn where p.Name == "Morgan Freeman" select t.Name which results in the following error: NotSupportedException: The method 'Select' is not supported I've tried a few other approaches, such as using Id's in the where clause, and selecting different things, but have got nowhere.
