When you train a classifier $f$ using a set of $m$ training classes $C=\{1,2,...,m\}$, it is possible that your classifier will encounter some class $c\notin C$ after it has already been trained. For instance, in object recognition, it may not be possible to obtain a training example for every type of object your sensor will encounter in practice. As you pointed out, if $f$ is not trained to recognize $c$, then it's impossible to make a correct decision! The classifier has been trained under the closed set assumption : the only classes we will encounter in the field are in $C$. Depending on the problem at hand, this can occur quite frequently, and classification errors can really pile up. Researchers have been trying to deal with this problem since the 1970s or earlier under a number of names. In the past, these approaches were usually called something like "classification with reject option," but lately the term open set recognition has been popping up. Whatever the case, many of these approaches boil down to picking some score threshold $\tau$ below which we forgo a decision on the input and simply call it "unknown." They typically deal with rejection at the classifier output, rather than the feature level (the decision is based on $f(x)$ rather than $x$). In your example, we might build a classifier that returns probabilities that the example is red or blue : $$ \begin{split} p_1 &= f(y=\texttt{red} | x)\\ p_2 &= f(y=\texttt{blue} | x) \end{split} $$ Then, we can define a decision function $$ \delta_\tau(p_1,p_2) = \begin{cases} \operatorname{argmax}(p_1,p_2) & \text{if } p_1>\tau \text{ or } p_2>\tau\\ \text{unknown} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ or some incarnation thereof. In that case, the output would hopefully look something like A B Output -------------- 1 0 red 0 1 blue 1 1 unknown Now, this doesn't directly address the problem of getting the magenta label into the classifier. In fact, this is an open topic of researchâ€”check into open world recognition .
