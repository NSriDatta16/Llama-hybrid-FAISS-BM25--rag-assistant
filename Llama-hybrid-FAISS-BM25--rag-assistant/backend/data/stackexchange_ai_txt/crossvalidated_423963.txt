Is learning label embedding by factorizing label co-occurrence matrix unsupervised learning?

I was working on creating embeddings for medical concepts. These terms/phrases are used for annotating biomedical documents. Now usually the method of creating a co-occurrence matrix and then factorizing it to obtain dense, lower-dimensional vectors is termed as unsupervised learning since annotated data is not involved. I am using the same process but for the annotations themselves. Does this qualify as supervised learning since I need annotated data or does this qualify as unsupervised learning since the method of obtaining the embeddings is unsupervised?
