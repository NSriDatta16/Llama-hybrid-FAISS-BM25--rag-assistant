Regular Expressions: RegEx for determining valid PHP class property names?

I am using PHP's magic __set and __get methods to access a private array in a class. Use of the class can include "setting" new properties as well as using existing ones. I want to make sure the property names created or requested (i.e. $myObj->FakeProperty ) are valid according to the following rules: Property names must begin with either a letter or underscore [A-z_] If it begins with an underscore, it must be followed by a letter So long as the first two rules are met, the name may contain any of [A-z0-9_] My current RegEx isn't doing the trick; with my test values, _12 always falls through the cracks. Test Fields: albert12 12Albert _12 _Albert12 _12Albert _____a_1 RegEx: ^(?=_*[A-z]+)[A-z0-9_]+$
