You mean you want to generate variables named var0, var1, var2 and use them in your code. What is the difference when you use var[0], var[1], var[2], ..... BUT You can generate a Java class dynamically at runtime which implements an Interface you are using in your normal code. Then you compile this class using a compiler (For example Janino) and then load the class at runtime. Than you have created a class dynamically. But i wonder, whether this is necessary for your usecase. EDIT I dont now for which usecase you are using this parameters but dynamic arguments you can use in Java like this example from here // calculate average public static double average( double... numbers ) { double total = 0.0; // initialize total // calculate total using the enhanced for statement for ( double d : numbers ) total += d; return total / numbers.length; } // end method average
