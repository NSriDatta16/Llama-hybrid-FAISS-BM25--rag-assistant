I can see several problems here: First of all, you cannot a have super-user account in Exchange 2007 and 2010 to access mailboxes. If a user is a member of any Exchange administrative groups, he will be explicitly denied to access mailboxes via the EWS API. He can be a Domain Admin or Local Admin though. So check the account you use in EWS isn't. In mixed environments like yours - 2003 & (2007 or 2010) having a CAS server on 2010 doesn't mean you can access 2003 mailboxes from EWS. The only way to do that is to migrate the mailbox from 2003 storage to 2007 storage. This is probably the reason you get the first exception, as well as the second one. I'm not really sure how Public Folders are working internally in Exchange, never worked with them, but I can suggest this is just a special kind of a mailbox. In this case your user has to have the impersonation permission. Granting full-access from exchange console won't help - it was enough only in 2007. Here is a link how to turn on impersonation in 2010: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb204095.aspx Welcome to Exchange world.
