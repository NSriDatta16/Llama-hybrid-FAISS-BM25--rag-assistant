Understanding Bernoulli and logit function

currently I am reading a paper and trying too implement what is in the paper by myself. I plan to implement using R. I'm stuck at below part: I understand the X and Z but I'm not familiar with Bernoulli and logit function. I only know what is Bernoulli from Bernoulli proocess (like in the basic probability class). I don't understand the meaning of Bernoulli in the paper like above and furthermore the logit. Maybe you can help me explain what it is and how to implement it in R? Thank you. Update, I have write the R code and I think it is working. In the paper, further, the writer said the sample size is fixed, n=1000. I have tried the function in R and I get this kind of output: 1 2 3 4 5 T1 803 511 380 137 843 T2 819 528 348 100 839 Y 815 486 361 101 483 From what I expect, the logistic regression only accept output to be binary, either 0 or 1. In this problem, I expect the dependent variable Y should be 0 or 1 and the T1 and T2 probably as it is. Do I need to change the sample size for Y to only 1 and not 1000?
