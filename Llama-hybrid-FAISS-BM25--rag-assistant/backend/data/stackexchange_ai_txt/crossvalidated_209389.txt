Flexible prediction with neural network or other method

I want to use neural network for my first time, but I need to check if it fits for my case. So, my idea is to teach a model on data like Y = f(X1, X2...XN) and then to be able to predict both options: 1) predict Y-value on the full input (X1, X2...XN) , where I defined X-values 2) predict most probable Y-value on the partial X-input (let's say I know X2, X3, but I dont know X1 and I want my model to set the most probable X1-value). Could you advise something to start? Is it possible with neural networks to predict both complete input as well as partial input ? edition My problem â„–2 could be similar to imputation, but I am not fully agree. As I have seen, it something like replacing missing values with median or average or whatever. I want my model to predict it basing on other parameters. Let's say, I know, my model has a training data like month number, sunny days qty (number of sunny days in that month) and a target value - Y (sales) month sunny days qty Y (sales of caps) 8 7 10 9 6 8 And now i want to predict Y (sales) in month 12, but I dont know the number of sunny days. I know only the month number. I want my model to predict sunny days values as well as Y. Is it possible ?
