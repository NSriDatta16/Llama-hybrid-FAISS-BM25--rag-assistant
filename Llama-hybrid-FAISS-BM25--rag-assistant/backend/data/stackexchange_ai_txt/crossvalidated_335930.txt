Because linear model has limited "capacity" to perform the task. Consider the data set shown here Why does feature engineering work ? , we cannot draw a line to separate two classes. On the other hand, using nonlinear transformation (feature engineering), the classification tasks becomes easy. For neural network, it is usually a very big and complex system that uses nonlinear transformation on original data to achieve better performance.
