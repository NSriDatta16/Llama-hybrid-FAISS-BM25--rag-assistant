Just a hunch, but what looks odd to me are these lines: [[self parentViewController] presentModalViewController:controller animated:YES]; and [[self parentViewController] dismissModalViewControllerAnimated: YES]; True, I don't know about your arrangement of view controllers, but isn't it a little unusual to reference [self parentViewController] directly? You're heavily coupling three view controllers (the caller, the parent, and the modal view); this discourages code/view controller reusability (e.g. if you wanted to reuse the same view controller inside a different view hierarchy elsewhere in the app). The only reason I can imagine you may want to do this is that the parent is a UINavigationController/UITabBarController, and since that is the top view, you want that view controller to be presenting the modal. In this case I use: [[self navigationController] presentModalViewController:controller animated:YES] Or better yet, in a Tab Bar situation, I have my root view controller register an observer listening for notifications, and then all modals are launched from the root view controller. Could I get a little more detail about your view stack? Also, could you try once just calling on "self" instead of the parent and see what happens?
