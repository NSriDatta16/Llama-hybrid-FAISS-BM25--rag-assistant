Gaussian process likelihood with binned data

I have some binned data (no access to underlying info) and prior knowledge that the value in each bin smoothly varies in space. So I am modeling using a Gaussian Process prior, which according to Rasmussen has the following marginal likelihood: $$ p(\mathbf{y}) = (2\pi)^{-N/2}{|K|}^{-1/2}\exp \left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{m})^\intercal K^{-1}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{m})\right) $$ Where $K$ is the covariance, $y$ are the observations, and $m$ is the mean function. How should we adjust this when instead of point observations $\mathbf{y}$ we have average values for finite volumes (in 3D)? What I have so far : Perhaps the answer is to replace $\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{m}$ with the difference vector with entries: $$ \begin{align} d_i &= \int_{V_i} (y_i-m(\mathbf{r}))d\mathbf{r} \\ &\approx |V_i|(y_i-m_i) \end{align} $$ Where the last approximation has volume $|V_i|$ and $m_i$ is the mean function evaluated at the bin center. A related question: how would we sample densities from this distribution?
