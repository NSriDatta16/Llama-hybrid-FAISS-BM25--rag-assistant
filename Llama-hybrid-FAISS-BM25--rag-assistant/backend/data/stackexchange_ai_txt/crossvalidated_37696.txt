I found this as a partial explanation in http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adehabitatHS/vignettes/adehabitatHS.pdf . The function dudi.pca is to be used when all the variables present in the data.frame are numeric. The function dudi.acm is to be used when all the vari- ables present in the data.frame are factors. The function dudi.hillsmith (or, equivalently, dudi.mix) is to be used when the data.frame contains both types of variables. These functions, used as a preliminary to the GNESFA, are needed to scale the table suitably (so that all the variables have the same mean and the same variance), and to compute the weights of the variables in the analysis. For example, the use of dudi.hillsmith on a table containing a numeric variable and a factor with four levels ensures that the factor will have the same weight in the analysis as the numeric variable I can only assume the dudi.hillsmith is scaling the data correctly and I do not need to scale my data before using the k-select.
