How probable is the best fit of a model to lie outside 68% limit constraints on model parameters?

I am running MCMC analysis on a model using an observation data point. After the MCMC run has converged, when I check the best fit parameters and compare it to the constraints of the model parameters, I find that they are sometimes within 99% confidence limits of the model parameters but not 68% limits. How probable, is it? or am I making a mistake somewhere?
