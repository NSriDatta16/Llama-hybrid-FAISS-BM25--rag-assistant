Enforcing Different Type Parameters

Good morning, afternoon or night, When implementing, for example, ICollection > or IDictionary , is there any way I can enforce TKey and TValue to be different types? I know I can throw an exception in the constructors whenever typeof(TKey) == typeof(TValue) , but this doesn't seem neither the most elegant nor the most correct solution... Thank you very much.
