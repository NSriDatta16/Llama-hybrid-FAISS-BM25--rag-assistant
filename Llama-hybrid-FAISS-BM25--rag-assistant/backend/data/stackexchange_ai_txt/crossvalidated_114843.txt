Rank individuals according to 3 different scores

I'm looking for a technique that would help me rank individuals according to 3 scores A, B and C (each representing a separate score in 3 specific fields). A, B and C are all normalized value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the worst possible score, and 1 is the best possible score. I could simply average the three variables, except the probability densities of A, B and C are different and unknown. My level of understanding of statistics is just enough to feel that averaging is probably a terrible idea. What technique, if any, could help me order my individuals from best to worst? Do I need to know the probability density functions of A, B and C to do so? Any help and/or reading advice is appreciated.
