XGBoost training on sample of time series data

I am new to XGBoost and would like to use it on a time series dataset. Here is the scenario I'm faced with: The data set contains N samples of length T, with N>>T. I'd like to train an XGBoost model to predict the next H values, with H docs ) requires labels to be shape (N,). My question: How would one train using all N samples to predict the next H values?
