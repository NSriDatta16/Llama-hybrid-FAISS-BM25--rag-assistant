Get body of web page on address bar drag drop

I need to pull information from a web site. The user drags the address from IE to a C# win-form application. The web page they are dragging is not accessible by the address alone, saving the page to a bookmark brings me back to a useless page. How can I force a drag event to save the page to a local html file, and store that local file location in my win-form app?
