I am a Web Designer and recently I began using Wordpress . I've found it great so far, once I have my site ready in xHTML and CSS it only takes me a couple of hours to make the content editable. I have also created about 3-5 themes my self, I've found creating Child Themes and using Themes like Twenty Ten as a parent, so I can use their functions etc. I would highly suggest that you look into wordpress, especially if you want to speed up the process for creating websites.
