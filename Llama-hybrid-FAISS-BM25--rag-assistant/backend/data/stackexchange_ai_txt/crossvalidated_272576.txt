@Stephan Kolassa's answer was very good. Here I build in two other plotting ideas: It's helpful to see the relative N sizes at each level of the x-variable, Placements. These sizes can be indicated using hash marks. It can be convenient to show group (here, Ethnicity) labels alongside their lines, rather than in a separate legend. This becomes more and more applicable with larger numbers of groups. In this case I have set the random seed at 6 and have bypassed the "glm() and "predict()" commands. Instead I've plotted moving-average values using a lowess smoother. I've also changed N from 100 to 200 to better show plot features. library(Hmisc) plsmo(foo$placement, foo$disorder, datadensity = T, group = foo$ethnic, col=c('black', 'red','tan'), xlab = 'Placements', ylab ='Incidence of Disorder', ylim = c(0,1))
