Where are Windows Messages such as WM_LBUTTONDOWN, WM_COMMAND, and WM_CLOSE defined in the win32 C/C++ API?

I'm running through theForger's Win32 API Programming Tutorial . On page 4 he suggests it would be handy to find the list of #define statements in the API header files which list all the WM_* messages. I decided it probably would be worth my while to take a gander at them all, so I tried to find them, but was unsuccessful. If anyone could just send the name of the appropriate file and possibly its location relative to "windows.h" my way, it would be much appreciated. I have been rummaging around in my compiler's "include" folder for quite a while now, and for the life of me I can't find it, so I figured before I go ahead and look at every single include file (there are 294 of them), I should ask you guys, since I'm sure someone knows already. Thanks in advance.
