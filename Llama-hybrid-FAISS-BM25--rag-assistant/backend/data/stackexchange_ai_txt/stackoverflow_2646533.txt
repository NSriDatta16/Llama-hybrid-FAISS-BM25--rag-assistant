How do you persist a class on PostBack in an ASP.NET 3.5 Web Forms project?

How do I persist an ASP.Net class on PostBack? I've already taken the time to go to the database and fill my object with values when the page loads initially, so how can I save this object in an elegant way on a PostBack? The page that contains the custom object posts back to itself. For what it's worth I'm using C# in an ASP.NET 3.5 Web Forms application.
