I see you tagged this [iphone-sdk-3.0]. If you can use SDK 3.2 or later, you can do it easily with UISwipeGestureRecognizer . If you must stick with 3.0, you'll have to subclass UIImageView and process touchesBegan:withEvent: , touchesMoved:withEvent: , touchesEnded:withEvent: , and/or touchesCancelled:withEvent: .
