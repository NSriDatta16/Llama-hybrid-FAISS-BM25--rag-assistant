Executing Java JAR from PHP will not work

I have a java program that generates an HTML file. The Java program takes two input parameters: file1 and file2, the output file is specified by the "--file=". When executed from the command line (UNIX, Mac OS 10.6.2) it looks like this: "java -jar program.jar http://my.testsite.com/test1.html http://my.testsite.com/test2.html --file=/path/to/jar/new_file_1274119954.html Executing the program form the command line generates the file "new_file_TIEMSTAMP.html" Now I want execute this same line form PHP so I created the following script: $file1 = 'http://my.testsite.com/test1.html'; $file2 = 'http://my.testsite.com/test2.html'; $newFile = '/path/to/jar/new_file_'.time().'.html'; system ("java -jar program.jar $file1 $file2 --file=$newFile"); $handle = fopen($newFile, "r"); $output = fread($handle, filesize($newFile)); echo "$output"; Like you can see, I am not really interested in the console output, but rather in the file that is generated by the program. I have also use the following calls to execute the console command but neither of them works when executing this PHP script from my browser. system() exec() shell_exec() I am not sure if there is some special setting that I need to enable in my php.ini, or is something I am doing wrong, but I am not sure what to do now. Your help is appreciated PD: One error message I do get when using the system call is the following: javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: org.xml.sax.SAXException: setResult() must be called prior to startDocument().
