One such example is a theorem known as the delta method for finding the distribution of a random variable. The statement is: Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a sequence of random variables, and let $$ \sqrt{n}\left(X_i - \mu\right) \overset{d}\rightarrow \operatorname{N} \left(0, \sigma^2\right), \ \forall i. $$ Then, for any continuous function $g$ such that $g'(\mu)$ exists and $g'(\mu) \neq 0$, $$ \sqrt{n}\left(g(X_i) - g(\mu)\right) \overset{d}\rightarrow \operatorname{N} \left(0, g'(\mu)^2\sigma^2\right), \ \forall i. $$ Practically, this means that if a data set is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then transforming the data by $g$ yields a data set with mean $g(\mu)$ and variance $g'(\mu)^2\sigma^2$. One simple example of its use is buried in a book describing a program called MARK, on page B-7 (from the book's Appendix B , which also contains a detailed and very accessible derivation and explanation of the method): Suppose a researcher harvested $N$ fish and computed the average mass of a fish in the sample, $m$, so that one could estimate the total biomass $\hat B$ of the sample with $N \times m$. If the sample is reasonably large, the sampling distribution of $m$ is approximately Gaussian, by the Central Limit Theorem. Then $\hat B$ also has an approximate Gaussian distribution, with standard deviation $N \times \operatorname{SE}(m)$. Knowing this now allows us to conduct comparative statistical tests of biomass in different samples.
