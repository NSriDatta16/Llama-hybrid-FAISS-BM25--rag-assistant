BizUnit vs Visual Studio Team Test

With the release of BizTalk 2009 we can now use Visual Studio Team Edition 2008 to leverage some of the team test features. We can unit test maps, schemas, and pipelines ... but from what I can tell, that's about it. How would you unit test orchestrations for instance? Well I have been using BizUnit for years already and plan to continue to do so; What I like about BizUnit is that it is extensible and opensource So ... Who can give me a few reasons why I should be ditching BizUnit in favor of Team Test in Visual Studio?
