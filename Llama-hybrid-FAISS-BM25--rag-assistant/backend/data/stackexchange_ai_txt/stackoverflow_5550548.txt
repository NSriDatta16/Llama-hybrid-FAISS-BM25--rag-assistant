Embedding Ligature Font in an iPhone App

I was wondering what happens if I try to use a font with lots of ligatures in my iPhone App? I can't try the font because I need to buy it first, but wouldn't want to waste the money if ligatures were not possible in my iPhone app. This is the font I'm talking about: Dear Joe 3 I tried to use Arabic in my iPhone app and that works perfectly. Arabic is a script full of ligatures, but then again, Apple may be just supporting this particular ligature font for Arabic and no others. I'd be very grateful if you had any suggestions of how I could test this before I buy an expensive font which won't work... Thanks!
