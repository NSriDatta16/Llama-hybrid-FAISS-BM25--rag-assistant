adding 2d array column data together?

if you could possibly point me to the right direction, that would be great. i have tried researching about this but found no solution. i have a 2d array which holds student name and 3 grades (eng, maths, science.) student array (24,3) Now, i would like to use the data which is held within the array to create averages. I need a total class average for: maths column, eng column, and science. I also need an overall average for all subjects. the code i have used, so far, brings some odd results. studentarray(i,1) / count studentarray(i,2) / count studentarray(i,3) / count totalaverage = (studentarray(i,1) + studentarray(i,2) + studentarray(i,3)) / count the first 3 averages only give me result of the first entry within the array. then the calculation will just display the data shown within the 3 columns, eg 101010. any help would be much appreciated!!!
