VC will warn about many instances of this problem, but fails to detect some. I've repeatedly caught it missing this problem in function templates, but I've seen int in some plain functions, too. Treating warnings as errors (compiler switch for all warnings or pragma for specifc ones) will make it impossible to overlook those it finds. For those VC overlooks you have to use more thorough tools. AFAIK in VSTS you can also throw an /analyze switch for the compiler and have it find even more problems. There's also many versions of lint-like programs. Using some other compiler helps, too. Porting a VS project to GCC for the first time can be quite hard, but I think Intel's compiler can be used as a drop-in replacement for VC and compile VC projects right away. Comeau C++ , too, has switches for being quite VC-compatible and has incredibly good errors messages.
