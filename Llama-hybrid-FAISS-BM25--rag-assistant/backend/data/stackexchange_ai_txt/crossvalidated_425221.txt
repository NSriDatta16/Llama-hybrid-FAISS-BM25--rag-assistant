This is not really about the kind of encoding, as already explained in comment by @ttnphns. The kind (dialect) of encoding is more of an algorithm/implementation detail. For variable reduction (feature elimination) in logistic regression see How to reduce predictors the right way for a logistic regression model and this list of answered questions about rfe . If the question is about dropping/joining some of the levels of the categorical variable , that is a very different question. Mostly the answer is: don't do it, it changes the definition of the variable. The categorical variable with all of its levels is the variable, and should be dropt or kept as is . See Does it make sense to apply recursive feature elimination on one-hot encoded features? . If the problem is very many levels, see Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? . Part of the problem comes from a lack of abstraction. When the linear model is presented, with matrix language, as $$ Y=X\beta +\epsilon $$ this is not really where modeling starts. Some of the columns of $X$ really represent one 1D-variable, maybe a continuous variable like age , but others come from multi-df variables, maybe a spline or polynomial in age , maybe a factor, ... The matrix language used above forgets about this relations, so the multiple columns representing some logical variable are "forgotten", this relationship is unrepresented in the matrix formulation, which is a loss. Some modeling languages, like R, preserve this relationship, in R with terms objects. So, if RFE is used with one-hot coded columns, it should be done not at the column level, but at the terms level. With R, if you do the one-hot encoding not "by hand", yourself, but by declaring a factor variable and leaving the actual coding to R, the R in-built functions for stepwise modeling will use the terms structure and so do the right thing . If RFE is a good idea at all, is another question, see Are there any circumstances where stepwise regression should be used?
