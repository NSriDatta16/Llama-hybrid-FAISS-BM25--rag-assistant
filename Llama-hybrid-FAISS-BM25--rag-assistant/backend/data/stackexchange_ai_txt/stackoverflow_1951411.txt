I've typically used unions where you want to have different views of the data e.g. a 32-bit colour value where you want both the 32-bit val and the red,green,blue and alpha components struct rgba { unsigned char r; unsigned char g; unsigned char b; unsigned char a; }; union { unsigned int val; struct rgba components; }colorval32; NB You could also achieve the same thing with bit-masking and shifting i.e #define GETR(val) ((val&0xFF000000) >> 24) but I find the union approach more elegant
