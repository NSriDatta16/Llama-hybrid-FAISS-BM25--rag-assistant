For the theoretical algorithm that I would attempt, if I would write such a widget, would be something like: Record the amount of data transferred within a one second period (a literal KiB /s) Remember the last 5 or 10 such periods (to get an an recent average KiB/s) Subtract the total size from the transferred size (to get a "bytes remaining") ??? Widget! That oughta do it... (the missing step being: kibibytes remaining divided by average KiB/s)
