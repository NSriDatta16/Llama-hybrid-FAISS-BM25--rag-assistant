You can import a flv into a swf file using the Flash IDE - I've done that before. You can drop it onto the timeline of a MovieClip just like a sound and then drop that movieclip onto the stage for it to play. In Flash CS3 do File>Import>Import Video and select the flv. Choose the video and then on the next stop of the wizard choose "Embed ..... ", Here is a link to an Adobe Developer center article on embedding flvs into swfs . I have not done so myself, but I can see no reason why you could access the flv from the library of a loaded swf. FYI: It looks like this was a bug that was deferred. It doesn't look like Adobe currently allows embedding using the Embed meta tag. Here is a forum post on the issue and a link to the bug tracker .
