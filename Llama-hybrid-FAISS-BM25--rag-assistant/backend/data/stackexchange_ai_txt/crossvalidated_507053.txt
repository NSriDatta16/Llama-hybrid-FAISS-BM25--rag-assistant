Linear Regression Doubt

I'm studying about Linear Regression and searching about it I found an example that was a graphics that the axis X was the Year and the axis Y was Price, but my doubt is: When we are talking about Year we need to treat that as a Time Series problem, yes? Also, Linear Regression applies just when the variables are continuous, yes?
