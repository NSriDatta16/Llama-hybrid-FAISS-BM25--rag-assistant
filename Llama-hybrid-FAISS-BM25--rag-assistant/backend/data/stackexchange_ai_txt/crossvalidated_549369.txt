It seems you would like to represent a polytomous (6 levels) variable with all its levels , since there is no (natural) reference level . But that would lead to an overparameterized model (unless you leave out the intercept, which is maybe not natural when you have many factor variables). Your problem is that you want to interpret the results only by looking at a standard summary output table. But that is a very limited way to interpret model results. When you have an estimated model, use it to test parameter contrasts that are of interest to you Visualize the model!
