An equivalent of -javaagent in C#? Or: ways to use a java framework in C#

This is probably something I should be able to figure out by myself, but I'm not having much luck so I figured I'd ask. The issue: I'm translating a system from java to C# and they use a java framework that I'd really like to use, since it takes care of the most complex parts of the system, which I would otherwise have to implement myself. I have the source code of this framework. I know there are several possibilities for using java libraries in C# (although I'm not familiar with any of them, so I'd appreciate suggestions). So far I've thought of using IKVM.NET to generate a .dll, but I'm not sure what to do next, because in java in order to run the framework with your code you're supposed to use the option -javaagent by adding -javaagent:bin/deuceAgent.jar (where deuceAgent is the framework) to your java command line. I don't know what the equivalent in C# would be once I have my .dll, or whether there's an equivalent at all. Any help? Thanks so much.
