Performance issues when handling orientation configuration change and having multiple layout resources

The app I'm working on provides several layout resources for different orientation configurations: layout-land; layout-land-mdpi; layout-land-hdpi, etc. I've noticed that the performance degrades when the platform has to choose from three alternatives - it loads the layout at average of 494 ms (from 5 attempts). On the other hand when I define the layout only in 'res/layout' I've noticed that the performance improves and loads at average of 234.4 ms (again from 5 attempts). In both cases there was some random GC interference for about 100-120 ms during some of the tests. Has anyone else observed similar behaviour when you have multiple alternative layout resources for the platform to choose from? Thanks.
