I can't deploy to the device in Xcode

Xcode doesn't let me choose "Device". I only deploy to simulator, to iPad 3.2. Organizer tells me: "XCode cannot find the software image to install this version" when I connect an iPhone 3.1.3 firmware. I have Xcode 3.2.5 with iOS 4.2. What can I do to solve this?
