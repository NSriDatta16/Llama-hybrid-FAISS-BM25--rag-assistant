Prolog is popular for problems of this type. I've set up some simpler puzzle problems that have relatively nice solutions in Prolog. There are very elegant ways of solving these kinds of problems in Haskell, using functions and backtracking. A friend of mine solved a very vexing physical puzzle— Puzzling Pets —in just over 200 lines, of Haskell, including descriptions of all the pieces and everything. A good way to learn the relevant techniques would be to read John Hughes's paper Why Functional Programming Matters , install the Haskell Platform , and try your hand.
