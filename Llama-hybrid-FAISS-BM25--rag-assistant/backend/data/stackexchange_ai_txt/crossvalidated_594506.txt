Using $predicted values of a randomForest object as predictor in training for another randomForest

I'm wondering if there is any problem in using the predicted values (based on OOB observations) of a randomForest object as a predictor in the prediction of another variable. Something like this using R: rf_interim Ulitmately on new data, I want to predict z in a first random Forest and use that prediction to predict y in a second random Forest. Will it for example skew the error prediction or mess with any of the other outputs? Does this approach make sense when z is a strong predictor for y but not initially observable?
