Content-Disposition to set the file name is ignored in IE6. Url from web.xml is diplayed as file name

This is the code snippet I am trying to run. It is working fine locally, but if I try to run it in a unix server, the name of the down loaded file is displayed as the url mapped to the servlet in the web.xml instead of Report.xls . Please help meâ€¦ response.reset(); response.setHeader("Expires", "0"); response.setHeader("Cache-Control","must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); response.setHeader("Pragma", "public"); response.setContentType("application/vnd.ms-excel"); response.setHeader("Content-Disposition","attachment; filename=Report.xls;");
