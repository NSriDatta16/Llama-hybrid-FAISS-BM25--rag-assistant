You say that there is no connection between TUniv and HUniv . You're wrong. If the average of TUniv is dtermined in terms of HUniv , that 's a connection. And that connection should be modeled somehow. If this kind of connection occurs between only these two university types, you can easily solve it by using a friend declaration. But maybe the classes need a more extensive interface. Since C++ has no reflection, it may be a good idea to set up an object used to represent the graduate's university. That, by the way, reflects the real world better, too: a graduate actually graduates at an institution. If you do that, the institution (an object) can keep references to it's graduates. The different metrics can be defined as member functions on the university objects, and the metric function for the TUniv object will require an explicit reference (argument) to it's HUniv connection.
