Confidence interval for difference between two predicted probabilities in R

In R, I have estimated a logistic regression and calculated two predicted probabilities (with 95% confidence intervals) using the code shown: set.seed(1234) x = runif(100, 0, 1) y = rbinom(100, size=1, prob = x) model = glm(y ~ x, family = binomial("logit")) newdata = data.frame(x = c(.25, .75)) predicted.probs = predict(model, newdata, type="response", se.fit = T) upper.interval = predicted.probs $fit + 1.96 * predicted.probs$ se.fit lower.interval = predicted.probs $fit - 1.96 * predicted.probs$ se.fit Hmisc::errbar(newdata $x, predicted.probs$ fit, upper.interval, lower.interval) Rather than plotting these two predicted probabilities separately, I want to plot the difference between them, along with a 95% confidence interval for that difference. I know that the point estimate for that difference is simply the difference between the two predicted probabilities, but I do not know how to determine the confidence interval. I could simply add widths of the two original confidence intervals, but this seems wrong to me given that the two predicted probabilities are based on the same model and not independent. Is there a way in R to calculate a confidence interval for this difference between two predicted probabilities?
