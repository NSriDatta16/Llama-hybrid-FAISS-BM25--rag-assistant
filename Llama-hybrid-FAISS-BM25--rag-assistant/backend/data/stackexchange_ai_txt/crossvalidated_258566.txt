Porting an Excel Optimization Model to R

Apologies straightaway if this question is not appropriate for this forum...I've already been downvoted out of the house on Stack Overflow... I have built an optimization model at work in Excel....but Excel solver is not the best, to put it kindly. I get a different answer every time I run it... I'd like to try implementing it in R, both to teach myself a bit and to see if I can get something that is more useful. I'm not a complete R beginner, but I'm not far off. Here's the setup: There are a number of projects that the organization may pursue. Each project has a dollar cost for the complete project an "importance" weight - these are normalized so that the entire set sums to 1 a funding level - these are the decision variables, how much funding do I give it a "value curve" that translates funding [0%,100%] to value [0,1] The value curves can be of three types linear %funding=value i.e. 50% funding = 0.5, 75% funding = 0.75, etc exponential - there is a parameter (rho) that describes the shape of the curve S-curve So for a given project, you set a funding level, consult it's value curve to determine where on the interval[0,1] it falls, and multiply that by the weight. This gives you what I call the "realized value". The model picks funding levels that maximize the sum of the realized values subject to the constraint that you don't go over the dollars available. Any hints on how to start pursuing this in R?
