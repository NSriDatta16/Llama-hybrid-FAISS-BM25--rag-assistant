What is it written in ? If it is in AWT or Swing then you putting it in an Applet is just a packaging issue ( http://java.sun.com/applets/ ). You can also look at http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/jnlp/ which allows you to run a Java App from a web page If you are good at Swing you might want to look at GWT (Google Web Toolkit) which is an API very similar to Swing that translates into javascript to run natively on a browser.
