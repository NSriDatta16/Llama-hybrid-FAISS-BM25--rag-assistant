Objective-C methods are seldom named with get . The getObjects: method has get in it only because the result is placed in a buffer in an input argument. -(void)getObjects:(id*)aBuffer; ^^^^ ^^^^^^^ whereas your method is not filling a buffer, but return an array. Option (A) and (B) are out. Also, the kind of argument is usually part of the selector name (stuff before : ), e.g. -(UIView*)viewWithTag:(NSInteger)tag ^^^^^^^ // not view:(NSInteger)withTag -(CGPoint)convertPoint:(CGPoint)point fromView:(UIView *)view // not convert:(CGPoint)point from:(UIView*)view; so option (D) is discouraged. A detailed guideline for naming methods can be found in Coding Guidelines for Cocoa: Naming Methods . This guideline also include other conventions which you may be interested.
