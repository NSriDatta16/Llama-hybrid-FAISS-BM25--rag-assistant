Sorry, but "loose coupling" is not a coding issue, it's a design issue. The term "loose coupling" is intimately related to the desirable state of "high cohesion", being opposite but complementary. Loose coupling simply means that individual design elements should be constructed so the amount of unnecessary information they need to know about other design elements are reduced. High cohesion is sort of like "tight coupling", but high cohesion is a state where design elements that really need to know about each other are designed so that they work together cleanly and elegantly. The point is, some design elements should know details about other design elements, so they should be designed that way, and not accidentally. Other design elements should not know details about other design elements, so they should be designed that way, purposefully, instead of randomly. Implementing this is left as an exercise for the reader :) .
