How is cross validation different from data snooping?

I just finished "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" . I wondered whether using cross-validation to find the best tuning parameters for various machine learning techniques is different from data snooping? We are repeatedly checking which value of the tuning parameter results in a best predictive result in the test set. What if the tuning parameter we arrive at just happens to fit this particular test set by chance, and won't perform well on some future test set? Please excuse my novice understanding of machine learning, and I'm eager to be educated. EDIT: Please see @AdamO answer on the definition of "data snooping". I used the term very inaccurately in my question.
