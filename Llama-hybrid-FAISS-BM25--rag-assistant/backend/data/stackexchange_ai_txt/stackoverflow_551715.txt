All the replies (and the question) are based on the assumption that readability is solely the responsibility of the code writer. If you don't really want to read code and you have a give up reading now list (the code smells) which matches 99% of code available and you don't actually want to even think very hard about what some code is doing, then you're not going to find any code readable. Whatever rules we use today to make our code more readable are just going to look old fashioned and stupid in 10 years time. If you really want better code readability, read some old code (allow for the fashions of the time, that it had to run on a machine with 1000th of the speed and memory you have), make an effort to understand it and encourage someone else to do the same.
