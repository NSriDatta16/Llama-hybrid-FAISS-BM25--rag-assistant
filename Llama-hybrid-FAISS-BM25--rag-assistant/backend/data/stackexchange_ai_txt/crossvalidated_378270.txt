GAN generated images all similar per epoch

I'm working on a GAN using cifar-10 images. After each epoch I create 10 new random z noise vectors, and use them to create 10 images using the generator. All of the 10 images look very similar, but they really shouldn't because the z vectors are all random, and theoretically should be sampling from a broader distribution. It's almost as if the z vector has virtually no influence, and the model creates nearly the same thing regardless of the input. Why would this happen, is this mode collapse?
