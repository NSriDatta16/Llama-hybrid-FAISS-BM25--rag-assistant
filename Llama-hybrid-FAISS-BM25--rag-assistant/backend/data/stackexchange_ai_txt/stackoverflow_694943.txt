The typical memory model for C is that memory is a set of boxes; each box is 1 byte wide. Each box has an address in hexadecimal. A pointer is a variable that has an address in it. Regarding books/lectures, you're looking for a basic computer organization and architecture book. I've used these 3 books; I order them by "decreasing understandability". The classic is the last one by Patterson and Hennessy, but I find it the least readable. YMMV. http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computing-Systems-gates-beyond/dp/0072467509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238345302&sr=1-1 http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-Computer-Architecture-Harris/dp/0123704979/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238345245&sr=1-6 http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-Fourth-Architecture/dp/0123744938/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238345245&sr=1-3
