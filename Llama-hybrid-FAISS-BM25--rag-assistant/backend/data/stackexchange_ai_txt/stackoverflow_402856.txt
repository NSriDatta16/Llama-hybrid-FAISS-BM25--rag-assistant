The previous comments were dead on accurate that you can mine the data from the ReportServer ExecutionLog table in SQL Server 2000/2005 or the ExecutionLogStorage table in SQL Server 2008. If you are using form-based authentication to access the reports instead of windows authentication, then you are probably passing some unique UserID, CompanyID, CustomerID, or other value as a parameter in your reports. If this is the case, then the built-in table captures the parameters already. If you aren't passing the unique user identifier as a parameter, then you will probably need to rely on logging report executions in your application itself.
