One machine leaning approach would be to assign a score (or a class) to each of our samples. If you're using a continuous score you can then use a regression technique. If your score is more like categories, you can use a classification technique, like random forests. Then in the future you can use your fitted model to calculate the score or predict the class of new data. But of course, this is if you intend to use machine learning. If you just want to create a way of assigning a score based on a set of variables, then you're free to invent it as you like, as long as you can show that it's consistent.
