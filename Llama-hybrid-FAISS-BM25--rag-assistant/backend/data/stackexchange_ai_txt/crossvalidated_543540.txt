Different output for logistic regression between R and SPSS: how to get correct probability estimates?

I'm trying to fit a binomial logistic regression model, with the ultimate goal of estimating the chances of success/failure for the predictor variable over the outcome variable. For some reason I get different results when I do it in R and in SPSS . I don't understand what drives the discrepancy. In this investigation, I experiment about what influences people to share money with others versus keep the money to themselves. I hypothesize that a negatively-phrased message would make people more likely to share money than a positively-phrased message. I sample 89 people, where each person gets 10 experiment rounds (aka "trials"), to share money or to keep it. For now, let's ignore within-subjectness. I simply want to know how likely people are to share money in the positive condition vs. the negative condition. So I want to get an estimate that reflects the chances of sharing money in each condition. The outcome variable is dichotomous (binary) -- share or keep. The predictor variable is categorical (2-levels) -- positive/negative prompt message There's another predictor that I wish to control for (categorical, 2-levels) Therefore, in R I use the glm() function with family = "binomial" . my_fit Then, to get the estimates (chances) for the predictor variable I use ggemmeans() such that: ggemmeans(my_fit, terms = "predictor") ## # Predicted probabilities of outcome ## predictor | Predicted | 95% CI ## ------------------------------------ ## n | 0.71 | [0.67, 0.75] ## p | 0.16 | [0.13, 0.20] And in addition I get the p-value for the model, implying that predictor var is indeed "significant": broom::tidy(my_fit) ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## ## 1 (Intercept) 0.876 0.133 6.60 4.16e-11 ## 2 predictorp -2.57 0.168 -15.3 5.14e-53 ## 3 var_to_control_forB 0.0802 0.164 0.489 6.25e- 1 So far so good. Now, I wanted to double-check my results against SPSS . So for the same data I ran a binary logistic regression. The relevant output is given in the following table It is my understanding that the values in Exp(B) are in Odds-Ratio scale. to convert those values from odds-ratio to probability, we need to divide each value x by x+1. However, dividing 13.084 by 14.084 gives 0.93, clearly not the 0.71 we got from ggemmeans() in R . How come I don't get the same results when I do this logistic regression procedure in R versus SPSS ?
