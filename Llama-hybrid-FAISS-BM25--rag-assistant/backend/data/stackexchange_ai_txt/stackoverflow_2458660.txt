The enum package from PyPI provides a robust implementation of enums. An earlier answer mentioned PEP 354; this was rejected but the proposal was implemented http://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum . Usage is easy and elegant: >>> from enum import Enum >>> Colors = Enum('red', 'blue', 'green') >>> shirt_color = Colors.green >>> shirt_color = Colors[2] >>> shirt_color > Colors.red True >>> shirt_color.index 2 >>> str(shirt_color) 'green'
