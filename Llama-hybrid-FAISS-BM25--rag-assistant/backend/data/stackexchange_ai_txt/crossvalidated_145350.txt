The $R^2$ values returned by Cox survival analyses (or by other analyses of binary-outcome data as in logistic regression) are sometimes called pseudo-$R^2$ because they aren't the same as the $R^2$ values returned in ordinary linear regression. This page has a description of several types of pseudo-$R^2$ values. The approach used in coxph bases its $R^2$ value on the improvement in likelihood between the fitted model and a model without predictor variables (null model). That said, it sounds like camouflage did not have much of an effect on food "survival" in your study. If the overall survival analysis did not show significance, you shouldn't be examining $R^2$ values very closely in any event.
