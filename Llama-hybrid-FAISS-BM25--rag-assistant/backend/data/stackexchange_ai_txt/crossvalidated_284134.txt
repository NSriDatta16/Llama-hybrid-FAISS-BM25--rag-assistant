Measuring how effective training is

After 15 years post uni formally not using stats I find myself covering for someone at work for the next 6 months and it is rather stats heavy. The memory is very hazy but the mind is willing. I have to test how effective a training technique has been in my unit to see if it will be rolled out across the organisation. I have before and after data for measurable outcomes (both experimental group (n=2000) and control group (n=650) as well as some demographic info such as age, gender, time in service. I started using some variations of t-tests to compare means but now find myself at a loss at how to see if the areas like age/gender etc are having an impact. I am looking for help! I don't know what type of analysis to run or even if the t tests were the right thing to do! One of the other guys in the unit mentioned hierarchical regression but I don't know what that is or how to do it. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
