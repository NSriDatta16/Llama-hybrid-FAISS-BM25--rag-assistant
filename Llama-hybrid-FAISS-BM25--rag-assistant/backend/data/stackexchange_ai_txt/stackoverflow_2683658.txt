I use - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event in the ViewController to call resignFirstResponder on the active control from there. // edit: My Views contain several UITextFields; I want the keyboard to disappear when the user touches anywhere besides a TextField or the keyboard, so my ViewController has this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [currentTextfield resignFirstResponder]; } This causes the keyboard to disappear. (I keep track of the current textfield elsewhere.)
