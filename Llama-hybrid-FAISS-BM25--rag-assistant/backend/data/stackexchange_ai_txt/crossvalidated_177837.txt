It seen the post haven't been update for a while. I suppose you have found the answer by the time, but i have been struggling with the exact same problem. I've been doing weighted linear regression as describe in ASHRAE Guideline 14 for single x variable. But never been able to make multiple weighted regression that have no net bias error. Like you I have tried the matrix approach with octave and R .... β=(XTWX)−1XTWY ... which gave me net bias error even with single weighted regression. I have found this paragraph in page 139 of guideline 14: "The solution is to weight each data point by the length of the time period from that point. Most standard statistical packages can perform weighted regressions. If only a spreadsheet program is available, the same result can be obtained by including each point as many times as the length of data covered. In this example, that would mean 33 points from observation number 1, 27 from observation number 2, etc ." So I tried making ordinary multiple least squares regression (using HDD and CDD ) by this method using excel Analysis ToolPak and it work great. I have no more net bias error. I think you need to recalculate the stats because of the wrong number of data ( 365 instead of 12) Regards
