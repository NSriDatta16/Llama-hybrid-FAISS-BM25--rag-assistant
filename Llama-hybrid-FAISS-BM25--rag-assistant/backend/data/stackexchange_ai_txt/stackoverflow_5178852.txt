Finally, I found the solution to my problem. I looked into the Magento system log file (var/log/system.log). There I saw the exact error. The error is as below:- Recoverable Error: Argument 1 passed to Mage_Core_Model_Store::setWebsite() must be an instance of Mage_Core_Model_Website, null given, called in YOUR_PATH\app\code\core\Mage\Core\Model\App.php on line 555 and defined in YOUR_PATH\app\code\core\Mage\Core\Model\Store.php on line 285 Recoverable Error: Argument 1 passed to Mage_Core_Model_Store_Group::setWebsite() must be an instance of Mage_Core_Model_Website, null given, called in YOUR_PATH\app\code\core\Mage\Core\Model\App.php on line 575 and defined in YOUR_PATH\app\code\core\Mage\Core\Model\Store\Group.php on line 227 Actually, I had this error before. But, error display message like Error: 404 Not Found was new to me. The reason for this error is that store_id and website_id for admin should be set to 0 (zero) . But, when you import database to new server, somehow these values are not set to 0. Open PhpMyAdmin and run the following query in your database:- SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0; UPDATE `core_store` SET store_id = 0 WHERE code='admin'; UPDATE `core_store_group` SET group_id = 0 WHERE name='Default'; UPDATE `core_website` SET website_id = 0 WHERE code='admin'; UPDATE `customer_group` SET customer_group_id = 0 WHERE customer_group_code='NOT LOGGED IN'; SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1; I have written about this problem and solution over here:- Magento: Solution to "Error: 404 Not Found" in Admin Login Page
