You seem to be asking two different questions. The first one, about comparability, is a duplicate of Likelihood comparable across different distributions Then you say: In that case, that data point is twice as likely to come from the normal distribution given its parameter values vs. the T distribution given its parameters? You cannot conclude that! Likelihood values come from a probability model, yes, but they cannot therefore itself be interpreted as probabilities (neither as probability densities). The wording of your conclusion has a bayesian flavour, and such a conclusion would require some full bayesian model, with priors.
