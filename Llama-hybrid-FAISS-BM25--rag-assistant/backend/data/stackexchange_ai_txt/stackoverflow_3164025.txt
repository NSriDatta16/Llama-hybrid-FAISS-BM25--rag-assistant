I have used eXist . I'm not claiming that this is the best and most popular XML database, but it was OK for my purposes. It's simple to install and configure. It's opensource, it supports XQuery, XPath, and (what was really useful for my project) it has nice and simple SOAP and REST APIs. I agree with the comment above that XML databases are not really a good idea for large storages.
