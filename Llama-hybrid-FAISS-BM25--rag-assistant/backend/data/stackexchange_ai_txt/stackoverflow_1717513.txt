It seems you found a bug in WebClient/WebRequest, though perhaps Microsoft put that in intentionally, who knows. Nonetheless, when you pass in TW., the URI class is translating that to TW without the period. Since WebClient/WebRequest parse strings into URI, your . is disappearing in that world. You may have to use TcpClient to get around this and roll your own web client. Any variation of this: TcpClient oClient = new TcpClient("www.shareprice.co.uk", 80); NetworkStream ns = oClient.GetStream(); StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(ns); sw.Write( string.Format( "GET /{0} HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: {1}\r\nHost: www.shareprice.co.uk\r\n\r\n", "TW.", "MyTCPClient" ) ); sw.Flush(); StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); while (true) { int i = ns.ReadByte(); // Inefficient but more reliable if (i == -1) break; // Other side has closed socket sb.Append( (char) i ); // Accrue 'c' to save page data } oClient.Close(); This will give you a 302 redirect, so just parse out the 'Location:' and execute the above again with the new location.
