FWIW, if you are running within a GUI, then you can precisely re-arrange window sizes quickly and easily with the mouse. This isn't quite the same thing as you're asking for, but may be a handy alternative in some cases. You can click on any non-'active' area of the mode line (such as the buffer name) and then drag it up or down. Dragging side to side is more fiddly. You must click on the exact border between the two mode lines, and then you can drag left/right. For your specific example, I don't believe that is supported. AFAIK you can only reorganise the window splits within their existing 'parent' window (the upper split in this example). To make the upper-right window fill the vertical space you would either remove the bottom window with C-x 0 , or use C-x 1 to remove all other windows, and then re-split them in the desired manner. (Tangentially, I've often thought a custom library to 'rotate' the window splits would be a nice thing to have.)
