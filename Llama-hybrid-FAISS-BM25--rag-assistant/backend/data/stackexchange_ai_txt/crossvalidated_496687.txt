Are you just trying to forecast. Or explain the variables? If just forecasting try exponential smoothing which have a good track record and are robust to violations of methods. If trying to explain variables none of the options are easy to do. You have to start by seeing if autocorrelation exists and there are more serious issues than that. The simplest time series regression, if you want to explain a variable, is probably ARDL or regression with ARIMA error but there are many others. I would get a book on time series regression first (I have read many and still am not brave enough to try this).:) Unfortunately I have yet to find a good introductory time series book despite a lot of looking.
