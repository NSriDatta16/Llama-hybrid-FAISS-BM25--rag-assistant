XGBoost tree dump contains lots of empty trees

After fitting a regression model using XGBoost, I want to inspect the individual trees that were built. In the resulting table, I find a lot of 0-depth trees, i.e. trees with only a leaf node, and mostly NA values in columns "Split", "Yes", "No", "Missing" while a constant value for column "Quality" == 0.07 and a different value for Cover for each 0-tree. How do I interpret these lines? And how come they add value? Thanks a lot for the help!
