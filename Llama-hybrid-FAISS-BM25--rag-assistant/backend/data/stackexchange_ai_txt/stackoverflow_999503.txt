You really have to make some assumptions about your user experience to make an initial non-load-tested estimate of concurrent users. Start with some assumptions about a users session. Decent ballpark assumptions could be (this may not hold depending on the complexity or simplicity of your site): Each user hits a new page or resource every 5 seconds (assuming AJAXy) Each request takes an average of 200ms to process. It's generally good to have an average usage that is 25% of capacity to allow for spikes, even more for social network sites where the spikes could be larger. Then you would say: 200 users ( 200ms / 5s ) => 8 CPUs average need * 4 (for 25% load) => 32 CPUs. I don't think this is particularly language centric. Memory isn't expensive, have enough.
