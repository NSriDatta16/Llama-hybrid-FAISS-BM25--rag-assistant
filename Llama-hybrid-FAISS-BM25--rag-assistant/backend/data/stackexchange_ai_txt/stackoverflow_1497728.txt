I don't know if you can use this, but we generate content objects in Zope that get unique numeric ids based on current time strings, in millis (eg, 1254298969501) Maybe you can guess the rest. Using the recipe described here: How to convert an integer to the shortest url-safe string in Python? , we encode and decode the real id on the fly, with no need for storage. A 13-digit integer is reduced to 7 alphanumeric chars in base 62, for example. To complete the implementation, we registered a short (xxx.yy) domain name, that decodes and does a 301 redirect for "not found" URLs, If I was starting over, I would subtract the "starting-over" time (in millis) from the numeric id prior to encoding, then re-add it when decoding. Or else when generating the objects. Whatever. That would be way shorter..
