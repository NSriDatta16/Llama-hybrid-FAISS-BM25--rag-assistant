Is Statistical Significance only a concept in Frequentist statistics - not Bayesian statisticians?

Statistical significance is denoted to occur when: In statistical hypothesis testing, statistical significance (or a statistically significant result) is attained when a p-value is less than the significance level (denoted Î±, alpha) (According to Wikipedia). While I understand that there is such a thing as Bayes factors (equivalent to alpha values in Frequentist statistics). It seems that the definition of statistical significance is embedded in Frequentist statistics exclusively. Can anyone confirm this?
