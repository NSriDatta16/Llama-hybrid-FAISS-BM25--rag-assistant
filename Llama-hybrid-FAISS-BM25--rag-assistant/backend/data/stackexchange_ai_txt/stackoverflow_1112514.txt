The language has changed & the way things were done (i.e. drag/drop form, create a macro, modify a few line & you are done) will also change. It won't remain a tool, which a non-developer will find easy to use. Object model should remain same for basic stuff (Workbook, Worksheet, Range) etc. New set of things will get added & that will change the object model & hence new learning (e.g. Ribbon Interface) Not to forget, .net brings in its own concepts/complexity.
