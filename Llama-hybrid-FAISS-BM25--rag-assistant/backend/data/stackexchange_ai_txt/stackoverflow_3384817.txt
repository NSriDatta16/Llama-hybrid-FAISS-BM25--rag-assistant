The problem is that you're trying to initialize an instance variable in a declaration with an expression (a call to new is an expression). That doesn't work. Put the assignment in the constructor and it will work. Like this: class AgentPages { public function __construct() { $this->pages = array("List" => new AgentList(), "Details" => new AgentDetails(), "Form" => new AgentForm()); echo "Constructed"; } private $pages; }
