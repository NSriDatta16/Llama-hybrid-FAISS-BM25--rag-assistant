I agree with the binary search idea. However two points are important here: The range of valid answers to your question is from 0 to 64 inclusive . In other words - there may be 65 different answers to the question. I think (almost sure) all who posted the "binary search" solution missed this point, hence they'll get wrong answer for either zero or a number with the MSB bit on. If speed is critical - you may want to avoid the loop. There's an elegant way to achieve this using templates. The following template stuff finds the MSB correctly of any unsigned type variable. // helper template bool IsBitReached(T x) { const T cmp = T(1) = cmp); } template int FindMsbInternal(T x) { if (!bits) return 0; int ret; if (IsBitReached (x)) { ret = bits; x >>= bits; } else ret = 0; return ret + FindMsbInternal (x); } // Main routine template int FindMsb(T x) { const int bits = sizeof(T) * 8; if (IsBitReached (x)) return bits; return FindMsbInternal (x); }
