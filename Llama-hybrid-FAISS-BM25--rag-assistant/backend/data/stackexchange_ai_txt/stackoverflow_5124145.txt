getting and setting global co-ordinates of component in Flex AS3

Hi all I've some components in container, these components are drag-able in order to be drop at their target. But if they are being dragged away from their target then they should be replaced at their original position. Problem is that when I get x and y co ordinates at the mouse down event, and set that co ordinates on on mouse up event, but it is not going to its original position because x and y are its local co ordinates in container. I want to ask how to get global co ordinates and then set at other time, so that it will come to their original position. Can some one give me piece of code? Thanks in advance :)
