Not only is that a bad way to term things but that's not even a statistical dead heat. You don't use overlapping confidence intervals that way. If you really wanted to only say that Candidate A was going to win then Candidate A is definitely in the lead. The lead is 8% MOE 6.4%. The confidence interval of that subtraction score is not double the confidence interval of the individual scores. Which is implied by claiming the overlap of CIs (Â±MOE) around each estimate is a dead heat. Assuming equal N and variance, the MOE of the difference is sqrt(2) times 4.5. That's because finding the difference between the values would only double the variance (SD squared). The confidence interval is based on a sqrt of the variance therefore combining them is the average (4.5) * sqrt(2). Since the MOE of your 8% lead is approximately 6.4% then Candidate A is in the lead. As an aside, MOE's are very conservative and based on the 50% choice value. The formula is sqrt(0.25/n) * 2. There is a formula for calculating standard errors of difference scores that we could use as well. We would apply that using the found values rather than the 50% cutoff and that still gives us a significant lead for Candidate A (7.5% MOE). I believe that, given the questioners comment, and the proximity of that cutoff to the hypothetical one selected, that that was probably what they were looking for. Any introduction to both confidence intervals and to power would be helpful here. Even the wikipedia article on MOE looks pretty good.
