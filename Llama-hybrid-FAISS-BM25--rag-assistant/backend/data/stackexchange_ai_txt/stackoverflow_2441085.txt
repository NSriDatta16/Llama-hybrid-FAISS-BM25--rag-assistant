You probably want to move the loop into the task. As it is you just start all the threads and almost immediately you're back to single threaded. Usual microbenchmarking advice: Allow for some warm up. As well as average, deviation is interesting. Use System.nanoTime instead of System.currentTimeMillis . Specific to this problem is how much the threads fight. With a large number of contending threads, cas loops can perform wasted work. Creating a SecureRandom is probably expensive, and so might System.currentTimeMillis to a lesser extent. I believe SecureRandom should already be thread safe, if used correctly.
