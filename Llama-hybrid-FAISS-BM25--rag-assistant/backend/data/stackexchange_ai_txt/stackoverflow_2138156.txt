A server-to-server posting means that the program running on your server makes an HTTP POST to a gateway running on the vendor's server. The code fragment that you provided is HTML. You will need to have a code fragment in PHP (or some other language) to execute the POST. (If you did it in JavaScript, the post will come from your user's web browser, which is not what you want.) You want to use the PHP HttpRequest class. Take a look at Example #2 in the PHP Manual , reprinted here: setOptions(array('cookies' => array('lang' => 'de'))); $r->addPostFields(array('user' => 'mike', 'pass' => 's3c|r3t')); $r->addPostFile('image', 'profile.jpg', 'image/jpeg'); try { echo $r->send()->getBody(); } catch (HttpException $ex) { echo $ex; } ?>
