See http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/SynchronizationContext.aspx There is the answer you need. You must override SynchronizationContext to make it properly handling your operations. Read starting from: Notice that DoWork is executed on thread 11, the same thread as Run1. Not much of a SynchronizationContext into the main thread. Why? What's going on? Well... This is the part when you realize that nothing is for free in life. Threads can't just switch contexts between them, they must have an infrastructure built-in into them in order to do so. The UI thread, for example, uses a message pump, and within its SynchronizationContext, it leverages the message pump to sync into the UI thread.
