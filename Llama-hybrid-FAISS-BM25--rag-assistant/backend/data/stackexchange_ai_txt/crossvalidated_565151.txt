Can an additional class help to identify an 'other' label without training examples?

Suppose that we are going to build a model for identifying cats and dogs with neural networks. In the common way, we have 2 neurons in the last layer. If instead of two neurons, we put 3 neurons (but do not input any sample regarding the corresponding class), can we expect that non-dog, non-cat inputs (like flower, plane or ...) can be identified, thanks to that additional neuron?
