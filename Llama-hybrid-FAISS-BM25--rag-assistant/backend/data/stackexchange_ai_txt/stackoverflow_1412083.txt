Where in the filesystem does IE8 store values stored in localStorage?

My organization is starting to use this feature and for testing it would be ideal if we could find and delete these values as well as see what's written to disk, but I can't figure out where IE8 is storing them. I found the .sqlite files in AppData\Local\Apple Computer\Safari for Safari and AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ryb7f27l.default\webappsstore.sqlite for FF3.5 Any help on IE8 would be appreciated!
