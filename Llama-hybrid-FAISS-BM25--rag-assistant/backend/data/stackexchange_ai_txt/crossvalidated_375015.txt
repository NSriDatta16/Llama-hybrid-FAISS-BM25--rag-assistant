Since you have a table of counts, you will want to use methods appropriate for count data. These might include chi-square test and logistic regression. The simplest approach for your data would be to treat each Question separately. You will be assessing if the proportion of X and Y follow a null 50% / 50% distribution. For the hypothesis test, you might perform a chi-square goodness-of-fit test or a binomial test. For the effect size, you might just present the proportions of X and Y, or you could use another statistic like odds ratio. You might want to construct confidence intervals for the proportions and present these as well. (Be sure to use a method that is appropriate for proportions). A different question would be to ask if the distribution of X or Y changes across questions. Here you could use a chi-square test of association on the whole table (Questions on one axis, and X-Y on the other, as you laid it out in the question). Another approach to this second question is to use logistic regression where X-or-Y is your dependent variable and Question is your independent variable. This approach is helpful if you have additional factors you want the model to consider. For example, if you had also recorded the sex of respondents and wanted to include that as a predictor. For example, if we look at Question 1, we could conduct a binomial test. binom.test(21, (21+47)) # Exact binomial test # # data: 21 and (21 + 47) # number of successes = 21, number of trials = 68, p-value = 0.002186 # alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 # 95 percent confidence interval: # 0.2023635 0.4325608 # sample estimates: # probability of success # 0.3088235 Here, the proportion of X being chosen is 0.31. This is significantly different than a null proportion of 0.50 (p = 0.002). We could also report the 95% confidence interval of this proportion (0.20 to 0.43). This is helpful in presenting results in tabular or graphical form.
