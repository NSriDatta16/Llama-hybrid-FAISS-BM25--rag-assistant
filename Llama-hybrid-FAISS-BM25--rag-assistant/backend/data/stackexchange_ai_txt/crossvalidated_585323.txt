Propensity score matching in a case-control study: can the number of matches per patient be correlated with a matching variable?

Say I am trying to investigate the association between antidepressants and achieving recovery in a depression programme. I have an observational cohort of depressed patients enrolled in the programme between the ages of 20-90, and I wish to match patients by a series of depression measures (QoL surveys etc), the presence of several chronic conditions (which affect severity of depression), medications affecting mood, as well as age, sex, and a bunch of other demographics that might confound results. I wish to use a propensity score to match patients with a caliper width of 0.25. Cases (recoverees) can be matched with up to 5 controls. I would assume that the older a patient gets, the more complex and variable their morbidity/depression/treatment profiles are, and thus the harder it is to find matches within the caliper width, i.e. I would expect fewer matches, on average, for cases aged 80-90 years old compared to 20-30 years. In which case, you would end up with controls which are on average younger than cases. Is there anything stopping PSM correlating the number of matches a case is expected to get with a matching variable, resulting in an imbalance of the said variable within the matched set? My second question, if this can occur, is: does it even matter, if there truly aren't the matches available and it's not some fault in study design? Or should you do something about it (e.g. lower the limit from 1:5 matching to, say, 1:3, if older people are roughly getting 3 matched controls). (Yes you could probably simplify matching variables to a single metric that summarises morbidity severity, but in this hypothetical argument I want to assume that it's important to match on individual morbidity, so that older patients truly are harder to find matches for)
