Yes, it does make sense to use better objective functions than accuracy, just as Dave says . After all: Why is accuracy not the best measure for assessing classification models? And the problems with accuracy occur not only for evaluation of predictions, but of course also in the fitting step. And indeed, many methods do work with better objective functions. Classically, one can posit a probability model and maximize the (log-)likelihood. This is the classical statistical approach and is used, e.g., in logistic regression, or multicategory generalizations. Not coincidentally, the log-likelihood corresponds to the log score, which is a proper scoring rule (the tag wiki contains more information).
