You should try the empirical Bayesian approach. You can see an example related to baseball here . This gist though is that you update players as you gain more observations thus giving you more reason to move from your prior. This is because having a winning percentage of 100 means something very different for 1/1 vs 100/100. In the prior case one loss will make you 50% while in the later case one loss keeps you pretty close to 100. This method will most likely move your brother to the average player.
