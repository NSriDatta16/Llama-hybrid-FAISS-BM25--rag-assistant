Transfer Function Equation from SPSS

I'm having some difficulty applying concepts I'm learning about Transfer Functions into useful equations. I've read a couple of the related posts, and perhaps I need to learn by example... I have two examples below, which are output from made-up data in SPSS Time Series modeler. As I am simply trying to learn the mechanics of Time Series, and how the equations work, I would like it if someone could walk me through translating the output into an equation I could understand and manipulate in Excel. I understand that SPSS produces the forecasts automatically, but I'm trying to better understand the mechanics. Any help is appreciated. Here is one example, with one predictor... This is another example, with 2 predictors.
