How to combine Bayesian Optimization and Cross Validation

I am currently using a train-validation-test split and Bayesian Optimization (BO), which is straightforward. Now, I want to transition to using 3-fold cross validation and BO (+an additional test set for final evaluation). However, I see that there are two ways to do that: BO inside cross validation : Inside cross validation, apply BO three times, one for each foldset. The issue here is that this will create three different sets of optimal hyper-parameters (one for each foldset) and it is unclear how to combine them. Cross validation inside BO : The entire cross-validation procedure is encapsulated inside the black box function optimized by BO. This will create one optimal set of hyper-parameters. So, is any of the above correct?
