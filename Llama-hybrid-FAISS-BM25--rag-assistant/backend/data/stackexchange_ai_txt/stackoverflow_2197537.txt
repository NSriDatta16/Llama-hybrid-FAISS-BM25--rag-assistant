The b ||= "value" statement is much like Perl’s widely-loved // and //= operators, because in Ruby the only values that test false are nil and false . This makes its functionally identical to Perl’s //= operator. How much more elegant can you get than a ||= b ? Honestly, I don't know how much more compactly that idea can be conveyed other than making the operator shorter (and at that point you're just being silly).
