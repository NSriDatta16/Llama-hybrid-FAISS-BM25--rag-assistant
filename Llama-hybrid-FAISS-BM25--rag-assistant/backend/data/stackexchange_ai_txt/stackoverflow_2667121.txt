Organising XML results as cells in container (AS3)

I'm having some problems figuring out how to organise data pulled off XML in cells within a container. I'm sure this should be a basic thing in AS3, but my head's fried.. can anyone help? Basically an array if fed to callThumbs() which iterates through it and compares the entries with preloaded XML _my_images . If match is found, it's sent to processXML which loads all relevant info and loads a .jpg thumbnail. All this is then fed to createCell which creates a specific cell with position values depending on x_counter and y_counter values (4 cells in a row) and adds the cell into a container _container_mc . The Problem: This all works fine and looks fine, the problem is that the cells within the container do not display in descending order . They are in random order, probably because some of the .jpg's takes longer to load etc. How do I easily organise the cells within the container in descending order by the XML .id value? Or how do I tell Flash to wait till the thumbnail and data is loaded and the cell created and added? Thanks guys, would really appreciate all the help!
