Specifically, [the recent] likelihood-free methods are a rewording of the ABC algorithms, where ABC stands for approximate Bayesian computation . This intends to cover inference methods that do not require the use of a closed-form likelihood function, but still intend to study a specific statistical model. They are free from the computational difficulty attached with the likelihood but not from the model that produces this likelihood. See for instance Grelaud, A; Marin, J-M; Robert, C; Rodolphe, F; Tally, F (2009). "Likelihood-free methods for model choice in Gibbs random fields". Bayesian Analysis. 3: 427–442 .
