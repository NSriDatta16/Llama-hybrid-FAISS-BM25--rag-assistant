It would work as long as your session information is stored in a database, and not flat-file (which is the PHP default). Basically the PHP script would be sent the Session ID via a cookie (just like ASP would), and then the PHP script will look up the corresponding session information in the database to get the user's information (e.g. username, privileges, etc.) to do its thing. If you are not using database-driven sessions, then it gets a lot more complicated, since it's unlikely that ASP and PHP store their session information in a compatible flat-file format. The best thing to do in that situation might be to add an additional layer of your own on top of the session storage. For example, when the user is logged in on the ASP side of things, have some basic information that you need to know about the user save in a database (again that both ASP and PHP can access), and then write a unique key to a cookie. Have PHP read the cookie yourself, and look up the corresponding information in the database. This is essentially re-creating a basic version of sessions, so it would be best to switch to database-driven sessions in the first place, but it might be the only option available to you, depending on the specific circumstances.
