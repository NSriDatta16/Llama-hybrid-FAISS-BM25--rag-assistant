Let us assume that the Markov Chain is finite state, time-homogeneous. If $p_{ij}^{(m)}>0$, and $p_{ji}^{(n)}>0$ for some integers $m\geq 1$ and $n\geq 1$, then we say that states $i$ and $j$ communicate with each other. Case-1: Markov chain is irreducible: All the states belong to a single closed communicating class. States belonging to a closed communicating class are recurrent. Hence, both the states $i$ and $j$ are positive recurrent. Case-2: Markov chain is not irreducible: The state space is reducible into closed and non-closed communicating classes. For a finite state, time-homogeneous Markov chains, there must be at least one closed communicating class. If states $i$ and $j$ belong to a closed communicating class, then they are positive recurrent. The states $i$ and $j$ are transient, if both of them belong to a non-closed communicating class.
