It doesn't matter that the random forest model happens to be built from a collection of binary tree splits. In your examples, the first random forest model makes predictions in the original scale and the second in a log-transformed scale. Whether the predicted values are obtained from a standard linear regression or a random forest regression, the issue is how close the predictions come to the actual values in the scale of the transformation used in the model . As this answer says, the "percent variance explained" is 100 times the pseudo- $R^2$ from the random forest regression model. As this answer shows, that pseudo- $R^2$ is given by: $$ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2} . $$ where $y_i$ are the observations, $\hat y_i$ are the predicted values, and $\bar y$ is the mean of the observations. So if a transformation brings the predicted values $\hat y_i$ relatively closer to the observations $y_i$ in the transformed scale over what was seen in the original scale, the $R^2$ and the "percent variance explained" will be higher in the transformed scale.
