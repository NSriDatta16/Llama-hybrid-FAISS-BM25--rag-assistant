If mean absolute loss is not differentiable, how it can be used in neural networks? which majorly are trained using back-propagation

If Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss is not differentiable, how can it be used in neural networks? which majorly are trained using back-propagation I am wondering if MAE is not differentiable how they can be used as a loss function.
