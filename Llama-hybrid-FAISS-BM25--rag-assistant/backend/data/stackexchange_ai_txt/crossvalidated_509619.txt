There are two general forecasting techniques I will point you towards. The first is hierarchical forecasting . This is a good method if you data has a structure where you need to forecast individual series, but also aggregated series (for example forecast each individual item in a store, plus each store's sales). Rob Hyndman has published quite a few papers on this I would point you to this textbook chapter Hierarchical Forecasting - Hyndman (2019) , as well as this paper Coherent Probabilistic Forecasts for Hierarchical Time Series - Hyndman (2017) . Also along the lines of this is the M5 Forecasting Competition (2020) which took place last year. The second is vector autoregression with sparsity . It seems from your question that there is some dependence between the time series, but only a small subset of the time series will affect any given series. An example of this can be found in the following paper Sparse Vector Autoregressive Modeling - Davis et. al (2012) or Structured Regularization for Large Vector Autoregressions with Exogenous Variables . In both papers they seek to fit a VAR model where the coefficient matricies are relatively sparse; this is similar to how in standard regression introducing regularization can sometimes improve performance. A good resource on how to implement these models is the CRAN Task View: Time Series Analysis . As you will be able to see under the heading Multivariate Time Series Models there are a few R packages that can do this type of time series analysis.
