Disabling Drop on certain items in Silverlight Toolkit's TreeViewDragDropTarget

Basically in the treeview, I have a list of items, if the item is of type "Group", then I can add / drag drop items into it. How can I achieve that in code? I tried DragEnter, DragOver events and setting the allowdrop property to false if the target item is not a group object but to no avail. Any advice please? Cheers
