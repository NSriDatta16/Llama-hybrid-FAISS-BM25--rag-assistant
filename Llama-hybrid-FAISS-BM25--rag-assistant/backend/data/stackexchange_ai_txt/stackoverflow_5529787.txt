I'm not at a computer (with excel) right now. I do know there is a select current region (I think it was mapped to Ctrl-/ ?) You should be able to use that to detect ends of contiguous regions. If you want only a column of that, use Range.Intersect to limit to a column (e.g. "$D:D" for column D). This will leverage the power of Excel instead of coding your own. Have a look at named ranges (Insert/Name, F3 to pick a named range in formula editor). IIRC you could have 'dynamic' ranges (like: automatically detect contiguous areas) under a name as well. I'd have to try how that worked to provide more details
