Sum up counts in a data.frame grouped by multiple variables

This is a snippet of the dataset I am currently working on: > sample name sex count 1 Maria f 97 2 Thomas m 12 3 Maria m 5 4 Maria f 97 5 Thomas m 8 6 Maria m 4 I want to sum up the counts grouped by name and sex to finally get this data.frame: > result Maria Thomas f 194 0 m 9 20 I wrote a simple loop to iterate over the rows and sum up the counts: result Is it suitable to do it this way? Are there any other ways to do it in a more elegant / shorter fashion? Edit: I already tried it with aggregate , but the output is in a different format: > aggregate(sample$count,by=list(sample$name,sample$sex),sum) Group.1 Group.2 x 1 Maria m 9 2 Thomas m 20 3 Maria w 194
