What is a reliable measure of accuracy for logistic regression?

Say I fit a logistic regression model on training data and test it on test data. How do I measure accuracy? Using the "treshold method" where we predict $y = 1$ if the predicted probability is above 0.5, and vice versa, is a very poor method, obviously. I think it would only work well for simple problems but not for complicated data. A second method I know is to calculate a $\sum_{i}$ where each term is either $\log p_i$ if the actual value at the point $i$ is $1$ , or $\log(1 - p_i)$ if the actual value is $0$ . But testing this on my data, I do not get sensible results. This method seems to be biased in preference of models that predict $p_i \approx 50 \%$ rather than predict extreme probabilities.... What is a simple and robust method?
