Visual Studio 2010: How to add a simple file not as a resource?

I just want to have a "data" directory in the project, and that it will be located at the startup directory of the application. When I add files with drag&drop they're not appearing in the startup directory of the application (they're embedded or something). Seems to be very simple but not found any solution yet =[
