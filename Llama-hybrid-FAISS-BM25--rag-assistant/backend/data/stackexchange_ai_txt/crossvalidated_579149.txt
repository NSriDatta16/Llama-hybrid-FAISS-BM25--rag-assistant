Process ordinal data as a function of time in R

I try to treat ordinal data as a function of time in order to analyze if there is a significant difference between two different modalities. Here is my data set num Note Semaine Companion mummies mycosis 1 2 13 0 1 2 2 1 13 0 1 1 3 4 13 0 1 1 4 2 13 0 1 1 31 5 13 1 2 1 1 3 14 0 3 2 num is the number of th plant, there are 30 plant in each modality so a total of 60 plants. Note is the grade given according to the amount of aphid found on the plant : 1 "absence" 2 "founder" 3 "founder + larvae" 4 "colony" 5 "winged colony" Semaine is the weak in which the statments were done Companion is the modality 0 "without companion plant" 1 "with companion plant" mummies is the grade given according to the amount of mummies found on the plant : 1 "absence" 2 "few" 3 "a lot" I performed a linear regression using the polr function but time is taken into account here as a fixed factor. head(aphid, 2) aphid$Note = factor(aphid$Note) e = polr(Note ~ num + Semaine + Companion, data = aphid, Hess = TRUE) n4 = data.frame(num = 30, Semaine = 14, Companion = 0) predict(e, n4, type = "probs") exp(cbind(OR = coef(e), confint(e))) I want to find a way to see if there is a statistical difference between the number of aphids, mummies, mycosis and weeks of the two modalities. Is there a model that can do that ?
