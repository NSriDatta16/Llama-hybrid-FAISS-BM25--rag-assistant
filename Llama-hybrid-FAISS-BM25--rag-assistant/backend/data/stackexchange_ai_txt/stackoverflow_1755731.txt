SELECT person_id, AVG(mpg) from car group by person_id; If you want to get an average for the group, you should probably do this: SELECT AVG(mpg) from car; Unless you really want to average the averages, which seems a bit dubious to me: SELECT AVG(average) from (SELECT person_id, AVG(mpg) as average from car group by person_id);
