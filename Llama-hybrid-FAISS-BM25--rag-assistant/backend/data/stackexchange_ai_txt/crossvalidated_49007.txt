From what I see here, I agree that igraphs / Markov Chains is probably the way to go, however you could definitely use rpart and/or the partykit. It's hard for me to give a simple answer with your limited example, but I can explain generally how you would do it. You want look at where all your users had been, and summarize that into a string for example "Home / product4 / product3 / product4 / buynow" "Home / product3 / buynow" "Home / product3 / product4" You could then segment your users into categories, say ones who ended up in the "buy now" page, and ones who didn't. Then you could simply start predicting on that terminal result. In this example, maybe you would find out that people who did the most comparison shop did / didn't buy something. You could also make more variables, like "what was the page before the buynow page" "how many pages did they visit before buying something" or "when did they create their first account", and you could add those metrics to your analysis. There are a lot of different ways you could go, and this begins to answer different questions, but my point is that you could use the trees and for some problems it might be a faster and simpler route to insight. By the way, you would need to make non-numeric variables factors by using factor or as.factor , if you're going to use party. Party has some nice vignettes to get you started.
