What are comments about the model specification when significance levels decrease in the multivariate model?

So I run the multivariate model and the significance levels decrease (i.e., larger p values) for almost all predictors. The extent to which they decrease vary, some may go from There have been discussions of CV of this issue (e.g., Significant predictors become non-significant in multiple logistic regression ). But I thinks one missing part across these discussion is: What can we comment about the model specification in that multivariate model, such as the selection of that specific set of predictors? Is it a good specification (because we identify relevant confounders so that, when included, they appropriately adjust the significance levels and give us a better understanding of the true relationship, which is none in this example)? Can we stop there after some effect of interest becomes insignificant and make our conclusion (no effect) or continue with model specification or, more generally, analysis in some way? Any thought is appreciated.
