Dataset with Multiple Choice Questions for fine tuning

I hope it's allowed to ask here, but I am looking for a dataset (the format is not that important) that is similar to SQuAD, but it also contains false answers to the questions. I wanna use it to fine tune GPT-3, and all I find is either MC questions based on a text, but with no distractors, or classical quizzes that have no context before each question. I have a code that generates distractors, and I can just plug it in there, but I was wondering if there was any pre-made dataset.
