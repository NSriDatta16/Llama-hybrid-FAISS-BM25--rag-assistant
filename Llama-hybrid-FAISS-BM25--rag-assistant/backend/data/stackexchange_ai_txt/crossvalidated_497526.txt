How to explain Bayesian's summary?

I ran Bayesian logistic regression as below. n=1000 set.seed(1) df $smoke smoke) df $cancer cancer) df $diabetes diabetes) df $depression depression) fit_rstanarm There are no convergence issues, and the mean in Estimates shows the same values as the Estimate in Coefficients when I ran logistic regression. Does this mean I can say depression is an important factor to cause cancer? I only need to find which x variables are important to y, but I do not completely understand how to explain this result.
