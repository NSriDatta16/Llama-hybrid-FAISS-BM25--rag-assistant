That encoding is the result of the enctype="multipart/form-data , when I suspect you are actually expecting the default encoding of application/x-www-form-urlencoded (ie. key=value&key2=value2 ). If you do not need the file input (which requires the multipart encoding) then simply remove the enctype from your form tag, otherwise you will need to parse the multipart input. The stdlib cgi.FieldStorage is one solution for Python 2.x, but I do not know the status of that particular class for Python 3.x (it used to be broken, IIRC).
