A latent unit $z_i$ having low covariance with $x$ doesn't mean that $z_i$ is constant, it means it varies independently of $x$ , i.e. $p(x,z_i) = p(x)p(z_i)\ ^{**}$ . Simple proof: $$\text{Covar}(x, z_i) = \int_{x,z} \!\!\!p(x,z) (x-\bar{x})(z - \bar{z}) \ \overset{**}{=} \int_{x,z} \!\!\!p(x)p(z) (x-\bar{x})(z - \bar{z}) \\\qquad\quad\ \ = \int_{x} p(x)(x-\bar{x}) \int_zp(z) (z - \bar{z}) = (\bar{x}-\bar{x}) (\bar{z} - \bar{z}) = 0$$ So low covariance ( not variance) identifies $z$ components that are independent of $x$ , i.e. carry no information, or are "dead" from a useful representation perspective. The same measure is used when considering posterior collapse (e.g. in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) ), which refers to when all dimensions of $z$ are independent of $x$ .
