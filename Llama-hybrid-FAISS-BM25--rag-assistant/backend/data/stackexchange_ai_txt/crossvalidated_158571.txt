The textbook definition of a $100 \times (1-\alpha)$% confidence interval is: An interval which, under many independent replications of the study under ideal conditions, captures the replicated effect measurement $100 \times (1-\alpha)$% of the time. Probability, to frequentists, comes from the notion of "rewinding time and space" to replicate findings, as if an infinite number of copies of the world were created to assess a scientific finding again and again and again. So a probability is a frequency exactly. For scientists, this is a very convenient way to discuss findings, since the first principle of science is that studies must be replicable. In your card example, the confusion for Bayesians and Frequentists is that the frequentist does not assign a probability to the face value of the particular card you have flipped from the deck whereas a Bayesian would. The frequentist would assign the probability to a card, flipped from the top of randomly shuffled deck. A Bayesian is not concerned with replicating the study, once the card is flipped, you now have 100% belief about what the card is and 0% belief that it could take any other value. For Bayesians, probability is a measure of belief. Note that Bayesians do not have confidence intervals for this reason, they summarize uncertainty with credibility intervals.
