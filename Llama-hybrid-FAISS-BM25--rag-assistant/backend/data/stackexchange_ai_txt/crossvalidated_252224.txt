As you note glm won't do it: the family=binomial part, implies two-way, not multi-way. To look through packages you already have installed, try ??multinomial and look through the results. Among others the nnet package has a multinom , and there are several Bayesian R packages that support multinomial logistic regression including brms . (You can also do searches like ??"multinomial logistic" or ??"ordinal logistic" .) For packages you don't have installed, search on CRAN . You should also specify whether the categories have any ordering or not. If there is some ordering, such as "Small", "Medium", "Large", then you will probably want to use ordinal logistic regression rather than the more general categorical logistic regression.
