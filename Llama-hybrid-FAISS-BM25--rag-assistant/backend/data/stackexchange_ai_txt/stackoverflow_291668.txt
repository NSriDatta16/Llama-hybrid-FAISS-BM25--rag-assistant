Can you store the table status as a variable, then use that variable to determine whether to insert data? Ex: @status = SHOW TABLES LIKE 'my_table'; INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (1,'hello'),(2,'world') WHERE @status <> false; The problem with Paul Morgan's answer is that it expects data to already exist in another table. Jonas' answer would be extremely resource exhaustive, especially if there's a lot of REPLACES (which are unnecessary if the table exists).
