It seems that the default, if it happens, happens only once for an individual, at a particular time. This sounds like it would be better handled by a survival model than by a logistic model. For a survival model, your outcome variable is a table with both an outcome indicator (as you have already produced) and an associated time for each individual, representing either the time of the default (for $y=1$) or the last time at which it was known that there was no default (for $y=0$). Survival models can take time-varying predictors into account and can even take advantage of data available for individuals for which the last data were taken before your 18-month time point. If 18 months is particularly important for you, you can then use a survival model to make predictions about outcome specifically at 18 months. This recent question and detailed answer go into more discussion about the advantages of survival models over logistic models for this type of study. Statistical software packages, like the survival and rms packages in R, provide tools for doing survival analysis. Setting up the analysis for time-varying predictors needs some careful attention but is relatively straightforward.
