Welcome to the world of developing Multiversion targeted Word automation apps. Seriously though, you're going to hit +mountains+ of these types of issues. I know that different versions of word handle inserting page breaks at different places in different ways. I had tons of problems with then developing an addin that intelligently merged multiple word documents into a single, normal (not master) document. Best thing is to test like heck and build exception routines to handle specific versions of Word when you get anomalies like this. Hopefully, you won't run into many, but I can say there's a LOT of em out there. In this particular case, the paragraph selected is likely in a table, and you're collapsing to the END of the para, then trying to insert something, which is messing with the End of cell marker for the cell you're in. Different versions of word handle that differently. In one case (I forget specifically which), if you do that in the VERY LAST CELL in the table, you'll corrupt the document when you save it, but you won't know that till you try to reopen the document. Often, you can work around this specific prob by detecting you're in a table, and if so, collapse to the end, then back up one char (if possible, the cell might be blank) and THEN inserting your page break.
