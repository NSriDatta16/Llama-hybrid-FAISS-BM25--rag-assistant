Why are faces so low-dimensional? (i.e. why does the eigenface approach work so well?)

I (think I) understand PCA, but it still blows my mind that you can get such good reconstruction of the faces with only like 20 eigenface components. How is that possible?? Why should it be the case that faces lie more or less on a 20-dimensional hyperplane?
