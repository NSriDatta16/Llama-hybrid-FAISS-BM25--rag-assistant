css declaration efficiency

Does separating CSS code into multiple declarations cause more overhead for users? I have seen some .css files organized like so: /* Font Styles */ #text{ font-size: 12px; color: white;} .highlight{ color: red} /* END */ /* Div Positioning */ #text{ position: absolute;} /* END */ Could this cause any potential inefficiencies? I understand that something on this scale will have no noticeable effects, but what about on massive style sheets?
