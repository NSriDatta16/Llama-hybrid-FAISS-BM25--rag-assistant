If you were to rely purely on the data, there's a limit to what you can conclude with one year of measurements. But wouldn't you be surprised if there was no seasonality? Your expectation was probably that there would be some seasonality - and this data is consistent with that. To put it in Bayesian terms, your prior should dominate because your data are limited.
