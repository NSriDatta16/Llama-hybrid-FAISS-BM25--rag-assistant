Code Coverage on Lambda Expressions

I'm seeing a pattern throughout my code where the lambda expression is showing as not covered in code coverage, the debugger DOES step through the code and there are no conditional blocks. public CollectionModel() { List languages = LanguageService.GetLanguages(); this.LanguageListItems = languages.Select( s => new SelectListItem { Text = s.Name, Value = s.LanguageCode, Selected = false }). // It is somewhat odd. Any ideas?
