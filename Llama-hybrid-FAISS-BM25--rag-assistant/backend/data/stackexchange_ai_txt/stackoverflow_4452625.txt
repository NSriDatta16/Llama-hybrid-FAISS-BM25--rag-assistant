If you have a look at Reactive Extensions , it provides an elegant way of doing this using the observable pattern . var timer = Observable.Interval(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100)); timer.Subscribe(tick => OnSomeCondition()); A nice thing about observables is the ability to compose and combine further observables from existing ones, and even use LINQ expressions to create new ones. For example, if you wanted to have a second timer that was in sync with the first, but only triggering every 1 second, you could say var seconds = from tick in timer where tick % 10 == 0 select tick; seconds.Subscribe(tick => OnSomeOtherCondition());
