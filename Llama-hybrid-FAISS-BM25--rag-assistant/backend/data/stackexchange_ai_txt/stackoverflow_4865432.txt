I have used both Yii and Zend framework and I still use bits of both however. There are some really elegant solutions in yii. I started using Zend framework but have since swinched to use primarily yii, with sprinklings of Zend. Yii's component based model is excellent. Jquery and ready to go jquery based components out of the tin is a huge time saver. not to mention gii which autogenerates whole areas of the application from the database structure.
