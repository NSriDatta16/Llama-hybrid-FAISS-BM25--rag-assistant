GWT has two parts to it. One is a client that the GWT compiler translates to Java, and the other is a Servlet if you do any RPC. Typically you would run your Client code on a browser and then when you made any RPC calls you would contact a Java Servlet Engine (Such as Tomcat or Jetty or ...) , which in turn calls you persistence layer. GWT does have the ability to do JSON requests over HTTP and coincidentally, this is what CouchDB uses. So in theory it should be possible. (I do not know if anybody has tried it). There would be a couple of issues. CouchDB would need to serve up the .js files that have the compiled GWT client code. The main issue I see in your case is that couchDB would need to generate your PDF files, while couchDB is just a storage engine and does not typically do any processing. I guess you could extend it if you are any good with the Erlang programming language.
