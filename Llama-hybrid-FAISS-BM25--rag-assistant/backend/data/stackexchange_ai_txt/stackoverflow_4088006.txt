You can't instantiate an interface; it is merely a contract and not an object itself. You need to figure out what the contract means and have AddDocumentsDialog implement that contract, doing whatever it is supposed to do when CategoryToAdd is set. On a side note, set-only properties are discouraged. It's better to use a method.
