I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly, but FU-A is not a packetization mode, it just signals that the NAL unit is a Fragmentation Nal Unit i.e. a NAL unit is fragmented over several RTP packets. RFC3984 table 3 shows that NAL FU-A can only be used in the interleaved and non-interleaved packetization modes (modes 1 and 2) i.e. not in single Nal Unit mode (mode 0). As for encoder/decoder support: if the SDP signals packetization mode 1 or 2, it means that there might be FU-As in the RTP stream. This won't affect the decoder though RFC3894 section 7.1: "If a decapsulated packet is an FU-A, all the fragments of the fragmented NAL unit are concatenated and passed to the decoder." I don't understand the last part of your question relating to the SIP B2BUAs, the SDP signals packetization modes and based on that the RTP receiver must be able to handle the different NAL unit types that are specified in RFC3984.
