How do I determine my Bayesian sampling size when comparing two proportions?

I am currently working on writing a simulation in R to compare the results of Frequentist vs Bayesian when it comes to two-proportion hypothesis testing. For the Bayesian side, I am simply using a Beta-Binomial model for each of the proportions. Below is my code for determining the posterior distribution of the difference between the two samples: postdist = rbeta(mcmcsize, prior1+treatment, prior2+tsamp-treatment) - rbeta(mcmcsize, prior1+control, prior2+csamp-control) My questions basically comes down to determining the value of 'mcmcsize'. I know I need to go large, but how do I determine what's large enough? Can I get too large? Thanks.
