Why does a 1D convolution increase the size of the output, while a 2D convolution tends to decrease (such as in a CNN?)

The function np.convolve is a 1D convolution (e.g. when both inputs are 1D). It results in a larger output size. >>> import numpy as np >>> a = [1,2,3] >>> b = [4,5,6] >>> np.convolve(a,b) array([ 4, 13, 28, 27, 18]) However typically in CNNs, each convolution layer reduces the size of the incoming image. What causes this distinction between 2D and 1D convolutions?
