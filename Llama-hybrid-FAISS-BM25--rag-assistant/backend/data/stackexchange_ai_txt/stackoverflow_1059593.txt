Kayhan YÃœKSEL, You have mention SQL 2000 and dtsx. Which one is it? You have mentioned 64 bit server. Is SQL also 64 bit? You have also mentioned "job". Is this SQL Agent job? If this is SQL 2005/8 64 bit and this is indeed a scheduled job, then you are having the famous 64 bit Vs. 32 bit issue. The SQL agent will run in 64 bit and cannot see any of your 32 bit drivers. Do you have the 64 bit Oracle data provider installed? If the tnsnames.ora is not in the default location, you will need the TNS_NAMES environmental variable set. Also make sure that you are referring to the Oracle server with the correct registered name in your SSIS package. Raj
