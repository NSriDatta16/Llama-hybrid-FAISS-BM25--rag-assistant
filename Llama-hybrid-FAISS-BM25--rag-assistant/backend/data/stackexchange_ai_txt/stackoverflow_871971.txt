Minifier that preserves conditional comments?

I tried out the online JS Minifier but it cuts out conditional comments like: var u = navigator.userAgent;var e=/*@cc_on!@*/false; BECOMES var u=navigator.userAgent;var e=false; This would affect the operation of the code, so instead of manually adding the stripped out comments manually, I'm looking for a minifier that intelligently preserves these and any such comments.
