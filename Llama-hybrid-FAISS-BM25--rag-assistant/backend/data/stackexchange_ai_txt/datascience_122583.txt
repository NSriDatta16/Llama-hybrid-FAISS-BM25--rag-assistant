A Dense layer in neural networks performs a linear operation on the layer's input vector. This operation can be summarized as a matrix multiplication followed by a bias offset. The Dense layer takes the inputs, multiplied by the weights, and then adds the bias. This is also known as a dot product. The weights and biases are learnable parameters which the neural network adjusts during training to minimize the loss function. The dimensionality reduction happens because the weight matrix in the Dense layer has a shape of (input_dim, output_dim). So, if you have 10000 neurons (input_dim) and you want to reduce it to 2000 neurons (output_dim), the weight matrix would have a shape of (10000, 2000). The result of the matrix multiplication would then be a vector of size 2000, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the input. After the linear operation, the Dense layer typically applies an activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, which allows the network to learn complex patterns.
