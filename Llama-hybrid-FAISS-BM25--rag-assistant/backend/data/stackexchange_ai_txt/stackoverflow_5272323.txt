How to limit the number of result within Magento?

I've a recent products action in my Catalog/Product controllers. I retrieve all the product sorted by entity id. Works great ok. The problem is I just want to show 20 products in 4 pages. I tried to extend Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List and override _getProductCollection() and I did something like this: $this->_productCollection = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSort('entity_id', 'desc') ->addStoreFilter(); And the important part: $this->_productCollection->getSelect()->limit($this->getProductsLimit()); If I 'dump' the returned Object I've something like this: ["limitcount"] => int(5) ["limitoffset"] => int(0) So it looks to be overriden by the paginator. Do you know a way to limit properly the number of result? For both optimization and presentation I actually don't want to retrieve all the products collection. Thank you
