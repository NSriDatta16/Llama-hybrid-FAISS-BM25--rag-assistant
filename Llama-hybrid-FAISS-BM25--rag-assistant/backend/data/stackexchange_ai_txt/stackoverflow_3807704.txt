I suspect that they haven't implemented WebRequest.CachePolicy in MonoTouch. I think you'd be better off implementing your own caching, as you could invalidate your cache on demand--such as after modifying the data from the iPhone or by some other event. You also get to pick your storage mechanism as SQLite, xml file on disk, etc.
