The absolute value of the coefficient is not proportional to the importance of the corresponding feature. There are two ways to assess the significance of a given feature in logistic regression (and more generally for Generalized Linear Models): Look at the p-value of this parameter in the output of the logistic regression or: run two models, one with all the features except the feature of interest (the one you want to assess the performance), and run a second model with all the features, including the feature of interest. You can then perform a Likelihood Ratio Test between the two models to see if this feature is significant in the prediction task The second approach is more reliable.
