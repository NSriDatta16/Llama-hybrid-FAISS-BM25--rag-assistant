Significance test for average profit per user

I'm going to be running an A/B test trying out two different prices for a product. I'm interested the average profit per user for the two variants. Since most people won't convert, I will have samples that contain many zeros, and some larger values for users who converted. The non-zero values will likely be one of a few possible values. My question is, how would I go about conducting a single-tail significance test for such skewed data?
