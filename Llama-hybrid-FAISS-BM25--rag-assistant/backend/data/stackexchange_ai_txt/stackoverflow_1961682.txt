How can I make my Perl script use multiple cores for child processes?

I'm working on a mathematical model that uses data generated from XFOIL, a popular aerospace tool used to find the lift and drag coefficients on airfoils. I have a Perl script that calls XFOIL repeatedly with different input parameters to generate the data I need. I need XFOIL to run 5,600 times, at around 100 seconds per run, soabout 6.5 days to complete. I have a quad-core machine, but my experience as a programmer is limited, and I really only know how to use basic Perl. I would like to run four instances of XFOIL at a time, all on their own core. Something like this: while ( 1 ) { for ( i = 1..4 ) { if ( ! exists XFOIL_instance(i) ) { start_new_XFOIL_instance(i, input_parameter_list); } } } So the program is checking (or preferably sleeping) until an XFOIL instance is free, when we can start a new instance with the new input parameter list.
