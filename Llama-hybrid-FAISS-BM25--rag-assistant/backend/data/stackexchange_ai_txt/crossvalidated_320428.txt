The design imbalance is not a cause for concern. The precision of the mean-estimate is enhanced by drawing more samples. If the "post" assay is more precise then such a design may in fact be optimal. You can perform a paired t-test in the aggregate by averaging the 3 replicates from the "pre" sample and the 2 from the "post" sample, then taking their respective difference. Alternately, you may choose a mixed model with a random intercept for each protein sample, 5 observations per cluster and an indicator variable for administration of the chemical. Another approach is to use a GEE with an exchangeable correlation structure for replicate assays of each protein sample. Since you use a Welch's paired t-test, the variance is calculated from this sample. The standard error of the paired mean difference may not correspond to the standard deviation of either assay, but rather a complicated combination of them. What's important is that the confidence intervals for the mean difference are correct and the inference you draw from the sample makes optimal use of the design. The Welch's T-test does not require homogeneity, but it does require independent, identically distributed samples within either group. A reason this may be violated is due to a mean variance relationship. I find this is almost always the case in biological samples. Be sure to inspect the distribution of residuals vs. cluster-specific mean differences. Higher concentrations of proteins tend to be more variable simply because the measurements arise from a counting process. Performing a log transform of the outcome prior to calculating means or differences can approximately stabilize the variance.
