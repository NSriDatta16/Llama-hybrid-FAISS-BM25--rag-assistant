is the memory deallocated automatically? Yes. And the destructors will be called too, in case you wonder. This is why they're in the auto matic storage class . (Actually for most architectures the program will only call that 100 destructors (if any), then shift the stack pointer backward by 100* sizeof(T) bytes as "deallocation".)
