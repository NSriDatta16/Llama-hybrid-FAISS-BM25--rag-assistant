The easiest way, as you said is: Read in each pixel and store them in a collection. The top five colours used would be the values that occur the most. That's how I'd have ago at first trying something like this. To further this work, you could take in colour ranges, so using RGB values ( Red, Green, Blue ) assign a colour to a certain approximation of colour. For example, say that same image was used, the light blue values would get stored together, then an average could be taken of these to give the most common (yet average) light blue in the scene. Repeat for the other pixels. As for the scaling - the example website uses dull/bright values. A simple scale value could be used. Consider a medium red in RGB: 0.7, 0.0, 0.0 You could scale this by adding/multiplying a value. Keep the values within the limit of 0 to 1 however. As for what the scaling value should be, experimant. The higher it is, the duller/brighter the colour will become.
