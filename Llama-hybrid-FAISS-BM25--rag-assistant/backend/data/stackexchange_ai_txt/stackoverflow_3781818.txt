The article in the link is dubious at best. Does not specify what SQL Server version to use, and what are the various options enabled/disabled. Since SQL Server 2005 there is row small-lob storage for columns over spilling the 8K limit (see Table and Index Organization ), there are default in-row vs. out-of-row options (see sp_tableoption ) and there are many compression options ( row-level , page-level , Unicode ). For accurate information I would stick to the official product documentation, starting from Planning and Architecture (Database Engine) . For a more digestible read, buy one of the well established books, like Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Internals or Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2005: The Storage Engine .
