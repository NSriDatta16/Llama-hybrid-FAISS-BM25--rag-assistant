If your intention is to call other Activities from the current Activity, you should use Intents . Your focus could be less on persisting data than on sharing it on an as-needed basis. However, if you really need to persist these values then you could persist them in some kind of structured text file or database on local storage. A properties file, XML file, or JSON file could store your data and be easily parsed during activity creation. Don't forget also that you have SQLite on all Android devices, so you could store them in a database table. You could also use a Map to store key-value pairs and serialize the map to local storage, but this might be too cumbersome to be useful for simple data structures.
