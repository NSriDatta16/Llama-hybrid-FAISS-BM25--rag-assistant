How do I disable form validation on Magento 1.4?

I'm experiencing validation errors in the checkout and user registration workflows of my Magento (version 1.4.2) install. Example: During checkout, I get a "Customer email is required" error even if the field is correctly filled out. In the registration process, I get the error "Field xx must be greater or equal to a characters" It's interesting that it says "a" characters and not a specific number, but what does this refer to? I want to figure out how to disable form validation so I can troubleshoot the problem and find out what is causing the errors.
