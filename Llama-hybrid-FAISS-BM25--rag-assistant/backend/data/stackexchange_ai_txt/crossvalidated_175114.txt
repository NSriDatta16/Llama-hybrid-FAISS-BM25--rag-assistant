One possibility for modeling continuous nonnegative data is the gamma distribution. You can include covariates by running a gamma regression, e.g., using glm() . Since you have time series, you may want to create harmonics or (Gaussian or other) dummies as predictors to model seasonalities. Then again, your data seems to have a suspicious bump at zero. This would argue for a Tweedie distribution , which is a kind of "zero-inflated gamma distribution". You can run a "Tweedie regression" in R by using the Tweedie and the statmod packages. I don't know whether you could model autoregressive behavior in some reasonable way. Then again, you may not even need it if you use useful regressors.
