You might want to check out the package zone: M-x zone The 'zone-pgm-drip is like the Matrix drip, only one character at a time. I'm sure it could be enhanced to be more flood like. Also, the 'zone-pgm-jitter has text flooding down, but it's just the text currently on the screen (so it's horizontal extent is limited to what was already showing). You can just run M-x zone over and over until you find what you like. If you want to limit the choices zone uses, you can restrict the array that zone uses: (setq zone-programs [zone-pgm-jitter]) The choices for zone-programs are: zone-pgm-jitter zone-pgm-putz-with-case zone-pgm-dissolve zone-pgm-explode zone-pgm-whack-chars zone-pgm-rotate zone-pgm-rotate-LR-lockstep zone-pgm-rotate-RL-lockstep zone-pgm-rotate-LR-variable zone-pgm-rotate-RL-variable zone-pgm-drip zone-pgm-drip-fretfully zone-pgm-five-oclock-swan-dive zone-pgm-martini-swan-dive zone-pgm-rat-race zone-pgm-paragraph-spaz zone-pgm-stress zone-pgm-stress-destress zone-pgm-random-life
