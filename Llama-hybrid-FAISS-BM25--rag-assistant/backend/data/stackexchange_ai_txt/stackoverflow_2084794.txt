How to read system time in WPF for updating SQL Server timestamp field?

For the purpose of organizing streamlined database timer-based polling, with every updating of database table I need to update a timestamp field in a SQL Server 2008 database (then poll, read its value, compare with the value in front-end and making decisions about reading the whole table). Regarding all this, how I could read system time for writing timestamp? What data format of SQL Server field to use (DataTime or Time)? And how values of this format could be compared?
