SSIS: Oracle Multiple rows to one column output without STRAGG

Looking to generate a comma separated list of languages when the ID is the same. Table 1: ID | LangID 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 4 3 1 Table 2: ID | Language 1 English 2 Spanish 3 French 4 German Want to generate results that look like: ID | Languages 1 English, Spanish, French 2 French, German 3 English Things I have tried: Stragg - SSIS gives me "Invalid Identifier" SYS_Connect_By_Path - Can't figure out how to join the ids to convert to the string languages. Any suggestions?
