The main advantage of RNN over ANN is that RNN can model sequence of data (i.e. time series) so that each sample can be assumed to be dependent on previous ones. On the contrary, ANN can not model sequence of data. So, ANN is useful if only each sample is assumed to be independent of previous and next ones (akn as iid assumption).
