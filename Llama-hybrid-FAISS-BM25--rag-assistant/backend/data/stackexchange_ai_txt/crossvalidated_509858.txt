Mathematics for Machine Learning Support Vector Machine's distance equation, why do we not project $\vec{x}$ onto the normal to get distance?

Hi all in the Mathematics for Machine Learning Book on page 375 they use the following equation to get the distance from the hyperplane $\vec{x_a} = \vec{x_a'} + r \frac{\vec{w}} {\lVert{w}\lVert}$ Where $\vec{x_a'} $ is the projection on to the plane and $\vec{w}$ is the normal to the plane. I can follow this, but I was wondering would it be wrong to just use the projection of $\vec{x_a}$ onto $\vec{w}$ instead? Doesn't this give me the $r \frac{\vec{w}} {\lVert{w}\lVert}$ directly? And if that would be wrong, why? Thanks a lot in advance! I hope this isn't too silly a question.
