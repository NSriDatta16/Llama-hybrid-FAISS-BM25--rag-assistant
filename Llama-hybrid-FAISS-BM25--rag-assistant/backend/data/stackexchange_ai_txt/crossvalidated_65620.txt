I would run the MCMC many times (with different starting values) and plot the log-likelihood along with parameter estimates across time (or iteration number). Hopefully you see a trend for what the iteration number is for the chain to enter the stationary distribution. I would then use this value (and add a little more to be conservative) as the burn-in time. Of course there is no guarantee this will work across all scenarios, or that you have entered the true stationary distributions in your simulations. Therefore this advice should be taken with a grain of salt.
