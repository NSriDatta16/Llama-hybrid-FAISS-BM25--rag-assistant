Use a framework like chef or puppet to organize your nodes. This will allow you to bootstrap instances as they start. The way this works with Amazon EC2 is that it allows you to pass user-data to each instance -- generally a script of some sort to run commands, e.g. for bootstrapping. If running this yourself is too much of an obstacle, I'd recommend a service like: opscode platform scalarium rightscale scalr (also opensource ) HTH
