Software aid in plotting dataset and data table relations

I am at a complete loss of where to start with this in terms of where to start to look and what tags I should mark this with. I am working on gathering data from different sources with different structures and putting it in to a new data set that I will use as core for descriptive analysis. Currently I'm struggling with getting an overview and have been looking for a software where I can plot both relations between tables (such as key columns to join on for example). But also a simple way to visualize how the core dataset would look (for example drag and drop functionality of columns from the different tables). Is there good software (free / paid?) which could help with this? I'm completely open to redesigning the question adding tags etc. Right now after a lot of google time, I still haven't found and good threads to pull. /Henrik EDIT Adding two images with a very simplistic example of what I refer to when I say visualize how the dataset and relations would look like. Base tables When the three tables ave been combined to a core dataset for analysis
