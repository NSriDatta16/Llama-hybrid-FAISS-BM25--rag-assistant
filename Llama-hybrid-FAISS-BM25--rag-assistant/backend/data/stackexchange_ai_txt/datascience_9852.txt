For every Bayesian Network, is there a Neural Network that gives the same output?

After thinking about a question comparing Bayesian Network to Neural Network , I am now wondering if they may not be one and the same thing! At this point, my maths (unused for over 20 years fails me!). But.... If infinite random test data was used The output of the Bayesian Network was found for each data item And the Neural Network was then trained on it Would the Neural Network not tent towards being the same as the Bayesian Network?
