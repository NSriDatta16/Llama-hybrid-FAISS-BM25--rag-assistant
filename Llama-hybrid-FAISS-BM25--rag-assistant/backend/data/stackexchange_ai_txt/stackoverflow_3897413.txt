This is a well studied problem: multiple string pattern matching, of which many good solutions exist in the literature. Aho-Corasick provides a worst case optimal forward matching algorithm (ie execution complexity of O(|P|+|T|), where |P| is the sum of the length of all the strings you want to match) and |T| is the length of the text you match against). The set-backwards oracle matching (SBOM) algorithm is an example of a good backwards matching algorithm that has O(|P|X|T|) worst case complexity, but performs better than Aho-Corasick on average.
