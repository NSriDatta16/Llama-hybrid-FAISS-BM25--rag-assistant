How do I pre-determine the length of the resultant cipher text produced in an encryption operation?

I have an application which stores some information in an encrypted state, both on file and in a database. How can I calculate what the length of the resultant cipher text will be based on the plain text input? The encryption operation consists of using the .NET RijndaelManaged class/algorithm and then a conversion to a Base64 string prior to storage. What I want to be able to do is to know beforehand how long the encrypted string will be for a given input so that I can limit the length of the input accordingly in relation to the storage space available for its encrypted form (if that makes sense!). Thanks
