To mimic the behaviour of the ten time series you have, you need to use the estimated contemporaneous covariance matrix of model errors when simulating the errors. Using a diagonal matrix instead (which is approximately what you get when you simulate the ten univariate error series separately) will not work as needed. By the way, why doesn't the simulation in R work? You can simulate multivariate normal errors using the function mvrnorm from the MASS package. Edit (to respond to an edit of the OP): Why the output does not "fit" the original series: it does not have to, visually. But if you estimate a VAR(6) model, you should be getting very similar coefficient matrices and very similar contemporaneous covariance matrix of errors. That shows the process is generated as it should be, but due to different random shocks you get potentially very different trajectories.
