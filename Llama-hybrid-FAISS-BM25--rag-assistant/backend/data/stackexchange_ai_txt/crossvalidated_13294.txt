Johansen test is for testing whether the variables are cointegrated. If they are, the appropriate model is vector error correction model (VECM) which is a special case of vector autoregression models (VAR). Cointegration is defined for unit root (integrated) time-series. To be more precise a set of variables are said to be cointegrated if their linear combination is stationary. Since any linear combination of stationary time series is stationary the cointegration is specifically defined for non-stationary, i.e. unit root time-series. So yes there is a requirement to test whether the time series in question are unit roots (which by the way is always a good idea if you are using time series in regression). So to sum up, the answer to your first question is yes, more or less :) It would be good to know how exactly you have determined that ADF test was not passed. It has a lot of variations, and it is easy to make mistakes. If some of the variables are stationary (did not pass ADF test in your terminology) it is still possible to use VECM. For this however more information is needed about your desired model. If you are only interested in forecasting response variable, simply differencing unit root time series might be sufficient. Then a lot depends whether the response variable is unit root or not. If it is not, then using VECM might not be appropriate.
