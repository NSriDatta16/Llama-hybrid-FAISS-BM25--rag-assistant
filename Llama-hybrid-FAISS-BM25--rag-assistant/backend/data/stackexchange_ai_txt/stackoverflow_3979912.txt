Your best bet is to have the user upload directly to S3. The d2s3 plugin works well for this. In your d2s3 callback, create a delayed_job event to download the full size images and save thumbnails them to S3 with Reduced Redundancy Storage . If you wire everything up correctly, you can automatically generate thumbnails when and if they're ever lost from S3.
