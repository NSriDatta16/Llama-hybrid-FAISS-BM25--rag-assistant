The conditional distribution of $Y$ when $X=a$ is bimodal. The mean is in the middle, and reporting it as such is correct (the mean of $1,2,3,91,92,93$ is indeed $47$ ). This will be reflected somewhat in the variance being extremely wide. If you want to model a full distribution, you could consider quantile regression at many quantiles. I found this article on neural networks to predict multiple quantiles. Such a quantile regression approach would, correctly, show that the conditional median is in the middle of the parabola, but then youâ€™ll have a big jump to the, say, 45th and 55th percentiles before the quantiles bunch up around each mode.
