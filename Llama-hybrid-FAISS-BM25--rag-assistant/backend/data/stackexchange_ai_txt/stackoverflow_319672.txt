GetWindowLong vs GetWindowLongPtr in C#

I was using GetWindowLong like this: [DllImport("user32.dll")] private static extern IntPtr GetWindowLong(IntPtr hWnd, int nIndex); But according to the MSDN docs I am supposed to be using GetWindowLongPtr to be 64bit compatible. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633584(VS.85).aspx The MSDN docs for GetWindowLongPtr say that I should define it like this (in C++): LONG_PTR GetWindowLongPtr(HWND hWnd, int nIndex); I used to be using IntPtr as the return type, but what the heck would I use for an equivalent for LONG_PTR? I have also seen GetWindowLong defined as this in C#: [DllImport("user32.dll")] private static extern long GetWindowLong(IntPtr hWnd, int nIndex); What is right, and how can I ensure proper 64bit compatibility?
