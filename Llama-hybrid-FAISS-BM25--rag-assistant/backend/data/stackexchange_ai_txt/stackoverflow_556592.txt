Silverlight Grid Splitter Unexpected Behaviour

I am just starting out on Silverlight using version 2.0. I wanted to show a few data grids on the page and got this going OK by dropping each into a grid cell. I then thought I would try adding a grid splitter using the following markup: I expected to be able to drag the splitter around to resize the other two columns. When I drag the bar, both of the other columns shrink. Can anyone explain why?
