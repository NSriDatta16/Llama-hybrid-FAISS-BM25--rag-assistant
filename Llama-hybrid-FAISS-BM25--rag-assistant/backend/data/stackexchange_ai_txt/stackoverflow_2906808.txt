Here are just a couple of approaches I could think of but they are not without flaw: Whatcha Gonna Do technique Detect the mouse position going towards the edges of the browser as the user might be going to close the tab, window, go back, navigate elsewhere among other things. If so, immediately prompt them that that may be a mistake and they are going to lose out on something very valuable. However, the catch here is that you don't know for sure what their intentions were and you might piss them off with that popup. Also, they might use a bunch of shortcuts such as Ctrl+W etc to do the same. You've Got Mail technique If you've managed to get hold of the user's email address before they closed the page, you've hit a jackpot. As soon as the user types anything into the email box and then leaves it, immediately send it to the server using AJAX. Save the state of the page into localStorage or on the server using a cookie or something so it can be recreated later. Every couple of hours send them an email giving them a direct link to the previously saved form, and maybe with special offers this time. History Repeats Itself technique Then there's the infamous history manipulation where you keep stacking the current page into the document history so the back button renders effectively worthless. Don't Put All Your Eggs In One Basket technique Another technique off the top of my head is to create multiple windows in the background with the registration form and keep them all in sync when any the fields in any one changes. This is a classical technique and really puts the "don't put all your eggs in one basket" saying into real-life usage. Another advantage of this awesome technique is even if the user closes one of the windows, and later comes across an identical cloned window with all the fields they filled up-to-date populated, they might get confused and think that they never closed the page. And guess what, this time they might just go ahead and fill out the registration form. But you have to be cautious with this as anything more than 2 or 3 clones will make it obvious as to what's going on. You're Winner technique Another technique is to tell every user they they are the Xth visitor on the site and use a good rounded number for X such as 1000, 10000, 50000, etc. Tell them that they can claim their prize once they register on the site. Imagine how special each user feels when they land on your site. The prize doesn't have to be anything tangible, it can simply be free coupons that you find on the intertubes. Where Do You Want To Go Today? technique 1 This is basically a rip-off of your answer. Use document.location.href = 'some url' inside your onbeforeunload callback to navigate to a different page before it is unloaded. 1 Firefox only. Note: there is no silver bullet solution here unless you write your own browser with your own security policies, but these are all optimizations that you can do to make it utterly impossible for users to leave.
