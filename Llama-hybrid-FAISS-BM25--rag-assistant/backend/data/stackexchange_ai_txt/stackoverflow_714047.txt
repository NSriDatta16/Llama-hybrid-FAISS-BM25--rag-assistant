It depends on the situation. On a previous job, we used ADO.NET Entity Framework while it was still in beta. We tested the beta thoroughly, and we were using automated unit tests and code coverage analysis to make sure we were being thorough. The beta passed our tests. This turned out to be a good move. It saved us the three-month wait for the final release, and it only took a few hours to fix the breaking changes between the beta and the release versions. What I would not use is pre-release software I wasn't sure would ever be released, or well supported. That includes open-source software, unless I'm willing to support it myself.
