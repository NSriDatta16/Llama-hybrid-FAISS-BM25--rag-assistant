Oops, I ran ahead without looking at the page code properly. Jscrollpane adds the following css when you hover or drag the bar: .jspHover .jspActive. So I can do this with just CSS. Thanks for your code. Ill see if my client is happy with the CSS solution. They may want fade in and delays, etc, which will mean doing it in js after all. Thanks
