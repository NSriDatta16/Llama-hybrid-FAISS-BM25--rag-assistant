If you're creating an XML file (as your comments imply), I would strongly recommend that you use the XML libraries to output this and write the correct XML encoding header. Otherwise your character encoding won't conform to XML standards and other tools (like your JBoss instance) will rightfully complain. // Prepare the DOM document for writing Source source = new DOMSource(doc); // Prepare the output file File file = new File(filename); Result result = new StreamResult(file); // Write the DOM document to the file Transformer xformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); xformer.transform(source, result);
