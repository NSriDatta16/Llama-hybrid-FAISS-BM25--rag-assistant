product of two number in a array

Given a array of n distinct integer. Find all pairs of x,y in the array such that z(given) = x * y...do it without sorting and in a most efficient manner.. [edit] Integer are within range of int i.e 0-65536 and numbers are non negative if that helps. Dont want to sort coz it will take a lot of time. Storage space is not a issue.
