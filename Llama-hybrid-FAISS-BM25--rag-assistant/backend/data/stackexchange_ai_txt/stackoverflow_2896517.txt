UINavigation controller problem

I'm developing an iPhone application and I'm trying to do this: I want an application with tree views. The view shown first, doesn't have a navigation bar. If the user tap on a button, I need to open the second view with a navigation bar and a table view. The user can also add new items to the table view. If the user do so, the application will show the third view where the user can add fields (this view has also a navigation bar). It may seem simple, but for me it is not. I don't know how to use the UINavigationController and have not found yet a similar example for what I do (paragraph translated by google). UPDATE I don't know how where to put UINavigationController . How can I do that? Can I use a UIViewController to call a UINavigationController? Thank you.
