The world is changing constantly, so if you want to apply time series analysis only when the environment is constant you cannot do time series analysis at all. This does not mean that you can ignore changes in the environment, but it does mean that it is necessarily a trade-off when to split a time-series up. Apperently, these authors made a different trade-off than you would have done. That happens all the time. You can discuss that in your literature review. But I would only do that if it helps bring across the message you want to convey in your article, otherwise it is just a distraction.
