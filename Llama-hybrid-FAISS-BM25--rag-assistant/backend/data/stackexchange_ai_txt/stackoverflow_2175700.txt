Unless I've totally missed the boat, you shouldn't be able to drag-and-drop any control from the toolbox to an MVC view. At least in MVC 1.0, views and user controls do not implement code-behind by default, but, more importantly, the designer code file that gets modified in WinForms .ASPXs and .ASCXs is not created when the view is created. In MVC, controls are added to views using code-based HTML helpers or the actual HTML code. The fact that the default Visual Studio behavior when executing a drag-and-drop with a toolbox control is to modify the form's designer file could be causing the immediate exit, since the file doesn't exist. P.S. Don't bother trying to create it...the framework isn't built to implement or support it and it would probably just slow you down, anyway.
