Thanks a lot for the advice Tom. I am new to dojo and did not know about the place function. I changed my code around and I am able to use it and place new form fields in the same div. I am using a jsp fragment that uses the following spring tags: When these are at the very top of the fragment I would receive an ajax error saying type mismatch. I tried removing them completely but then the fields would be placed but have no values. I ended up putting them inside the opening tag and everything works fine now. Thanks for your help.
