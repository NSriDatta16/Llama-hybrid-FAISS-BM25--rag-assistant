If your classes are genuinely exactly as given then it's impossible as there's not enough information available at runtime to reconstruct the required information. If they're actually polymorphic classes, with virtual functions, it sounds like dynamic_cast is the answer. It returns a pointer to the most derived object. Your check would then be dynamic_cast (a)==dynamic_cast (b) . See paragraph 7 here: http://www.csci.csusb.edu/dick/c++std/cd2/expr.html#expr.dynamic.cast I suspect the usual dynamic_cast issues apply -- i.e., no guarantee it will be quick, and your classes will have to be polymorphic. This is not a feature I have used myself, I'm afraid -- but I have seen it suggested often enough by people who have that I infer it is widely-supported and works as advertised.
