This should be stored in a separate table, like this: RowID | Index | value 1 | 1 | abc 1 | 2 | 23 2 | 1 | 34 2 | 2 | abc 3 | 1 | 23 3 | 2 | abc 3 | 3 | 56 Get rid of the Index column if order does not matter. Either store it directly like this, or populate this table from your original column by splitting the string on whitespace and repeating inserts. Once you have this format of storage, it is relatively easy to achieve what you want: SELECT value, count(*) from keywords group by value; to get a count of all the distinct flags, then join it with SELECT count(*) from original_table;
