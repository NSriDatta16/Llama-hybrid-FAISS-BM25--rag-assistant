Changing the color of a QTextBlock that is within a QTextDocument

Is there any other way to change the QTextLayout of a QTextBlock that is within a QTextDocument without having to subclass QAbstractTextDocumentLayout and call its documentChanged? I know that on a call to QTextBlock::layout() const ; "the returned QTextLayout object can only be modified from the documentChanged implementation of a QAbstractTextDocumentLayout subclass" but I was wodering if there was any other way before I implemented it. UPDATE basically I just want paragraphs(QTextBlock) that are longer than X characters to be highlighted and the rest to be normal.
