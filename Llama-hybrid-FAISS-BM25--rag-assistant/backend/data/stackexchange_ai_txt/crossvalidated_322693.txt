This is a Bayesian understanding of probability. For a Bayesian, probability reflects a degree of belief. When a Bayesian says, "There is a probability that..." they are saying, "I haven't excluded the possibility that..." They have no problem implicitly ascribing probability to events for which they've collected no data. To a Bayesian, excluding a possibility means that even seeing evidence to the contrary will not convince them otherwise. Practically it means there is no rationale for collecting data on the subject. So in an optimistic light, the claim as you mention is saying the opposite, "It is worth collecting data on whether or not intelligent life exists beyond our solar system."
