How do you get multiple touch buttons to work with touchesBegan/Moved?

I have a bunch of buttons that I want to activate in three different ways. Touch Down Touch Down - multiple touch (at the same time) Touch Drag Inside (The same as dragging your finger over a piano) The first two is obviously easy in IB. However many people, including myself, have had trouble with Touch Drag inside. So I ended up using - (void) touchesMoved [see code] . This works great for the drag... but to get it to work I had to disable the buttons "user Interaction" in IB. Which means I lost the "Touch Down" and multi-touch capabilities. So, in order to get the "Touch Down" to work, I used -(void) touchesBegan [see code]. This works fine, but I can't get multi-touch to work. Does anyone know how I can get my buttons to fire simultaneously during multi-touch? Or ... Is there a way to get touches moved and button functions in IB to work together? I have tried touch.view.multiTouchEnabled = Yes; and I have ensured that my buttons are multiple touch ok in IB... But nothing. Below is my code. Thank you very much for your help. -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event touchesForView:self.view] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; if(CGRectContainsPoint(p1.frame, location)) { if (!p1.isHighlighted){ [self pP01]; [p1 setHighlighted:YES]; } }else { [p1 setHighlighted:NO]; } // if(CGRectContainsPoint(p2.frame, location)) { if (!p2.isHighlighted){ [self pP02]; [p2 setHighlighted:YES]; } }else { [p2 setHighlighted:NO]; } if(CGRectContainsPoint(p3.frame, location)) { if (!p3.isHighlighted){ [self pP03]; [p3 setHighlighted:YES]; } }else { [p3 setHighlighted:NO]; } } /// - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event touchesForView:self.view] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; if(CGRectContainsPoint(p1.frame, location)) { [self pP01]; [p1 setHighlighted:YES]; } if(CGRectContainsPoint(p2.frame, location)) { [self pP02]; [p2 setHighlighted:YES]; } if(CGRectContainsPoint(p3.frame, location)) { [self pP03]; [p3 setHighlighted:YES]; } }
