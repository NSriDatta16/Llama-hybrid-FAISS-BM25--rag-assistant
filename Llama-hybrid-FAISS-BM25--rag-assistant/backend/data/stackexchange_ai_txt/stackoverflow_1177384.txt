Override Drag and drop for Shell Extension

I am working on a ShellExtension code in C++. I am creating a Virtual Drive. Which represents a repository somewhere in the Network. What I want now is to enable Drag-Drop functionality to this Drive. I want to enable user to drag the file to that Virtual Drive and then I must be able to Grab that event, so that I can perform my custom operation. I am not able to find any of such Event or Interface so far. I tried using IDragAndDrop interface, but its rgs files were not registering properly. Is there any way out?
