A great paper by Guyon and Elisseeff (2003). An introduction to variable and feature selection. Journal of machine learning research, 1157-1182 says: "Constructing and selecting subsets of features that are useful to build a good predictor contrasts with the problem of finding or ranking all potentially relevant variables. Selecting the most relevant variables is usually suboptimal for building a predictor, particularly if the variables are redundant. Conversely, a subset of useful variables may exclude many redundant, but relevant, variables." Therefore I recommend caution when interpreting weights of linear models in general (including logistic regression, linear regression and linear kernel SVM). The SVM weights might compensate if the input data was not normalized. The SVM weight for a specific feature depends also on the other features, especially if the features are correlated. To determine the importance of individual features, feature ranking methods are a better choice.
