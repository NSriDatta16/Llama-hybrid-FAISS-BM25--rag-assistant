How to compute the average aligned ranks of variables from Friedman's test

In the paper EUSBoost: Enhancing ensembles for highly imbalanced data-sets by evolutionary undersampling , in figure 2 and 3, the average aligned ranks of methods being compared are plotted. Can anyone help with how to get the average aligned ranks of variables from Friedman's test? I'd also appreciate some direction on how to do a holm post-hoc test in R.
