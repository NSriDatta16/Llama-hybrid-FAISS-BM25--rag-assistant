PHP is a very fragmented community with no "standard" way of doing things. That said, it appears the pageheader.inc example you posted can be simplified. The code at the top is doing you no good. This alone would suffice: If you're looking for some direction on architecture and best practices, I'd highly recommend checking out a popular PHP framework like Codeigniter or Kohana.
