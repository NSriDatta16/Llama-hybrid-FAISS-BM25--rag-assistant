You have a couple of options: You can split your video offline to the fragments you want, and serve them over http to standard FLVPlayback/VideoPlayer component. This is pretty straightforward, but won't allow you to choose how to segment the video on the fly (at serving time). This is because using HTTP, you have to start downloading the video from the start. You can use Flash Media Server, or an open source equivalent (such as Red5) to stream the video over RTMP, which will allow you start downloading/playing the video from any keyframe. You can use youtube, as suggested by other answers.
