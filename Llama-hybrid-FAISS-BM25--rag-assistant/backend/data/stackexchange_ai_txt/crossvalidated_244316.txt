neural network formula

I was interested in communicating a neural network fit that I obtained from R's nnet package in the form of some type of regression equation. The model I obtained gave: a 2-1-1 network with 5 weights options were - linear output units decay=1e-05 b->h1 i1->h1 i2->h1 -0.75 17.72 0.85 b->o h1->o 0.27 0.59 Any idea on how to write this in "equation form"? Thanks!
