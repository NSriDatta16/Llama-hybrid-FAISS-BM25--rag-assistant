Central Tendency for Negatively Skewed Data

I am trying to understand how to best describe left or negatively skewed data in terms of central tendency. I have provided code below that simulates such a distribution, as well as the source code to calculate several different central tendency metrics (i.e. geometric, harmonic means) - note that the code for both means were obtained from here: https://github.com/cran/psych/tree/master/R What I have been reading is that skewed distributions are best represented in terms of median or geometric mean, but when I plot the latter onto the histogram for the left skewed data, it does not really capture the "average" part of the data (see my code and said plot below). I understand that part of the answer to this question is application dependent, and for my purposes I am trying to aggregated (or upscale) remote sensing raster data from a fine grid to a relatively coarser grid. In this context, it would appear the median will not work either, because the median does not include the information in the final answer. So, back to my question, is there a "good" parameter that can be used to summarize negatively skewed data? "geometric.mean"
