Where to save application data in .NET application

My application is something similar to a Contact Manager. Let's say a user can enter contacts with their addresses. I have the code and technology to save my contacts to a file. But where do I save that file? Considering this is a .NET application running on Windows. Should my file end up in the AppData of the users folder? Should I use the Isolated Storage (as mentioned here )? Something else? What's the recommended practice?
