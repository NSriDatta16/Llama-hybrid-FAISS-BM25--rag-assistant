Media queries : avoid inheritance?

Good evening, I have a website with a current css optimized for a desktop experience. I am working on an Iphone css, using IwebKit5 to provide a better user experience on the go. I was using javascript, parsing the user agent to detect which css to use. I was looking for a way to avoid use of javascript, and discovered the media queries feature. --> This is what I tried, it works well on desktop (the Iphone css is ignored), but on Iphone I realized that both mobile.css and desktop.css are loaded, so I am trying to find a way to avoid that. What is the option to add in order to avoid this behavior ? Thanks !
