What's the difference between VARCHAR(255) and TINYTEXT string types in MySQL?

What's the difference between VARCHAR(255) and TINYTEXT string types in MySQL ? Each of them allows to store strings with a maximum length of 255 characters. Storage requirements are also the same. When should I prefer one over another?
