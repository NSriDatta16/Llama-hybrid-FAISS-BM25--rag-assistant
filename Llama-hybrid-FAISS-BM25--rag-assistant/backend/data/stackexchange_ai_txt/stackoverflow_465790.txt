Frankly, Virtualbox will probably get you up and running with the least hassle, but it doesn't support virtualized SMP. Failing that, VMWare Server is free, as is ESXi (whichi s more of a pain to configure unless you have some experience with ESX), and VirtualPC is a serviceable option. If you aren't planning to install anything on the host OS, run it on Server 2k8 with Hyper-V machines (which gives you the option of natively booting from the VHD files also). For my part, I don't tend to treat virtual machines as if they're my desktop. Install whatever you want on the host OS, and leave the VMs to run the services the machines run right now. After all, if you wanted to run your desktop in a VM, you could have done that with RDP on an ESX box anyway. As for the 15k drives? Uhh... ok. I hope they're SAS (not Velociraptors), since you're going to want a lot of cheap secondary storage for snapshots, images which are not performance critical (anything but the SQL servers), and Velociraptors don't have quite the same reliability.
