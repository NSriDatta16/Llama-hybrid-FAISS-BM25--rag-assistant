-fobjc-nonfragile-abi2 on LLVM compiler 2.0: unknow argument?

I tried to built my project on Xcode with the LLVM compiler 2.0 and it gives this error: error: unknown argument: '-fobjc-nonfragile-abi2' I'm not familiar with the LLVM compilers, does anyone has a solution? Removing the argument doesn't solve my problem, because my code has errors in that situation.
