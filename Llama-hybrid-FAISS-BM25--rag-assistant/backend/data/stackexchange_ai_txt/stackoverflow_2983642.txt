Welcome to the wonderful world of ViewState and dynamic controls :-) If you use both (ViewState and dynamic controls) you have to recreate your controls in every request because they are needed to recreate the ViewState. Split your code in control creation code (CreateTable?) and code to fill the controls (FillTable?). The best place for the control creation code is the PageInit event. This is the part of code that has to run in every request. Place the other code wherever you need it (Postback?, LoadEvent?). This part of code has to run once. After this it is part of the ViewState. If the control creation part of your code depends on the ViewState (values of your static controls) you are in bigger trouble. You can't access the ViewState in PageInit! Use another storage methode (SessionState?) to persist this information and redirect to your own page.
