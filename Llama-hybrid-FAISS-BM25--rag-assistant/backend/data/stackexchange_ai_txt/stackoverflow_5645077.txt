Depending on the network statistics that you want to capture, you may find that (as Aamir suggested) SNMP is a good choice. There are standard MIBs defined that will provide a number of network statistics. Three that are worth investigation are: IF-MIB, RMON, and Etherlike MIB NET-SNMP is a good library for accessing SNMP information and is available for Windows (as you've mentioned vc++). Others are available. This does assume that you have an SNMP agent running and accessible on the remote machines that you wish to monitor.
