Neural network (multi-layer perceptron) in R with count data as response

The goal is to run Poisson regression for neural networks (multi-layer perceptron) in R. I am currently using the neuralnet package in R. I have read Is there an R package which uses neural networks to explicitly model count data? and Nonlinear Poisson regression using neural networks: a simulation study . I have figured out that I should change the error function to err.fct = function(x, y) { -(-x+y*log(x))} (for Poisson). Code: fit . I know that act.fct = "logistic" specifies the sigmoid function in the hidden layer, but how can I change to the exponential function in the output layer?
