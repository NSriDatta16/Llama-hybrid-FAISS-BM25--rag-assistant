No need to go full Bayesian, a per your last point. The model you've written down is just logistic regression, so I see no problem doing $$ \operatorname{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$ Here, $\beta_0$ is the log odds of cell type A, $\beta_1$ is the log odds ratio for the treatment, and $x$ is a binary indicator for treatment or not. You can very easy do this in R via the following commands repli The cbind(cell_type_a, cell_type_b) will model the probability of being in cell type A. If you wanted to model the probability of being in cell type B, just do cbind(cell_type_b, cell_type_a) .
