Do you need a project management system if you work alone? Yes. Currently I keep my issues in a very good organizer software and I keep project documentation in Word files (and of course I have a version control system). See. You have a project management system. Why ask? project management system can additionally give me is linking issues with commits. That's not necessarily project management. You can easily do that with you version control software. Read this: http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/issuetrackers.html sharing issues so your users or your employer can view or manage them. That means you're not working alone, if you're sharing something. What are you asking for here? How to share?
