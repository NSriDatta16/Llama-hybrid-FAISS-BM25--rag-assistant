Embedding a SWF in PowerPoint with VSTO

I was wondering if there is someway to embed a Flash Shockwave Object or .SWF file in PowerPoint (Presentation) 2007 and higher version, i.e. inside the ".pptx" format. By embed I mean when I save the presentation,close it . i wont be needing the the .swf file again. That way I can share the presentations with others. If I use this link Insert-Flash-Into-PowerPoint-2007 ,it works but when I save and close the presentation, the swf file doesn;t get embeded. ( Note : If i do the same with a .ppt file, it works correctly) I know we can embed the swf inside PowerPoint presentation version 2003, i.e. the ".ppt" format. but couldn't do the same in .pptx format. Also is it possible to embed .swf file in .pptx using Open XML format? I tried to rename the ".pptx" file to ".zip" and added the ".swf" in media folder and then renamed it back to ".pptx", but when opened in PowerPoint, it gave an error about unreadable content or corruption. I had read somewhere that its kind of strategy from MS not to provide this kind of support for Adobe SWF file / ActiveX object and as of now the feature is not supported. Flashppt PPTX Embed not supported I tried the same with Office 2010 and still the same result. It doesn't work. Does anyone have any workarounds?
