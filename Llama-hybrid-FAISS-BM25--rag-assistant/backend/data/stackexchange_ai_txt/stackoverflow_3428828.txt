tag is a block-level element in XHTML?

I know that in HTML4.0 tag is not a block-level element. What about in XHTML 1.0? Thank you This is the reference for HTML4.0 http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html The P element represents a paragraph. It cannot contain block-level elements (including P itself). Was that my misinterpretation?
