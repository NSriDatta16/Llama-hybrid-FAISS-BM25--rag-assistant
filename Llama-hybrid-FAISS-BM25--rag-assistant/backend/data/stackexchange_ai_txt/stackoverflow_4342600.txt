Magento Category Pages: Change layout of specific categories from grid mode to list mode

I want some category pages to be in the list mode and to start with 30 items displayed but I want another category page to be in grid mode and with fewer items displayed. I understand that I can do this by updating the custom layout xml through the admin panel, but I'm not sure what the exact XML would be.
