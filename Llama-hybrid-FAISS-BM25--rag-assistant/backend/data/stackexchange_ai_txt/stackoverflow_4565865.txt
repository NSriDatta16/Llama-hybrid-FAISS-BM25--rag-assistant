iPhone: Multiple touches on a UIButton are not recognized

I have a UIButton (a subclass of one, actually) that interacts with the user via the touchesbegan: and touchesmoved: functions. What I would like is for the user to be able to press down the button, drag their finger away, and have a second finger touch the button (all while the first finger has never left the screen). Problem is, the second touch event never calls touchesbegan: unless the first finger has been released. Is there some way to override this, or am I trying to do the impossible?
