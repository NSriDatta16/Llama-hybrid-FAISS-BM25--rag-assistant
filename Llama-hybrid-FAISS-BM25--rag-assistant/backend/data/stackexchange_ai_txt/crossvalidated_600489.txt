If all your time series are the same length, cover the same time period and the time steps coincide then your proposed solution to stack them and feed through a single RNN should work. It would make sense to do this if your time series are related and you want to extract joint features. Otherwise you can feed each time series though a separate RNN and concatenate the output before feeding this through the dense layers. For the static features, concatenating these with the RNN output before the dense layers seems a good solution to me. You could first feed these through some separate dense layers if you want to extract some low-level static features. While tacking these features on to each time step is feasible, to me it doesn't make a lot of sense. Replicating that feature across multiple time steps could imply relationships that don't exist and/or lead to the trained model putting too much weight on it.
