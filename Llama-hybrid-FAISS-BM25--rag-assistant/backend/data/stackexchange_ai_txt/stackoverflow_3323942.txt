IPhone: How to Switch Between Subviews That Were Created in Interface Builder

So I basically have two subviews within my main view. I created each subview by going to the library in IB and dragging a view onto my main nib file and then positioning controls on them. Now, I'd like to flip between these views via a "flip" button. What I don't understand is how I can programmatically do this. My question is: do I "Hide" one of the subviews and then unhide it someway programmatically when I do the flip? Do I give each a name via the Interface Builder and do it that way? I don't really need the code to actually do the flip or anything, I just need a conceptual understanding of how I'd refer to views built in IB programmatically and if hiding makes sense in my scenerio... Any suggestions? thanks
