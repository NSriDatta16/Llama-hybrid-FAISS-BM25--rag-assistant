Last year on the a conference in the USA i first heard about Cruise Control .net on a 1 hour presentation, on my way home in the plain i decided to implement a small POC for our company and succcesfuly done it in less than 5 hours (including all the learning i could have done). I am using it since than and i must say that i am very pleased with the results, and ease of operation, There are some drawback (E.g. lack of distribution of task across servers scale although you can monitor several servers) i found a a bug in one of the implementation and because it is an open source i could have fixed it very quickly (big advantage) - i created a little [project][1] in codeplex to contain my fixes before i contribute them to the community as a check in. I highly encourage you to look at this platform, also it would be nice if you can say what you actually need. [1]: http://www.codeplex.com/DavidovitzCCE project
