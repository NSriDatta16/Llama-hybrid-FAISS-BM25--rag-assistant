TTLauncherView in iPad landscape mode has a blank white area on the right

I have not spent enough time yet to look at the code behind TTLauncherView, but it seems to have a blank white area on the right in landscape mode. I am thinking of rewriting the launcher, but anyone has a more elegant solution? I want to remove the blank white area and instead reorganize the items to that blank area.
