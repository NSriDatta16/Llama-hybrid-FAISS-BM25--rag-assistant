If you want to stick with Swift, your main option is Swift for Tensorflow . There are some tutorials in their web page (e.g. this one for training a neural net on the Iris dataset ). I would suggest, however, to stay away from Swift if your main focus is machine learning. Swift for Tensorflow is one of the most popular ML libraries for Swift, and there are rumors that it is no longer active. Other frameworks listed in the webpage you linked seem not to be active either, e.g. Bender 's last commit was on January 2019, SwiftAI on May 2017, BrainCore on March 2017. The same seems to apply to the Objective-C ones. Python and R are the programming languages with most ML tooling available, so I suggest you go for one of them and use their vast and super active ML ecosystems.
