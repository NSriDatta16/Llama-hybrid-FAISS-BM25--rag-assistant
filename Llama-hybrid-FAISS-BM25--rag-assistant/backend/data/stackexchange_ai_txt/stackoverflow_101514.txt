In some circumstances, I use Perl's Crypt::PassGen module, which uses Markov chain analysis on a corpus of words (e.g. /usr/share/dict/words on any reasonably Unix system). This allows it to generate passwords that turn out to be reasonably pronounceable and thus remember. That said, at $work we are moving to hardware challenge/response token mechanisms.
