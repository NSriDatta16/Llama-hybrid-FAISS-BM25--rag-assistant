I have a discrete-valued time series and would like to analyse it, but dont know where to start

Due to some health issues, each day at about the same time, I give myself a score which represents the state of my health: specifically, fatigue, with 1 being the worst and 10 the best. In practice, the scores are between 3 and 9. I have over three years' worth of data. I'd like to understand it: trends (if there are any) or periodic behaviour. I have a degree in mathematics (and a PhD in statistics, but in a very specialised area) but little specific knowledge of time series. Can anyone suggest where I could start with analysis, before I dive in and teach myself time series analysis?
