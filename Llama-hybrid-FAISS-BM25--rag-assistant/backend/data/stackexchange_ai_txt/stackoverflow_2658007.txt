No. It's not possible to put a browser frame inside Flash. You get some rich text capabilities, but far from a full HTML renderer. You could have Flash communicate up to JavaScript in the embedding document and tell it to add the iframe to the HTML document, then position it on top of the Flash so that it looked like it was part of it. But that's about it.
