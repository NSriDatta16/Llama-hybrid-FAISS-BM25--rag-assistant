jquery droppable based on condition

Below is my code. $(document).ready(function(){ $("#container li").draggable({ revert: 'invalid' }); var total = 0; $("#selected ul").droppable({ drop: function(e, ui) { $(ui.draggable).css({ top: 0, left: 0 }).appendTo(this); }, accept: function() { return $("#selected li").length It is something like we can drag and drop LI elements from container div to selected div and vice versa. Everything is working, but LI elements that are dragged and dropped are not being sorted. I mean, if I drop an LI element from container to selected, it is always moved to at the end of LI list. Same happens when I drop element from selected to container div. So what should I do to make LI sortable? Here is link: http://www.jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/HemSU/1/ Please need help to resolve this out. Thanks.
