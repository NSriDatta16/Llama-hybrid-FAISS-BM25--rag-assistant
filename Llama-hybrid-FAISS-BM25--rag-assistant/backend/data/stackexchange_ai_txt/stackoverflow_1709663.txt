First, let me knock off two incorrect points quickly. Details to follow below: RTMP can be done over other servers than Flash Media Server TCP is fine for live. There is too much F.U.D. from the UDP-loving folks out there. Apple has just released a draft specification of doing simple, live streaming over HTTP (and hence TCP) for the iPhone. I expect it'll end up in browsers too. Also, TCP has the bonus of getting through corporate firewalls much more frequently and easily. My read is that complex and UDP-based streaming is tapering off. I'm not forecasting death, just a lesser and lesser share of the market. UDP-based streaming servers consume huge resources, relative to TCP-based solutions (like 10x or more), and the benefits just aren't that tangible. You say you don't want proprietary technology, and "crap on [Flash]", but you still want to do Real streaming? Hate to break it to you, but both RealAudio and RealVideo are both proprietary. If going Open Source really is that important to you, which I can understand, then you'll need to ignore the vast majority of the streaming media market. Have a look at Theora : a royalty-free, open standard, lossy video compression technology Vorbis : a free software / open source project that produces an audio format specification and software implementation for lossy audio compression. Ogg : a free, open standard container format If pragmatism gets the best of you, then reconsider your aversion to Adobe products. Remember, Flash is more widely distributed than any other browser-based player (namely Windows Media Player, Quick Time and Real Players.) You can still use RTMP with open source: Red5 is probably of greatest interest--it can stream live to Flash-enabled browsers. I would recommend thinking about your priorities. Spell them out for us in your question.
