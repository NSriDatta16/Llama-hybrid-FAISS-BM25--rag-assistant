What is a 'classification score' in machine learning?

I wanted to implement machine learning algorithms (SVM and KNN) for a biometric-based authentication system to classify whether a user is genuine or not. I have the feature data. What I understood, in order for me to evaluate the performance of an algorithm using the equal error rate (EER), I have to obtain the score for each instance using a classification algorithm. I have read about classification algorithm from books and papers. I couldn't find information on this. Could you explain what is a classification score? Could you suggest me any reading material for me to understand the concept? By the way, I'm using MATLAB.
