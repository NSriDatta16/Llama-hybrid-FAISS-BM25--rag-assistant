Is there an R function that performs LASSO regression on multiple imputed datasets and pools results together?

I have a dataset with 283 observation of 60 variables. My outcome variable is dichotomous (Diagnosis) and can be either of two diseases. I am comparing two types of diseases that often show much overlap and i am trying to find the features that can help differentiate these diseases from each other. I understand that LASSO logistic regression is the best solution for this problem, however it can not be run on a incomplete dataset. So i imputed my missing data with MICE package in R and found that approximately 40 imputations is good for the amount of missing data that i have. Now i want to perform lasso logistic regression on all my 40 imputed datasets and somehow i am stuck at the part where i need to pool the results of all these 40 datasets. The with() function from MICE does not work on .glmnet Impute database with missing values using MICE package: imp Fit regular logistic regression on imputed data: imp.fit Pool the results of all the 40 imputed datasets: summary(pool(imp.fit),2) The above seems to work fine with logistic regression using glm(), but when i try the exact above to perform Lasso regression i get: First perform cross validation to find optimal lambda value: CV When i try to perform cross validation I get this error message: Error in as.data.frame.default(data) : cannot coerce class ‘"mids"’ to a data.frame Can somebody help me with this problem?
