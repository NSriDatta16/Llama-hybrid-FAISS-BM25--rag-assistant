If you like to trigger an alarm before your measurement is crossing the limit and you want to deploy this in a live setting, you can look at last $N$ timesteps and calculate the trend (or multiple trends on different time scales), e.g by linear regression. Now you can compute how many timesteps it would take to cross the limit and create an alarm if necessary. To look further back in time and recognize seasonal trends and such you can have a look at autogregressive models which are commonly used for timeseries forecasting, there is a nice python library as well ( statsmodels ). Facebook Research also developed a nice forecasting model based on deep learning ( Prophet ), never used it myself though.
