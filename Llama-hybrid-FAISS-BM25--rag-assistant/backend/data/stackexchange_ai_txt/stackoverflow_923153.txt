I agree with Dan Herbert . Put the path in web.config and make sure the permissions for the folder are correct. Also, make sure that path is not on the C drive. That way, if something goes wrong, or if the site is attacked, the c drive won't fill up and crash the server. Be careful with the permissions; even a simple text file can be dangerous if a hacker can muck with the path somehow. Think about someone overwriting the server's hosts file, for example.
