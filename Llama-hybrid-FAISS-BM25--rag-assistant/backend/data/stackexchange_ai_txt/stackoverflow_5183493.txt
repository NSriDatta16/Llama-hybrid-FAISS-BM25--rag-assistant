As far as I know, there is no way to display a datasheet containing a VBA instance of a recordset. If the source of your recordset is strQSL, you could however create a table with your results, and open that one, or more elegantly, create queryDef and open it: Sub ShowQd(strQdName As String, strSql As String) 'creates queryDef and display it in a datasheet' Dim qd As DAO.QueryDef Set qd = CurrentDb.CreateQueryDef(strQdName) With qd .ReturnsRecords = True .SQL = strSql End With DoCmd.OpenQuery strQdName End Sub If you focus on displaying things, you could also put a ListBox in a form, set its Number of columns to the number of fields returned by your query ( qd.Fields.Count ), and set your strSql as the RowSource of the ListBox. AND... if you put all your related code in that form, you now have a form that you can import in any db to quickly display what you want :) Good luck !
