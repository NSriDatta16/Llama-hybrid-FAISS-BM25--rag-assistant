Intel MKL vs. AMD Math Core Library

Does anybody have experience programming for both the Intel Math Kernel Library and the AMD Math Core Library ? I'm building a personal computer for high performance statistical computations and am debating on the components to buy. An appeal of the AMD Math Core library is that it is free, but I am in academia so the MKL is not that expensive. But I'd be interested in hearing thoughts on: Which provides a better API? Which provides better performance, on average, per dollar, including licensing and hardware costs. Is the AMCL-GPU a factor I should consider?
