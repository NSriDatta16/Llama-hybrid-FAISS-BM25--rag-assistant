I think that a physics engine would be overkill for just animating a gui element (unless you already have a physics engine in your game). You could try using animations but I've no experience of doing this without UIKit but I suppose you would start here ? If you didn't want to use Core Animation, I would take a look at Robert Penner's easing equations - they're in actionscript but are pretty simple to port to C and would be a good start to get your own animation code started. Hope this helps, Sam
