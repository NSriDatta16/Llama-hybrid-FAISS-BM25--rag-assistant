To apply Random Forest you dont need to check for any assumption. Take y=t,and x=t-1, t-2, t-3 (all lags you feel would help). But instead of applying RF etc, go with Time series techniques like- Hybrid Model in R, which will give you ensemble of ARIMA, ETS, NN, TBATS, THETAM, STLM algorithms. Another algo that handles multiple level of seasonality ( Facebook's Prophet model)- https://machinelearningstories.blogspot.in/2017/05/facebooks-phophet-model-for-forecasting.html
