For a good overview of common statistical methods, check our Rob Hyndman's Forecasting Principles and Practices . For a comparison of different models, including machine learning and deep learning, check out the M4 competition and their companion repo . The current state-of-the-art on the M4 data set is N-BEATS as far as I know. For a replication and extension of the M4 study in Python, check out sktime (disclaimer: I'm one of the developers) and our preprint .
