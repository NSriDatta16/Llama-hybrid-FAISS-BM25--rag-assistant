About box with Application is agent (UIElement) set to YES?

Im trying to create a application that should only be visible in the status bar, and not have a window until you press the NSStatusItem menu options. So i have one that should open "about" [[NSApplication sharedApplication] orderFrontStandardAboutPanel:self]; But nothing shows if I have the Application is agent set to YES. If I change it to NO it works, but I get a application window and all the menu options that i don't want to see. Any ideas? Kind regards
