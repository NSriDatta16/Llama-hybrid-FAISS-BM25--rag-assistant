If you check the MSDN reference for the WinHttp* functions you will see that you need to link with the library Winhttp.lib. Open the project settings, select the linker options then 'input' and add WinHttp.lib to the 'Additional Dependencies' list. Or you could put #pragma comment(lib, "winhttp.lib") (as previously mentioned) in your source code.
