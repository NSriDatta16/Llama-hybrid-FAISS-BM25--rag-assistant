Incremental learning on Autoencoder for anomaly detection

I want to incrementally train my pre-trained autoencoder model on data being received every minute. Based on this thread, successive calls to model.fit will incrementally train the model. However, the reconstruction error and overall accuracy of my model seems to be getting worse than what it initially was. The code looks something like this: autoencoder = load_pretrained_model() try: while True: data = collect_new_data() autoencoder = train_model(data) # Invokes autoencoder.fit() time.sleep(60) except KeyboardInterrupt: download_model(autoencoder) sys.exit(0) The mean reconstruction error when my autoencoder was initally trained was 0.0206 but after incrementally training the model for 30 minutes it has become 0.3737
