PCA routines typically work by performing SVD first so if PCA won't work for you there's a good chance that neither will SVD. Remember that incremental PCA incrementally processes the records; not the variables, so you'll keep all your variables. However, because you're processing records in batches you will lose some precision. scikit learn comes with a decent incremental PCA routine: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_incremental_pca.html It has a batch size parameter which lets you control how many records are processed simultaneously.
