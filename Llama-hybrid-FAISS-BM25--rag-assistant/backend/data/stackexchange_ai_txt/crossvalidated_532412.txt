There is, as you suspect, a fundamental connection between a Cox model and a binomial generalized linear model with a complementary log-log (cloglog) link.* That is described exactly for interval-censored data, as explained on this page with a link to the literature for further reading. The binomial regression in that circumstance with cloglog link is actually called a "grouped proportional hazards model." The intercepts in that case are related to the differences in cumulative baseline hazard between the endpoints of the time intervals. The above is for a binomial model that explicitly includes (discrete) times in the model. With data organized so that censored cases are omitted beyond the last observation time, a discrete-time binomial model handles censoring like a continuous-time survival model: cases only contribute to calculations at times when they are in the risk set. It's not clear that your binomial model handled times to events. Perhaps there was a fixed study duration with all participants starting at the same time, so that each individual either had an event during the study or was censored at a survival time equal to the full study duration. That would be OK: you then have interval censoring with a single interval equal to study duration, and the explanation above for the cloglog link would hold. In general, though, if you don't model time properly in a binomial model you risk having problems if there's censoring. Finally, don't perseverate over the apparently small pseudo- $R^2$ value of the Cox model. As Frank Harrell explains : The only thing going against pseudo $R^2$ is the difficulty in interpreting its absolute value. But it is excellent for comparing two or more models, even though examining increases in LR [likelihood ratio] is better. With respect to your survival model, the $D_{xy}$ value shows how well you can distinguish between cases. You can calculate the concordance $C$ from that, $C= 0.5 + (D_{xy}/2)$ or about 0.73 in your Cox cph model. That means for any pair of cases whose survival times can be compared, the model puts them in the correct order 73% of the time. As a next step, use the calibrate() function for cph objects to get an estimate of how well predicted and actual survival probabilities align at any specified survival time. *Technically you shouldn't call that a "logistic regression," as that term should be reserved for a binomial regression with a logit link.
