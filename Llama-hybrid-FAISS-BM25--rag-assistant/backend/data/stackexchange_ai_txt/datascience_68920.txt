You’re fine to proceed without worrying about lacking normal data. Go run your SVM. Even in linear regression, the frequent assumption about normality has to do with the error term. Further, that assumption is not part of prediction. The Gauss-Markov theorem does not assume a normal error term, so the $\hat{\beta}=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ parameter estimate is the best linear unbiased estimator whether the error term is normal or not. When we do make an assumption about a normal error term, that is to help us with parameter inference, not prediction. That’s on the side of the response variable, though. For the predictor variables, we absolutely do not make any assumptions about normality, not even for parameter inference. So please feel free to run your SVM without worrying about your data lacking a normal distribution.
