Probability distribution of random variables

The SAT is used as an aid in determining college admissions. This test is a multiple choice test. To discourage random guessing, points are subtracted for wrong answers. Each question has 5 possible answers, and the test taker must pick one answer or choose not to answer the question. One point is awarded for each correct answer, and for each wrong answer 1/4 point is subtracted. Construct a table of probability distribution of the random variable x, which represents the point for each answer. Then calculate the expected point value of a random guess.
