How to setup organization specific data elements about shared items?

First post, please be kind. NOTE: I have reviewed entry #20856 (how to implement tagging) but feel this is different due to the fact that the tags method I'm considering is organization specific in my app. I’m hoping someone can confirm the direction I’m going or point out some other options. (background) We are building a web application that gives different organizations visibility to their inventory in different locations. The database stores users, organizations, sites, and items and there are links from sites and items to organizations that allow us to determine which items / sites to show to which users (based on their organization). It is common for two (or more) organizations to want to use the portal to check on the stock status of (for example) Widget A in the Los Angeles Warehouse. That part is fine. However, the different organizations also track unique information about Widget A. For example, Org 1 wants to track the color, volume, and primary vendor for each item. Org 2 wants to track Color, Stock Type, Inventory Cycle, Buyer Code for each item. I want to avoid a situation where I have to have a table loaded with all these possible fields and then figure out which organizations use which fields. I’m considering using something along the lines of tags, but adding a tag category, and having the tag category be defined at the Org level. So, the basic table structure would be something like: Table: OrgTagCategory Fields: OrgId, TagCategoryId, CategoryTitle Table: OrgTag Fields: OrgId, TagCategoryId, TagId, TagTitle Table: OrgItemTag Fields: OrgId, ItemId, TagId Then, when the user logged in the main dashboard the grid would include their appropriate item fields as columns in the grid. So, from above example, Org 1 would see Item#, Description (would be shown for all), color, volume, and primary vendor. Org 2 would be shown Item#, Description, Color, Stock Type, Inventory Cycle, Buyer Code. Am I overthinking this or is there a simpler method of doing this that I’m missing? All thoughts / feedback sincerely appreciated.
