That's more of a model comparison question: The interest is in whether a model without a switchpoint better explains the data than a model with a switchpoint. One approach to answer that question is to compute the Bayes factor of models with and without a switchpoint. In short, the Bayes factor is the ratio of probabilities of the data under both models: $K = \frac{\Pr(D|M_1)}{\Pr(D|M_2)} =\frac{\int\Pr(\theta_1|M_1)\Pr(D|\theta_1,M_1)\,d\theta_1}{\int \Pr(\theta_2|M_2)\Pr(D|\theta_2,M_2)\,d\theta_2}$ If $M_1$ is the model using a switchpoint, and $M_2$ is the model without, then a high value for $K$ can be interpreted as strongly favoring the switchpoint model. (The wikipedia article linked above gives guidelines for what K values are noteworthy.) Also note that in an MCMC context the above integrals would be replaced with sums of parameter values from the MCMC chains. A more thorough treatment of Bayes factors, with examples, is available here . To the question of computing the probability of a switchpoint, that's equivalent to solving for $P(M_1|D)$. If you assume equal priors across the two models, then the posterior odds of the models are equivalent to the Bayes factor. (See slide 5 here .) Then it's just a matter of solving for $P(M_1|D)$ using the Bayes factor and the requirement that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n P(M_i|D) = 1$ for n (exclusive) model events under consideration.
