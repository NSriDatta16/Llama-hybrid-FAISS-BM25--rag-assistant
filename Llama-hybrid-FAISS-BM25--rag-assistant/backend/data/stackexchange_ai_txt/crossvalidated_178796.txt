In this before-after comparison, we need the assumption that individuals' average unobserved characteristics do not change over time. For example, if some other unobserved event occurred around the same time as the intervention, than this sort of comparison would conflate the average treatment effect and the effect of that event. Another possibility is that the way the outcome was measured changed at the same time that the intervention was introduced.
