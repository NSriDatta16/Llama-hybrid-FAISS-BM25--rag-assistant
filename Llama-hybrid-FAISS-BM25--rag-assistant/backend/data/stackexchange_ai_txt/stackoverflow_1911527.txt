INSERT command inserting duplicates

I am writing a quiz website. What should happen is: A page has a question on it and four buttons or a textbox. When you click a button, it calls itself with the answer number in the address like: ?q=[question number]&a=[answer]. If the question uses a textbox it POSTs the answer. This code should then detect that something has been sent to it and write that to a database. The user id is stored in a cookie. There is also a key column in the database. the idea is that it stores all answers a user has submitted over time and users can change their answers. I don't think it should matter, but later on on the code, it queries the database with the SELECT command. When i run this code, it seems to enter 2 or 3 entries to the database. The trend seems to be that when i run the code it enters the previous answer, followed by the new answer. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Logan
