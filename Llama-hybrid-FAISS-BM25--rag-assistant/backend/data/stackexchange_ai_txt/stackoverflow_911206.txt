How does the execution plan looks like ? By having a look at it, you'll learn which part of the query takes the most time / resources. Have you indexes on the columns where you filter on ? Have you indexes on the columns that you use for joining ? Have you indexes on the columns that you use for sorting ? once you've taken a look at this, and the query is still slow, you can take a look at how your database / table is fragmented (dbcc showcontig), and see if it is necessary to rebuild the indexes. It might be helpfull to have a maintenance plan which rebuilds your indexes on a regular basis.
