Some notes, not too helpful, I'm afraid: I believe rfc5322 limits the length of any individual line in an email message to 999 characters. While it is possible to extend a header field over multiple lines, it seems to me it's a reasonable upper bound for the length of a message-id. SQL CE doesn't support full-text search, so basically you'll have to write your own search engine. Chop the text up into words, then create a table of words, paired with a field containing a list of the StorageId fields they link to. Quite a bit of work, and you're probably better off with a third-party solution Consider adding a "parent" field that links threads together based on their message-ids and In-Reply-To/References headers.
