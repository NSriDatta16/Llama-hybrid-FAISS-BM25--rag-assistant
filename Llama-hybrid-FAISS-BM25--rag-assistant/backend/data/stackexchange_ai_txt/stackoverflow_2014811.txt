This is an incomplete question. So assuming you are using either TextBox or RichTextBox you can use the Lines property found inTextBoxBase . //get all the lines out as an arry string[] lines = this.textBox.Lines; You can then work with this array and set it back. this.textBox.Lines= newLinesArray; This might not be the most elegant way, but it will remove the first line. EDIT: you don't need select, just using skip will be fine //number of lines to remove from the beginning int numOfLines = 30; var lines = this.textBox1.Lines; var newLines = lines.Skip(numOfLines); this.textBox1.Lines = newLines.ToArray();
