Logistic regression line has wrong slope

I have created logistic regression model with my X_variable being income and y variable being a binary variable of whether the business accepts card or cash (link to data at the end), I used sklearn python library to do so and these are the charts I got: However the issue is that while the chart on the right makes sense, with the chart on the left I would expect the line to have negative coefficient as the scatter plot suggest, the y values of value 0 are in the region where the net annual income is higher. Furthermore, I ran the regression using statsmodel library (very similar to R programming language ) where I got a full summary and there the coefficient for cash is negative while for card positive (as I would expect it to be) The data that I used: https://pastebin.com/ShPxuqmL Example code: import matplotlib as plt from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression clf = LogisticRegression() clf.fit(X, y) plt.scatter(X_train, y_train) x_range = np.linspace(X.min(), X.max(), 100) y_range = clf.predict_proba(X.reshape(-1,1))[:,1] plt.plot(X, y, color='red',label='logistic line')
