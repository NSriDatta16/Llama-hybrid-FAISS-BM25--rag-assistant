lme4_fixed-effect model matrix is rank deficient so dropping 1 column / coefficient

I have a dataset consisting of the following: one column language containing five different languages. Two other columns Canonicity and Intrinsic containing either (0, 1). One last column, useOfIntrinsic . You can view the data here . I would like to test the use of intrinsic as a function of Language , Canonicity and useOfIntrinsic . Thus, I ran the following mixed-effect logistic regression model: glmer(INT ~ Language * Canonicity + Language + Canonicity + useOfIntrinsic + (1|Picture) + (1|ID), data = data, family = "binomial") I also tried: glmer(INT ~ Language + Canonicity + useOfIntrinsic:Language + Canonicity:CAN + useOfIntrinsic + (1|Picture) + (1|ID), data = data, family = "binomial") However, I get this error: fixed-effect model matrix is rank deficient so dropping 1 column / coefficient I do not get the error when I exclude the useOfIntrinsic factor. This factor is basically is the count of intrinsic==1 for each Language . I add this factor in order to test whether overall use of intrinsic is a good predictor intrinsic . There are other post that talk about this error (e.g. What is rank deficiency, and how to deal with it? ) but I am still unable to fix the error. Another related question is whether I should reduce the significance level when running the same model 5 times (or order to change the reference language group)?
