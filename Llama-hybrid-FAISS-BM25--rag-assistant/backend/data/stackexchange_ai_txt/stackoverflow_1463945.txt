I've personally ended up using Swing/SWT + JRuby. The Java cross-platform GUI libraries are just light-years ahead because they're used for IDEs, which are about the most demanding application you can have for a GUI toolkit. It's nowhere near as elegant as Rails is for the web (and I'm no fan of Rails), but in the long run, it's a much better choice than anything based on wxWidgets or GTK or QT. It also gives you the option to drop into Java if you have a particular piece that's running too slow. I wish there were better options, but that's what we've got.
