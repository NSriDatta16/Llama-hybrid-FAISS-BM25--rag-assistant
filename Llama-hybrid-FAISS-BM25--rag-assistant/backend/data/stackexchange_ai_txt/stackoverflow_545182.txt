I use a folder for each, which seems to be the convention. Does it really make a difference if you're copying them? What if you want to switch one out? Let's say you go with a new O/R mapper. It will be much easier to just delete the NHibernate folder than to selectively delete DLLs in your Rhino-Tools folder. Take this to it's logical conclusion and you won't have any folder organization in your lib folder since everything uses log4net :)
