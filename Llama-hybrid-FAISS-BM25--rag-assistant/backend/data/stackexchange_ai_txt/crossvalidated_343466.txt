Fat Tails and Volatility clustering relationship

Let's say I have a return time series that after a proper ARMA modelling exhibits fat-tallness from QQ-plot. Can this be a consequence of volatility clustering so that by applying a GARCH model I can obtain normally distributed residuals? When is this the case (if any)? In other words: what's the relationship between significant autocorrelation in squared residuals and leptokurtosis?
