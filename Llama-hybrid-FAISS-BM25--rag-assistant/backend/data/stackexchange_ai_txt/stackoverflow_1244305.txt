S3 is an interesting idea here. Use cron to sync files that are not accessed for over 1 month up to Amazon's S3, then create a web interface for users to restore the sync'd files back to the server. Send emails before you move files to S3 and after they are restored. http://s3tools.org/s3cmd Limitless storage, only pay for what you use. Not quite an existing open-source project, but not too tough to assemble. If you need good security, wrap the files in GPG encryption before pushing them to Amazon. GPG is very, very safe. A more expensve alternative is to store all the data locally. If you don't want to buy a large disk cluster or big NAS, you could use HDFS: http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hdfs_design.html And sync to a cluster that behaves similar to S3. You can scale HDFS with commodity hardware. Especially if you have a couple old machines and a fast network already laying around, this could be much cheaper than serious NAS, as well as more scalable in size. Good luck! I look forward to seeing more answers on this.
