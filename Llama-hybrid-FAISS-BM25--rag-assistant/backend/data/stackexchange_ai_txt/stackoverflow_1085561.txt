Channel allocation algorithm

We have a set of radio nodes in close proximity to each other and would like to allocate the frequencies for them to minimize overlap. To get complete coverage of the area, radio channels need to be oversubscribed and so we will have nearby radios transmitting on the same frequency. Sample data: 5 Frequencies 343 Radios 4158 Edges My current best guess is to randomly generate a population of frequency allocations and to swap frequencies between radios until the best score does not improve for 10 generations. Score is the sum of 1/range^2 for radios on the same frequency. Each edge is the distance between the radios, corrected for walls and floors. Edges above 2* the max radio range have been culled from the list. Is there a better way?
