Interpreting exp(B) in multinomial logistic regression

This is somewhat of a beginner's question, but how does one interpret an exp(B) result of 6.012 in a multinomial logistic regression model? 1) is it 6.012-1.0 = 5.012 = 5012% increase in risk? or 2) 6.012/(1+6.012) = 0.857 = 85.7% increase in risk? In case both alternatives are incorrect, can someone please mention the correct way? Ive searched many resources on the internet and I get to these two alternatives, and I am not entirely sure which one is correct.
