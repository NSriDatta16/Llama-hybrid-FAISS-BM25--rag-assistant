There are many confidence intervals for single proportions and most of them have poor performance for $p$ close to 0 or 1. The "exact" Clopper-Pearson interval mentioned above is very conservative in that setting, meaning that the actual coverage of the interval can be quite a bit larger than the nominal $1-\alpha$. An interval that has pretty good performance for $p$ close to 0 or 1 is actually the Bayesian credible interval using the Jeffreys prior. See e.g. this paper by Brown, Cai and DasGupta (2002). It is simple to compute in R: qbeta(c(alpha/2,1-alpha/2),x+0.5,n-x+0.5) Nevermind that it is Bayesian by nature - it has been shown over and over again to have good frequentist performance! (Although the Bayesian Jeffreys interval usually is recommended in this setting, it is possible to construct intervals that simultaneously give higher confidence and lower expected length for small $p$; see a recent manuscript of mine.)
