You need pre-trained weights for it to be Transfer Learning. Copying layer structures is not transfer learning, it is just structuring a network inspired/copied from others. The transfer learning consists of using pre-trained layers to construct a different network that migth have similarities in the first layers. That is usually useful for Deep Learning. So the reasons for using Transfer Learning are: You want to analyse something different in a dataset that was used to train another network You want to perform classification in a class that was used to train a certain network but was not annotated before You want to train a network for a problem similar to the other one and don't have time or computational power to retrain all layers
