I've resolved this, the problem was the plain text I was passing in in setText. If I take out the call to setText , the result of JTextPane.getText() is nicely formatted HTML with line breaks correctly encoded. I believe when I call JTextPane.setText("Try entering some newline characters") it sets the HTMLDocument.documentProperties.__EndOfLine__ to "\n". This document property constant is defined here . The solution is to make sure you wrap your text in tags when passing it to the JTextPane.setText() method (note, the style attribute is used for any subsequent paragraphs): textPane1.setText(" Try entering some newline characters "); Or, after you pass in plain text, replace the EndOfLineStringProperty (this is more of a hack, I wouldn't recommend it): textPane1.getDocument().putProperty(DefaultEditorKit.EndOfLineStringProperty, " \n")
