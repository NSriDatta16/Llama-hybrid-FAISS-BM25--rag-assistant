Are Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors made completely obsolete by Convolutional Neural Networks in image classification?

I was wondering if the Histogram of Oriented Gradients has been made completely obsolete by Convolutional Neural Networks. HOG descriptors involve specific manually crafted convolutions, while ConvNets learn the best convolutions for the task. Is this proposition generally correct or is there more? For example, a convolutional layer that may learn edge detections on different orientations (multiple filters) followed by a (learned) Gaussian convolutional layer followed by max-pooling seems to me to achieve a similar result to the HOG descriptor.
