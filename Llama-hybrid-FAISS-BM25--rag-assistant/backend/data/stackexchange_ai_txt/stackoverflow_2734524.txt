One approach I've started using was writing unit tests for each method, and putting them in separate files, organized like rubyspecs. I run each spec in isolation, specifying the exact method I want to heckle. I have a rake task that manages all this and prints a report at the end with failing mutations, if any. In the end I get full heckle coverage of each method, without waiting forever for the results. Plus it's even better than the normal approach everyone uses, because I don't get any incidental coverage -- each methods's specs must cover all mutations of that method.
