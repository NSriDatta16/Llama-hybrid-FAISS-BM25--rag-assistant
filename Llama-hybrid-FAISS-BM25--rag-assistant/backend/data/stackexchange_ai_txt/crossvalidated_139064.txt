Conditional probability is measures the probability of an event given that (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) another event has occurred using a definition taken from Wikipedia . It is a domain of probability theory , not statistics, while Bayesian and frequentionist are two approaches to statistics. Bayesian statistics heavily use probability theory, so you see conditional probability often in Bayesian literature, but statistics in general are founded on probability theory. So, no, conditional probability is not connected to any particular area of statistics but is rather more elementary concept.
