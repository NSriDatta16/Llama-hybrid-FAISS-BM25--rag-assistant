Siebel - How to get all accounts of an employee with eScript?

how can I get all accounts of am employee? In the "Siebel Object Interaces Reference" I found an example, how to get all industries of an account: var myAccountBO = TheApplication().GetBusObject("Account"); var myAccountBC = myAccountBO.GetBusComp("Account"); var myAssocBC = myAccountBC.GetMVGBusComp("Industry"); So I would like to do something like: var myEmployeeBO = TheApplication().GetBusObject("Employee"); var myEmployeeBC = myAccountBO.GetBusComp("Employee"); var myAssocBC = myAccountBC.GetMVGBusComp("Account"); But I get an error Semantic Warning around line 23:No such predefined property Account in class BusComp[Employee].MVGFields. I can see in Tools that there is no Multi Value Link called "Account" in Business Component "Employee", so I can actually understand the error message. So I wonder how I can get all accounts of an employee. I found the Business Component "User" which has a Multi Value Link to "Organisation" and another link "User/Account". Is this what I am looking for? How can I know? Where is documentation which tells me about the semantics of links? (Is this described in "Siebel data model reference"? I cannot download this document, although I have signed in...) This link could also link a user to the organization it belongs to. If one of these links IS what I am looking for, what would be the way to go to get the "User" Business Component of a corresponding "Employee" Business Component? Many questions of a Siebel newb...Thanks for your patience.
