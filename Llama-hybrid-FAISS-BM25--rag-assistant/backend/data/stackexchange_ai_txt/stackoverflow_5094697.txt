How should I deal with latency in game development?

I'm working on a hobby project consisting of a multi-player web browser game. It is my first and I have just stumbled into the latency issue. I am trying to make user control as smooth as possible and latency is getting in the way. I reckon that average latencies might be around 80-200ms and that for virtually-smooth control a command-action delay needs to be less than 100ms. I have a few questions: Would it be good practice to try and send user actions 100ms before required ? e.g. User keeps the '->' arrow key pressed, I submit the right arrow key action 100ms before action needs to be submitted to a server. How do developees keep consistency/synchonise between what is happening on the online server and on the client? Any tips or recommendations? Thanks guys, help would be very much appreciated. :)
