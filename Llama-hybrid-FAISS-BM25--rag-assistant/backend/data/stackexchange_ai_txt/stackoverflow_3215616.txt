This idea is your best bet. While it's not exactly what you're looking for, my JLNDragEffectManager (morphing images while dragging) demonstrates one approach to the "borderless window following the mouse". The difference is it looks like you're not interested merely in drag events, but rather "anywhere the mouse is." You can always get the current mouse location by asking NSEvent for the +mouseLocation (given in screen coordinates).
