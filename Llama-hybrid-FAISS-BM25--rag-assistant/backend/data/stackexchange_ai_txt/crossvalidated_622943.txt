Age-sex standardization over study period

I have 10 years of health (number of cases of health outcome, such as asthma cases) and population data, but am using the data cross sectionally because the exposure data are also cross-sectional (due to how the exposure data were collected). The health and population data are both age, sex and geography specific. I am calculating age- and sex-standardized rates for each geography. To calculate the age- and sex-specific rates first, I will use the sum of the cases over the study period from the health data. My confusion is regarding the population data: should the population data also be summed, or should I take an average over the 10 years (similar to when calculating period prevalence)? The latter seems to be more conceptually correct, but leads to standardized rates that are higher by a magnitude of 10 compared to the rates I calculate when summing the population data (i.e., 0.7 vs 0.07). Any clarification on this is much appreciated!
