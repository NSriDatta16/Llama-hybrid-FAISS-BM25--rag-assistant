Why do renamed or moved application shortcuts in the Start Menu get recreated whenever the application is started?

This is happening with my applications that I create using VS2008 and the built in deployment project to create MSI installers. It goes like this: Install the application, which creates a shortcut on the desktop and a start menu folder containing a shortcut to the application. Pretty normal stuff... Rename the start menu folder (usually done by a user that wants to reorganize his/her start menu). Start the application. When the application starts up, a small dialog opens saying something to the effect of "configuring application...". During this process the original start menu folder is recreated (and the renamed one remains). Pretty annoying stuff... Also of note, a deleted desktop shortcut does not get recreated (on application start-up) unless the start menu folder is also renamed (and recreated). I did not see this same behavior back when I was using VS2005. Much googling on this subject hasn't been very helpful so far. What am I missing here? At this point, I'm planning on moving to NSIS as my installer tech of choice.
