Does ASP.net Report Viewer / Reports require Reporting Services on SQL server

I have an application that makes use of Report Viewer and Report (.rdlc) files. Does this mean that I need to have "Reporting Services" installed on my SQL server?? Also would not having "SQL Server Analysis services" affect me any way I want to make sure I keep using - SQL Server Profiler - SQL Server Agent - create and run management tasks - Reporting services if the first question's answer is true.
