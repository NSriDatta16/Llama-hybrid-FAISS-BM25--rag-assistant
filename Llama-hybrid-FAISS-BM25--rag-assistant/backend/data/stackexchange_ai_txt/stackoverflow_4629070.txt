I don't know what the root cause is, but I had a similar experience. I released Circle 8 for iPhone back in September (before iOS 4.2 came out for iPad) and it required iOS 4.0+ in order to use MapKit. Searching the App Store for Circle 8 from an iPad did not show Circle 8, even under "iPhone apps." After I installed iOS 4.2 on my iPad, searching the App Store from my iPad still did not show Circle 8. It was only once I released a universal binary of Circle 8 that it began to appear in an App Store search from the iPad. Weird, huh?
