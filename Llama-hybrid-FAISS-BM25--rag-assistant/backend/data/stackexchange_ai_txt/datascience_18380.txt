Benchmarking mlr (default) learners on OpenML The entire openml database of ML results. Test from RStudio suggests SVM. Mlmastery suggests LDA and Trial and Error . Do we Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems? by Fern ́andez-Delgado et al. Paper concludes parallel random forest (parRF_t) is best followed by random forest, LibSVM with Gaussian kernel (svm), extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 decision tree and multi-layer perceptron (avNNet). The best boosting and bagging ensembles use LibSVM as base classifiers (in Weka), being slightly better than the single LibSVM classifier, and adaboost R (ensemble of decision trees trained using Adaboost.M1). The probabilistic neural network in Matlab, tuning the Gaussian kernel spread (pnn m), and the direct kernel perceptron in C (dkp C), a very simple and fast neural network proposed by us (Fern ́andez-Delgado et al.,2014), are also very near to the top-20. Wainer, Jacques (2016) Comparison of 14 different families of classification algorithms on 115 binary datasets Based on Fernandez-Delgado et al. (2014). "We have shown that random forests, RBF SVM, and gradient boosting machines are classification algorithm that most likely will result in the highest accuracy" Rich Caruana & Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil () An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms (classification) concludes with Platt-Calibrated Boosted Trees as best followed RF BagT Cal.SVM NN. Many other studies include comparisons of models used. Some papers prefer SVM others SVM with radial-basis or polynomial kernel for classification. (maybe same thing) From my own regressions on generated data I recommend earth(MARS) Cubist SVMlinear. Manisha Thesis first runs tests on UCI Machine Learning Repository then soil fertility which is the focus of the thesis. Best models on UCI were :"elm-kernel is the ELM neural network but with Gaussian kernel", "svr is the support vector machine for regression, with Gaussian kernel using the Lib-SVM library with the C++ interface", extraTrees and cubist. The thesis includes great descriptions of each model and links to more papers."extraTrees achieved the best RMSE for 7 of 10 soil problems". Paper is definitely worth a read.
