R - analyzing 2 by 2 table of categorical data

I have a small data set of cases from an outbreak. For each case I have collected data for a few variables (age, HIV status, hospitalisation, country of infection etc. ). There are only 28 cases and so I imagine that it won't be possible to do any meaningful inferential statistical analysis. I would however like to present the data in as scientific manner as possible. I would like to, for example, tabulate the data showing the difference between the cases that are HIV positive and HIV negative. I've included some R script and the results of what I've managed to do so far: data Odds_Ratio Outcome + Outcome - Total Prevalence * Odds Exposed + 2 1 3 66.7 2.00 Exposed - 13 11 24 54.2 1.18 Total 15 12 27 55.6 1.25 Point estimates and 95 % CIs: ------------------------------------------------------------------- Odds ratio (W) 1.69 (0.13, 21.27) Attrib prevalence * 12.50 (-44.45, 69.45) Attrib prevalence in population * 1.39 (-25.97, 28.75) Attrib fraction (est) in exposed (%) 39.79 (-1206.69, 99.08) Attrib fraction (est) in population (%) 5.45 (-22.83, 27.23) ------------------------------------------------------------------- X2 test statistic: 0.169 p-value: 0.681 Wald confidence limits * Outcomes per 100 population units From the above, my interpreting is that the odds of a hospitalised case being HIV postive are 1.69 that of a non-hospitalised case being HIV positive. The 95% CI is (0.13, 21.27). I am not sure that the p value is however. I see a p value of 0.681 but that seems to be for the X2 value. Here is what I'm stuck with: 1) am I using the right statistical test (or should I be doing logistic regression or something else)? 2) how do I get a p value for the odds ratio (or is the p value provided above actually for the odds ratio)? With appreciation! Greg
