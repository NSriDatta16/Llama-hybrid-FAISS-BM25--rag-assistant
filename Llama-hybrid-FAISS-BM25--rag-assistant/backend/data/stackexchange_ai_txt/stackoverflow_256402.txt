If you're using Win32, there are the calls IsBadReadPtr and IsBadWritePtr. However, their use is discouraged: "The general consensus is that the IsBad family of functions (IsBadReadPtr, IsBadWritePtr, and so forth) is broken and should not be used to validate pointers." The title of Raymond Chen's take on this says it all: "IsBadXxxPtr should really be called CrashProgramRandomly" Chen has some helpful advice about how to deal with this issue here . The upshot is, you shouldn't be testing this kind of thing at run-time. Code so that you know what you're being handed, and if it's not what's expected, treat it as a bug. If you really have no choice, look into SEH for handling the exception.
