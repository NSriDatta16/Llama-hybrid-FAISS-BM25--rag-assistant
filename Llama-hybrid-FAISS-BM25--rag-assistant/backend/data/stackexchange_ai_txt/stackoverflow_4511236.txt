Well, that's a result of PHP serialization - I assume CF uses a completely different process. The schema seems pretty straightforward: datatype:size:structure or numbertype:numbervalue so a:2:{i:2;s:3:"foo"} would mean "array of size 2 { integer 2 ; string 'foo' of size 3 }". Note that arrays can be nested, and things can get complicated with Objects and other serialized classes (see PHP's manual on serializing objects ).
