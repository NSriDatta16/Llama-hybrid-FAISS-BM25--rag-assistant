I figured it out. With Lucene, you can add a field with the name 'id', but retrieving id from a hit gives you something different -- I'll guess this is the id of the search term within the entire search results. What I had to do in this case was use a different field name like this: // Id for retrieval $doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnIndexed('item_id', $market->id));
