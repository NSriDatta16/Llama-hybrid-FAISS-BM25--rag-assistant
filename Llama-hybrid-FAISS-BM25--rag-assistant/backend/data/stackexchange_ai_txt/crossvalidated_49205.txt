Variables that do not converge in winbugs

I conducted a Bayesian analysis in winbugs and then checked the convergence from the history plots. The regression coefficients look stabilized, but the variance parameters don't. I got the number of iteration up to 5000, but it still does not look stabilized. I attached the history plots of a regression coefficient and variances. Can you please tell me what I might be doing wrong? Or is is converged?
