How to implement Adaptive Lasso penalty for a Logistic regression in Python?

I want to use an Adaptive Lasso instead of a standard Lasso because of the Oracle properties of the former. However, I cannot seem to find an option to implement an Adaptive Lasso for a logistic regression in Python. For example, the package asgl lets one implement penalties such as an Adaptive Lasso, however, it only supports linear and quantile regressions. Unfortunately, switching to R (glmnet e.g.) is no option here because of company regulation. Does anyone know how to implement Adaptive Lasso penalties for logistic regressions in Python?
