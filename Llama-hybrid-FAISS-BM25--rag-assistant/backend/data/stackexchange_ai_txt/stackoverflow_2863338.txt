I have to agree with those that say "it depends". The most important part is what the audience of the site use, if they use IE6, develop your page to support IE6. In my experience you can expect audiences like this: private : IE7+ or FF private & technical || gamer : IE8, FF, Chrome Many still use XP with IE6/7 unless they are in any way technical people or use the PC very often. art & design : Safari, FF (often Mac-Based) Macs are still widely used in graphical environments and nearly every artist and designer owns one, even if it is just to fit in with the crowd. elderly : IE6, rarely IE7 Windows 95/98 has no support for IE7. You should also avoid javascript for this audience as they usually have crappy PCs. corporate : IE6/IE7 Many companies update very slowly since it involves a lot of paperwork, organization and a budget. Depending on who in the corporation might use your page and what type of company it is you can expect worse (Secretaries, lowly wage-slaves, etc.) or better (CEO, CTO, ...). Note that this is not based on any statistic, only my personal experience. Dropping IE6 and IE7 would be nice but especially commercial sites just cannot afford to lose users. You as creator of a web-site have no power at all to make the users switch browsers. In some cases (like corporate environments) not even the users have the power, they can just use what the admins allow. In other cases they have no idea how to install anything (elderly, kids, ...).
