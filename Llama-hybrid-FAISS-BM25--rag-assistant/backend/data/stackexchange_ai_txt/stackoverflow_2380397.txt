Error while compiling the Xcode project (IPhone)

I added ffmpeg iphone port into my library and I can able to use a few of its functions like avcodec_init(),.. without any errors. But when I include this function call "avcodec_register_all" Xcode is giving error after compilation The error message is : *--------------- ld: ldr 12-bit displacement out of range (4276 max +/-4096) in _CFRelease$stub in _CFRelease$stub from /Users/foxit/Documents/CameraTest/build/CameraTest.build/Debug-iphoneos/CameraTest.build/Objects-normal/armv6/CameraTest Command /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 failed with exit code 1 *------------- Does anyone know whats wrong with this ?
