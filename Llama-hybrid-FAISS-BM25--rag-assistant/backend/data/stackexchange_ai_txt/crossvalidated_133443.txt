What to do about very unstable mixed-effects models

I'm working on some poisson mixed effects models for an interrupted time series analysis, and I'm running into two frequent errors. The first I've posted on Stack Overflow , as it appears to be purely a programming question, but generally speaking, the models are having pretty serious convergence issues. Consider a model like: mod In terms of controlling for confounding, this model doesn't do much - it controls for some trends, two potential confounders, and that's it. Yet there's still some pretty serious convergence issues, and simplifying the model further seems to just be sacrificing validity for the sake of having the model run. In this kind of case, is there another technique one should be using? An alternate package? Other ideas?
