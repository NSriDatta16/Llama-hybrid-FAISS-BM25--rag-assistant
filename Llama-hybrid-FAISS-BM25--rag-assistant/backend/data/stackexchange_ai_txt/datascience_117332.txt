how to define a multidiscrete action space

I want to define a Multi Discrete action space for Reinforcement Learning, gym style and Stable Baselines compatible (A2C, PPO) with the following structure : entry : 'nothing', 'entry with SL 100', 'entry with SL 200', 'entry with SL 300' hold : 'nothing' close: 'nothing', 'partial', 'total' how can I define it? and how should I deal with received actions ex , if algo chooses entry he will tell entry[2] and will access the 'entry with SL 200' in loop and perform specified actions? or will tell ex [2,0,0] ? thank you update: ok, already understood that it should be initialized as 'MultiDiscrete([ 4, 1, 3 ])' but how should I do the action function, should I do ex: 'received action' = [2,0,0] if received action.shape(0) == 0: ... elif received action.shape(0) == 1: needed funcs ... elif received action.shape(0) == 2: needed funcs ... ... elif received action.shape(2) == 0: ... elif received action.shape(2) == 1: needed funcs ... thank you for your help ! update : ok, already understood that i can get a sample of action space after initialize it with action_space.sample() answer is closed thank you
