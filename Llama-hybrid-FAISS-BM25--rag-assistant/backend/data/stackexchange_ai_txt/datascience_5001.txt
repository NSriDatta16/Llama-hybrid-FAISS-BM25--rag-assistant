Data available from industry operations

I'm going to start my degree thesis and I want to do a fault detector system using machine learning techniques. I need datasets for my thesis but I don't know where I can get that data. I'm looking for historical operation/maintenance/fault datasets of any kind of machine in the oil & gas industry (drills, steam injectors etc) or electrical companies (transformators, generators etc).
