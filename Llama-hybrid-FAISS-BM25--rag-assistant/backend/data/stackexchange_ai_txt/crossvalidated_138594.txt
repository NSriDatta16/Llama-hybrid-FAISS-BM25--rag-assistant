Assume the kids can't tell the difference and decide by chance. Then each kid has a 50% chance of guessing it right. So you expect (expected value) that in this case, 5 kids do it right and 5 kids err. Of course, as it is by chance, it is also possible that 6 kids err and 4 get it right, and so on. On the opposite side, even if the kids can tell the difference, it is possible, that by chance one of them errs. Intuitively, it is clear, that if the kids guess by chance, it is rather improbable that all kids give the correct answer. In this case one would rather believe that the kids actually could taste the difference between both drinks. In other words, we don't expect improbable events to be observed. So if we observed an event that is improbable under the 50-50 scanario, we rather believe that this scenario is false and the kids can distinguish between Coke and Pepsi. But what does "rather improbable" and "rather believe" mean? Let your pupils choose $\alpha$: "If we observe an event from the extreme end contradicting the 50-50 hypothesis, which probability may it at most have such that you don't believe this hypothesis any more?" Hope they don't answer $\alpha \leq 0.00098$ Write their $\alpha$ at the board. I assume $\alpha=0.05$. So you and your pupils agree: If we observe an event that belongs to the upper 5% of extreme events contradicting the 50-50 scenario, we don't belive in this scenario any more (reject the hypothesis). Now calculate the binomial distribution with them. $P(\textrm{all kids guess it right})=0.00098$, $P(\textrm{only one kid confuses Coke with Pepsi})=0.01074$ and $P(\textrm{only two kids confuse})=0.05468$. Obviously, you'll only conclude that there is a difference between both beverages, if at most one kid confuses them. This is the moment where you conduct the experiment. Do it thoroughly with all 10 pupils, even if you just calculated that you could stop after the second error. Then record the results and keep them. You'll need the results if you want to explain meta-analyses to them. (By the way, the historical example is about tasting if the milk or the tea has been poured first into the cup. The tea tasting lady.)
