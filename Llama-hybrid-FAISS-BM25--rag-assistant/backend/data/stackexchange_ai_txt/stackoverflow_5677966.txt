FsUnit is a set of libraries that makes unit-testing with F# more enjoyable. It adds a special syntax to your favorite .NET testing framework. FsUnit currently supports NUnit, MbUnit, xUnit, and MsTest (VS11 only). The goals of FsUnit are: to make unit-testing feel more at home in F# , i.e., more functional. to leverage existing test frameworks while at the same time adapting them to the F# language in new ways.
