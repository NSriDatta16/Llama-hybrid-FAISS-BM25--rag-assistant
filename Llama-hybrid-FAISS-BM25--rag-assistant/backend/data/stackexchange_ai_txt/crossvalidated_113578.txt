Consider the following situation : suppose that your feature $X$ has a coefficient of $t$ after training. Now consider the same model, replacing $X$ by $2X$. Then your coefficient will now be $t/2$. However the relative importance of the feature hasn't changed at all, since the information contained by $X$ hasn't changed a bit when multiplying it by $2$. The coefficients in logistic regression just aren't a good measure of the importance of the feature (although they can be an indication if the features are scaled), it is preferable to use other metrics like comparing likelihoods when omitting the features.
