iPhone4 change IMEI?

Can I change the IMEI of an iPhone4? It is just a hypothetical question, I am preparing for a little presentation to show off how easy it is to "hide" yourselves from anyone unwanted (even the carrier) and how people use this to do not pay for their phones, and because of this, I want to show off how easily it can be changed. I've tried Googling it, but only found links to older versions of a particular app what only supports iPhone 3G(S). So, could anyone help me in this? An app name or link would be perfect (IDK if ZiPhone3 can do it), and please before starting a rage war, THIS IS FOR PRESENTATION USE ONLY! I will never change the IMEI of a phone permanently!
