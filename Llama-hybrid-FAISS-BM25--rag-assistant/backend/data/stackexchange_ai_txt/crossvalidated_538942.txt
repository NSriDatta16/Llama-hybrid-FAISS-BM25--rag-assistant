How to look into Agglomerative linkage matrix to find optimal number of clusters using python

I am generating the linkage matrix on 73k data-points. The objective is to find the cut-off point by visualising the distance value from linkage matrix . The code is: import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as sch from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering Z = sch.linkage(u, 'complete',metric='cosine') #u is 73k*768 dimension embedding vectors. Output: Z[0] array([ 52. , 53. , 0.04151, 2. ]) We can see that each row of the resulting array has the format [idx1, idx2, dist, sample_count] Can I use this matrix to identify rough cut-off point/ optimal number of clusters. I tried to plot line graph of all the distance value from Z and identify any jump or Knee-point, but it looks cluttered. But using this how can I decide optimal clusters? Is there a pythonic way to use this matrix to come up with rough number of clusters?
