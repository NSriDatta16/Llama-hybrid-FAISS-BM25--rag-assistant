It depends on the nature of your application, here are 2 examples: To keep session at JSF bean (client-side): normally you are intended to store and retrieve some information less sensitive to be manipulated/supporting some client-side operation such as calculation, provide ID for records retrieval and everything is completely stateless, after user close browser everything will be wife off. Also considering less server load require in such approach. To keep session at server side using Stateful Session Bean: normally you are intended to store and uses sensitive information for that particular session of the user, such as username, password etc... this part creates more load to the server as well as to be more secured. Probably you might want to share more information what is the objective to be achieve otherwise the answers would never be accurate.
