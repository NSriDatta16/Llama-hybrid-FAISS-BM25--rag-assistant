I haven't used Joomla much and have never really needed to tweak Wordpress outside the design but have used Drupal quite extensively. Drupal seems to be becoming the standard for PHP CMS' which I think is quite a shame given how much is wrong with it. I won't try to tell you why you should use it, or shouldn't, but here's a few things that I find really annoying with it. Complete lack of OOP. Ok, in Drupal 7 they're finally doing some OOP with the Abstraction Layer but the community as a whole still shuns the entire concept of OOP as it applies to the CMS as a whole. And given their dependence on modules and third party code doing a decent OOP setup would help keep the code more organized. Currently to avoid naming conflicts you need to prefix all functions and constants with your module name which can lead to some very long function names which can lead to some very long lines of code which can make things a little less readable than doing something like $node->parent()->parent()->title; Drupal content is completely unorganized. When doing an information heavy site it's imperative that you have well organized content and Drupal simply doesn't allow this. Drupal's content management is just one large list of nodes with a few filters you can apply. There are ways you can use Drupal's taxonomy system and other modules to setup relationships but I've never found any that actually make the interface easier to navigate and make it easy to manage the content on the templates. At work I've created a module that allows this but it's required dumping weeks worth of development time into it a simple feature that any good CMS should come with out of the box. The admin interface is absolutely rancid. This one pretty much speaks for its self but install a copy of Drupal and click around. Then take a look at say, the Radiant interface (Radiant is Rails I know, but we're talking UI here). Another example of a good UI for the admin would be FrogCMS , a PHP port of Radiant. No ORM, and absolutely no attempt to have one, means you better like writing lots of SQL to get the data you need. While I generally have no problems with writing my own SQL it's starting to get a bit old when most good frameworks and CMS' built on them have at least some kind of ORM for you to use. Even if it's a botched one. Drupal loves to use non-standard file extensions (.module, .info, .install, .inc, etc) so you better make sure your htaccess and/or virtual host is setup to not allow direct access to these files or all your source code will be wide open for the world to see. Personally I think FrogCMS looks like it's off to a good start to be an up-and-comer if the maintainers allow the community to contribute to it and allow it to grow. You'll need to do more coding as it doesn't have a big feature set out of the box and doesn't have a plugin repository like Drupal or Joomla but from a coding standpoint it's setup with a pretty well done, albeit basic, MVC implementation that will help your code be more organized and easier to maintain.
