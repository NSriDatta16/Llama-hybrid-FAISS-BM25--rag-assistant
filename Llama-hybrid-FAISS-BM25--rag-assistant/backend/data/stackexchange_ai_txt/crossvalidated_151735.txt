Stratified Random Sampling Implementation how to in R?

I have a dataset of 20 million rows. it is organized into strata (groups), and I need to sample from them. I need to create a smaller sampled dataset on which I bulid a regression model. I need to first determine total sample size and then the sample size for each stratum, and then choose the training and test indexes. How does one implement all of this in R? can anyone provide some links to this?
