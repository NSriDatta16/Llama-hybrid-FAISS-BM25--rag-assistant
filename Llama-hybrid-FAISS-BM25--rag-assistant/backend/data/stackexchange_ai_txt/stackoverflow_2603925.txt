Are the contents of a fragment visible outside the host plugin?

I have never worked with plug-in fragments before. I thought that by creating a new class within a fragment and exporting the package that contains it in the fragment's manifest, I'd be able to access that class from another plug-in that already has a dependency on the host plug-in. However, I cannot seem to make this work. Are the contents of a fragment ever visible to any plug-in besides the host plug-in? If so, is there something special I have to do to allow this?
