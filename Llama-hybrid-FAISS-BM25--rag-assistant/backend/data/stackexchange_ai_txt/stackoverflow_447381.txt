I tend to code until I have something that should produce a well-defined observable behavior. Usually, this is a single public API function, sometimes a full class. This also encourages me to break down the problem into small functions with well-defined observable behavior. Most of my functions are smaller than a full screen. If a function is too complex to test, then it's probably badly designed from other perspectives anyhow.
