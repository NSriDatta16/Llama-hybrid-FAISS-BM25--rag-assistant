Find significance level of hypothesis

I'm given two random sample datasets of sample size n=20, where the first dataset represents the weights of random boys, and second group represents weights of random girls. I need to find the significance level of saying that boys on average weight more than girls. To solve this problem I'm assuming that the null hypothesis of saying that boys weight the same as girls (no difference) is true, and building a sampling distribution of differences of weights between boys and girls with the mean difference of 0 (since I'm assuming that there is no difference in general). I've calculated the standard deviation for this sampling distribution and I know the difference of mean weights of two sample datasets (which is supposedly a part of this sampling distribution). Now if I divide the difference of sample means by standard deviation of this sampling distribution what value do I get? Is that a t-value? How do I find the significance level from that?
