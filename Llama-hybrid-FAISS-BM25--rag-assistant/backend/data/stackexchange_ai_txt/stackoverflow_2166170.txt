For block-level, non-replaced elements, when overflow isn't set to "visible" and height isn't "auto", the element's height depends on its descendents ( CSS 2.1 ยง 10.6.6 ). Thus when you set overflow: hidden on .a , it stretches to contain the floated descendents. The is below .a , so it's below the floats. Without overflow: hidden , .a doesn't contain the floated children; its calculated height is 0. The is still below .a , but not the floats. The floats push the inline content of , as floats are wont to do. Try putting borders around .a and paragraphs to more clearly see the difference.
