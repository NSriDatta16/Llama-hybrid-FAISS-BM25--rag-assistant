Xgboost quantile regression via custom objective

I am new to GBM and xgboost, and am currently using xgboost_0.6-2 in R. The modeling runs well with the standard objective function "objective" = "reg:linear" and after reading this NIH paper I wanted to run a quantile regression using a custom objective function, but it iterates exactly 11 times and the metric does not change. I just simply switched out the 'pred' statement following the GitHub xgboost demo , but am afraid it is more complicated than that and I cannot find any other examples on using the custom objective function. Do I need to take it a step further and take derivatives for the 'grad' and 'hess' part? Or could it be a problem with xgboost (doubtful)? qntregobj = 0 , (1-qr_alpha)*abs(preds - labels) , qr_alpha*abs(preds - labels) ) grad Which produces: iter train_rmse_mean train_rmse_std test_rmse_mean test_rmse_std nround 1: 1 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 1 2: 2 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 2 3: 3 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 3 4: 4 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 4 5: 5 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 5 6: 6 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 6 7: 7 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 7 8: 8 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 8 9: 9 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 9 10: 10 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 10 11: 11 122.6362 0.04268346 122.6354 0.3849658 11
