It might be better to say that they appear in the same context but answer slightly different questions. These approaches are used when there are correlations among observations that can't be accounted for just by the covariates included in the model. In a Cox model with only a single type of event experienced no more than once by an individual, those could be within-group correlations, e.g., within hospitals. If there are repeated events, those could be within-individual correlations. The difference between them is essentially the distinction between generalized estimating equations (GEE) and mixed models, discussed in some detail on this page , and also in this answer . The regression coefficients produced by the 2 types of models can differ, as they model the data from different perspectives. Handling of the cluster() term in the R survival package is similar to what's done with GEE. You are interested in modeling some type of population-average effects, but you need to adjust coefficient covariance estimates to take into account the correlations within individuals. The frailty() term leads to modeling inter-individual or inter-group differences directly, similar to the random effects in a mixed model. In a Cox model, the frailty is an individual- or group-specific multiplicative factor in the hazard. Starting with an assumption about the distribution of the frailty among individuals, the modeling then estimates together the Cox coefficients (common to all individuals) and the frailties. That leads to "conditional" estimates of regression coefficients, conceptually closer to what would be used to predict individual outcomes. Frailty-type models in survival now seem to be deprecated in favor of the coxme , or Cox mixed-effects, package.
