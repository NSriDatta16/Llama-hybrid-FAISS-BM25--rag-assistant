You would need to change way how computers and storage works. There is no free memory and there is no way of getting space for free. Changing number system would give you more space when you write it on paper, but in computer memory, you still need same amount of bits. Also notice that, if you want to encrypt something, that operation also prevents any meaningful compression since encrypted content must be as near to random as possible. Usually some form compression is done BEFORE encryption (GZip or something similar) but that does not work by changing number systems. P.S. Use some proven encryption algorithm.
