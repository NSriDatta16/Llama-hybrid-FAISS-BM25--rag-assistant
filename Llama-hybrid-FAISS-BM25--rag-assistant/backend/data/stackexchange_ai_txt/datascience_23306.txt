In R's randomForest, is predict() non-deterministic?

Training a random forest model is inherently non-deterministic (absent control over the random number generator), but is predict() also non-deterministic? That is, if I construct randomForest (with an odd number for ntree per the caveat in the doc) and save an .rda , will loading that .rda give me identical results given identical inputs? I tried answering this myself by looking through https://github.com/cran/randomForest , and it seems that nobody along the predict() path is calling for a random number, but I'm very new to R and rather rusty with C and may be missing something. Pointers into the code or the docs will be appreciated.
