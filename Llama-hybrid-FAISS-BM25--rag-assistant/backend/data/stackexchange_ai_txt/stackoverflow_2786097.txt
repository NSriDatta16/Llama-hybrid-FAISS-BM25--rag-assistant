It appears that SqlCe does not support isolated storage. See these questions. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/108399/what-embedded-database-with-isolated-storage... What are the advantages of VistaDB VistaDB looks like a better choice. Or, you could set up some kind of hack where you use the IS API to copy the SDF (SQlCe) file out of isolated storage to a location in the normal file system, where you can interact with it normally and then copy the SDF file back into IS. This pretty much defeats the purpose of isolated storage though, so I wouldn't recommend it.
