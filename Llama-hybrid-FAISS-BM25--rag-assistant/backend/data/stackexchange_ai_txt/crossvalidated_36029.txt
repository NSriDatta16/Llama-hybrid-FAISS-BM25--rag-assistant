A question about notation of Bayes' Theorem

When I studied Bayesian statistics, a question about the notation of Bayes' Theorem came to my mind. Below is the density function version of Bayes' Theorem, where $y$ is data vector and $\theta$ is the parameter vector: $$ p(\theta|y)=\frac{p(y|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(y)} $$ The numerator on the right handside can be written as: $$ p(y,\theta) $$ which is the joint probability distribution of $y$ and $\theta$, then Bayes' theorem could be written as: $$ p(\theta|y)=\frac{p(y,\theta)}{p(y)} $$ Furthermore, $$ p(\theta|y)\propto p(y,\theta) $$ Am I right on this? I think it does not look right. Because the posterior is the proportional to the joint density function. But where is the mistake?
