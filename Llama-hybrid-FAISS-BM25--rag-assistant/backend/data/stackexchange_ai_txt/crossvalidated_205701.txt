Yes, that is the gist of how you'd set up a mixed effects model (or rather, that's the right pattern for how you'd write it using most mixed model libraries in R). As for whether that's conceptually the right model, it depends on how you're defining age. The term (1|Age) models Age category-specific intercept effects. Random effects are typically defined so that each individual group's random effect follows a Standard Normal distribution, and the sum of all random effect estimates is zero (some groups are above average, some are below average).
