How can I drag and drop from Excel cells to a drag-enabled task pane programatically?

I am using Excel 2007, VS2008 Pro. I am building a VSTO Add-in that requires "drag and drop from Excel cells to a drag-enabled task pane". So far I notice that I can only drag and drop within the cells themselves. It does not allow me to drop into the task Pane or drag past the sheet limits. (http://www.computerimages.com/tip_xl.html) Note: The task pane has drag drop enabled, I ahve already tested I can drag/drop from task pane to excel but I need to do this the other way around?
