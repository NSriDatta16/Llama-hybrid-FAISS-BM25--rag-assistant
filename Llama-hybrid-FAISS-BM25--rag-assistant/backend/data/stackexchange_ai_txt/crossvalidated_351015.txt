Which software to use for Gaussian regression on spatially and temporally correlated data?

Which tools out there could help me to do a Gaussian process regression on spatially and temporally correlated data? My main aim is to extract values for a particular covariance model. I know that in Machine learning area a similar technique is referred to as Gaussian processes (GP). In the context of GP, covariances are called kernels. I have acquired data from multiple temperature sensors deployed in a city. My data is non-uniform distributed, meaning that samples (measurements) from a different sensor are not acquired at the same time. Furthermore, the number of samples per sensor is uneven.
