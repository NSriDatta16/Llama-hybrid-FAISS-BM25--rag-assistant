How do I back up SQL 2008 tables & stored procedures?

Last night I got completely hosed by a worm from Dilbert.com (so be careful there). It is invasive enough where I am going to do a complete system restore. The only thing I need to save on the pc is a database (consisting of just tables & stored procs) in SQL 2008. How can I export them so that, once I restore, I can easily import them again. I thought about doing Access, but that is never completely clean (data types get changed and such).
