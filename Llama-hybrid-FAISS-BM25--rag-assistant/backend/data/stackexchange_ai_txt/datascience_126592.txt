Colab file errors

and thank you to whoever answers this. I'm pretty new to data science and machine learning, and I've been trying to immerse myself in it. I feel like there's so much to learn. One of the things that's been a constant frustration: I keep getting the same error over and over again. Whether it's in VS Code or Colab or any platform, when I try to read any sort of file, esp csv files, I get "no such file or directory". I've tried many different things, usually recommended by chatGPT, but no luck. Does anyone have any suggestions? I really want to improve at reading datasets and csv files. Thanks.
