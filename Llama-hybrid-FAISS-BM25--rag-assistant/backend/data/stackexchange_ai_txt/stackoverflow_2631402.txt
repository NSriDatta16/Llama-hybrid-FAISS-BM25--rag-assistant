iPhone/Obj-C: Accessing a UIScrollView from a View displayed within it

I'm writing a simple iPhone app which lets a user access a series of calculators. It consists of the following: UITableViewController ( RootViewController ), with the list of calculators. UIViewController + UIScrollView ( UniversalScroller ), which represents an empty scroll view - and has a 'displayedViewController' property. UIViewController ( Calculators 1-9 ), each of which contains a view with controls that represents a particular calculator. Each calculator takes 3-5 values via UITextField s and UISliders , and has a 'calculate' button. They can potentially be taller than 460px(iPhone screen height). The idea is: User taps on a particular menu item in the RootViewController . This loads and inits UniversalScroller , ALSO loads and inits the UIViewcontroller for the particular calculator that was selected, sets the displayedViewController property of UniversalScroller to the newly loaded calculator UIViewcontroller , and pushes the UniversalScroller to the front. When the UniversalScroller hits its ' viewDidLoad ' event, it sets its contentSize to the view frame size of its ' displayedViewController ' object. It then adds the displayedViewController's view as a subview to itself, and sets its own title to equal that of the displayedViewController . It now displays the calculator, along with the correct title, in a scrollable form. Conceptually (and currently; this stuff has all been implemented already), this works great - I can design the calculators how I see fit, as tall as they end up being, and they will automatically be accommodated and displayed in an appropriately configured UIScrollView . However, there is one problem: The main reason I wanted to display things in a UIScrollView was so that, when the on-screen-keyboard appeared, I could shift the view up to focus on the control that is currently being edited. To do this, I need access to the UniversalScroller object that is holding the current calculator's view. On the beganEditing : event of each control, I intended to use the [UniversalScroller.view scrollRectToVisible: animated:] method to move focus to the correct control. However, I am having trouble accessing the UniversalScroller . I tried assigning a reference to it as a property of each calculator UIViewController , but did't seem to have much luck. I've read about using Delegates but have had trouble working out exactly how they work. I'm looking for one of three things: Some explanation of how I can access the methods of a UIScrollView from a UIViewController whose view is contained within it. or Confirmation of my suspicions that making users scroll on a data entry form is bad, and I should just abandon scrollviews altogether and move the view up and down to the relevant position when the keyboard appears, then back when it disappears. or Some pointers on how I could go about redesigning the calculators (which are basically simple data entry forms using labels, sliders and textfields) to be contained within UITableViewCells (presumably in a UITableView , which I understand is a scrollview deep down) - I read a post on SO saying that that's a more pleasing way to make a data entry form, but I couldn't find any examples of that online. Screenshots would be nice. Anything to make my app more usable and naturally 'iPhone-like', since shuffling labels and textboxes around makes me feel like I am building a winforms app! I've only recently started with this platform and language, and despite being largely an Apple skeptic I definitely see the beauty in the way that it works. Help me solve this problem and I might fall in love completely. Dan
