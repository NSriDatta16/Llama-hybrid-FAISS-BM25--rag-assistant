Is there a free code coverage tool suitable for use with .NET 4 and NUnit?

Is there a free code coverage tool suitable for use with .NET 4 and NUnit that runs from the command line (and is thus suitable for use on a build server)? Please note that any tools that require editions of Visual Studio higher than Professional are not appropriate in this case. I am asking this question because I can't get NCover 1.5.8 to work with NUnit 2.5.5 on a .NET 4 C# app. I can run the unit tests, and I can generate a Coverage.Xml file, but it is empty - it contains no sequence points. After a lot of research, I have concluded that this is because NCover 1.5.8 simply doesn't work with .NET 4. However, if you know better, please feel free to answer this question from another user .
