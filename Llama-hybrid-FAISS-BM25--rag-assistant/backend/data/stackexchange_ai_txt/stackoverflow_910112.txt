Instead of guessing, measure it. Come up with a list of 100 words and ask a handful of people to type them in. Measure the amount of time between each keystroke. For every pair of letters, accumulate the total time taken by the user to move from the first to the second and divide by the number of times that letter pair appears to get an average, which is an actual direct estimate of the difficulty of moving between those two keys. Of course, there will be some pairs of letters that don't appear anywhere in your words (e.g. ZQ). But those letter pairs will probably be irrelevant to your work anyway, unless you need to score random sequences of letters. You'll also need to somehow account for mistyped letters. You could either discard these outright, or use mistyped letters to add some sort of penalty to that letter pair (reflecting the fact that mistyping one of the letters indicates that this letter pair may be difficult to type).
