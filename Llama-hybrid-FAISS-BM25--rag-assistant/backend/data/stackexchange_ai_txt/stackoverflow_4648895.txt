Accessing the DOM to obtain values from a HTML table Server-Side

I created a aesthetic control that creates two lists in seperate div tags organized with a table for each. The control always the user to click on the img tag associated with each item to move it between the two lists. I am doing all the movement between the lists via javascript and want to have a good method for obtaining the values and storing them in two lists upon Postback. I thought of doing something like storing the indexes/classes in hidden values and them reading them to find the items but that seems messy. Also, thought there might be a clever way of traversing the DOM via FindControl() but not sure. Any input would be great. One other thing is that this is not a composite control. All the tags are being rendered in the RenderContents() method. So I don't know if there is a way to even tack on a runat="server" attribute to an elem like I normally would if I wanted code behind access to an html element. Here is the HTML that is generated. I don't think there is need to post the server side code since it does nothing more than generate the html at this point. Item 1 Item 2
