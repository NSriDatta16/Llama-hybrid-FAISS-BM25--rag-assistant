WPF is not supported. Silverlight is not supported in current phones but will be supported with Windows Phone 7. XNA will be supported on Windows Phone 7. For the current phones on the market you really have to abandon the idea that you're going to get a decent UI by simply dragging controls out of the toolbox. That simply is not going to happen. You can still create compelling UI, but you have to do custom/manual drawing of your controls.
