There are some options not to overfit your Random Forest Classifier given your observations: 1. Complexity of the Model (Tree Depth) Check the max_depth parameter in the tuned RF model. A very high value might contribute to overfitting. Consider reducing it to limit the depth of the trees. 2. Number of Trees (n_estimators) Large values of n_estimators can lead to overfitting. Experiment by reducing the number of trees to find a balance that prevents overfitting while maintaining good performance. 3. Feature Importance and Selection: Reevaluate the features selected based on RF feature importance. Using too many features may introduce noise. Experiment with a smaller subset to assess its impact on overfitting. 4. Cross-Validation Strategy Ensure an appropriate cross-validation strategy during hyperparameter tuning. Consider using a stratified k-fold to maintain the class distribution in each fold. 5. Class Imbalance Handling Despite using class_weight='balanced', class imbalance might still pose a challenge. Try to address the imbalance by using oversampling, undersampling, or advanced techniques like SMOTE. 6. Ensemble Model Calibration Random Forests can produce overly confident probability estimates. Consider calibration techniques like Platt scaling or isotonic regression. Scikit-learn's CalibratedClassifierCV can be useful for this purpose.
