As I mentioned even though you cannot compute a confidence interval for the mean of the distribution you can determine a nonparametric tolerance interval. Tolerance interval tell you with a given level of confidence what percentage of the distribution of your run lengths fall within the interval. They are based on using upper and lower order statistics for the end point. Since you can say that the minimum distance out of 20 was 3.9 km and the maximum was 4.05 that range can be used as a tolerance interval for a certain confidence and coverage. Table A.16 in Hahn and Meeker's book "Statistical Intervals" provides the answer. From this we see that you can be 99% confident that the interval generated by taking the range will include at least 75% of the distribution. For it to be able to claim higher coverage you would need a larger sample size. For a sample size of 50 it will give you 99% confidence in a coverage of 90% of the distribution and for 95% you need a sample size of 100. For 99% confidence in 99% coverage you need a sample size of 500. The required sample size can go down a little for a given % coverage if you lower the ocnfidence level from 99% to say 95% or 90%.
