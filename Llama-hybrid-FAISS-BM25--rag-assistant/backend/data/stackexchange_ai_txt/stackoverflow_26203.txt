If you're using C# 3.0 you can use linq, which is way better and way more elegant: List myList = GetListOfIntsFromSomewhere(); // This will filter ints that are not > 7 out of the list; Where returns an // IEnumerable , so call ToList to convert back to a List . List filteredList = myList.Where(x => x > 7).ToList(); If you can't find the .Where , that means you need to import using System.Linq; at the top of your file.
