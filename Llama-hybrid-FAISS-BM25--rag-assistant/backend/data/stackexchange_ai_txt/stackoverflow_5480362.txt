I don't know how many email clients interpret or generate this correctly, but RFC 3676 includes the following: When creating flowed text, the generating agent wraps, that is, inserts 'soft' line breaks as needed. Soft line breaks are added at natural wrapping points, such as between words. A soft line break is a SP CRLF sequence. So if the previous line has a space at the end of it, the current line should be interpreted as a continuation of the previous line. I suggest reviewing the entire RFC.
