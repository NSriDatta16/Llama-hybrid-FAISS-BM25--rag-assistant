Set trigger for both the form and the inputs, but when the input events are triggered, stop the propagation to the form by calling the stopPropagation method. By the way, IMHO, it's not a great thing to change default behaviors to anything any average user is used to - that's what make them angry when using your system. But if you insist, then the stopPropagation method is the way to go.
