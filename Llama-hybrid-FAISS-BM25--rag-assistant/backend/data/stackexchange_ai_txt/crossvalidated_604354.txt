As you've noted, simulating from the posterior is common in Bayesian modelling. It is also common to simulate from the prior , which is often called prior predictive sampling or prior predictive checking . The purpose of doing these simulations is to check that the model predicts scientifically justifiable outcomes even before it is updated with data. For example, I'm going to seriously doubt my prior is justifiable if it predicts that moose run at the speed of light with some non-negligible probability. You can read more about prior predictive checking in Bayesian Workflow , or see some code in the pymc docs and stan docs .
