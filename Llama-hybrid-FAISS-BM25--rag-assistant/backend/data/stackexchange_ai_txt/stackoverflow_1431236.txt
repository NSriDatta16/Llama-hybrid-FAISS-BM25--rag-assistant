Remove Header and Footer using C#

I'm working on windows application using C#. I generated the "Report" using IE control. While printing and exporting into XPS format, Header and Footer are appearing. But i don't want the header and Footer and also i don't want to touch the IE settings. I want to remove the Header and Footer using C#. So user can print other IE pages with Header and Footer. How to do this. Updated: Ok, Header and Footer needs to be disabled while printing. I'm using IE browser for displaying the Report and it has three export options( HTML, PDF, XPS). Export to pdf is done using Infragistics document engine. This report has print option also, for this i need to remove Header and Footer while printing.
