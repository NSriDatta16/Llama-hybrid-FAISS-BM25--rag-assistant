How to convert the following MySQL schema into CouchDB?

I am not sure how I can design the following problem in CouchDB. I have a logger web app that keeps track of how many items are in a warehouse. To simplify the problem we just need to know the total number items currently in warehouse and how long is each item stays in warehouse before it ships. Lets say the warehouse only have shoes but each shoe have different id and need to keep track by id. MySQL schema looks like this id name date-in data-out 1 shoe 08/0/2010 null 2 shoe 07/20/2010 08/01/2010 The output will be Number of shoe in warehouse: 1 Average time in warehouse: 14 days Thanks
