I like the Right BICEP acronym from the aforementioned Pragmatic Unit Testing book: Right : Are the results right ? B : Are all the b oundary conditions correct? I : Can we check i nverse relationships? C : Can we c ross-check results using other means? E : Can we force e rror conditions to happen? P : Are p erformance characteristics within bounds? Personally I feel that you can get pretty far by checking that you get the right results (1+1 should return 2 in a addition function), trying out all the boundary conditions you can think of (such as using two numbers of which the sum is greater than the integer max value in the add function) and forcing error conditions such as network failures.
