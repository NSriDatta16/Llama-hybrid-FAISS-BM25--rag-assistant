Age-standardized survey results with complex sampling in SPSS

Apologies if I am missing something obvious with this question, but I have dug around online a fair bit and can't quite seem to find the answer I am looking for. At my organization we have health survey data which is sampled using a complex sampling plan, in order to be representative at the national and regional levels. We use SPSS complex samples for the bulk of our analysis work. In case it matters, the sampling plan is summarized below: Stage 1 (equal probabilities without replacement): Strata: region_num, sub_region_num, comm_size_num Clusters: residence_merge Weights: weight_final Probability of inclusion: inc_prob_1 Stage 2 (equal probabilities without replacement): Strata: age_gender_group Clusters: Weights: Probability of inclusion: inc_prob_2 I have been asked by a partner organization to produce some age-standardized tables in order to compare with a different dataset. I am familiar with the method outlined here: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/can-spss-produce-standardized-rate-estimates-correct-standard-errors-under-complex-sampling which produces age-standardized rates, but what I would like to produce are age-standardized frequency tables for categorical variables in the dataset, i.e., likert-style responses. My question is, how should I go about producing these age-standardized tables? I know I could create dummy variables for each category and compute the rate separately, but that seems unnecessarily cumbersome-- surely there is a better way? Also, I could (and have, for exploratory purposes) create a weighting variable, which when applied produces the correct mean estimates, but my hunch is that the standard error (and consequently my confidence intervals and CVs) will not be correct. Any and all guidance would be appreciated.
