Evaluate statistically if time series is Jump or Trend?

Q1. Is there any statistical test to differentiate "Trend" and "Jumps". Below example. I have tried Successive variation test (Neumann), all data sets yield same results. It is clear that Example 1 has trend, Jumps in case of example 2 & 3. What statistical will tell us that Example 1 has trend while other's do not. Unfortunately will not be able to share the data, just looking for some clues. Q2. How do you statistically conclude that there is trend / No trend ? |or| How do you say data is non-stationary and has a trend ? If slope is the measure of trend, is there a threshold for slope after which we can consider that the time series has a trend ?
