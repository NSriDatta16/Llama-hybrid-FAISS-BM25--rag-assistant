Depends on what model you want to use to estimate the difference. Plenty of power calculations exist for power to detect a difference in means for a binary variable which are based on a difference in proportions z test. If you want to use logistic regression, the power can be computed using the following equation $$ \gamma=1-\Phi\left[z_{1-\alpha / 2}-\left|\beta\right| \sigma_{x} \sqrt{n p(1-p)}\right] $$ Here $\mathbf{\Phi}$ is the standard normal CDF $\beta$ would be the estimated coefficient in your model $\sigma_x$ is the variance of the predictor $p$ is the prevalence of the outcome And of course, you could use LPM. The differences in these approaches may be appreciable when sample sizes are small but they should converge with enough data.
