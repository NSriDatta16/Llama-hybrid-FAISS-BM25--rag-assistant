How to use correct weights in linear regression model

I'm trying to understand can we implement a simple linear regression model. Let's say we are predicting price currencies. We want to know whether the currency will raise or not. As i understand, we need to define two vectors for this: $x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$ - months $y=[2.30,2.33,2.29,2.30,2.36,2.40,2.46,2.50,2.48, 2.43,2.38,2.35]$ - average prices. Let's plot this: Before sigmoid separator, i will try a simple linear separator. I'm guessing that at first, I need to choose some random slope (and bias will be the smallest scalar in vector). $f(x) = 0.026x+2.3$ As we see, the separator is inaccurate, let's try the quadratic cost function at f(1): $C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N}(\hat{y} - y)^2$ $C = \frac{1}{1} \sum_{i=0}^{1}(2.3259999999999996-2.30)^2=0.0006759999999999897$ It seems accurate in the beginning, but it gets worse as it progresses, so somehow i need to improve it. From my knowledge, the next step is to find the derivative of the function. Normally, gradient descent algorithm is used for this, but finding a slope of the tangent line is very easy here: $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0.026$ What is the next step? How can i use this derivative to use proper weights to minimize the cost function?
