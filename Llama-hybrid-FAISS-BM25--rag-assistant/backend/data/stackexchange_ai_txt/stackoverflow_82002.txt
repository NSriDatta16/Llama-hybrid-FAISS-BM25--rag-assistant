I've done multithreaded data access, and it's not straightforward: 1) You need to create a session per thread. 2) Everything done to that TDataSet instance must be done in context of the thread where it was created. That's not easy if you wanted to place e.g. a db grid on top of it. 3) If you want to let e.g. main thread play with your data, the straight-forward solution is to move it into a separate container of some kind,e.g. a Memory dataset. 4) You need some kind of signaling mechanism to notify main thread once your data retrieval is complete. ...and exception handling isn't straightforward, either... But: Once you've succeeded, the application will be really elegant !
