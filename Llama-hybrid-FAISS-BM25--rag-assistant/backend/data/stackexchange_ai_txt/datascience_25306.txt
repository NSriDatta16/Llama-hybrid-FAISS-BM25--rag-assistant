With Doc2Vec, each string will be treated as a separate document regardless of any formatting such as sentences or paragraphs. So for an analysis of a book from project Gutenberg, you could have each chapter of the book treated as a document or you could treat each paragraph as a document. So, for a two sentence paragraph like your example ['I really love football. Peyton Manning was a great player'] and use a sentence tokenizer such as the NLTK package in Python's nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenizer() function which will divide your string into separate sentences. You would then run the tokenized sentences through Doc2Vec and have each sentence as a different document. See this example for an example with a sentence tokenizer in Python The choice of which level of text to treat as a document should be based on what your research design is and what unit of analysis you want to interpret for the end product. You tagged the question with gensim, so I assume you are trying to do a topic model. You have to weigh whether you are interested on change in topics from sentence to sentence, in paragraph chunks, or some other hierarchy within the text.
