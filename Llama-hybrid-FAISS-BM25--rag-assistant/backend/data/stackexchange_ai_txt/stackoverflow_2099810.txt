I think UIScrollView becomes the first responder of touch events, and it doesn't pass the touch events to other view as a default. So, why don't you create a subclass of the UIScrollView? Then, pass the all touch events which are received by the subclass to the UIIMageview or UITextview like as follows. @implementation SubclassOfScrollView - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } @end
