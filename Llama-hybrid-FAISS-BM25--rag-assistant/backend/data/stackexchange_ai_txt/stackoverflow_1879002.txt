I would agree with your colleague in this case. Storage and processing should be separated because both have different "reasons to change." As for the bank example you gave, I would argue that a bank doesn't sell mortgages. The loans department (or whatever) sells mortgages, and the bank has a loans department. Treating "the bank" as a single object is the equivalent of one person running an entire bank.
