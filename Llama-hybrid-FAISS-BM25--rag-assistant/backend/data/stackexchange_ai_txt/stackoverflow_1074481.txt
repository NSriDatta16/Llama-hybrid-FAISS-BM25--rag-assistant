osgi: fragment is not working outside eclipse pde (and no error appeared)

Context of this problem: OSGi and Eclipse Platform. I've got bundle (plugin) which is host for some fragment. Fragment is running only when I start it through Eclipse "run configuration" (I add it in plugin dependencies in run configuration of plugin), but when I am trying to export it either through eclipse or through maven tycho project then fragment is not working. In osgi's console I've not found any conflicts (osgi command diag ) and fragment is in "RESOLVED" state which afaik means it's ok and it's started. Breakpoint in fragment in method IStartup#earlyStartup() (which is afaik entry point to fragment) is not activated, no error shown in osgi's console...nothing... Any clue? Am I missing something?
