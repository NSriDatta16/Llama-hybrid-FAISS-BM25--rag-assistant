Take a look at this blog post: http://www.bendewey.com/blog/index.php/9/jquery-rollover-image Based on Daniel Roberts answer, the plugin is similar to his solution #2 in which I take a base link with an image on the bottom and then using relative positioning, I place the hover image on top. When the user hovers over the link the hover image on top fades from an opacity of 0 to 1, now depending on your image in the background, this could look nice and seamless, although, if your background image has a lot of contrast the results may have interesting results.
