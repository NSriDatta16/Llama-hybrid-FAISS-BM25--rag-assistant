Are the terms Hypothesis Space and Parameter Space Interchangeable?

In the Machine Learning literature there seems to be a term called the Hypothesis Space. As a statistician, I find this to be a bit of a awkward term, but in use it seems to imply that it is equivalent to a non-parametric parameter space (infinite dimensional). Are these two terms equivalent?
