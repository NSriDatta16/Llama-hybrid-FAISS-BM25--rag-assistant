cssSandpaper.js help needed?

For a small project I am using the rotate js library found: http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/03/09/cross-browser-css-transforms-even-in-ie/ cssSandpaper.js (line 308) Line: me.identity = $M([[1, 0], [0, 1]]); Unfortunaly im getting $M is not defined, Im not brilliant at understanding loads and loads of javascript (although I can understand my own code fine) so could anyone think of a way of fixing this?
