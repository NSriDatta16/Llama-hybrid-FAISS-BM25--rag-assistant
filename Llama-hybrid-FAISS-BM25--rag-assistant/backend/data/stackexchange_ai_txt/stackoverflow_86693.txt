This screening technique is intended to reduce the number of distance computations you need to perform in the average case, without compromising the accuracy of the result. It works on convex and concave polygons. Find the the minimum distance between each pair of vertexes such that one is a red vertex and one is a blue. Call it r . The distance between the polygons is at most r . Construct a new region from the red polygon where each line segment is moved outward by r and is joined to its neighbors by an arc of radius r is centered at the vertex. Find the distance from each vertex inside this region to every line segment of the opposite color that intersects this region. Of course you could add an approximate method such as bounding boxes to quickly determine which of the blue polygons can't possibly intersect with the red region.
