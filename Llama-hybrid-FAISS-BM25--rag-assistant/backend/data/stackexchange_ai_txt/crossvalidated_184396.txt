Confused on Neural Network Representation

I'm reading about reppresenting neural networks with topology in this: http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/ And I don't understand the 5th image. I understand how it makes a horizontal line with no hidden layer, but I don't get what exactly is happening in image 5.
