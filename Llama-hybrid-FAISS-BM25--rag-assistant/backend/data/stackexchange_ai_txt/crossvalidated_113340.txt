I would add one other thing to Snow's answer (and this applies to any power analysis via simulation) - pay attention to whether you are looking for a 1 or 2 tailed test. Popular programs like G*Power default to 1-tailed test, and if you are trying to see if your simulations match them (always a good idea when you are learning how to do this), you will want to check that first. To make Snow's run a 1-tailed test, I would add a parameter called "tail" to the function inputs, and put something like this in the function itself: #two-tail test if (tail==2) fit$stats[5] #one-tail test if (tail==1){ if (fit$coefficients[5]>0) { fit$stats[5]/2 } else 1 The 1-tailed version basically checks to see that the coefficient is positive, and then cuts the p-value in half.
