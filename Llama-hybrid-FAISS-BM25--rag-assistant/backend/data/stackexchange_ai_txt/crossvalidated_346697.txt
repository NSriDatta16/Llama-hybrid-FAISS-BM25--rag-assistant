You cannot use these variables in this model. HbA1c is used to diagnose diabetes, which is your dependent variable. So all HbA1c levels below threshold are not diabetes, all above threshold are diabetes, so you have perfect prediction of diabetes (by definition, as the threshold defines diabetes) so your logistic regression will not run. Insulin resistance "is a condition that will eventually lead to diabetes", so it is not diabetes, so if this is recorded then you know the diagnosis is not diabetes -- perfect prediction. Similarly for "pre-diabetes". You could use these variables recorded in the past to predict current diabetes. Eg, if someone was diagnosed with insulin resistance 12 months ago, what is probability they have diabetes now.
