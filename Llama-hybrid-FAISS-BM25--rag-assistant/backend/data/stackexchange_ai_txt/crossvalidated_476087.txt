You are right: you cannot know in advance that the assumptions hold. That's one reason why some people consider clustering an ill-posed problem. Considering cluster sizes, you are also right. Uneven distribution is likely to be a problem when you have a cluster overlap. Then K-means will try to draw the boundary approximately half-way between the cluster centres. However, from the Bayesian standpoint, the boundary should be closer to the centre of the smaller cluster.
