Dummy coding omits / removes select variables from the data frame R

I have a fairly large dataset 1460(n)x81(p) . About 38 variables are numeric and rest are factors with levels ranging from 2-30. I am using dummy.data.frame from dummies package to encode the factor variables to run PCA. However, as I run the following code: train_dummy some of the colums are from the original dataset are removed. Link to original training dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data A number of columns from the original dataset including response variable SalePrice are being dropped. Any ideas/suggestions on what to try?
