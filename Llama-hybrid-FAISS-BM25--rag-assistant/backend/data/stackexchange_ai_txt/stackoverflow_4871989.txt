Telerik, Infragistics, XCeed,

I'm looking for a vendor for a grid control for WPF that works nicely together with MVVM; and that allows grouping by dragging the columns. I've been looking around and at first sight it seems that my choice at the moment would be Telerik. If there are people that have experience with one or more vendors, I would like to hear your opinion. Thanks! L
