What does the data sample (xi) means in z-score normalization?

Is $\mu_i$ computed by averaging over the entire features or by averaging over each feature respectively? Here is a snapshot I found from a journal article? Can anyone help to answer the above two question? Normalization operation is used to increase the classifier performance. Frequent normalization methods are used after feature extraction. However, in this study $z$ -score normalization process is used. $\begin{eqnarray}z=\frac{x_i - \mu_i}{\sigma_i}\end{eqnarray}$ Here, $x_i$ represents the data samples. $\mu_i$ represents mean of the column and $\sigma_i$ represents the standard deviation of the same column.
