PDO has the advantages listed over at the pages linked to above: database abstraction (i.e. your code is made portable across a variety of flavours of DB), it handles a lot of the usual security issues for you if you use its prepared statement features and it returns results as Class instances (which by itself can greatly improve your code by encouraging an object oriented approach), etc., etc. However the very best approach would be for you to look into an ORM library such as Doctrine. It may seem like overkill given the size of your project, but frankly it's never too early to start learning best practice. An excellent overview of how to build bullet-proof, maintainable database-driven apps given by the lead developer of the Zend Framework can be watched at http://mtadata.s3.amazonaws.com/webcasts/20090724-playdoh.wmv
