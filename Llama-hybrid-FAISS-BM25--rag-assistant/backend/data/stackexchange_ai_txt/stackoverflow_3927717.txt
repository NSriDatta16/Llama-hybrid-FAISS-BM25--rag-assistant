Have you been to Adobe's Flex website? You can do anything you need to with the free Flex SDK, available here http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex4sdk . To develop without Flex Builder will be more tedious and require a more in-depth understanding of how to position and organize graphic elements. I hope you have lots of time :)
