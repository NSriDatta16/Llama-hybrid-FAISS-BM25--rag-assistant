Autocomplete textfield

I'm trying to make an autocomplete textfield for my Rails app, following the Agile Web Development with Rails, 3rd Ed example. But if I simply paste their demo code in: Editing user 'update', :id => @user do %> Username Favorite language {:action=>'autocomplete_favorite_language'}, :tokens => ',' %> 'show', :id => @user %> | 'list' %> I will get an error saying: undefined method `auto_complete_field' for # Is there anything else that they should have told me to get this to work? http://media.pragprog.com/titles/rails3/code/pragforms/app/views/user/autocomplete_demo.rhtml EDIT: This section was under Scriptculous so I thought just installing that library would do.
