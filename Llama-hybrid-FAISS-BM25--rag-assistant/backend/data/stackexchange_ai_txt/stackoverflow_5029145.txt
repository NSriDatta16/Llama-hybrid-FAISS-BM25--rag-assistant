Even transparent fragments are written to the depth buffer. Your options are: Disable the depth buffer - either don't write to it or disable the depth test. Enable the alpha test so that transparent fragments are rejected. e.g.: GLES10.glEnable( GLES10.GL_ALPHA_TEST ); GLES10.glAlphaFunc( GLES10.GL_GREATER, 0 ); Sort your geometry and draw the quads in back-to-front order
