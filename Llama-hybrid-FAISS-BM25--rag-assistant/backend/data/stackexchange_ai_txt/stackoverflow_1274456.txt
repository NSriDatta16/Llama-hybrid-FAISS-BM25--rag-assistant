For the age field you need a range search , written in the syntax of Lucene something like: age:[18 TO 100] As Gandalf said, you can use a QueryWrapperFilter . I am not sure this exists in Nhibernate Search. Similarily, you can use "AND" to further constrain your query. I am not sure what you can do about unindexed properties.
