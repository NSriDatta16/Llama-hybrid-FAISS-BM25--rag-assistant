It's best if you start with some clear problem formulation: do you want to detect on the session level or on the account level - i.e. can a legit account have a bot only playing sometimes? Do you have any labeled data? If you don't, the problem becomes MUCH harder. Even a couple hundred sessions hand-labeled as bot sessions should work. Think about and talk with your engineers about other features you might use - such as IP, OS on which the client is run, etc. etc. I'd start with just a simple classifier, if you have satisfied 2. If you do have labeled examples, just take those, a lot of unlabeled examples (which are probably not bots), and fit a simple classifier (such as logistic regression). Only once you have a simple model running and are not satisfied with it's performance, would I start to look into time series models.
