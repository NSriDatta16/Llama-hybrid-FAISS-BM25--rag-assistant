At a minimum, you should consider cross-posting this to the Data Science stack exchange site (stats is more in tune with the statistical, ie math, underpinnings). That said, there is a trade-off between variance and bias in pretty much every model of this sort. Essentially, there are a few factors here. Overfitting. You dismissed this with a handwave but it's one of the most critical aspects. A high bias model (fewer parameters in this case) helps guard against overfitting -- but at the cost of sensitivity. There is a sweet spot in increasing the complexity of the model. At some point, it might not improve the fit to the training data. Additionally, that hand-wave of setting "processing power/storage aside" really is non-trivial as are the labor-hours involved. I hope that helps but, again, this (and a number of questions like it) are better asked here .
