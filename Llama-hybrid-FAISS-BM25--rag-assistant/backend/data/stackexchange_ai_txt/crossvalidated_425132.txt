Examples of Real Applications for Time-series with Continuous-valued Targets and Continuous-valued Observations

Suppose that we are interested in estimating continuous-valued targets $y_t$ from continuous-valued observations $x_t$ over discrete time steps $t = \{1,2,3,\dots,T\}$ . Could you give me some examples on real-world applications that during training we have data on both $x_t$ and $y_t$ and at test time we want to estimate $y_t$ given $x_t$ ? There are applications where $y_t$ is always hidden where we can use algorithms such as expectation maximization (EM) to train the model. Also, there are applications for time-series prediction using RNNs such as the one presented here . But I'm looking for applications related to real-time estimation instead of prediction.
