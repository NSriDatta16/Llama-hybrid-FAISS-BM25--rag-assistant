Usually, when we get likelihood function $$f = l(\theta)$$, then we solve equation $$\frac{ df }{ d\theta } = 0$$. we can get the value of $$\theta$$ that can give max or min value of f , done! But logistic regression's likelihood function no closed-form solution by this way. So we have to use other method, such as gradient descent .
