I'm not an expert on MLP time series models, but logically there are two ways you can do this. These examples asume you want to skip 2 steps, and the trainingset is x1, x2, x3, xn... Method 1, teach to skip months: You should train your network as follows: Input: [x1, x2, x3], Output: [x6] You basically just teach it the pattern between xn, xn+1, xn+2 and xn+5 . Method 2, predict multiple months This advise is more eye-appealing, but it requires more steps: Input: [x1, x2, x3], Output: [x4] -> save x4 to next step Input: [x2, x3, x4], Output: [x5] -> save x5 to next step Input: [x3, x4, x5], Output: [x6] -> you have your output
