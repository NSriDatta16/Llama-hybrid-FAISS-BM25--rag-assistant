Preset Value on Infragistics UltraCombo

I have an infragistics ultraCombo that I set to a specific datasource . I want to pre-select one of those values so the user doesn't have to choose it (most of the time it will be the pre-selected value). However, when I set the ultraCombo to that value it modifies the drop-down list to contain only that single value! I've tried using the ultraCombo.value method, the ultraCombo.textbox.text method, etc, and they all behave the same way. When I look in the debugger the full list appears to be present, just not displayed. How do I pre-select a value in the list without destroying my drop-down list?
