Dragging to fire UIButtons

I have four UIButtons on a UIView in an iPad application being developed at the moment for iPad Simulator 3.2. What currently happens is this: The user drags their finger from one button to another. As the finger leaves the first button, that button remains in its active state, and nothing happens as the finger passes over the second button unless the user releases the touch and taps the screen again on the second button. What I need to happen is, the moment their finger leaves the area of the first UIButton, it should go back to its default UI state, and when the finger enters the area of the second UIButton, the second button should assume its active state, and fire an event. I'm really completely lost as to how to accomplish this, I've done lots of Googling, nothing has offered a quick solution to what seems to me like something that should be easy to accomplish. Thanks in advance.
