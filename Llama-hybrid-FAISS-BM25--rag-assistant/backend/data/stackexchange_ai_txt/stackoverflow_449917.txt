Single-page display, multi-page print problem

A web page displays the following:- Bob Fred John However when the user (that would be me) prints the web page I want multiple repeats of this output with slight variations to be printed on separate pages :- Bob Fred John >page break here Bob Fred John >page break here Bob Fred John In reality the page content is larger (although well within a standard A4 page worth) and the number of output pages is about 20. I'd prefer an elegant cross-browser solution but ultimately a solution that works on Internet Explorer 7 is acceptable. I'm using ASP.NET MVC with jQuery (although a straight JavaScript solution is fine). Edit: Page-Break-XXX css style is going be part of the answer, but I'm particularly interested in a means to dynamically create the print version HTML from the screen version. Note I don't want to navigate to a 'printer friendly' page and then print that. I just want to hit the browsers print button and magic happens.
