The SPGraphviz project handles graph descriptions in DOT : SPGraphviz - create your own visualization graphs without programming in Sharepoint. Just define graph on DOT language in simple text file, upload it into document library and specify URL in SPGraphvizWebPart - it will make graphical representation of your graph The documentation implies that the project uses a wrapper around the C language graphviz , and points to 2 such wrappers: SPGraphvizWebPart uses Graphviz open source library for rendering graphs defined on DOT language . Many objects in real life can be presented as a graph mathematical abstraction. E.g. organization structure, portal hierarchy, version history of the files, etc. - all these can be displayed as a graph (number of nodes with relations between them). Using DOT language you can create textual definition of a graph (nodes, relations, visual effects like color, shape, etc) in simple text file and pass this file into Graphviz library. It will make graphical representation of the graph using selected layout and image type. Graphviz - is library written on C. SPGraphviz uses managed wrapper for using functions from Graphviz library. There are several implementations of managed wrapper for Graphviz: WinGraphviz by ood Tsen Rendering an in-memory Graphviz image with C# by David Brown
