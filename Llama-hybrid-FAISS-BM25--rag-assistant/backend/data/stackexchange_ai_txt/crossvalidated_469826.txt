I can't think why anyone would care how the test performs at $\alpha \simeq 0.9$ , per se. However, the ROC curve is monotonically increasing, so the power at $\alpha\simeq 0.9$ bounds the power elsewhere. In practice the bound is likely to be very weak for $\alpha \lesssim 0.1$ or so of actual interest. Let's consider the average power $$ \int power(\alpha) p(\alpha) d\alpha $$ since power depends on $\alpha$ , this depends on the distribution of $\alpha$ , $p(\alpha)$ . Thus the AUC corresponds to the expected power for a uniform distribution over $(0, 1)$ , $$ \text{AUC} = \int power(\alpha) d\alpha. $$ So the AUC tells us something about the power averaged across $\alpha$ (or specificity since that is $1-\alpha$ ). In other words, in answer to your second question, greater AUC tells us a test has more power when averaged uniformly over specificity.
