I'm not sure, but if you add event handlers to both 'click' & 'dblclick' events, where you say to put marker on a click, and don't take any action on double click, then you can skip the adding of timeouts (the maps API can differ what is click and what is double click) google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'click', function (event) { placeMarker(event.latLng); }); google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'dblclick', function(event) { //DO NOTHING, BECAUSE IT IS DOUBLE CLICK }); The placeMarker(latLng) is custom added function which adds marker on the given location: var marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position: location, draggable: true, map: map }); map.setCenter(location);
