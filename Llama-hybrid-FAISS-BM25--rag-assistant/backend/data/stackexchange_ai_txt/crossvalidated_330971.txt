It sounds like "neural computation" is being used here as a buzzword referring to the use of artificial neural nets. I'm not aware of any common technical use of this term in machine learning. It is, however, commonly used in neuroscience to refer to the operation of the brain or biological neural networks, at a computational/algorithmic level of description (rather than a biological/mechanistic one). This is very different from artificial neural nets, which bear only a loose resemblance to their biological counterparts. Describing an iPhone in terms of "neural computation" sounds rather silly and out of place. To interpret the $600 \times 10^9$ ops/s spec, more information would needed about what exactly those operations are.
