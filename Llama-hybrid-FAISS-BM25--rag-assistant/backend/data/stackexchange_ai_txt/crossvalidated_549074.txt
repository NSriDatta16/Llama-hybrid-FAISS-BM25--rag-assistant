Online time-series smoothing algorithm for sparse data

I am working on building a real-time system for processing and aggregating somewhat sparse and irregular survey measurements (ranges from 0-100, usually on the order of 20-100 measurements). I am looking for a way to remove the noise and smooth out this data so our end users can see the overall trend. The main constraint of the problem is that the data needs to be normalized online â€” past measurements cannot change as a user should be able to reference historical data. Are there any good algorithms to do this? I was thinking about a simple moving average, but it tends to be pretty volatile if an outlier enters/exits the averaging window. Thanks so much!
