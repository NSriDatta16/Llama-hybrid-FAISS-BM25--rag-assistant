The interesting and useful property of the Normal is that it's what we get, very generally, when we average lots of measurements. Thus, the height of a randomly-selected individual isn't Normal, as you note - and their blood pressure, shoe size and number of years of education are also non-Normal - but when we take an average of a sample of these measurements, on different people, their average behaves very like a Normal - and more Normal when we average more measurements. In this sense, yes, the Normal is very like reality, in all sorts of applications. Moreover, it's not just the average that looks Normal, all sorts of manipulations of averages look Normal too - and this is fundamentally what makes regression work. In fact for many statistical purposes, Normality of data is basically irrelevant; what matters is that it's what you get when averaging lots of similarly-behaved variables. It is a tremendously useful property.
