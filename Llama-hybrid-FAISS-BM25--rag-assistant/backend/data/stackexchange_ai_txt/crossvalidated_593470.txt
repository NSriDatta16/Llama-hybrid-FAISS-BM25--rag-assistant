In search for the exact "z-value" of the binomial test

I want to explain my second-semester psychology students why we have sample-SNRs (Signal to Noise Ratios) all over the place (t, z, F, Chi²). They are also called statistical test values. But we have nothing like that for the binomial test. At least not an exact one. We only have z as an approximation. My students are trained in frequentist statistics only (time constraints and me not feeling comfortable teaching bayesian concepts yet). In more detail a) The test statistics z, t, F etc. can be interpreted as sample Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNR). But: A SNR for the classic / frequentist binomial test does not seem to exist. SPSS and JASP do not report one and an extensive google(scholar) search did not reveal one. Who does know the formula for an exact SNR or "test statistic" of the binomial test? b) When the binomial distribution is symetric the z-value of the z-Test of proportions is a good approximation of a SNR. And if not symetric or for very small n, it would need a correction of some sort... but which one? For the z-Test of proportions the empirical z-value or SNR is: SNR = z = Signal / Noise = Cohens g / Standard error of proportions = (p - p0) / Square Root of (p0 · (1 - p0) / n) with p as the observed proportion and with p0 as the reference value, sometimes called Pi0 or Pi. with n as the number of observations So how to calculate this exactly for the binomial test specificallywhen n small and p unequal 0.5?
