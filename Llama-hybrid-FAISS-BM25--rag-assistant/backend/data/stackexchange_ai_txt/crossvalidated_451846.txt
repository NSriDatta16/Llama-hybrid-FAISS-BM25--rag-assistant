From what I have seen, people will work with the "iid definitions" of (strict) propriety and pretty much work "pointwise", even in time series forecasting contexts. For examples, see papers of Gneiting and colleagues, who routinely illustrates his papers with meteorological forecasts. I am certainly no expert in meteorological forecasting, but judging from what I have seen, this approach is common there, all the way back to Brier's (1950) original paper . For a recent example, take a look at Ehm et al. (2016, with discussion) . Ehm et al. and discussants also refer to Str√§hl & Ziegel (2015) , who specifically look at calibration in a time series context, and even they (section 5.3) use this "pointwise" approach. Bottom line: the "pointwise" approach seems to be the state of the art for scoring rules in time series. Of course, that does not mean it is correct.
