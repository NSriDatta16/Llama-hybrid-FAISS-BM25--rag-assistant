Answer1 : Some classification methods give you the probability of each class. The Naive Bayes and logistic regression are two of these methods. Note that logistic regression is a classification method, not a regression method! Answer2 : Your problem is inherently a classification problems, not regression. As mentioned in the Answer1, you can use classification methods which give you the probabilities. If you want to use regression methods, you need to provide training samples where the targets are continuous, that is you should provide each training sample with your confidence about her/his availability.
