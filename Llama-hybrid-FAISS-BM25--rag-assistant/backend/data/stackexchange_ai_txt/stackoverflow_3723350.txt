You begin with point one: print "instructions to the user" (just change the string to be more informative, that's not a programming problem!-), then continue with point two (three assignments, just like your homework assignment says), then with point three: while high > low: There -- that's half your work already (points 1-3 out of 6). What's giving you problems beyond that? Do you know what average means, so (say) guess = (high + low) // 2 is understandable to you, or what? That's all you need for point 4! Do you know how to ask the user a question and get their response? Look up input and raw_input ... OK, I've covered the first five of the six points, surely you can at least "get started" now!-)
