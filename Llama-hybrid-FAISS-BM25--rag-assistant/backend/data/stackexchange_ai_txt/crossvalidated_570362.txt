How to compute transfer entropy between different length time-series?

Is there a way to calculate transfer entropy between two time series having different lengths? Given two time series: $x=(x_1,x_2,\dotsc,x_n)$ $y=(y_1,y_2,\dotsc,y_m)$ , where $n \ne m$ . Is there a way to calculate the transfer entropy from $x$ to $y$ ? Would it make sense to apply padding on the shorter series? Are there any specific methods?
