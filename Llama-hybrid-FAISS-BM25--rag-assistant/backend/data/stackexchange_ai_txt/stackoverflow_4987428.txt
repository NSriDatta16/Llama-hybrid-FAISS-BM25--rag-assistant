A different approach could be using the OSGi framework. I'm not sure if you're familiar with it, but it allows you to build your application out of components (called bundles) and those can be installed, updated and uninstalled without having to stop other components. OSGi is used a lot to create either completely modular applications, or to create a plugin mechanism for existing applications. There are several open source implementations of OSGi. Apache Felix runs out of the box on Android, and embedding it in your application is fairly easy as well. If you're interested, I can provide more pointers, so feel free to follow up on this answer.
