Logistic regression with "repeated" independent variable

I'm attempting to model my dependent binary variable using only a single continuous independent variable with "duplicate values", but I'm not sure if this counts as a "repeated measures" scenario. I ask because the dependent variable isn't being repeatedly "tested" (because each "outcome" is an independent observation - an individual fish caught in the same net), but the independent variable is the same value for multiple outcomes (the salinity of the water these fish were caught in - this was only recorded once per "net"), so would that count as a "repeated measure"? Would I just proceed with a simple logistic regression as usual or is there something I should do to account for this? A "1" indicates a fish with an empty stomach. I also realize this may be a useless research question. Just because we caught a fish with a full stomach at a location with a certain salinity doesn't mean it ate something under the same conditions. I just wondered how to deal with this problem.
