Writing self explicitly is actually helpful. This encourages readability - one of Python's strengths. I personally consider it very useful. A similar argument in C++ is that when you use using namespace std , just to save repetitive prefixing of the std namespace. Though this may save time, it should not be done. So get used to writing self . And seriously, how long does it take!
