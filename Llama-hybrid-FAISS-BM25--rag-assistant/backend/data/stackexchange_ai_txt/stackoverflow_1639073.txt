Scintilla .NET - Can't find libraries

I'm trying to get Scintilla .NET working in a C# form I'm making. I've followed the directions provided in the readme such as adding the Scintilla component to the toolbox, but when I try to drag the component to a C# form I get this following error: http://tinypic.com/r/152m7wx/4 I've placed the two included dlls (SciLexer.dll, ScintillaNET.dll) in my system32 folder. I can't seem to figure out what's wrong. I'm using VS 2008, and Windows 7. Any ideas why I'd be getting a File not found error?
