Trouble With Keras in R

I am using Rstudio on windows 11 trying to install and use keras for deep learning. Following the instructions from the ISLR2 book for installing dependencies ( https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/keras-instructions.html ) I still get an error when I try to run my code using the keras library. It confirmed that my installation of tensorflow and keras was successful but when I try to run my code I get the following. Code: library(tensorflow) library(keras) library(magrittr) modnn % layer_dense(units = 50, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(x)) layer_dropout(rate=.4) %>% layer_dense(units=1)``` Output: Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘keras’: .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'keras', details: call: py_module_import(module, convert = convert) error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow' Run `reticulate::py_last_error()` for details. In addition: Warning message: package ‘keras’ was built under R version 4.3.1 Any help would be appreciated
