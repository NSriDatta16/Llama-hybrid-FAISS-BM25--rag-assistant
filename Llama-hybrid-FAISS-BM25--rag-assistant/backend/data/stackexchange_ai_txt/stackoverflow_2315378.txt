If you need drag-and-drop, which seems to be the reason to want this in the first place, I can warmly recommend not trying to code that yourself. Instead, use a popular framework like YUI, or jQuery. They are reasonably lightweight and offer reasonable cross-browser compatibility. Really, it's no fun reinventing this wheel.
