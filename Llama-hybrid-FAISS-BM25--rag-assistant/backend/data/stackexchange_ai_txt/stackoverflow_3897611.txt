Here is a sample project from one of my books showing drag-and-drop movement of markers on a Google Map in Android. In a nutshell, it uses onTouchEvent() to detect when the user touches and holds their finger near a marker. It then removes the marker from the overlay, but puts the same image over top of the map using RelativeLayout . Then, on "move" touch events, the image is moved (faster than forcing the whole overlay to redraw). When the finger is lifted, the image is removed, but the marker is put back in the overlay at the new spot.
