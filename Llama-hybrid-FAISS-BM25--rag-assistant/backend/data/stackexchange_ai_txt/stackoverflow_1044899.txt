Is LINQ to Everything a good abstraction?

There is a proliferation of new LINQ providers. It is really quite astonishing and an elegant combination of lambda expressions, anonymous types and generics with some syntax sugar on top to make it easy reading. Everything is LINQed now from SQL to web services like Amazon to streaming sensor data to parallel processing . It seems like someone is creating an IQueryable > for everything but these data sources can have radically different performance, latency, availability and reliability characteristics. It gives me a little pause that LINQ makes those performance details transparent to the developer. Is LINQ a solid general purpose abstraction or a RAD tool or both?
