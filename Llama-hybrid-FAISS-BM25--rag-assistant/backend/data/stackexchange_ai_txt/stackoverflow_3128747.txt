You don't write tests until 100% code coverage is achieved. If you've been following TDD, then there is no code that was ever written without being required by a test, so you should always be near 100% coverage. Instead, you write tests until all tests pass, and until all the tests required have been written. This will imply that all the required code has been written, since you will only have written code if it was required by a test.
