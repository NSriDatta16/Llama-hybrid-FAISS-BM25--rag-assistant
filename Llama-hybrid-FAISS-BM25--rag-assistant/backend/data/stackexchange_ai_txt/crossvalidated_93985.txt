Aggregation of correlated variables

I've been trying to aggregate correlated time series, by using Alexander's proposal that you can see here: http://bit.ly/1hIPwiI . Her proposal to find a random variable $Y=\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$, where each $X_i$ represents a stochastic process, is based on solving an integral of dimension $N-1$. The problem that I see is that the integral must be solved by iterative methods (I use Monte Carlo) when the dimension is high. Even so, when $N>5$ my results are really disappointing; with large errors in some point estimates. The question that I ask here is, Is there any other method to solve the problem of portfolio aggregation (summation of random variables) when the variables are correlated? In other words, if I have the marginal distributions of $X_1, \ldots, X_N$, how can I find the distribution of$Y$?
