You can have residuals, or not, in either case. But to start with, you don't need residuals at all to specify the model: In either case, you can write $$Y|X=x \ \ \sim \ \ p(y|x),$$ where $p(y|x)$ is some conditional distribution. In the case of logistic regression, $p(y|x)$ is a Bernoulli distribution. In the case of classical regression, $p(y|x)$ is a normal distribution, but this can be relaxed to allow other forms, like Poisson, negative binomial, multinomial, non- or semi-parametric variants, etc. If you want residuals, you can also have them, in either case: For an observation where $X=x$ , the residual is $\epsilon = Y - E(Y|X=x)$ . In the case of standard regression, under the usual linearity assumption, this gives you $$\epsilon = Y - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x).$$ In the case of logistic regression, under the usual linearity (of logit) assumption, this gives you $$\epsilon = Y - \frac{\exp{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}},$$ where $Y$ is either 0 or 1. It is just not common to use this form in the case of logistic regression because the salient feature of the model is the form of the conditional Bernoulli distribution of $Y|X=x$ .
