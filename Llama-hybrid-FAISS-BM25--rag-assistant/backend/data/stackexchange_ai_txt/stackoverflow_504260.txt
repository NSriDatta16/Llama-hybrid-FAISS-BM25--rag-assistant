I believe your method is the best elegant you can have for following reasons: since the input is not a "clean" number, you do need to involve some sort of string parser. Using regular expressions is the very code-efficient method to do it by looking at the code, it's clear what it does short of wrapping this into a function, I don't think there's much more to be done
