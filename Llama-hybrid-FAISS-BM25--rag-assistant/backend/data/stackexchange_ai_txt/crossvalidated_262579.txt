Measurement System Analysis (MSA) refers to the study of how measurement variability contributes to observed process variability. An MSA helps to quantify and describe the type of measurement variability within a measurement system. A robust and capable measurement system is one that is accurate and precise over: multiple operators; multiple gages; the operating range of the gage; the range of product / process variability; the usage environment; and time. Mathematically: $$\sigma^2_{\rm process}+\sigma^2_{\rm measurement}=\sigma^2_{\rm observed}$$ Accuracy and Precision have different meanings and it is possible for a measurement system (or process) to only exhibit one of the two desirable features. Accuracy deals with the location of the grouping while precision deals with the spread of the grouping. There are three main types of measurement error, each of which are described by other distinct attributes. Accuracy bias linearity stability Precision repeatability reproducibility Discrimination Gage resolution Increments of scale Operational definition of acceptable vs. unacceptable These terms are defined as follows: bias : The difference between the observed average value of measurement and the "true" or "accepted" reference value. linearity : The difference in the bias values throughout the expected operating range of the measurement instrument. stability : The consistency of the measurement system over time. repeatability : The variation in measurement obtained with one measurement instrument when used several times by the same operator to assess the identical characteristic of the same unit of product. reproducibility : The variation in the average of the measurement made by different operators using the same measurement instrument and method, to assess the identical characteristic of the same unit of product. discrimination : The ability of the measurement system to detect differences in the characteristic being measured.
