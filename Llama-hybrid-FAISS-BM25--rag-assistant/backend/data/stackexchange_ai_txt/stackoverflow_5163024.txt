UINavigationController inside UIView

I can adda UINavigationController to a UIView programmatically but how is this represented in IB? Everytime I add UINavigationController to the view heirarchy it stays at the same level as the (root) UIView. Is this normal? I expected to be able to "drag" the UINavigationController underneath the View. View - UINavigationController - UIView but instead I get in IB: View -UIView UINavigationController I basically have, in my app, a View that contains two sections, the top section is a UIView and the bottom section is the UINaivationController. (think of it as something like a split view but vertically) my main question is this: Is it normal to see the UINaigationController at the same level as the root view in IB during design the views?
