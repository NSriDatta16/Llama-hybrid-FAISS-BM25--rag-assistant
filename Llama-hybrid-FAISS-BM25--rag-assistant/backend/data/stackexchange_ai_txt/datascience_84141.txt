Precision Accuracy and recall rate of a confusion rate of confusion matrix

Assume you are solving a 4-class problem. Your test set is as follows: • 5 samples from class 1, • 10 samples from class 2, • 5 samples from class 3, • 10 samples from class 4. • Total Samples: 30 The decision made by your classifier is as follows: • 2 samples from class 1 are decided as class 1, 3 samples from class 1 are decided as class 2. • 2 samples from class 2 are decided as class 1, 5 samples from class 2 are decided as class 2, 1 sample from class 2 are decided as class 3, and 2 samples from class 2 is decided as class 4. • 4 samples from class 3 are decided as class 3 and 1 sample from class 3 is decided as class 4. • 2 samples from class 4 are decided as class 1, and 8 samples from class 4 are decided as class 4. Generate a confusion matrix. Using the confusion matrix, calculate accuracy, average precision, and average recall rate. I need help calculating the accuracy recall rate and precision by hand using this confusion matrix below
