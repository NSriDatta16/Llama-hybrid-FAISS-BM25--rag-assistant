1) The overfitting will come if a huge number of parameters $\beta$ is significantly different from zero. Putting a prior distribution on each $\beta$ centered on zero is, in some sense, as forcing all the parameters to be non significantly and then only the ones that are strongly significant can have a posterior distribution non close to the zero. 2) If you are working in a bayesian framework, you have to put a prior distribution on each parameter you want to estimate. The prior can be any distribution (uniform, beta, gamma), depends on the type of variable you are putting the prior distribution on. Using a normal prior centered around 0 is like said that departure from zero in negative and positive value are equally likely.
