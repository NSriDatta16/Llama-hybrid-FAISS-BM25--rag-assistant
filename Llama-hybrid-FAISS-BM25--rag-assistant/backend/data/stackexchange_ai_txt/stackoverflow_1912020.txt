Discuss on Commercial Component libraries of silverlight

I am now looking forward to buy a component library of silverlight for increase the productivity. I find there are number of them. Telerik ComponentOne ComponentArt Infragistics Syncfusion I found more people talk about Telerik and ComponentOne on the Net, and so I did a try. Telerik seems more handy for the beginner lever, as many components are fullset, most of item and drug and drop to the xaml. But seems Telerik component is not flexible, eg, the uploader, they dont provide client side preview using isolatedStorage. And I more thing I worry about is the speed of Telerik, I got bad experience when using Telerik ASP.NET AJAX component, When the number of controls need to AJAXify, everything go okay, but when the control size growing, it is terrible slow and use up the CPU resource when update... About ComponentOne, It seems that it is more fit for developer as its flexibility, but it involve more coding, reasonable coding effort ... But still the old question, performance issue. Anyone can share your using experience and comment, thanks~
