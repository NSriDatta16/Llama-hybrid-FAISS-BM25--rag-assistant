Is generating Javascript Code and HTML Tags from HTMLHelper a Bad Practice?

maybe this is a stupid question, but i have seen many Tuts that build JavaScript ode and HTML Tags from an HTML Helper Extension Method like creating a Jquery Menu or Tree, it looks so neat and saves cluttering in View and encourage re usability. but i am wondering that because this code is generated on Server Side will it be slower than writing the code directly in the View ?
