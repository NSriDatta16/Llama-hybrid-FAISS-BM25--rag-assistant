Typesetting logic proofs in LaTeX

I'm trying to typeset some basic logic proofs in LaTeX. I need a multiple column layout, and I need the lines numbered on the right. I want to reset the numbering for each proof. The output should look like this: 1) (x)Â¬F A 2) (Ex)F 3) ... What is the easiest way to do this? enumerate doesn't seem a good idea, since it's not going to like the multiple column things. I need everything to be in mathmode as well. Is there an easy way to do this? [edit] Here is what I've managed to do so far, but it is far from elegant. \begin{minipage}{\linewidth} \boldmath \center{$ \forall x \neg F \to \neg \exists x F $} \unboldmath \begin{math} \begin{array}{llr} 1. &\forall x \neg F & \\ 2. &\exists x F & A \\ 3. &F[\alpha / x ] & ES 2 \\ 4. &\neg F[\alpha / x] & US \\ 5. &\exists x F \to F[\alpha / x ] & CP 2,4 \\ 6. &\neg \exists x F & TI 4,5 \end{array} \end{math} \end{minipage} Ideally I want something that automatically numbers steps and makes the "title" line easier...
