The two concepts are pretty orthogonal, neither complementing nor contradicting each other. If you threatened to stick a rusty fork in my eye and forced me to generalise, I'd say that component-based development was a technique for modelling and assembling a specific piece of software, where as SOA is a technique for organising separate systems so they can talk to each other. Like I said, a crass generalisation, but it's all I'm going to give you without a more specific question :)
