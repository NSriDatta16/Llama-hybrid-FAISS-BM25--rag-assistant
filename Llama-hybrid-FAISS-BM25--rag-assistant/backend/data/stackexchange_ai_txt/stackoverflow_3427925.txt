From http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-doc-available If fn:doc($uri) returns a document node, this function returns true. If $uri is not a valid xs:anyURI, an error is raised [err:FODC0005]. Otherwise, this function returns false. And from http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-doc One possible processing model for this function is as follows. The resource identified by the URI Reference is retrieved. If the resource cannot be retrieved, an error is raised [err:FODC0002]. The data resulting from the retrieval action is then parsed as an XML document and a tree is constructed in accordance with the [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model]. If the top-level media type is known and is "text", the content is parsed in the same way as if the media type were text/xml; otherwise, it is parsed in the same way as if the media type were application/xml. If the contents cannot be parsed successfully, an error is raised [err:FODC0002]. Otherwise, the result of the function is the document node at the root of the resulting tree. This tree is then optionally validated against a schema. So, it looks like you could do this (I'm being cautious because of the words "One possible processing model" ): This stylesheet: With any input and B.xml been an empty document, Saxon output: And this alternate information: Error on line 1 column 1 of B.xml: SXXP0003: Error reported by XML parser: Premature end of file. Altova Output: B.xml 0 0 0 0 false
