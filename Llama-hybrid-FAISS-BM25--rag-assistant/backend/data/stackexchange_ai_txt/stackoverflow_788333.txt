Please, read paragraph 3.15 (Extension bundles) of the official OSGi Service Platform Core Specification. There are answers on all your questions. Here is quote from the Specification: Extension bundles can deliver optional parts of the Framework implementation or provide functionality that must reside on the boot class path. These packages cannot be provided by the normal import/export mechanisms. Boot class path extensions are necessary because certain package implementations assume that they are on the boot class path or are required to be available to all clients. An example of a boot class path extension is an implementation of java.sql such as JSR 169.
