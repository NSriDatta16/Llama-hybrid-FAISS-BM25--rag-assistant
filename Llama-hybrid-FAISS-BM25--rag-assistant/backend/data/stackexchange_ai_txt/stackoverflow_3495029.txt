Being a shareware author and longtime member of ASP myself i think you are going into the wrong direction with your solution. The only way to make this workable is with a hardware device as already suggested. This or constant online activations is the only way if you want to be sure and your product is so good and without competitors that your customers will still use it. But what we (organized small ISV's) learned from practice is that you should not do what you are trying to do. Do not bind it to hardware. Sell one license per person not one license per computer. In the end you will make more sales because of the relaxed license. Just do enough to make the honest people stay honest. So limit the trail version (i decided to terminate the application after one hour for me) and leave the final version free from all stuff. Give a separate download for payed customers and thats it. Be a nice company and not a greedy profit maximizing by legal restrictions company. I used some of the better windows protection programs first but they all had serious problems with my code. And they call get cracked sooner or later. So i gave up all of them. P.S.: I use a hardware fingerprint schema on windows where i don't restrict the program but just to keep people away from getting new trial keys every 30 days. Together with a nag screen it seems to work. The fingerprint is an xor of user name, windows installation time, modify time stamp of a system files and harddisk serial id.
