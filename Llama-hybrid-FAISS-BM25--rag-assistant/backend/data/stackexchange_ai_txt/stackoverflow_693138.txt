Java 1.4 comes with javax.xml.transform , which can take a DOMSource , SAXSource , etc: // print document InputSource inputSource = new InputSource(stream); Source saxSource = new SAXSource(inputSource); Result result = new StreamResult(System.out); TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory .newInstance(); Transformer transformer = transformerFactory .newTransformer(); transformer.transform(saxSource, result); If you want to go back to the J2SE 1.3 API, you're pretty much on your own (though if you're on the J2EE API of that era, there might be something - I don't recall).
