Hidden Markov model - formulas

I am self-studying Kevin Murphy's book, and trying to understand the math behind the HMM. I am struggling with the following derivation. Why can we in 17.46 cross out the $X_{1:t-1}$ term? my guess would be that $X_t$ is independent of $X_{1:t-1}$, but i am not 100% sure why in Markov Chain / HMM that would be the case. any hints much appreciated.
