what is the best UX for non-programmer users? comma-separated tags or space-separated tags?

I'm creating a social site for teachers (non-programmers) on which teachers can add events, links, exercises, tips, lesson plans, books, etc. Each of these items I want them to be able to add tags to as we do at StackOverflow. However, because they are non-programming users, I thought that space-separated, nonspace tags and camelCase tags would lead to too much confusion , e.g.: grammar teachingtips universityOfMinnesota phrasalverbs and indeed on this similar stackoverflow question most of the answers suggested commas like this: grammar, teaching tips, university of minnesota, phrasal verbs but then I just signed up for a delicious.com account (which I don't think has a very programmer-centric audience) and saw that they use spaces as well: separate tags with spaces: e.g. hotels bargains newyork (not new york) What has been your experience on this point in terms of the current UX trend for tags ? Is the average Internet user accostumed to space-separated tags by now? I have to admit, I have never seen comma-separated tags on any major site I have used. Have you come upon a good way to combine them so it doesn't even matter, e.g.: grammar book reviews teaching tips and e.g. have a quick algorithm which checks the number of current tags for: grammar grammar book grammar book reviews book book reviews book reviews teaching ...
