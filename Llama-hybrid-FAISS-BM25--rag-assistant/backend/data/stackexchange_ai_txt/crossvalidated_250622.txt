Gaussian Mixture Model - Model selection using the held-out likelihood?

I am trying to understand how to select the number of components in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Most presentations mention the use of criteria such as AIC and BIC . But if we simply follow model selection approaches for supervised learning, we could for example perform a cross-validation and estimate the likelihood for each held-out set. Then we choose the model with the highest averaged likelihood. Is this a valid approach for selecting the number of components of a GMM?
