Comparing centrality measures of different graphs

I have a set of samples that each containing a certain number of points in 2D. The number of points varies across samples. Each point in these samples also has a specific type, like blue, red, green, etc. I would like to compare the distribution of, say, red points across samples in terms of their clustering and centrality. I thought about using the centrality scores as introduced by Everett and Borgatti [The centrality of groups and classes. J. Math. Sociol. 23, 181â€“201] ( https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0022250X.1999.9990219 ). With these, I can get estimates of the centrality and clustering per group (red balls) per sample. However, it is not clear to me how I can compare the centrality and clustering scores calculated per group across samples. Does anyone stumbled upon a similar problem? To give a bit more background: I have tissue images composed of different cell types. Each image contains different number of cells (a few hundred each) but composed of a subset of cell types. One cell type (A) is present in all samples, and I would like to measure and compare its distribution across images. For instance, I would like to be able to differentiate if these cells of type A are clustered in the image center, or distributed around the periphery etc. Edit: Thank you all for the comments, suggestions, and the questions. To clarify the question more, I add a depiction of the question ( https://imgur.com/a/Er6rSML ), which shows two cell types (blue and orange) in a "pocket" (pocket appears to be in 3D but we assume 2D). I have the (x, y) coordinates of all cell centroids (single pixel per cell centroid), but the cells cover on average 50 pixels. Assume that we have multiple independent pockets coming from different images. Then, the questions are how can one determine/measure if orange balls are more clustered in a given pocket and if different pockets have different degree/strength of clustering of the orange balls. One hypothesis I can test is to compare the distribution of the orange cells in a given pocket to a spatial point process by using Ripley's K. Yet, I get a feeling that the size of the cells should also be somehow included in this analysis, as I have only the centroid locations but the cell areas are much larger than a single pixel.
