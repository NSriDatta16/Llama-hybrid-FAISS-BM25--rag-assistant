The two approaches won't usually make a big difference if all your images and objects are of reasonable size. By reasonable I mean you don't are not working on some objects that are only a few pixels big. I would usually prefer the second approach. One particular reason is you don't have to worry about instances where both I and U are 0, which could happen frequently at the beginning of your training stage. From my experience most machine learning software adopt the second approach. For instance, the mean_iou in Tensorflow simply flatten the input tensor into a vector before calculating the IoU for each class.
