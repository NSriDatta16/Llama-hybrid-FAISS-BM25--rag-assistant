To be honest, it is not possible for a deep-learning method to outperform a kernel methods. Why ? It is very simple, because any network, be it deep or shallow, can be described by a kernel. Thus a kernel can reproduce any result coming from deep learning. However, a kernel method have access to other, more powerful methods, than deep learning ones. Indeed, today, kernel machines obtains results that are far better than any deep learning approach. EDIT : As I received a warning concerning this answer, please let me detail it. I reference this paper : https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3769804 . Every neural network (NN) can be input in a kernel machine, it is known since more than a decade now. For instance, in our kernel machines, we can input any NNs, there is an interface to it, see section 2.3.7. A kernel machine have access to other methods than NNs. See for instance section 3, that allows any PDE approach. We benchmarked both approaches. I am sorry, but our kernel machines always retrieved better results than NN ones, as for instance the MNIST test in https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3766451
