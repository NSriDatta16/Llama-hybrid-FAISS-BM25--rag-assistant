Have you considered something like a trie ? Lookup is linear in key length, which in your case means essentially constant, and storage can be more compact due to nodes sharing common substrings. Keep in mind, though, that if your data set is actually filling large amounts of your key space your bigger efficiency concern is likely to be caching and disk access, not lookups.
