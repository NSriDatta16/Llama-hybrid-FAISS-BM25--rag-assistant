how can I see POST methods in raw HTTP that my computer sends to a page?

that's it isn't there a way to see the raw text file that my browser sends to a website when I do a POST method? something like: POST /path/script.cgi HTTP/1.0 From: frog@jmarshall.com User-Agent: HTTPTool/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 32 home=Cosby&favorite+flavor=flies Thanks!
