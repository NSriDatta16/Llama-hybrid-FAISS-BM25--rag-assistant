Generally speaking, outside of extremely specific reasons, listwise deletion of missing values is not encouraged. It would be better if you could employ some alternative like multiple imputation (MI) or full information maximum likelihood (FIML). I have linked a couple very readible papers here that discuss missingness, modern techniques, and misconceptions. There is also a phenomenal book on MI using R that I can recommend called Flexible Imputation of Missing Data by Stef van Buuren. The main reason you don't want to remove missing values willy-nilly is because you will lose a ton of valuable information. Normally listwise deletion deletes an entire row of data rather than just that unit that is missing. Regardless, this leads also to a loss of power. Additionally, there may be missingness patterns that you need to examine which predicate decisions to remove or impute values. Is the missingness due to chance? Is it systematic? Is there clustering involved? (i.e. a specific hospital constantly has missing values for medical exam data). These are also things to consider when dealing with missingness.
