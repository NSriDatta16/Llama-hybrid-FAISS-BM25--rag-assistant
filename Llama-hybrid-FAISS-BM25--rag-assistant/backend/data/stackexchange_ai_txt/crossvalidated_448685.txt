Sampling states of an "unnatural" Hamiltonian System

I would like to sample from a Gibbs distribution given by $$f(p, q) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}e^{-H(p, q; \omega, J)}$$ where $H$ is the Hamiltonian on generalized coordinates $(p,q)\in \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ defined by \begin{align} H(p,q; \omega, J)& = \sum_{\ell=1}^n \frac{\omega_{\ell}}{2}(q_{\ell}^2 + p_{\ell}^2) \\ &+ \frac{1}{4}\sum_{\ell, m = 1}^n J_{\ell, m}(q_{\ell}p_{m} - q_m p_{\ell}) \cdot (q_m^2 + p_m^2 - q_{\ell}^2 - p_{\ell}^2) \end{align} $$$$ explored in this paper . We take $J$ to be symmetric. Notice that $H$ is not a ``natural" Hamiltonian expessible as $H(p,q) = K(q) + U(p)$ so that, for instance, it is not easy to calculate a marginal on $p$ or $q$ and then use Hamilton's equations to propose new samples for the remaining coordinates in the manner of Hamiltonian MCMC. I'm not sure I can use Gibbs sampling either, since I don't see any tractable conditionals. Any help with this or references to "unnatural" Hamiltonian systems would be greatly appreciated. Edit : "Eq. 4" in the comments is the action-angle reparameterization, $$H(I, \theta; \omega, J) = \sum_{\ell}^n \omega_{\ell} I_{\ell} - \sum_{\ell, m = 1}^n J_{\ell, m}\sqrt{I_{\ell}I_m} \cdot (I_m - I_{\ell})\sin(\theta_m - \theta_{\ell}).$$
