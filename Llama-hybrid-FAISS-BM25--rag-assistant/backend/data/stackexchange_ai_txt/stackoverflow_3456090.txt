Not a C expert, but usually there is a call stack depth limit enforced by the compiler. Probably you can change this with a compiler flag , but this will not solve your problem. Making the algorithm iterative instead of recursive will fix it. Recursive algorithms won't go faster than iterative ones, usually. But they are typically nicer to understand. (= more elegant)
