This paper of Altham compares Bayesian and non-Bayesian (Fisher's exact) tests for equal proportions between two groups. It turns out Fisher’s exact test can be understood as taking the prior Beta(1, 0) and Beta(0, 1) which is a surprising because using the uniform prior Beta(1,1) would have been more intuitive. Altham notes, “[Fisher’s exact test] seems to correspond to a strong prior belief in negative association of rows and columns.” She also shows that Fisher’s exact test is strictly conservative relative to the Bayesian analysis with uniform priors.
