10% dip in February for metrics that count?

February usually has 28 days, unlike it's neighbors January and March which have 31. It seems that most countable things will exhibit, on average, a 10% dip in February for the missing 3 days. This isn't a matter of pure statistics, but it's something I just noticed. Is this known? Is it ever adjusted for charts?
