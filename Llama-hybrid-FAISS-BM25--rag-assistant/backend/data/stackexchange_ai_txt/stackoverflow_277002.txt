7 pass and 35 pass would take forever to finish. HIPAA only requires DOD 3-pass overwrite, and I am not certain why DOD even has a 7 pass overwrite as it seems they just simply shred the disks before disposing of machines anyway. Theoretically, you could recover data off of the outer edges of each track (using a scanning electron microscope or microscopic magnetic probe), but it practice you would need the resources of a disk drive maker or one of the three letter government organizations to do this. The reason to perform multipass writes is to take advantage of the slight errors in positioning to overwrite the edges of the track also, making recovery far less likely. Most drive recovery companies can't recover a drive that has had its data overwritten even once. They are typically taking advantage of the fact that Windows doesn't zero out the data blocks, just changes the directory to mark the space free. They simply 'undelete' the file and make it visable again. If you don't believe me, call them up and ask them if they can recover a disk that has been dd'ed over... they will typically tell you no, and if they do agree to try, it will be serious $$$ to get it back... DOD 3 pass followed by a zero overwrite should be more than sufficent for most (i.e. non- TOP SECRET) folks. DBAN (and its commercially supported decendent, EBAN) do this all cleanly... I would recommed these.
