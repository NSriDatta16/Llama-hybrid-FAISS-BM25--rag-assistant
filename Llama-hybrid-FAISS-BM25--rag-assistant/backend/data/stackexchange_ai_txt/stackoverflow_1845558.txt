jQuery plugin for designing report layouts

I'm looking for some sort of jquery plugin (or even plain javascript) that can be used to create report layouts, business card layouts, etc. Not finding anything after lots of googling. Basically, I'm envisioning a canvas (possibly html5 canvas?) that shows a background grid. At a minimum, text and images can be added to the canvas. Preferably, they can be dragged and dropped. I'd be happy with anything with any features that are anywhere remotely like this. I expect to have to write it myself. But if there is already something out there, I'd like to see it first. Just to help clarifiy what I'm looking for, imagine jquery code that would let you layout a business card in a web browser, without using flash. This would include adding text, changing fonts, adding images, adding lines, changing background colors, applying gradients, etc. I hope someone knows of something that will help!
