There is a very large number of components you can use in your application. Google will help you finding them. An example for a datepicker is JCalendar and Java Swing Date Picker . Just download it, add the jar to your application and use it. You could easily add it as a bean to the palette of your IDE and drag and drop it like a JButton. JCalendar has also a JDayChooser, JYearChooser a couple of spinner beans and a JLocaleChooser. I have been using Kai Toedter' JCalendar a few years and recommend it highly. Localization is simple. If you want to create your own controls you must create them as Java Beans. The objects must be serializable, have a no argument constructor and accessors and mutators named set, get and is. An old but nice article on JavaBeans is in Java-World . You can study JCalendar's Java sources.
