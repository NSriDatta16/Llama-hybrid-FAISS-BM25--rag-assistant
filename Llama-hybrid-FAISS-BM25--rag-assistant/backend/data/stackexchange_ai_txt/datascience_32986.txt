Transforming words in sentences into vector form to prepare a model

I want to build a simple classifier that classifies if the text is a question or just a simple message . I understand logistic regression and can work to create a simple neural network. I have the labeled input data in English, Japanese, Korean, Thai. How could I transform this data before I feed it into the classifier?
