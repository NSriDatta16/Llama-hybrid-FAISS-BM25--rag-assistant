This was intended as a comment. I think this question is not receiving enough attention because it is too difficult to answer without trying several approaches first. Your third idea is a nice one, but LSA is most likely not going to be able to help you choose clusters with the necessary granularity. For example, you may get a cluster of "broken things" but not to the specificity that is required to be helpful to the customer. A similar approach would be using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, but again, you may not get the clusters that you want. I wouldn't be so eager to try your fourth option because it requires a lot of work and I'm not sure you're going to get great results unless your customer support deals with very well-defined questions and in that case, you're going to have to build your own ontology from scratch. In your situation, I would be curious if I can get information about the inner workings of Watson (obviously, the purpose is only to have a general idea of some steps that are sensible enough to try.) Here is a descriptive image that could be helpful from Wikipedia : The main idea is to segment questions into its components (using a regular chunking), then come up with several possibilities (hypothesis generation) of what the question might refer to (maybe this step can be implemented as a clustering). The third stage is rating the previous hypothesis based on available information. Finally, you choose the more likely hypothesis. There is a feedback involved in this process using sample questions and their answers. It would be interesting to see if the rating stage can be modeled in terms of a Bayesian or an incremental approach to allow for a feedback.
