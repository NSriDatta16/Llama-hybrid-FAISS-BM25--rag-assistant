If you have many independent observations per zip code and ample compute resources, you might try to use the zip code as-is. Instead of including a categorical variable for zip code, you might acquire demographic data for each zip code, join it to your data set, and include those numeric variables instead. Perhaps income level, voting behavior, etc. could conveniently describe the variance in the response, saving you hundreds or thousands of dummy variables. Statistics has an elegant and powerful way to include categorical variables with many levels: Random effects. In this case, the coefficients for each zip code would be assumed to come from a normal distribution, and cleverly fit with maximum likelihood instead of least squares. It has the effect of keeping the coefficients for the zip codes closer to each other (controlling overfitting) and keeping the standard errors of the estimates under control. The most commonly-used function for this is lmer from the R package lme4 .
