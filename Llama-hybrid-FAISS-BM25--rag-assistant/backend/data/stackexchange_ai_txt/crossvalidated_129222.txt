Likert data simply cannot be normal. Although in some cases it is safe enough to treat it as normal, it isn't actually ever normal and treating it as such is potentially dangerous. In addition to the points @Glen_b has made, your residual plot doesn't look good. The residuals should be symmetrical (vertically) around the 0 line. Either there is something seriously wrong with your model or you have strong skew in opposite directions at the two ends (this seems more likely). This means that your model will be attenuated through much of its range (as you get closer to the ends, the predicted values will be closer to the grand mean than they should be), but then will overshoot the possible values if you were to move far enough out from the mean of X. So in addition to your interval estimates being distorted, the model isn't even picking out your means correctly. You would do best to use a mixed ordinal logistic regression.
