It depends on what you mean by "interact". Browsers can't really interact with the desktop except for choosing files to upload or choosing places to download files. There's a good reason for that. ActiveX controls on Windows permitted IE to interact with the desktop, which turned out to be a gigantic security nightmare. Even Microsoft has backed off of that approach now. If you want to interact with the user's computer, you should try AIR, which is an executable application outside of the browser.
