Design: classes with same implementation but different method names

I have multiple classes that have similar implementation for different named methods: class MyClassX { public int MyClassXIntMethod(){} public string MyClassXStringMethod(){} } class MyClassY { public int MyClassYIntMethod(){} public string MyClassYStringMethod(){} } the methods inside the classes have similar implementation but because the method's names are different (due to 3rd party constraints) i cannot use inheritance. I'm looking for an elegant solution that would be better than implementing the same functionality over and over again.
