Choose between robust Pooled OLS and robust Random effects

Please, can anyone tell me how can i choose between Robust Pooled OLS and Robust Random effects ? Is there any command for robust estimation of Breusch-Pagan LM test or something else? To be more precisely, is there any command such as xtoverid, which we use when we make a decision between robust random and robust fixed effects?
