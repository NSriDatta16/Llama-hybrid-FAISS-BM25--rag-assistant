WPF Call MessageBox.Show asynchronously

I have an object that has a timer and it throws an event when the timer reaches to 5 minutes. In this event, I call a MessageBox.Show("Something") in my MainWindow.xaml.cs. The problem is that when I call the MessageBox.Show(), the timer stops, until the user hits ok. And I need the timer to keep going even if the user hasn't clicked ok. Is where a good, elegant way to do this? This is what I've tried so far (but didn't work): private void OnAlert(object sender, MvpEventArgs e) { this.Dispatcher.Invoke( System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Normal, new Action( delegate() { MessageBox.Show("Alert"); } )); }
