How to treat data of one parameter measured with two same devices that show slight differences in averge

I have measured one parameter with two identical devices. Unfortunately one device shows higher values on average. Also maximum and minimum of the values differ by exactly the same value like the average. Can I just substract the mean difference from values measured with the device which measured slightly too high values. Or is there any statistical approach for this issue?
