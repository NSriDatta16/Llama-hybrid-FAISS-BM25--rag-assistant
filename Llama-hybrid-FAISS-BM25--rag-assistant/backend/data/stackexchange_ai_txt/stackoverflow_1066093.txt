OK, I just installed cvsps and ran it from the top level. Here's a sample of the output... this is one of the few hundred patch sets on my module. Note that indeed this does work across different directory trees. --------------------- PatchSet 221 Date: 2009/04/22 22:09:37 Author: jlove-ext Branch: HEAD Tag: LCA_v1_0_0_0_v6 Log: Bug: 45562 Check the length of strings in messages. Namely: * Logical server IDs cannot be more than 18 characters (forcing a TCSE protocol requirement). * Overall 'sid' (filter) search string length cannot be more than 500 (this is actually more than the technical maximum messages are allowed, but is close). Alarm messages and are now not going to crash either as the alarm text is shortened if necessary by the LCA.

Nice one, Joakim. However, as mentioned, CVSzilla does much more than this: Web-browsable CVS repositories (via CVSweb). Web-browsable transactions. Supports transactions across modules. Generates CVS commands (using 'cvs -j') to merge patchsets onto other branches. Integration with bugzilla (transactions are automatically registered against bugs). If all you want is just the patchset info, go with cvsps. If you're looking to use CVS on large projects over a long period of time and are thinking about using bugzilla for your bug-tracking, then I would suggest looking into CVSzilla.
