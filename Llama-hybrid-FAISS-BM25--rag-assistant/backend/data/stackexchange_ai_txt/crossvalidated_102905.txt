A variable is anything that does (or even can) take different values. Not all variables are random variables. When we do regression analyses, we consider the explanatory / predictor variables to be fixed, even when we sampled their values. This is because we are interested in understanding the response as a function of the explanatory variables. In another context, and with different goals, we can take the explanatory variables as stochatic, if appropriate. There is an interesting philosophical issue here, but it is a bit moot. Even in laboratory experiments, where all variables are controlled and set a-priori exactly at fixed levels, the explanatory variables certainly do have variances (albeit PCA would be tremendously uninteresting in such a case).
