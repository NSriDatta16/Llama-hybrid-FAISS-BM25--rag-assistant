Measuring Document Similarity

To cluster (text) documents you need a way of measuring similarity between pairs of documents. Two alternatives are: Compare documents as term vectors using Cosine Similarity - and TF/IDF as the weightings for terms. Compare each documents probability distribution using f-divergence e.g. Kullback-Leibler divergence Is there any intuitive reason to prefer one method to the other (assuming average document sizes of 100 terms)?
