Detecting heteroscedasticity - Can I use Breusch-Pagan Test on binary logistic regression?

I'm currently testing a (binary) logistic regression model, which seems to have at least some issues with multicollinearity. Now I don't really trust the data anymore and would like to also test it on heteroscedasticity. I found some information on Breusch-Pagan Test on the internet, but I could not find an answer to the question if this test also applys on Maximum-Likelihood-Methods, as it is usually mentioned in the context of OLS. So, can I apply the Breusch-Pagan Test on my model? Related to this question: How could I plot for heteroscedasticity-detection? I found this thread , but due to the binary nature of my dependent variable, the plot does not really work and unfortunately I'm pretty novice on plotting with R. Thanks in advance!
