I haven't seen RMSLE before, but I'm assuming it's $\sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\log(x_i) - \log(y_i))^2 }$. Thus exponentiating it won't give you RMSE, it'll give you $e^\sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\log(x_i) - \log(y_i))^2 } \ne \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - y_i)^2}$. If we take the log of both sides, we get the RMSLE versus $\frac{1}{2} \log \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - y_i)^2 \right)$, which is clearly not the same thing. Unfortunately, there isn't a good easy relationship in general (though someone smarter than me / thinking about it harder than me could probably use Jensen's inequality to figure out some relationship between the two). It is, of course, the RMSE of the log-transformed variable, for what that's worth. If you want a rough sense of the spread of the distribution, you can instead get a rough sense of the spread of their logarithm, so that a RMSLE of 1.052 means that the "average" is $2.86$ times as big as the true value, or 1/2.86. Of course that's not quite what RMSE means....
