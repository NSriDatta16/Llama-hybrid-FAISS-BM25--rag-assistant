Noninferiority Using Logistic Regression

From the paper Equivalence and Noninferiority Testing in Regression Models and Repeated-Measures Designs the following graphic is taken. I am interested in a non-inferiority test between two proportions (difference), say $p_{T}$ and $p_{S}$ where T is the new treatment and S is the standard. I am willing to accept that the new treatment is not more than 0.05 worse than the standard. I also have a variable I need to control for and thus want to use regression. Call this variable $C$. So, I believe according to this graphic that if I fit a logistic regression model : $logit(p) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}C + \beta_{2}Treatment$ where Treatment is coded 1 for treatment and 0 for standard, will an exponentiation of the lower side of the confidence interval for $\beta_{2}$ , if larger than -0.05 conclude that treatment is non-inferior to the standard?
