Rather than constantly subdivide your data, why not simply fit a single multiple regression model with each of the variables that are likely to be important in the model? If you had a 1000 observations and ten such grouping variables like sex that roughly split the data in half, on average each regression would have less than one observation -- yet 1000 observations with ten predictors (or eleven if you count the x-variable) all in one equation may be quite feasible. With some regularization you might reasonably incorporate all the two-way interactions you felt worth including. (On the other hand if you need all higher way interactions, you would be back in the same boat you started with, and then regularization - or some way to reduce the space of possible models - would be necessary.)
