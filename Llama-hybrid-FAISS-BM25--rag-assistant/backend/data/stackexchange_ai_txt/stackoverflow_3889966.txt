You never should do this the way you are proposing. Others already told you about the difference of allocating storage on the heap versus allocation on the function stack. But if and when you are allocating on the stack you should just declare your variable: structure A = { /* initialize correctly */ }; There is no sense or point in doing that as an (basically) untyped char array. If you also need the address of that beast, well, take the address of with &A .
