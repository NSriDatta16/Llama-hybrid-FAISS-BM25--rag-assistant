I'd recommend doing this in javascript. At a high level, you just need an element on the page to contain your image, some basic code to allow the user to drag the container around (much of this is available prebuilt through frameworks like mootools ), and some logic to save the final element position after the user is done positioning it. I'm not sure what you mean by saving it as a bitmap, but I'd recommend just saving the element's x and y offset coordinates from the top-left corner of its container. Again, there are readily available frameworks that will do pretty much all of the positioning computations for you. Here is an example site that implements draggable images with persistent state between sessions: http://webcomix.no-ip.org
