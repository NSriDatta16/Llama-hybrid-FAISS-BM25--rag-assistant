From my own experience, if your project starts off as an iOS project you are in for a world of pain, as it sounds like you have discovered. Sure, you can add OS X targets to your iPhone project, but the built executable isn't automatically added in Xcode. You can then add a custom executable, but the configuration lives in the user-specific project files which can be a dealbreaker if you're using source control and collaborating with other people. Also, as you have discovered, it doesn't integrate as well as it should with the debugger, etc. If you want a more manageable project, I'd recommend starting out with an OS X project and then adding your iOS targets. This has worked much better for me. This might be improved in Xcode 4, but in 3.2 these issues have been a real drag. At least you know you're not alone.
