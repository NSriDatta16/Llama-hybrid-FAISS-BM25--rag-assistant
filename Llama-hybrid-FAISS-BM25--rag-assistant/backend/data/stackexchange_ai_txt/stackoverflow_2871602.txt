RemoveContent task and the other folder tasks of MSBuild Extension pack use DirectoryInfo internally. To access remote folder DirectoryInfo handles UNC path , the problem is that you can't put the credential in a UNC path . So you can't do what you want directly using only RemoveContent task. Workarounds : The simple one : Give the right to your build agent The better : Map the folder to a network drive and use this network drive in your MSBuild task. This can be done with MSBuild Exec task and net command The harder : Write a MSBuild custom task doing what you want and that takes credential as parameters.
