which deep learning model to use for array sequence classification?

i am trying to classify a sequence of 10 numbers with keras and tensorflow. a common neural network doesn't seem to be an option. here is my data: X_train.shape (8313, 10) X_train array([[13, 17, 6, ..., 14, 14, 13], [13, 13, 13, ..., 3, 14, 14], [17, 14, 14, ..., 17, 13, 17], ..., [ 6, 14, 13, ..., 13, 14, 14], [ 0, 5, 9, ..., 12, 5, 7], [13, 17, 14, ..., 13, 13, 13]]) as you can see X has about 8k rows and 10 columns. the numbers inside the array have no real value. so 14 is not 2 times 7. they are categorical and stand for the sequence a user interacted with the system. so the first column is step 1, second columns is step 2, and so on. the order is important. i want the model to differ these sequences. y is binary 0 or 1. which model is appropriate for this scenario?
