Read the section from the Swing tutorial on Laying Out Components in a Container . Download the examples and play with them to learn how to use layout managers. And remember that you can nest different layout managers to get your desired effect. The only time I have ever had a reason to use a null layout is when you application has the ability to drag components around a panel. In this case you want to control the position through the dragging. Otherwise you time is better spent learning the learning mangagers instead of worrying about the consequences of using a null layout.
