Creating dummy variables should not be necessary. You should just use factors when modeling in R. admityear If the singular condition still persists, then you have multicollinearity and need to try dropping other variables. (I would be suspicious of WorkHistory_years.) I also don't see anything ordinal about that model. Ordinal logistic regression in the rms package (or the no longer actively supported Design package) is done with polr(). And it would be really helpful to see the results from str(fasd).
