how to run causalImpact on a time series with multiple interventions?

In CausalImpact package, one defines pre-period and post-period for a single intervention. However, in the scenarios where there are multiple interventions at irregular time intervals, is there a way to use causalImpact or other packages to estimate the impact? thanks. Sample code below library(CausalImpact) x1
