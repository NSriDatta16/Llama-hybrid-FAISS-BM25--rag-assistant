Time Series Forecast - Complex seasonality

I have a daily time series that I am having issues forecasting accurately.The time series is stationary and it looks I have tried ARIMA(3,1,1),(0,1,1)- 7 Period, auto.arima(D=1), Holt-Winters, nnetar, tbats, hybridModel and accuracy(RMSE) of test dataset is about 4 which is not good at all. Seasonality in time series looks like and I can see in acf and pacf plots that there is weekly seasonality. Is there any other method/technique I could use to forecast this daily time series more accurately? I can send the data if needed.
