wix - no rows with my CA in InstallExecuteSequence Table

i have code like this Not AdminUser But installer ignores this fragment. i looked the msi-database with Orca.exe. and i found that in InstallExecuteSequence Table there are no rows with this custom actions. what is the problem? should i bind my custom actions to dialog's controls?
