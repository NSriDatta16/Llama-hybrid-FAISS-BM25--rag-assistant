How does a linear SVM work?

I have a 2-class problem involving many features. Does a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier only take into account the values of these features and nothing more? Does it see the relationships between the variables? For example, does it work like this: if feature number 80 is "0", then feature 2: needs to be over 0.2 for class 1 and if feature number 80 is "1" then feature 2: needs to be over 0.8 to be in class 1? Does it do it with many variables at once, and do the values of other variables influence how the SVM is influenced by other variables?
