Embedding HTML5 video for Mobile Safari on an iPhone 3GS vs an iPhone 4

I have an H.264/AAC encoded video in an mp4 file on the server, the mime-type video/mp4 is added to the web server (IIS 7), and I have a page with a video tag: Works great on an iPhone 4, but on an iPhone 3GS (same iOS version, 4.3.2) is only shows the poster image and tapping it doesn't start the video. When I try to open the video file directly, I get a 'tip' from the Mobile Safari developer console: Other Tip QuickTime Movie could not be played What is needed to get HTML5 video working on an iPhone 3GS? Is it an encoding issue?
