Variance decompostion for logistic regression using deviances?

I have data on the proportion of methylated cytosines in a gene from 13 plant genotypes from replicate experiments at four sites. Each genotype is replicated at each site, so and I would like to quantify how much of the variation in methylation is due to genotype, to site and to the interaction between genotype and site. If this were a trait with homogenous variance then I would do a classic partitioning of the sums of squares. Since I'm working with proportion data, I am instead fitting a binomial GLM, but then you get deviances instead of sums of squares. Here is an example in R: > m anova(m) Analysis of Deviance Table Model: binomial, link: logit Response: meth Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid. Df Resid. Dev NULL 179 1.8435 genotype 11 0.21179 168 1.6317 site 3 0.02283 165 1.6089 genotype:site 33 0.55343 132 1.0555 My question is : is it valid to quantify variance explained by directly substituting the deviances for what would be sums of squares? Here is an example of what I mean: > data.frame( var = c('genotype','site', 'genotype:site', "residual"), explained = c(0.21178648, 0.02282985, 0.55343393, 1.05547605) ) > s $explained explained / sum(s$explained) > s genotype 0.115 site 0.012 genotype:site 0.300 Residual error 0.573 My interpretation would be that the genotype x site explains 30% of the variation, genotype 12% an site around 1%, which most variance going unexplained. To be clear, I am not interesting in testing significance, only in quantifying which factors are explaining the variation. I feel this ought to be a simple problem, but I haven't been able to find a source with a straight answer, because almost all discussions I have found focus on testing, not quantifying. Any suggestions for sources on this would be very welcome. Thank you in advance!
