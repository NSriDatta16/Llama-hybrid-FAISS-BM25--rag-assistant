Actually, I found a module that does basically what the template.php answer above does, by allowing you to assign a default menu item by content type. It's called Menu Trails . Here is an excerpt from its project page: ... adds some common-sense usability to Drupal's menu system Menu Trails implements primary/secondary links which keep the current menu trail "active" or highlighted. A handy snippet ready to go into your template.php is included. The module provides a means of broadly categorizing nodes (by type or taxonomy) as falling "under" a known menu item. These nodes are not added to the menu tree (keeping the menu admin system sane) but they will trigger the functionality above -- preserving navigation state for the user -- when viewed. New for 6.0: Menu Trails can also set breadcrumbs for nodes, keeping them in sync with the trail. New for 6.0: Menu Trails is now Organic Groups aware, so nodes can be designated to fall "under" the first group node they belong to. New for 6.0: A token is exposed to pathauto (and other token-aware modules) allowing for the menu trail to be used in automatic path alias creation.
