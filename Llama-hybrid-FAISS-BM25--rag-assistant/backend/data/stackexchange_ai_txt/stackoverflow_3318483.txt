Note that ICollection .Contains is not a generic method - it is a non-generic method of a generic type. Otherwise IsGenericMethod and GetGenericTypeDefinition would help. You could obtain the generic type definition ( DeclaringType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() ) and work back up to Contains , but I wonder if you are approaching this problem the hard way. Usually, if you are using reflection, it may be pragmatic to drop to non-generic IList - unless you need the type data (for example, for meta-programming). And in that case, I would consider looking closely to see if you can simplify the setup here.
