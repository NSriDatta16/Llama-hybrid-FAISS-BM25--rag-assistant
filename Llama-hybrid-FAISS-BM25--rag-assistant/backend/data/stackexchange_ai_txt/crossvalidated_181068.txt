Automated multi-product demand forecasting

I am looking for references regarding the forecasting of the demand for multiple products in an automated manner (no human intervention). Specifically, I have a number of clustered products for which I am trying to predict the future (daily) demand for a price using historical data. I have tried using a traditional time series approach, however I need to forecast the demand for each price level which makes my data a multivariate time series. Is a VAR model the most commonly used approach? I guess the different points are highly correlated (i.e. demand for day $t$ at price \$1 $ I know that I need to try different methods and explore the data but my main issue is that the volume of data is huge and changes a lot so I cannot re-estimate my model manually. I am still a beginner, so apologies if this is a straightforward question.
