You can't email the password to the user, because you don't know it. You've "hashed" it by applying something like PBKDF2 or bcrypt to it for storage, right? If you reset the password without confirming it with the owner of the account, an attacker can deny the owner access to his account, at least until he checks his email, by using the victim's email address to request a reset. A method safe enough for many applications is to email a link to the account owner, containing a large, randomly generated number. This token should only be valid for a limited time. If the owner wishes to reset their password, they click the link and this authenticates them as the account owner. The account owner can then specify a new password.
