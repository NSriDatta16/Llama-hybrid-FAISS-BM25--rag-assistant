Method to prevent infinite error with small values data prediction

I have a series of daily data (sales) where values are low: [0,1,..., 25 ] These are periodic data but it has strong daily variations: 10 -> 0 0 -> 6 ... When applying a prediction model and calculate the % (MAPE), I get obviously very high error. My question is : Is there any method to remove the "divide zeros" effect, or to deal with prediction error of small values data. (apart from averaging the values over time, cumulative error, ...).
