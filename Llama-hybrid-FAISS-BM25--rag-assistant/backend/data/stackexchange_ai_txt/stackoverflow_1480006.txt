I think there should be internal development teams that each has a system which may contain multiple applications within it. To take a few examples of what I mean by systems: ERP - If you are a manufacturer of products, you may need a system to keep track of inventory, accounting of books and money, and other planning elements. There are a wide range of scales of such systems but I suspect in most cases there is some customization done and that is where a team is used and may end up just doing that over and over if the company is successful and a new system is needed to replace the previous one as these can take years to get fully up and running. The application for the shop floor is likely not the same one as what the CFO needs in order to write the quarterly earnings numbers to give two examples here. CRM - How about tracking all customer interactions within an organization that can be useful for sales and marketing departments? Again, there are many different solutions and generally there is customizations done which is another team. The sales team may have one view of the data but if there is a support arm to the company they may want different data about a customer to help them. CMS - Now, here I can see your three applications making sense, but note what else there is beyond simple content. I don't think I'd want to work where everything is a home grown solution and there is no outside code used at all. Lots of code out there can be used in rather good ways such as tools but also components like DB servers or development IDEs.
