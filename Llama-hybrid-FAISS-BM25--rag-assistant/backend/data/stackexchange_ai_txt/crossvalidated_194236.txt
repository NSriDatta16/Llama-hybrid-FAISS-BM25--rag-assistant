Linear Regression to detect between a linear and non-linear trend

I have measured the area of spread of a number of plants through time. I'm interested in trying to ascertain whether a linear or a non-linear relationship (i.e. quadratic) best represents the increase in the sqrt of the area occupied by these plants through time My first feeling was that I could use a linear regression for this, whereby I fit a linear regression model containing a squared term to each plant's growth through time i.e. y = a + b.x + c.x^2 (where x equals time) and compare this to y = a + b.x via standard linear regression simplification to see whether a non-linear trend explains significantly more of the variation than just a linear trend. However, I'm aware that linear regression probably shouldn't be used for time series data. It is possible to do it in this way? Thanks
