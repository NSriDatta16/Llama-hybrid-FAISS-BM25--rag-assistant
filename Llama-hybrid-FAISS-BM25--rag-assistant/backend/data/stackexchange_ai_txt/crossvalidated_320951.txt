How to use support vector machines (SVM) in a dynamic environment?

Base on my understanding from the SVMs, the feature vector is formed based on the whole dataset (including train and test data). In case we want to apply the trained classifier on a new set of test data, do we need to run the classification algorithm from scratch? If no, what if one of the input test vectors has a size greater than the classifier's vector size?
