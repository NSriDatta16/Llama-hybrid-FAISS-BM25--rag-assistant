Supress or Ignore Non-Trusted Certificate With FTPS.exe (MoveIT Freely)?

One of the FTP accounts that I use recently began requiring secure FTP connections, which broke a script that I used to upload to it using a 'standard' FTP library. I've written a little batch file that will upload the 2 files via FTPS.exe (MoveIT Freely), but I get a dialog box that pops up and requires me to click yes. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but I'm calling the batch file at the end of a ~10 minute long script that parses, combines, and encodes several CSV files (usually unattended). With this dialog box popping up, I have to keep an eye on it... I'm trying to get this to the point where I can run it as a scheduled task and forget about it. There doesn't seem to be much support for this freeware unless you are also a payware customer, so I was wondering if anyone else has run into this problem and knows a flag to ignore the error (or a workaround, or another free secure FTP solution). Error is below (server names changed). MOVEit Freely --------------------------- Non trusted certificate --------------------------- The certificate's CN name does not match the passed value. Certificate issued to: funftp501 Certificate issued by: Standalone007 Do you want to proceed with the connection? --------------------------- Yes No ---------------------------
