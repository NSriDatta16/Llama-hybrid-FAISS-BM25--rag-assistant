Why do we need adjustment when applying Ljung-Box test over residuals?

Why do we need adjustment when applying Ljung-Box test over residuals? The following is from the Multivariate Time Series Analysis by R. Tsay. m1 = VAR(data.ts,p=2) resi=m1$residuals ### Obtain the residuals of VAR(2) fit. mq(resi,adj=18) ## adj is used to adjust the degrees of freedom. Regarding the above comment, why and how do we decide a value for adj?
