Database structure for efficient storage and retrieval

Ive got a database that receives links and content related to a specific football club,and the way im storing the content at the moment is in 2 seperate tables,1 that stores the links and the details,fm_sources, and another that stores club specific information,fm_club, that will be used to run queries against the fm_sources content to find relevant infomation. The question is,ive across an API that will virtually guarantee data that is associated with 1 club,would it be better for me to have a different table for each club with the rows being associated with the club on initial storage,this would allow me to use very simple SQL queries as opposed to massive LIKE comparisons as i used here . I could then simpley run a query like this SELECT * FROM fm_liverpool ORDER BY created_date DESC LIMIT 15 This method would then require me to have multiple tables for each club but each table would replicate the same columns.
