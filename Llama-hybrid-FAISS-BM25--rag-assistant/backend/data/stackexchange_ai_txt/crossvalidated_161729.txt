All these are useful comments. Just take one more into account. When you have enough data, using Hold-Out is a way to assess a specific model (a specific SVM model, a specific CART model, etc), whereas if you use other cross-validation procedures you are assessing methodologies (under your problem conditions) rather than models (SVM methodology, CART methodology, etc). Hope this is helpful!
