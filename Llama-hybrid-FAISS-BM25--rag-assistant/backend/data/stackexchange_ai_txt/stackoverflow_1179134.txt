How to get the Index Name from IndexId in SQL Server 2005

I'm running the following query to list size and fragmentation of the indexes: SELECT object_name(object_id, database_id) as objectname), index_id, * FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats Is there an SQL function I can use to convert the index_id to the index name?
