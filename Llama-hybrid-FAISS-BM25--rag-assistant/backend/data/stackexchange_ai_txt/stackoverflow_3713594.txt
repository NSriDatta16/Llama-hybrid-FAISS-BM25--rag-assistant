Stanford published videos and materials from a set of engineering courses at http://see.stanford.edu One course by Andrew Ng focuses on Machine Learning techniques http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1 The course is also available on iTunes U Its a really good course from someone who obviously knows the field well, but he spends alot of the time deriving mathematical results - so if your rusty in linear algebra or prob/stats, you might need a refresher first.
