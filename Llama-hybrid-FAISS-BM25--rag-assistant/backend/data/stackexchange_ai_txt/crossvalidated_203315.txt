Kurtosis does not measure "peakedness." By definition, it is the expected value (average) of $Z^4$.* Thus, $|Z|$-values less than 1 (corresponding to data values within one standard deviation of the mean, where any "peak" would be) contribute very little to kurtosis; nearly all the contribution to kurtosis is from $|Z|$-values greater than 1 (outliers in particular). See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321753/ , Figures 2 and 3 in particular. * Subtract 3 or not; it makes no difference to this point.
