Strictly speaking, it is only approximate. That is, if a probability of an event is very small then the average number of such events over multiple intervals is approximately equal to the probability of one event. Each event occurs in some small interval. It is possible to have more than one event in a single interval. The average number over many intervals should be close to the the probability of one event in one interval. This average should also be a good estimate of the probability of one event in an interval.
