There's an argument for multiple inheritance here! You could define an interface for the functionality (IFastEditTextBox and ISpellCheckingTextBox) and implement the methods in each one. This would be more OO but there's the potential for "copy-and-paste" code. There isn't any problem with using partial classes here. The only fundamental issue with them is they might encourage a developer who already leans towards a procedural approach to code everything into one class.
