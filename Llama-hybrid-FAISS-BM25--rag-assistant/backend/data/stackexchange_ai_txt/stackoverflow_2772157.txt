Is Weblog Expert reliable?

My boss asked me if Weblog expert ( http://www.weblogexpert.com/lite.htm ) is reliable in calculating the average time of the incoming visitors in a web site. Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, I think that the average time might be something left to personal interpretation. Does any one uses Weblog Expert? Is the visitor's average time reliable? Does anyone understand its criteria about how it process Apache logs to understand the average time?
