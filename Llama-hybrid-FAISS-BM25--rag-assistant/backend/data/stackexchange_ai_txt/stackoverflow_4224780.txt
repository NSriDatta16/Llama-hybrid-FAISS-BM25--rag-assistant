MS Foodmart database - what is difference between store sales and store cost?

There is the Foodmart database that was shipped with MS SQL Server 2000 for tutorial purposes. It has a table "sales_fact_1997" that has columns "store_sales" and "store_cost". What is the difference in their actual meaning? Both store currency info - the amount of money that was involved in a transaction (along with pruduct ID, customer ID, store ID etc). It seems to me, that "store cost" means the prime cost of a product (money that the company spent to buy this product) and "store sales" means the product price (money that a consumer spent to buy this product from the company). The only thing that looks odd is that in average "store sales" ~ 2.5 * "store cost". 250% profitability seems TOO MUCH.
