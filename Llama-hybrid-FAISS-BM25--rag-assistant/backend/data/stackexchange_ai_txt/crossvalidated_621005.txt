Where is the number "0.963" in the paper "Why Isn't Everyone a Bayesian?" by Bradley Efron coming from?

This paper by Bradley Efron (also available here ) concerning Bayesian vs. frequentist interpretation of probability contains an example I don't quite understand. It's on page two in the right column in paragraph two. It goes like this: Consider 15 random numbers $x_{1}, \dots, x_{15}$ drawn from an unknown probability distribution $F$ on real numbers. To estimate the median of the distribution $\theta$ , Frequentists can easily construct the confidence interval $$ \theta \in [x_{(3)}, x_{(12)}], $$ which contains the median with a probability 0.963, no matter what $F$ is. $x_{(i)}$ denotes the $i$ -th largest value of the 15 random numbers. After talking with colleagues and thinking I am not possible to come up with the same answer. The best idea I have is this: A random number has, by construction, a probability of 0.5 of being larger than the median of it's probability distribution. Thus the probability that for a (of course fixed but unknown $\theta$ ) the interval of the third largest value to the 12 largest value does not contain the median is $$ p(\theta \in [x_{(3)}, x_{(12)}]) = 1-\sum_{k=1, 2, 13, 14, 15}\binom{15}{k} 0.5^{15} \approx 0.9926 $$ which is obviously not 0.963. Any ideas?
