Testing for randomness of room assignments

I have data on room assignments for students at a university, as well as certain characteristics on the students in the rooms, e.g. test scores, gpa, nationality, gender. I am told room assignments are random, but how can I test this? My thinking is if I can predict an individuals characteristics based on the average characteristics of a room than it is not random. So essentially I would have to run some regression where the right hand side are average characteristics of some of the room, and then do an F-Test to make sure coeffiecients are not significant by chance? I am not sure if this is correct or maybe there is smarter way to go about this.
