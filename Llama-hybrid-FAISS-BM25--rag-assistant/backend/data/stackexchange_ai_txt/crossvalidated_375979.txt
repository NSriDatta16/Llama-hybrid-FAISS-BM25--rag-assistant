What is the relation between the number of components in PCA vs. overall number of components?

For example, if I have a 64-dimension problem, and 80% of the variance lies within just 12 components. Is there some mathematical relationship that says something about the number of components that was required to express 80% of the variance of 64 components? i.e. that it had to be 12 components for a 64-dimension problem or does it entirely depend on the data in question.
