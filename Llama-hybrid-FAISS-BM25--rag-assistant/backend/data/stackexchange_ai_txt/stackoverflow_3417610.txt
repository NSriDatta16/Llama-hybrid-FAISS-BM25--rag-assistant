SQLServer.NET data provider is high-speed and robust, but requires SQL Server license purchased from Microsoft, or you can get a free Express Version (if you get the new SQL Server R2 Express you get 10 GB of database storage!) (thanks from the comments, slipped my mind) http://www.microsoft.com/express/database/ OLE-DB.NET is universal for accessing other sources, like Oracle, DB2, Microsoft Access and Informix, but itâ€™s a .NET layer on top of OLE layer, so not the fastest thing in the world. ODBC.NET is a deprecated layer provided for backward compatibility to ODBC engines. More in depth look at Data Providers http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s7ee2dwt(VS.71).aspx
