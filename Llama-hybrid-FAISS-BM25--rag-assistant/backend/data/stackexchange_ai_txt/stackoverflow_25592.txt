OK, my joking answer didn't go down so well. This mailing list question, with answer from Matz indicates that Ruby 1.9's built in String#upcase and String#downcase methods will only handle ASCII characters. Without testing it myself, I would see this as strong evidence that all non-ascii characters in source code will likely be considered lowercase. Can someone download and compile the latest 1.9 and see?
