Probably the quickest/easiest way to do this is to: Stationarise the time series by taking differences or returns: e.g. $x_{diff}(t) = x(t)-x(t-1)$ . Subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation: $x_{norm}(t) = \frac{x_{diff}(t)-\mu(x_{diff})}{\sigma(x_{diff})}$ You now have something resembling data drawn from a Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Now just multiply the data by whatever you want the new standard deviation to be, add back in the mean, and do a cumulative sum/product to convert from difference/returns back to original values.
