Robert, just to expand on @Alejandro's correct answer/comment: It's not XSLT that's creating a folder. XSLT is already "ignoring" the / in the Heading: it does not treat it as anything special. (Look at XSLT's output and you can see that.) What OS (or more properly, file system) are you creating files in? Depending on that, '/' may be an illegal character in filenames, so substituting another character for it may be your only option. Try naming a file a/b manually and see if it's even possible. Since you are using normalize-space() already, it seems that you are not absolutely required to preserve the Heading content precisely in the filename. To substitute - for / , modify your translate() expression like this: translate(normalize-space($file),' /','_-') This means "substitute _ for every space, and substitute - for every / ."
