Comment, maybe not a complete Answer: You mention counts might be Poisson. Suppose the true rate of a sample before treatment is $\lambda_{pre} = 13$ and the true rate after treatment is $\lambda_{post} = 10.$ Then the probability of a higher count after treatment is about $1/4.$ (Simulation below based on 100,000 hypothetical samples.) set.seed(2021) pre = rpois(10^5, 13) mean(pre) [1] 13.00925 # near 13 post = rpois(10^5, 10) mean(post) [1] 9.99841 # near 10 mean(post > pre) [1] 0.23089 # aprx P(Post > Pre) Put another way, quantiles .05 and .95 of $\mathsf{Pois}(13)$ $[7$ and $19,$ respectively] are not a lot different from quantiles .05 and .95 of $\mathsf{Pois}(10),$ [5 and 15]. (Both Poisson distributions put a lot of probability between 7 and 15.) qpois(c(.05,.95), 13) [1] 7 19 qpois(c(.05,.95), 10) [1] 5 15 A plot of the two Poisson PDFs is shown below. A speculative Bayesian prior distribution could be chosen to have the effect of substantially ignoring 'reverse' counts, but that would not improve the relatively poor information available from comparing Poisson counts. I don't yet have a sufficiently good grasp of the context of your comparisons to make a responsible recommendation. (a) If your goal is to show that treatment tends in the direction of decreased counts, then a (highly-random) Poisson model might be able to detect a meaningful decrease overall. Suppose the overall rates are $\lambda_{pre}=13, \lambda_{post}=10$ throughout a group of $n=12$ subjects and that group averages before and after treatment are compared. Then the probability is about 98% that there will be a positive decrease from average before to average after. (Even though some individual patients may not have shown decreases.) set.seed(520) a.dec = replicate(10^5, mean(rpois(12,13)) - mean(rpois(12,10))) mean(a.dec > 0) [1] 0.98395 (b) However, if your goal is to say whether treatment has truly decreased the rate for a particular patient, I don't think your method as described is adequate. Note: R code for first figure: x = 0:30; PDF = dpois(x,13) pdf = dpois(x,10) hdr = "PDFs of POIS(13) [blue] and POIS(10)" plot(x-.1, PDF, type="h", xlab="x", ylim=c(0,.14), lwd=2, col="blue", main=hdr) lines(x+.2, pdf, type="h", col="brown") abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v=0, col="green2")
