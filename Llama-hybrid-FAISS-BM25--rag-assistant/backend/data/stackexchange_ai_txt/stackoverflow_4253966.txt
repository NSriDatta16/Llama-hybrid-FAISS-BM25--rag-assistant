Youtube Flash embed flickering in Firefox

I'm having a problem with youtube video embedding; In some places on my site (like news etc.) video is normally displayed and can be watched, while in others (forum topics mainly) it flickers whenever I mouseover it (making a new HTTP request to YouTube, as I can see in Firebug). It definitelly has something to do with CSS rendering; when I disable JS nothing changes but disabling CSS causes it to work properly. Firefox version: 3.6.12 Flash version: 10.1.82.76 The code I'm using for embedding: (to keep it W3 HTML valid, flickering happens with normal embed code as well). You can see it 'in action' here: Youtube embed code flickering in Firefox Edit: OMG, it works properly when I'm logged out... Now nothing is clear to me as CSS is the same for users and guests, there are just few minor differences in markup...
