I asked this question a long time ago, but now that I know more about reliability, I can answer my original question. The $\omega$ coefficients $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are different in the following ways: The $\omega_2$ coefficient can be viewed as the unconditional reliability, where it does not account for differences in multi-dimensionality. If for example there are cross-loadings (items which have at least some moderate loadings on more than one factor, the "dual loadings" that I was confused by before) or method factors (uniquely explained latent variable variance from a complicated factor structure), this coefficient will differ from $\omega_1$ . The $\omega_1$ coefficient can be viewed as the reliability after controlling for other factors, or conditional reliability. If the factors in the model do not have any multi-dimensional aspects, then $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ will be the same. It appears the updated documentation indicates that this function will in any case soon be defunct in replacement for a more complete function called compRelSEM which automates some of the selection process previously required in the reliability function for reasons outlined below: Reliability The original reliability function was suboptimally designed. For example, AVE was returned, which is not a reliability index. Also, alpha and several omega-type coefficients were returned, including the original formula that was in appropriate for models with complex structure. Some features could be controlled by the user for one but not both types of index For example, alpha for categorical indicators was returned on both the observed and latent-response scales, but this was not an option for any omega-type indices. The omegas differed in terms of whether the observed or model-implied covariance matrix was used in the denominator, but alpha was only computed using the observed matrix. These inconsistencies have been resolved in the new compRelSEM function, which returns only one reliability index (per factor, optionally total score) according to the user's requested features, for which there is much more flexibility. Average variance extracted is now available in a dedicated AVE function. Higher-Order Reliability Originally, composite reliability of a single higher-order factor was estimated in a separate function: reliabilityL2 . It is now available for multiple higher-order factors in the same model, and from the same compRelSEM function that estimates reliability for first-order factors, using the higher= argument to name higher-order factors in the fitted model. While now the new function automatically returns the "correct" coefficient, one can obtain them manually by setting the argument return.total=TRUE , which gives $\omega_2$ , while giving $\omega_1$ otherwise in a single composite factor structure.
