Derived class linker - is this wrong?

We have this situation: Window Keyboard ^ ^ | / ApplicationWindow so class Window { } class Keyboard { } class AppWindow : public Window, public Keyboard { } Now, Keyboard wants to access a property in ApplicationWindow , for example, it wants to call the ApplicationWindow's getWidth() property. The solution I have is to place a pointer to an ApplicationWindow inside Keyboard . I'm trying to use multiple inheritance here as composition , while I know actual composition is more strongly encouraged, I wanted to try MI. In any case I'd need a back link to the ApplicationWindow instance from Keyboard if I used composition anyway..
