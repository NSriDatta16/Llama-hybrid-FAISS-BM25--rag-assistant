Nope!!! I found the way out. Actually I have enabled the code coverage. When I enable it I was using the solution in one path which later copied to some other path. While copying I forgot to change the dll referenced for code coverage, it was refering the old path. This is why when I debug its using the local copy, but when I run, it is using the old dll's. When I updated the reference it is working like charm... :) Thanks a lot for your support. Regards, ArunDhaJ
