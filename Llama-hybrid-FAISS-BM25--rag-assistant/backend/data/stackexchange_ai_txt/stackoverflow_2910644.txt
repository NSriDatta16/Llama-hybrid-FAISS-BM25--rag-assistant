When you create an object using new, you need to use delete to release its memory back to the system. The memory will then be available for others to reuse. int* a = new int; delete a; NULL is just a pre-defined macro that can be assigned a pointer to mean that it does not point to anything. int* a = new int; a = NULL; In the above case, after allocating storage for a, you are assigning NULL to it. However, the memory previously allocated for a was not released and cannot be reused by the system. This is what we call memory leak.
