ARIMA model for vehicle-speed prediction

I am learning on how to predict with ARIMA models. To get some knowledge I read trough some online tutorials for R and ARIMA models. Now I wanted to try this by myself with a problem I am currently working on. The goal is to predict the vehicle speed of a car based on past measures. I have data sampled from the vehicle CAN-Bus with a rate of 0.01s. For me it doesn't matter if I predict the speed or the acceleration of the car. First I make my data a time series with: data ACF and PACF return following results (data = vehicle speed) I am not sure how to proceed further from here, hope someone can help me on what to perform on my data to use the auto.arima function EDIT: for explanatian, when I run ARIMAfit I get the following: Series: ts(data) ARIMA(1,1,0) Coefficients: ar1 0.9893 s.e. 0.0008 sigma^2 estimated as 1.05e-06: log likelihood=183883.2 AIC=-367762.3 AICc=-367762.3 BIC=-367745.5 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -1.988926e-07 0.001024627 0.00067539 NaN Inf 0.1398728 -0.2072756 with pred the prediction is almost zero for the next 1000 points
