Compiling and linking CUDA source files with OpenMP support

It it possible to use OpenMP pragmas in CUDA source files (not in kernel code)? I will combine GPU and CPU computation. But the nvcc compiler fails with "cannot find Unknown option 'openmp'", when I link the program with an openmp option (under Linux). A workaround is to use OpenMP pragmas only in C/C++ files.
