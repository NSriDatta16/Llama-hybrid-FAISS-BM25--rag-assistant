Data integrity question when collecting STDOUTs from multiple remote hosts over SSH

Suppose you run the following commands: ssh $host1 'while [ 1 ]; do sleep 1; echo "Hello from $HOSTNAME"; done' > /tmp/output ssh $host2 'while [ 1 ]; do sleep 1; echo "Hello from $HOSTNAME"; done' >> /tmp/output ssh $host3 'while [ 1 ]; do sleep 1; echo "Hello from $HOSTNAME"; done' >> /tmp/output Then the output would look like: Hello from host1 Hello from host2 Hello from host3 Hello from host1 ... But what if I changed it to ssh $host1 'while [ 1 ]; do sleep 1; cat /some/large/file1.txt; done' > /tmp/output ssh $host2 'while [ 1 ]; do sleep 1; cat /some/large/file2.txt; done' >> /tmp/output ssh $host3 'while [ 1 ]; do sleep 1; cat /some/large/file3.txt; done' >> /tmp/output so that stdout from each host won't fit into a single buffer? Would the data integrity of file[1-3].txt, and not the order, be maintained in this case? Is there a possibility that a file fragment of some other file slips in the middle of some other file like this? [file1_fragment1] [file2_fragment1] [file1_fragment2] [file1_fragment3] [file3_fragment1] ...
