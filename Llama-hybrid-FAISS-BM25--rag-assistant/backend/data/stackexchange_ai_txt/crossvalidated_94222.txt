Well first of all, what would you be using if the data were all present at every observation? Whatever you had in mind, you could basically do the same thing but create an indicator variable for whether the observation exists and include it along with an interaction between the indicator and the actual variable. That's kind of a cheap trick to handle missing data like that, but it works with a linear model. As for this kind of time series data, usually the simplest version of this model looks something like an ARMA model with an additional term that is a linear combination of the covariates you've got. So basically it's an ARMA model where the mean difference is linear in the covariates. But of course you can make it more complex than that; you could make the difference depend on the previous value times the covariate, or you could make the variance depend on the covariate. But that's a whole set of decisions you'd have to make even if all the data were there. As for what R packages to use, that I actually don't know although I think most of the standard packages will incorporate covariates like this if you do it right.
