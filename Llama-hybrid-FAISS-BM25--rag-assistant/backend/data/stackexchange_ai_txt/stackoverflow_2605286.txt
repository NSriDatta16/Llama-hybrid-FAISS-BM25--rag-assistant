While I encourage you to look at alternative design patterns, to do what you're looking for you simply need to add a method (or property) to access uberDict to AppController. As a property, the code would be: @interface AppController : NSObject { NSMutableDictionary *uberDict; } @property (readonly) NSMutableArray *uberDict; @end in the AppController.h file, and just add a one line @synthesize uberDict; inside the AppContoller implementation (before the @end). Don't worry about the (readonly) -- this means that the object getting the uberDict cannot set it to a new dictionary, but still can modify the contents of the dict and read from it.
