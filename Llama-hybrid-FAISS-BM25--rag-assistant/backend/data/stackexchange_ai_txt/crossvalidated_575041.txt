Combining Biological Replicates

I am doing an experiment where I track the behavior of larval zebrafish of 3 genotypes during a photomotor assay. The larvae are a result of a heterozygous cross, so following the experiment I genotype each fish to determine whether that data came from a wildtype, het or mutant. The tracking software provides measurements including distance moved, velocity and well location. Due to constraints with our tracking system, I can only run between 24-48 fish at a time. Because of this, I perform the experiment several times to increase n. When I repeat the experiment, it is done with different larvae on a different day - trying to keep as many factors the same (including time of day, amount of liquid in the wells etc.) Previously, our lab has normalized the data to the controls of each replicate and then combined the data. To do this, total distance moved by mutant larvae was divided by the average of total distance moved for the controls of that experiment, this was also done to the controls. The "normalized" values from multiple replicates were then combined. I don't think this is the most rigorous way to analyze these data. I am playing with lots of different ideas, including linear mixed models with Experiment # as a random effect (I recognize this may be an issue as I usually only have 3 replicates). Any suggestions? Note: I am new to statistics and have been feeling very lost while trying to balance all of the considerations of various models.
