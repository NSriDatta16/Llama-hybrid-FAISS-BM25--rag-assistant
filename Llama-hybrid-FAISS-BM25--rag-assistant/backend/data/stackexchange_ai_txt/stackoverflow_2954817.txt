For those many images it has to be a serious app.. thus giving you the liberty to suggest a piece of software running on the client (something like yahoo mail/picassa does) that will take care of 'managing' (network interruptions/resume support etc) the upload of images. For the server side, you could process these one at a time (assuming your client is sending them that way)..thus keeping it simple.
