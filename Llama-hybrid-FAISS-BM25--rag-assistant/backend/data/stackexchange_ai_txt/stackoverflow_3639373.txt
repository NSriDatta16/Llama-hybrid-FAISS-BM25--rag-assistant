Drag actions usually involve access to the stage, which belongs to the parent sandbox. You've got a couple of options - one is to simply ignore / catch the error if it doesn't actually impact on functionality in the compiled Air app, which won't stop running necessarily on this kind of error (usually doesn't). The other option is to refactor the functionality so that it doesn't access the stage. This is tough to do though as there seem to be some mouse events that try to get stage coordinates to populate their properties. I see this error a lot and it usually doesn't get in the way.
