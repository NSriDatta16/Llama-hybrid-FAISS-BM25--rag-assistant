I would also like to mention very popular for image recognition convolutional neural networks. Here is a link to simplified explanation of a CNN . Briefly, in CNN image is first split into features, like edges, shapes, collections of shapes. Then these features are 'fed' into a 'regular' fully-connected multi-layer neural network (multi-layer perceptron). In more details, a set of filters are applied to extract features in a form of a feature map. A filter is just a matrix (random in the beginning) that is applied to the original image so that dot product of the original image matrix and filter matrix is calculated and the result is summed up. Filter moves along the original image one pixel (the step) at a time and the matrix of feature map is being filled. A feature map is created for each filter. Then non-linearity introduced with RELU(Rectified Linear Unit) for each pixel in each feature map. Pooling, through application of either max(), sum() or average(), is done after convolution. Finally, features extracted this way look like 'magnified' pieces of the original image. These features are input into a fully connected (all units are connected) neural network and the probabilities for each image (lets say we trained our network on images of cars, trees and boats) are calculated after each feedforward pass through the network. The network is trained, which means that the parameters(weights) and filter matrices are optimized through backpropagation (minimization of misclassification error). When a new image is input into the trained network only feedforward is needed to identify the image (provided that the network is accurate enough, i.e. we trained it with enough examples etc.)
