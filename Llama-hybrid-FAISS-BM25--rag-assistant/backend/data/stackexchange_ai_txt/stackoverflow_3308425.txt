If you're looking to understand UI Automation, I've just started that myself. I wrote this project so that other people could use it or understand themselves too: http://code.google.com/p/wipflash/ Mostly it's based around the Patterns and Properties. You can see how I've used the Patterns here: http://code.google.com/p/wipflash/source/browse/#hg/WiPFlash/Framework/Patterns Hope it helps. (Edit: I also answered a similar question here: WPF, Project White and Infragistics - you're probably looking for the ValuePattern ).
