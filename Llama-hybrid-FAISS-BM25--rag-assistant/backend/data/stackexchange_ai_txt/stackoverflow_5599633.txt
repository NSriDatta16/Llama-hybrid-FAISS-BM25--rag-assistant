Getting the BuildAgent information from a Build

I have a IBuildDetail variable with the build information I need. Okay, but when I check the property BuildAgent it's showing this: build.BuildAgent' threw an exception of type 'System.NotImplementedException Then I tryed to check build.BuildController.Agents, it's nice I found the BuildAgent, but there are 7 build agents in this collection. I need only the build agent related to my build, not all build agents from that controller. Anyone knows how to get that information? (Select a build agent name or machine name using an IBuildDetail variable) -> I'm using TFS2010 api and I need to what is the agent for each build
