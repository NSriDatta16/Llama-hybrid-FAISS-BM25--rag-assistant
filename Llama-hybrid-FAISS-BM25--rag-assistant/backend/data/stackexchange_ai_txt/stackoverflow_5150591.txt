Is it possible to use Python, AJAX & CGI together

I want to have a web page where you click a button, by using AJAX I get a string from a python script, then display that string in a paragraph HTML element. I know I can do this by using Python, WSGI & AJAX (theoretically I can do it this way) but its waaaay too difficult. I am experienced with CGI & python. So can I do the above using CGI? If I can how do the python script work, exactly the same as when serving a page using CGI? This doesn't work: import cgitb; cgitb.enable() import cgi import os print "Content-Type: text/html\n" input_data = cgi.FieldStorage() print "hello" When I click my button in my page, nothing happens & my CGI server (which works fine for cgi page requests) gives me a http 501 error. My html & javascript: abcdef Click it
