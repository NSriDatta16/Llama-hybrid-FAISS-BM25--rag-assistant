Two advices: The first thing you need is Test suites. The second advice is to work in small steps. If you have a strong test suite already then you're in a good position. Otherwise, I would some good high level tests (aka: system tests). The main advantage of high level tests is that a relatively small amount of tests can get you great coverage. They will not help you in pin-pointing a bug, but you won't really need that: if you work in small steps and you make sure to run the tests after each change you'll be able to quickly detect (accidentally introduced) bugs: the root of the bug is in the small portion of the code has changed since the last time you ran the tests.
