Keyword/phrase extraction from Text using Deep Learning libraries

Perhaps this is too broad, but I am looking for references on how to use deep learning in a text summarization task. I have already implemented text summarization using standard word-frequency approaches and sentence-ranking, but I'd like to explore the possibility of using deep learning techniques for this task. I have also gone through some implementations given on wildml.com using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for sentiment analysis; I'd like to know how one could use libraries such as TensorFlow or Theano for text summarization and keyword extraction. Its been about a week since I started experimenting with Neural nets, and I am really excited to see how the performance of these libraries compares to my previous approaches to this problem. I am particularly looking for some interesting papers and github projects related to text summarization using these frameworks. Can anyone provide me with some references?
