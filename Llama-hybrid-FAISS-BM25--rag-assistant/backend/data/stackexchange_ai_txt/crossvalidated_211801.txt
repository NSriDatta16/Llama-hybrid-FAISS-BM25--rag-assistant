You could ask yourself the question 'Why would I expect one of them to be much larger than the others?'. I do not think you are doing anything wrong as far as specifying your model matrix is concerned. I do wonder though whether using linear regression for an outcome which is binary is a good thing. Most people would use logistic regression here.
