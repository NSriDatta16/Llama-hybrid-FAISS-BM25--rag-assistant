Django admin ManyToManyField: improving usability on change_form?

I have Django models as follows: class Subject(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=35, unique=True) class Book(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=400) subject = models.ManyToManyField(Subject, related_name='books', blank=True, verbose_name="Subject") There are many Subjects - around 100. When editing a Book record on the Django admin, it is very difficult to see which subjects are present on a particular book. The Django admin offers a multi-select list, which is great, but to see for a book, you have to scroll through the entire select list. It would be much better if either: I could offer a read-only list of the subjects above the multi-select list, or the multi-select list began with the selected subjects, then had an entry like '----', then continued with the other subjects. Does anyone have any idea how I could implement either of the above in Django, to improve the usability of ManyToManyFields in the Django admin? Thanks!
