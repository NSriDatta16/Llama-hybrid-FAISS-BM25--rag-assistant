What kind of library to use for display of graphical objects and right click context menus

Goal: To develop a web based NMS interface which displays a network topology (e.g., switches, routers, links, endhosts). Each node should be 'movable' (draggable to an appropriate place manually or their best location computed algorithmically). I should be able to zoom into the network graph (say if there are many clusters of nodes and I want to concentrate on a particular cluster of nodes). I should be able to right-click any node or link and get a context menu (e.g., 'show routing table', 'show interfaces', 'show bandwidth utilization graph' etc.). The data for this network topology will be fetched by making calls to an apache based webserver where the backend scripts in python will fetch the appropriate data and send it via JSON to the web client. Question: I am assuming that some sort of javascript library/framework will be most appropriate for this - jQuery, Dojo, Moo etc. [I've never used any of these before]. Which of these would be most recommended for this sort of thing. Which would be easiest to learn (say in a months time).
