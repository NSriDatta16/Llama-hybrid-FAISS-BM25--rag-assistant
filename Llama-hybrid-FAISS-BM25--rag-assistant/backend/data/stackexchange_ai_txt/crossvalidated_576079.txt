Where can I find pre-trained Pathways Language Model (PaLM)?

I am amazed by the possibilities coming from the PaLM model after reading the following post: https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html . I was trying to find the pre-trained PaLM model and fine-tune with my own data. I have only found the implementation of the model architecture in Pytorch ( https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-pytorch ). However I would like to start from pre-trained model to save the computational resources. Do you guys know where should I look or I just have to train it by myself (on my resources it will take ages)?
