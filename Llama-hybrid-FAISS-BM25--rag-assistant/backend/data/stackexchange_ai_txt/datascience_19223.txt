How to choose an appropriate Machine Learning algorithm?

I am currently new in Data Science field especially in ML domain. There are various approaches to a problem ie. Supervised, Unsupervised learning. I want to know what is the approach and how to determine using exactly which algorithms in real life test cases. Even if a particular algorithm is selected, how do we know other algorithm might have better accuracy and precision than this one
