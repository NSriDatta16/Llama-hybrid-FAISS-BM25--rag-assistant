On top of what Remus said, using GUID for clustered indexes is going to lead to tremendous fragmentation of them in most cases, affecting the performance of the queries in terms of IO. This happens when you don't use sequentially generated guids which I suppose is mostly the case when an application generates guid outside of database. To create sequential guid ('bigger' than the previously generated in database) you have to use function newsequentialid() Comparison of cost of two plans in one batch is not accurate in all cases. The cost is estimated amongst others on number of IO operations needed to execute the query. In small databases, difference between INT and GUID will not change IO significantly enough to show the difference in execution plans.
