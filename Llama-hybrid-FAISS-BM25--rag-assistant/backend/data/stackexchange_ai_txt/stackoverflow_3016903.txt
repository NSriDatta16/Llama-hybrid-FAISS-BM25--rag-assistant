Converting json data to an HTML table

I have an array of data in php and I need to display this data in a HTML table. Here is what an example data set looks like. Array( Array ( [comparisonFeatureId] => 1182 [comparisonFeatureType] => Category [comparisonValues] => Array ( [0] => Not Available [1] => Standard [2] => Not Available [3] => Not Available ) [featureDescription] => Rear Seat Heat Ducts ),) The dataset is a comparison of 3 items (shown in the comparisonValues index of the array) In the end I need the row to look similar to this $record['featureDescription'] $record['comparisonValues'][0] $record['comparisonValues'][1] $record['comparisonValues'][2] $record['comparisonValues'][3] The problem I am coming across is how to best do this. Should I create the entire table HTML on the server side pass it over an ajax call and just dump pre-rendered HTML data into a div or pass the json data and render the table client side. Any elegant suggestions?
