iPhone App to generate thumbnail images for the image obtained via camera or photo gallery

My app allows user to obtain picture/image from camera/photo gallery and then the app will upload the images to remote storage. Since the thumbnail images of those images will be used in some scenarios, I need to generate the thumbnail images. The questions are should the thumbnail images be generated by the app at the time when the original/raw image is obtained? is it achievable to upload a raw image and at least 2 of its thumbnail images at the same time from the app to the remote storage - let's say its Amazon S3 or Google App Engine is there any sample code out there that does the image transformation on iPhone?
