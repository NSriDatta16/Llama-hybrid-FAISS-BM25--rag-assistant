We rolled our own at work using RRDtool (the data storage back end to tools like MRTG). We run a perl script every 5 minutes that takes a du per partition and stuffs it into an RRD database and then uses RRD's graph function to build graphs. It takes a while to igure out how to set up the .rrd files (for instance, I had to re-learn RPN to do some of the calculations I wanted to do) but if you have some data you want to graph over time, RRD tool's a good bet.
