Embedding Flash / Flex component into Java app

I'm working on some Flex spike in my company. We are basically evaluating different scenarios etc. What solution would you recommend for embedding Flex components into Java app? Flex Java communication is not (yet...) an issue, just embedding swf into JFrame.
