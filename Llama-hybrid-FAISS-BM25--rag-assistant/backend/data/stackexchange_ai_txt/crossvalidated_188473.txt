Comparing predictors in a logistic regression with different degrees of freedom

I have a logistic regression for which different predictors have different degrees of freedom (for example, a categorical variable with 10 categories and a continuous variable). I would like to compare the different predictors in terms of their "predicting power". I computed and compared their corresponding deviance (using anova function in R). Is their a way to account for the different degrees of freedom of each predictor? Should I divide the explained deviance by the number of degrees of freedom?
