How to predict the second most likely categorical feature?

Suppose I have a dataset $X$ that contains both numerical and categorical features. For concreteness let's assume that one of the categorical features is a sample's color , and that it has been properly preprocessed via one-hot encoding. A property of $X$ is that about half the samples are described by one color, and the other half by two. For instance the data could look like Color A Color B Height (m) Weight (kg) other features Red Blue 0.5 1 ... Green NaN 0.2 1.2 ... Purple Red 0.3 0.5 ... Blue NaN 0.45 0.75 ... I was wondering whether it would be possible to predict the most likely second color for monochromatic samples given the information contained in $X$, and if so what is the best way to frame this question as a statistical/machine learning model? This problem seems related to clustering, although I have a few issues with taking this point of view. If I were to naively cluster the samples in $X$ that have two colors, then nothing guarantees that the clusters would be based on the color feature only. In fact clustering would most likely group samples with different colors together, invalidating my goal from the start. Another point of view would be to treat the monochromatic samples as having missing data. I have heard that Expectation Maximization can be used to replace missing data, but it still does so by clustering data using a mixture model, and I go back to my argument in the previous paragraph. Any guidance on how to approach this problem, if possible, would be greatly appreciated.
