Funny you should ask. I was just reading about the history of the windows beep. The Americans with Disabilities act has forced the Beep API to not change for the last 20 something years. Link For Windows 7, we resolved the issue completely – we moved all the functionality that used to be contained in Beep.Sys into the user mode system sounds agent – now when you call the Beep() API instead of manipulating the 8254 chip the call is re-routed into a user mode agent which actually plays the sounds. So the short answer is: Get Windows 7. A longer answer would be: Don't use the beep api. Get a beep noise and play it like you'd play any other noise.
