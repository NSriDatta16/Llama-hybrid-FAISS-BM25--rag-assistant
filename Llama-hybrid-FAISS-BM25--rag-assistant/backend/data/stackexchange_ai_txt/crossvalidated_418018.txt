Some points not discussed in the answer by @Josef. There might be nothing wrong, but with such a large sample size (107262) and logistic regression (LR) I am skeptical. With LR there is always the possibility of overdispersion , and with large sample size there will often be a substructure to the data/sampling process, some kind of dependence, that might cause overdispersion. Tell us more about your data context, investigate. You have very few model df. Your variables seem to be treated as numerical. Try some more flexible modeling, represent predictors via [regression splines]( Logistic Regression with regression splines in R . Look at the residuals, show us some plots from your residuals analysis . This might be relevant even with a huge sample size: The significance tests you have shown for individual coefficients are Wald tests , which is based on a quadratic approximation to the log likelihood. For LR that might be vary bad! this is known as the Hauck-Donner phenomenon . Compute confidence intervals via profile likelihood (in R the confint function does this, must be possible in Python also.) Maybe not very probable in your case ... but have a look.
