MAGENTO: welcome page and pricing by city

A friend of mine asked me to build a Magento site for him. I've done some standard things before with Magento, but never really undestood how it worked inside. He sells his products across the country with different prices by city. So, he wants: a Welcome screen where the user could pick his city and then show the user the prices defined for that particular city Is this doable? Where can I start reading? Thanks in advance.
