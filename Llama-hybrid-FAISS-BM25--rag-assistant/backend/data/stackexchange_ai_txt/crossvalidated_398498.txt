Simple trend analysis with unbalanced & short panel data

I have the following (unbalanced) panel data: yearly sustainability ratings (ESG) of ca. 2000 individual firms over a 11-year period. The average observations per firm only covers 5.3 periods. These firms can be grouped into 3 categories (i.e. 1=financial services, 2=industrial products, 3=oil and gas). I now want to investigate the differences in ESG ratings across these categories. In particular, I want to: determine if a trend exists (regarding these ratings) over my observation period for each of the three individual categories (i.e. no trend/positive/negative) compare the trends determined in 1) across the 3 categories (i.e. statistically show if categories show similar trends and if not, how they differ) As for now, I fitted a fixed-effects linear regression model for the panel data (depvar: ESG rating, indepvar: year), without yet accounting for the different categories: . xtreg esgscore year, fe Fixed-effects (within) regression Number of obs = 10,467 Group variable: firmid Number of groups = 1,964 R-sq: Obs per group: within = 0.2498 min = 1 between = 0.0002 avg = 5.3 overall = 0.0370 max = 11 F(1,8502) = 2831.28 corr(u_i, Xb) = -0.1414 Prob > F = 0.0000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ esgfundy | Coef.

I assume that a panel unit root test isn't really suitable for the same reason. What do you think? Am I missing other options? For 2), I suggest checking for differences in the slopes of the regression lines from 1). Is this sufficient to determine statistically significant differences across the respective trends? Please bear in mind that determining the change over time and the comparison across these 3 categories are my only objectives. Thank you!
