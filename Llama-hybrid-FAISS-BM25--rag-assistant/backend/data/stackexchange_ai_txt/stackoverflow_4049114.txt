You should read this paragraph : As an example of an unbounded wildcard, List indicates a list which has an unknown object type. Methods which take such a list as an argument can take any type of list, regardless of parameter type. Reading from the list will return objects of type Object , and writing non-null elements to the list is not allowed, since the parameter type is not known.
