Two collections should be considered equal if they contain the same elements, and further if the collections are ordered, that the elements are in the same order. On the subject of hashes for collections, it should be enough to combine the hashes of the elements in some way (XOR them or modulo add them). Note that while the rules state that two objects that are equal according to IsEqual need to return the same hash, the opposite does not hold : Although uniqueness of hashes is desireable, it is not necessary for correctness of the solution. Thus an ordered collection need not take account of the order of the elements. The excerpt from the Apple documentation is a necessary restriction by the way. An object could not maintain the same hash value under mutation while also ensuring that objects with the same value have the same hash. That applies for the simplest of objects as well as collections. Of course it only usually matters that an object's hash changes when it is inside a container that uses the hash to organise it's elements. The upshot of all this is that mutable collections shouldn't mutate when placed inside another container, but then neither should any object that has a true hash function.
