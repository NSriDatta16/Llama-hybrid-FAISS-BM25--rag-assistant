You are using the default SVC() which means that you are training a Soft-Margin SVM. Based on the plot, my guess would be that the default value for the parameter C=1.0 is not a good for your data. I would try different values of C, e.g. [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0, 10000.0, 100000.0] and see how this affects the train and cross-validation errors. It seems like your data is not really linearly separable and you should allow more freedom for misclassification during training. SVM has a unique solution for a fixed value of C and it looks like that the solution for the default value of C is not so good.
