Reinforcement learning, pendulum python

I'm having trouble finding a good reward function for the pendulum problem, the function I'm using: $-x^2 - 0.25*(\text{xdot}^2)$ which is the quadratic error from the top. with $x$ representing the current location of the pendulum and $\text{xdot}$ the angular velocity. It takes a lot of time with this function and sometimes doesn't work. Any one have some other suggestions? I've been looking in google but didn't find anything i could use
