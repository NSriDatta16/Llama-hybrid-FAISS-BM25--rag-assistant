Spell Checker for Search in ASP.NET

I am building a search where I need to implement couple of features in it among others. 1- It should bring all synonyms, like if someone searches for couch, it should bring in matching results for that couch plus linguistic matches like (sofas, cushions etc). To accomplish that I am using Full Text Search. In my query I use FreeText but it does not yield the required results. That's what I do, select * from Furn_Products Where FreeText(FurnName, 'Couch'); It should bring Names containing Cushions, Sofa and Couch off course but it only brings Names with Couch which I could also do by simple Like query. Any solutions? 2- I need to check for typos, like if someone types soofa , it should bring in results for sofa, couch etc. Any tips, ideas on how to achieve this? Thanks in advance.
