If I understand your problem correctly, you have an existing technique for dividing songs, etc., into clusters and now want to select a "best" example of the contents of that cluster based on whatever the defining characteristics are. I would take a look at Bayesian classifiers . These could help with inferring the key defining characteristics of any given cluster in your data (assuming that clustering was not based on an explicit, well-defined taxonomy) as well as provide some tolerance for noise and error in the metadata or other parameters. Then depending on the nature of your data and clusters, you could perhaps use maximum likelihood or sampling methods to determine one or more most representative examples from a given cluster. Bayesian methods can also be useful for inferring missing data, e.g., missing metadata values. The sample distribution can be used to generate likely values for the missing data based on the known values in other data fields.
