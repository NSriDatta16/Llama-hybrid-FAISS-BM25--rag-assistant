There are two things to argue here: The facts that a glm attempts the predict $y$ as the mean of a conditional distribution, and estimates its parameters $\beta$ by maximum likelihood are consistent. Estimating the parameters by maximum likelihood is not determining the mode of any distribution. At least not in the classical formulation of a glm. Lets take the simplest non-trivial glm as a working example, the logistic model. In logistic regression we have a response $y$ which is 0, 1 valued. We postulate that $y$ is bernoulli distributed conditional on our data $$ y \mid X \sim Bernoulli(p(X)) $$ And we attempt to estimate the mean of this conditional distribution (which in this case is just $p$) by linking it to a linear function of $X$ $$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = X \beta $$ Pausing and reflecting, we see in this case that it is natural to want to know $p$, which is a mean of a conditional distribution. In the glm setup, $p$ is not estimated directly, it is $\beta$ that the estimation procedure targets. To get at $\beta$ we use maximum likelihood. The probability of observing a datapoint $y$ from the conditional bernoulli distribution, given the value of $X$ observed, and a specific set of parameters $\beta$ ,is $$ P \left( y \mid X, \beta \right) = p^y (1-p)^{1-y} $$ where $p$ is a function of $\beta$ and $X$ through the linking relationship. Notice that it is $y$ that is sampled from a probability distribution here, not beta. To apply maximum likelihood, we flip this around into a function of $\beta$, considering both $X$ and $y$ as fixed and observed: $$ L(\beta) = p^y (1-p)^{1-y} $$ But, $L$ is not a density function , it is a likelihood. When you maximize the likelihood you are not estimating the mode of a distribution because there simply is no distribution to, well, mode-ize. You can produce a density from $L$ by providing a prior distribution on the parameters $\beta$ and using Bayes's rule, but in the classical glm formulation, this is not done.
