Don't get too hung up on the “relational versus non-relational” comparison. It appears to be irrelevant for this issue. The line your application has crossed is a different one: from a small database on local fast file storage, to a large database accessed over the network . Crossing that line means you are now better served by a dedicated, network serviced, database management system. Whether the management server manages relational databases isn't relevant for that aspect. For getting it up and running quickly, MariaDB (the successor to MySQL) is probably your best bet. If you foresee it growing much beyond where it is now, you might as well put it in PostgreSQL since that's where it will need to go eventually anyway :-)
