Using confusion matrix to improve my SVM

I ran an SVM classifier on the CIFAR_10 classification workbench. I got about 2/3 accuracy (which I think is Ok, but I want to improve...) Here is my confusion matrix: [[719 12 70 26 37 12 14 6 72 32] [ 14 783 13 21 11 8 20 5 40 85] [ 69 15 551 92 97 58 58 27 19 14] [ 27 14 87 502 89 148 57 33 9 34] [ 29 11 95 82 590 56 48 57 17 15] [ 14 8 91 185 57 531 45 45 9 15] [ 21 25 48 76 37 39 715 13 11 15] [ 12 8 41 62 79 53 11 701 8 25] [ 72 56 22 25 17 7 11 6 759 25] [ 44 83 16 30 19 20 11 26 29 722]] I noted that the 4th and 6th classes ( counting from index 1 ) have much in common, meaning the error rate between those two is high ( (148,185) images wrongly classified). I also noted the 3rd to 6th classes are classified in a less precise way than the others. My SVM (polynomial kernel) was trained on 50K images using SIFT descriptors, and was tested on 10K. My question is - how can I use the facts I stated to improve the classifier? I want to somehow use the confusion matrix to train it again, with more attention to the differences between those (3rd to 6th) classes. I have no objections to using other classifiers, but as an improvement to existing results, not a replacement. So, can I re-fit the classifier with specific data that suits my needs?
