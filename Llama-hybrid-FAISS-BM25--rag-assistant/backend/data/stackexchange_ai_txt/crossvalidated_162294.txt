Multiple logistic regression power analysis

I have a logistic regression model and output an $R^2$ value. I then go and add another predictor variable to fit a second model. I can output a new $R^2$ value associated with the second model. When I run an ANOVA test, I see no significant improvement in the second model, but I want to assess the power associated with including the additional variable in model 2. I have found an example for linear regression that uses an $F$-Test. I want to do something similar for a logistic regression using G*Power. But there appears to be very little documentation on multiple logistic regression models like my situation. I don't know how to do a more detailed power analysis for multiple logistic regression . From what I understand, in G*Power I set Test Family == z tests and statistical test == logisitic regression . But I am not sure what to set RÂ² other X equal to. Is that the improvement in $R^2$? Reading the tutorial in 27.4 from the software manual makes no variation of $R^2$, whereas this example , does not discuss the improvements made from $R^2$.
