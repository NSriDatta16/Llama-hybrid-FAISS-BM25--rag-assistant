So it turns out one of my executables which was using SomeOtherClass did not have the Boost libraries in its include list. I would have realised this earlier if I paid more attention to the output logs. 3>c:.. ClassUsingDynamicBitset.h(2) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'boost/dynamic_bitset/dynamic_bitset.hpp': No such file or directory 3>SomeClassInExecutableProjectWhichDidntPreviouslyRequireBoostHeaders.cpp 2>Build log was saved at "file://c:...\BuildLog.htm" 2>some_library_already_including_boost_libraries - 0 error(s), 1 warning(s) Effectively I failed to realise that VS was concurrently building my libraries/executables as I played with the headers; and it was in fact an executable which previously knew nothing about the class which included the Boost library where the problem lay. As soon as I extended the aforementioned class to implement the Callback interface I introduced a dependency back down to the Boost library; and I failed to ensure each of my projects using said class were including all required headers.
