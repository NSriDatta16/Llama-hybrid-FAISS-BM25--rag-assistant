Bayesian DHARMA Residuals I recommend reading through this specific section in the DHARMA package vignette to understand why it is saying this, along with the supplementary vignette they mention: The package creator has some code below that section for modeling with Bayesian data, which I've slightly modified to label what's going on and to include a random seed for reproducibility: #### Load DHARMa Library and Set Random Seed #### library(DHARMa) set.seed(123) #### Create Test Data and Fit to GLM #### testData You can see the residuals plotted below: For your specific case, I think you just have to include your model into the createDHARMa function and then this will use your residuals in the way you prescribe, rather than using the simulateResiduals function typically used. Binned Residual Plot As for the binned residual plot, notice this section in the same vignette: One reason why GL(M)Ms residuals are harder to interpret is that the expected distribution of the data (aka predictive distribution) changes with the fitted values. Reweighting with the expected dispersion, as done in Pearson residuals, or using deviance residuals, helps to some extent, but it does not lead to visually homogenous residuals, even if the model is correctly specified. As a result, standard residual plots, when interpreted in the same way as for linear models, seem to show all kind of problems, such as non-normality, heteroscedasticity, even if the model is correctly specified. Questions on the R mailing lists and forums show that practitioners are regularly confused about whether such patterns in GL(M)M residuals are a problem or not. Basically your standard residual plots can be severely inaccurate, and I know from personal experience this is the case.
