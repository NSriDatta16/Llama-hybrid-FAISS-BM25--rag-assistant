Changing Windows Vista/7's Transparency Color

Ok, so I've heard that the color Microsoft decided to use for there Transparency is Black. Which would explain why black text is invisible when drawn/placed onto a Glass surface. Wouldn't it just make sense for us to change the transparency color (black) BACK to Magenta? Why didn't they do this again? Is it even possible to change this color?
