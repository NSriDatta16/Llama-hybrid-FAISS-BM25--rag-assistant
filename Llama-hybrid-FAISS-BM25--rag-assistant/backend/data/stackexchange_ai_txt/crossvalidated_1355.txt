How could I predict the results of a simple card game?

I want to predict the results of a simple card game, to judge on average, how long a game will last. My 'simple' game is; Cards are dealt from a randomised deck to n players (typically 2-4) Each player gets five cards The top card from the deck is turned over Each player takes it in turns to either place a card of the same face value (i.e 1-10, J, Q, K, A), the same suit (i.e Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs) or any suit of magic card (a jack) If the player can place a card they do, otherwise they must take a card from the deck Play continues in turn until all but one player has no cards left I'm guessing that I could write code to play a mythical game and report the result, then run that code thousands of times. Has anyone done this ? Can they suggest code that does a similar job (my favoured language is R, but anything would do) ? Is there a better way ?
