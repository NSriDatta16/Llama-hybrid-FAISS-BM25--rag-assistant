This sounds like a problem for a machine learning algorithm. Therefore, I would try to figure out a set of features which describe a certain aspect of the trend and train on that. The whole machine learning theory is a bit to complex for this answer-box, but it would be useful for you to read into it. But honestly, I think that already exists out there. Where money can be made, people put their mind in it.
