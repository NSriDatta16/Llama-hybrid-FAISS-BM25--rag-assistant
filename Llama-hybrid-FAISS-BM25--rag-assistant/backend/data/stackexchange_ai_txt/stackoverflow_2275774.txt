You should rebuild indexes often enough so that production is not detrimentally affected by index degradation. I understand that this seems vague, but all databases are different and are used in different ways. You only need to regularly rebuild/defrag indexes that incur write operations (inserts/updates) â€“ your static or mostly read only tables will not need much reindexing. You will need to use dbcc showcontig([Table]) to check the fragmentation level of your indexes, determine how often they become fragmented and as to what level the fragmentation actually is. Use dbcc dbreindex([Table]) to totally rebuild the indexes when they become too fragmented (above 20%-30% or so) but if you cannot find a large enough downtime window and the fragmentation level is relatively low (1%-25%), you should use dbcc indexdefrag([Database], [Table], [Index]) to defrag the index in an "online" fassion. Also keep in mind, that you can stop the index defrag operation and start it again at a later time without losing any work. Keeping a database and its indexes "in tune" takes a bit of monitoring to really get a feel for when and what to reindex.
