It does make it harder to perform CI as the source control system is encouraging you NOT to integrate continuously. However, there is absolutely nothing that prevents you from doing that regular integration into the central repository. The team just needs to remain disciplined about that. Where smaller teams fork the project and do their own thing for a while, you should do continuous integration builds against that fork as well and potentially set up a regular integration between the two forks. This would be similar to the stream based multi-stage continuous integration strategies that Accurev pushes: http://www.accurev.com/multistage-continuous-integration.html
