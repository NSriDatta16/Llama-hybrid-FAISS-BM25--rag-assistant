Sql reporting Services - Programmatically setting a datasource?

I've got a bunch of reports deployed as RDL's to a SSRS. Because of high security requirements, the db passwords change very frequently. It's become a huge task to keep up with the changes and having to modify dozens upon dozens of reports. This leads to my question... Is it possible to programmatically set a data source or a connection string for a deployed report? Could this be done using an app that modifies something in the report itself as it sits on the server? Could this be done by modifying a shared data source from an app as the DS sits on the server? Could it be done by embedding a script inside the report itself which retrieves the connection from say a web service? Thanks
