Cosine vs Manhattan for Text Similarity

I'm storing sentences in Elasticsearch as dense_vector field and used BERT for the embedding so each vector is 768 dim . Elasticsearch gives similarity function options like Euclidean, Manhattan and cosine similarity . I have tried them and both Manhattan and cosine gives me very similar and good results and now i don't know which one should i choose ?
