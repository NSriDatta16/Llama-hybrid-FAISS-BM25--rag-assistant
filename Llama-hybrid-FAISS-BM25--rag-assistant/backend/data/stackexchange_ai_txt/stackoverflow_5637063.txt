How to get Android resource ID from dynamically-created (in Java) layer-list / LayerDrawable?

The "solution #2 (dynamic)" in this question/answer post: overlay two images in android to set an imageview is very close to what I want to do, which is to dynamically create a layer-list (for a status bar notification icon, I want to build-up my icon in layers), but the icon assignment in the notification API requires a resource ID (which I want to call from a service). I cannot figure-out how to build a dynamically build a layer-list without building hundreds of layer-list .xml files (for the various combinations of icons that I would like to be able to display). Daniel's "solution #1" works wonderfully for the static .xml files, but I'm looking for a more elegant, dynamic solution. In the above post, the code snippet: Resources r = getResources(); Drawable[] layers = new Drawable[2]; layers[0] = r.getDrawable(R.drawable.t); layers[1] = r.getDrawable(R.drawable.tt); LayerDrawable layerDrawable = new LayerDrawable(layers); appears to be what I want, but I don't know or understand how to "assign" the new layerDrawable to my notification icon (which takes a resource ID). Thanks to all...stackoverflow is a wonderful resource!
