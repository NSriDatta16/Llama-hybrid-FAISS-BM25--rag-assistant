how to drag UIImageView under UIScrollView?

I have a UIImageView (imageView) being the subView of the UIScrollView (scrollView). The scrollView is set only for pinching the showed image from imageView. And I have a small UIImageView (iconView) which is the subView of imageView. So the relationship is like: UIView |_____ UIScrollView ( scrollView ) |_____ UIImageView (imageView) |______ UIImageView(iconView) . I need to touch and move the iconView but I am confused with this two methods I found. Can I simply use the "hitTest:withEvent:" method to work this out and how to use hitTest ? Or Should I override "UITouchesBegan:withEvent:" "UITouchesMoved:withEvent:" "UITouchesEnd:withEvent:" ? and how to use it?
