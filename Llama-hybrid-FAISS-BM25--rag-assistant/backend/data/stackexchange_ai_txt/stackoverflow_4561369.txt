Some general comments. The first is around the IV. In general, you want the IV to be random. By restricting it to (displayable) ASCII, you're somewhat limiting the possible values. In general, you'd be better off by a) using the GenerateIV() method, and b) prepending the IV value to the ciphertext, so that c) you don't need to pass it as a parameter to either function. The second comment is that, in general, you need to plan for future changes to your crypto needs. It would be better to embed some versioning or parameter information alongside the ciphertext, and avoid embedding specific crypto settings in your code. If, at a later date, you decide to double the number of iterations for the password, for instance, you might still want to decrypt values that were encrypted using the older settings (or warn the user that the value is no longer accessible). You can also push a lot of decisions into your config files. For instance, you can create a name for your crypto provider (e.g. MyAppSymmetricCrypto) that maps to RijndaelManaged today, but at a later date, could be changed to whatever is then appropriate.
