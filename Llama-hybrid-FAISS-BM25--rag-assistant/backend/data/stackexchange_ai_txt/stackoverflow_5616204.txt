Good repository organization practice for Java properties files

I maintain a multi-platform development framework that attempts to configure environment variables based on certain system and environment information that is inferred via various means. Once I infer these variables, I store them in a Java properties file for later use. This file could also be edited by the user of my framework (a developer). I have a class called Env that manages this properties file, and it's in a package called org.myproject.config . I'm currently storing the default properties file in src/org/myproject/config . I'm wondering, is it good practice to store a config-type file under this directory of my project? Not sure where to go with this. Any input is appreciated. -tjw
