Can a Parameterized Hudson Build Override the svn revision?

I'd like to setup the ability to rebuild from a specific revision. The default would be HEAD and a user could rebuild an old build (that had been removed). I'd still like to leverage all of hudson's reporting regarding SVN etc. Is there a good way to do this?
