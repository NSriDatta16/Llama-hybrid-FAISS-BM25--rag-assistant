Point anomalies vs collective anomalies in time series

The Anomaly Detection survey by Chandola et al categorizes anomalies into point anomalies and collective anomalies. Do we need this type of categorization in anomaly detection in time series, though? Can't I always map time series data point of a time range into a single data point (e.g., a representative vector), and then apply a point-anomaly detector? Do we know if there's any effective anomaly detection algorithm that can't be equivalent to the aforementioned method, namely applying a point-anomaly detector to representation (as a single data point) of individual range of a time series? Thanks,
