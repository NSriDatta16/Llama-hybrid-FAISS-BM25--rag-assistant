A few remarks on your framework. Do you want to predict the scores (1) or do you want to evaluate to what extent each input variable (independent variables) contributes to estimate the score (2)? Please clarify. (1) Prediction: Random Forests and Neural Networks may help you to predict scores (please keep in mind every statistical model which is used for estimation (2) can also be used for predictions) (2) Estimation/Variable Selection: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), LASSO/Ridge Regression (performs variable selection), Multiple Linear Regression (p-Values of your estimates are not necessarily a good indicator for variable selection)
