jQuery and Processing inside the same Canvas element?

Is it possible to use both jQuery and Processing inside the same canvas element? It's easy enough to combine the two on the same page, but I am wondering if it's possible to place - for example - some jQuery UI draggable boxes in a canvas rendering some Processing code.
