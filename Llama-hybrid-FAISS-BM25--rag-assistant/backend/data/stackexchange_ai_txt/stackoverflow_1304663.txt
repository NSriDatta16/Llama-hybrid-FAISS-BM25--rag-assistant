I've done some Googling to find better information (with no success) but I can remember mention of something referred to as the "Manufacturers Section" of a hard drive, an area which is outside that of normal storage to which it's possible to write information that won't be lost if the drive is re-formatted. The specific product I'm remembering was AutoCAD. The fact that you are asking for something that is "difficult to be removed" leads me to believe that you are looking for something like this? It's unlikely that the use of this sort of technology would make you very popular with your customers, particularly with the bad feeling directed towards DRM, rootkits and the like.
