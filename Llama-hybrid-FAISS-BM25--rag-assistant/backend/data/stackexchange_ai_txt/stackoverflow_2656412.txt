Is there an easy way to sign a C++ CLI assembly in VS 2010?

Right now I am setting the Linker/Advanced/KeyFile option. I am getting the "mt.exe : general warning 810100b3: is a strong-name signed assembly and embedding a manifest invalidates the signature. You will need to re-sign this file to make it a valid assembly." . Reading from the web, it sounds like I have to set the delay signing option, download the SDK, and run sn.exe as a post build event. Surely there must be an easier way to do this common operation in VS2010?
