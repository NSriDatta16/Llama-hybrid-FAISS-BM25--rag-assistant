Depends entirely on your users platform. Mobile These are estimates, surprisingly difficult to find good comparison charts. Normal phone networks, anywhere from 5-20kbps Edge is pretty slow at around 40kbps as far as I can tell 3G will download max at around 80kbps 4g will be incredibly fast and is the future, but not out yet It is important though to realise that mobile users have a higher tolerance for slow loads. So a 3 second wait for a mobile page shouldn't put many people off. Broadband Depending on your visitors location, can have varying speeds. http://www.speedtest.net/global.php#0 Africa has average of 1.93mbps, South America 3mbps and the rest of the world is > 6mbps. These (as far as I can tell are averages). So if your visitor base is biased towards the Africas or South America, you should try to aim for a lighter page design. The rest of the world it becomes less of an issue. As broadband speeds improve world wide, page sizes will become largely irrelevant. But that day is not here yet! The Importance of Speed I studied a bit on online responsiveness, and can't find resources at the moment to back this up, but Google as far as I know did some research and found users were sensitive to page delays of just 30ms, meaning they would have a favourable bias towards two equal content pages where one loaded >=30ms faster. So speed can help get a leg up on competition! And the human brain is a lot more sensitive to speed than we might assume. Remember though, different platform users have different tolerance levels. Recommendation The faster the better! A well designed, CSS driven layout will naturally be small and have a lot of other benefits down the line (SEO). If your page is loading slowly, find the bottleneck (server or filesizes) and aim to reduce so that the page load is natural and speedy on your audiences target platforms.
