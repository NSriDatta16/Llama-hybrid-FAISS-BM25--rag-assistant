Rephrase Neural Network : Find the Fittest Word for Given Meaning/Explanation

I am a sophomore student who's interested in deep learning and its method layering up some linear/non-linear operations and constructs up the complex function through the network. I'd like to comprise a network that finds the word upon the given explanations : e.g.1 input: a spherically shaped fruit which tastes sour and sweet and gets red when matured well output: apple e.g.2, input: to make up the boundary between multiple options for the base of one's behavior or decision output: determine. So basically it's a classification problem but the class might be more than 20,000. I'd like to name this task "rephrase neural network". Any good reference or starting point, or, any network recommendation for comprising this neural network?
