How can one define the power of a randomized clinical trial?

The statistical power of a study is a measure of the ability of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to detect a difference statistically significant of the treatment effect in the treatment arms. How can one define the power of RCT? For the logistic regression (i.e. with a binary outcome), the treatment effects were usually reported in terms of Odds Ratio (OR). logit(p) = log(OR) = log (p/(1-p)) where p is the probability of presence of the characteristic of interest. Is there a mathematical relationship between the power of a RCT and OR? And how to interpret or understand this sentence: "80% power to detect a treatment vs. control OR of 0.8"?
