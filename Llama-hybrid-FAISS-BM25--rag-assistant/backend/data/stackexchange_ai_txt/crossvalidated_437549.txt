Calculating sample variance as squared deviation divided by n + 1 (instead of n - 1) will lead to underestimating variance, which will lead to confidence intervals with lower than expected probability coverage. That's probably at least part of the reason that an unbiased estimator of variance is preferred over minimizing MSE.
