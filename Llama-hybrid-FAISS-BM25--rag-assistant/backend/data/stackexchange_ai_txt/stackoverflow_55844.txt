You can certainly make it difficult. What about building a user profile with such things as ip address, browser useragent, machine name, and whatever other information you can get. Store the profile for each user, then if you receive a profile which is similar enough to one already in the database (you'll have to tweak that) you can throw out that vote. I imagine you can probably build a better profile using silverlight, though I'm not sure what information that gives you access to.
