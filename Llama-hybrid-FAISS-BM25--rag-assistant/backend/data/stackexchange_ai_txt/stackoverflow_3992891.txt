OAuth is a standard used for Web applications, its text is liberally littered with the word 'agent', meaning a browser. The best solution IMHO is, if possible, to actually have a callback URL, meaning you have your own site which provides the service to back your application functionality. There are services that make this possible for third parties already, like JanRain . If these options are not feasible (meaning you cannot provide a true WWW site for the callback URL) not feasible, then your only option is indeed the out-of-band authentication, oob. Don't even think about having the OAuth authentication call back the app listening on some port, that is completely unreliable for 1) the vast majority of apps will sit behind some sort of NAT device (router, outbound proxy) which makes them unreachable from the OAuth prvider and 2) the OS firewall will block your incoming calls.
