Irregular time series classification

I'm trying to classify about 5000 time series for patient admissions into two groups. which consists of large time gaps on nothing (months or years) followed by a short period of a significant number of data points, an admission. Each data point consists of a code (out of 6000 codes) or a code and a numerical value. Not every time series contains every code, and the codes are quite sparse. I've tried to look at the distribution of values in each code, but got nothing. I've tried a naive Baysian approach of looking at the probabilities of codes in each set, after ignoring any values associated, and did a little better. I'm now out of ideas. I looked at RNNs, but thought the long gaps in data would affect their performance. I looked at GLM's but the missing data and high dimensionality worried me. If anyone could suggest a technique that might offer some traction, I would be very grateful.
