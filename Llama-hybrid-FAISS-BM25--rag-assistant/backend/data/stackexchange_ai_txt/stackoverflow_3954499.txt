From Kernighan & Ritchie : static is a storage class specifier. Other storage class specifiers are: auto, register, extern & typedef. The static specifier gives the declared objects static storage class. The static declaration, applied to an external variable or function, limits the scope of that object to the rest of the source file being compiled. Static objects may be local to a block or external to all blocks, but in either case retain their values across exit from and reentry to functions and blocks. Whereas, const is a type qualifier. The other type qualifier is volatile. The purpose of const is to announce objects that may be placed in read-only memory, and perhaps to increase opportunities for optimization. I suppose one can infer that both these keywords serve distinct purposes; that of const variables being in text/code segment is quite clear from its purpose.
