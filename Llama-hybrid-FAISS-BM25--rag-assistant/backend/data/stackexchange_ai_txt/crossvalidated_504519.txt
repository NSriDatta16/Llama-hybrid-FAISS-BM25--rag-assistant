What's the likelihood that the 50 "dead voters" CNN selected were all incorrect by chance?

After the recent American election, a list of 14,000 "dead voters" went viral online. When CNN picked 50 of these voters at random , they found that: Of the 50, 37 were indeed dead and had not voted, according to the voter information database. Five people out of the 50 had voted -- and they are all still alive, according to public records accessed by CNN. The remaining eight are also alive but didn't vote. There are two possible conclusions here (one intuitively more likely than the other). The first is that all 50 of the CNN random picks were chance mistakes (the null hypothesis), the second is that the list was wrong. How would I go about calculating the likelihood that the list was wrong? How do I attach a p-value to this outcome?
