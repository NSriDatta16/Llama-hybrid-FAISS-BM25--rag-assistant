Interpretation of interaction coefficients and p-values with categorical predictors

Let's say that we have gene expression measurements from bacteria after heatshock. The expression changes are collected as log2 changes, and are approximately normal and centered around 0. Ribosomal genes decrease strongly in response to heatshock. Conserved genes also decrease in response to heatshock, but this gene group overlaps a lot with the ribosomal gene group. My advisor asks: Do conserved genes decrease on their own or only because they include ribosomal genes? What is the statistical significance of the effect on ribosomal genes? On conserved genes? The overarching goal is to know which attribute (ribosome or conserved) is most correlated with gene expression changes after heat shock. My first thought is that people generally use a two-way ANOVA to measure these effects. However, the data, like most biological data in my experience, doesn't meet the assumptions of ANOVA -- specifically both unequal variance between groups and extremely different group sizes. Let's say that in case A, the effect is only from the ribosome genes and conserved genes have no effect. In case B, conserved genes also have an effect. In both cases, 150/200 ribosome genes are also in the class of conserved genes. Here is some example synthetic data / test case in Python: import numpy as np import pandas as pd seed = 0 rand = np.random.RandomState(seed) # 4000 background genes, 200 ribosome genes, 200 conserved genes n_bg, n_ribo, n_cons = (4000, 200, 200) # Create random normal distribution for each group of genes y = rand.normal(0, 3, n_bg) # Ribosome genes mean change = -4 and group has less variance than other genes y_ribo = rand.normal(-4, 1, n_ribo) # Conserved genes either do not change (case A) or also decrease (case B) y_cons_A = rand.normal(0, 2, n_cons) y_cons_B = rand.normal(-2, 2, n_cons) # 150 of the ribosome genes are also conserved num_ol = 150 # Case A: conserved, non-ribo genes don't change df_A = pd.DataFrame(pd.concat([pd.Series(y), pd.Series(y_ribo), pd.Series(y_cons_A)]), columns=['log_change']) # Case B: conserved, non-ribo genes also change df_B = pd.DataFrame(pd.concat([pd.Series(y), pd.Series(y_ribo), pd.Series(y_cons_B)]), columns=['log_change']) dfs = {'A':df_A, 'B':df_B} for case in dfs: dfs[case]['ribosome'] = [0]*n_bg + [1]*n_ribo + [0]*n_cons dfs[case]['conserved'] = [0]*(n_bg+n_ribo-num_ol) + [1]*(num_ol+n_cons) Here is what the data looks like plotted: And here are the results of running OLS regression to model the change in expression either with or without interactions: We can see right away that adding the interaction term was important in the case B, where both conserved and ribosome groups had their own effects and the interaction term was significant. Addition of the interaction term caused the ribosome coefficient to approach its true value (-4). The two things I am confused about: I do not really understand the interaction coefficient for case B +interaction (1.68). If you think about the effect of conserved on ribosome, then it could be positive because conserved has less extreme changes on average than ribosome (-2 vs. -4). But if you think about the effect of ribosome on conserved, then it should be negative, because ribosome has more extreme changes on average than conserved (-4 vs. -2). So what is this positive interaction coefficient telling us? Is it acceptable to use the more negative interaction coefficient for ribosome vs. conserved in model B +interaction to conclude that ribosome has a larger effect than conserved? They both have very significant p-values. If not, what is the alternative? This type of problem is really common in exploratory data analysis of biological data, but somehow I am having trouble figuring out what the interpretation is and what statistics are appropriate to report. I am happy to hear suggestions for alternative methods and please feel free to write your response in R.
