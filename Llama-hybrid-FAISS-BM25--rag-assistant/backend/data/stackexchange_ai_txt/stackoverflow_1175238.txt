I use Dojo's package management ( dojo.require and dojo.provide ) and class system ( dojo.declare which also allows for simple multiple inheritance) to modularize all of my classes/widgets into separate files. Not only dose this keep your code organized, but it also lets you do lazy/just in time loading of classes/widgets.
