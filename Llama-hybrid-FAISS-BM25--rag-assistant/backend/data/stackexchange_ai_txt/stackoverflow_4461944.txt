It looks to me like your 3 tiers are the same as View, Controller Model. If your php is mainly making calls to your #2 layer, then I would think itself doesn't need to be MVC unless you have a very complicated presentation layer that itself should be organized into MVC, for instance if you have complicated navigation or user authentication logic.
