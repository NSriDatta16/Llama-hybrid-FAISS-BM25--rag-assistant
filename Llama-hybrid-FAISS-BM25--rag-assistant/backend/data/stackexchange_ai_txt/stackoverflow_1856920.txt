It's a clever idea. The only problem I see is how to distinguish between SQL and passed-in variables. Unless you make an assumption that every second arg is a variable. I just think that assumption is fragile, and obfuscates things more than makes them clear. Better way would probably be to use interpolation: query("SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE id = #{id}", array("id" => "23")); Then write logic to interpolate these.
