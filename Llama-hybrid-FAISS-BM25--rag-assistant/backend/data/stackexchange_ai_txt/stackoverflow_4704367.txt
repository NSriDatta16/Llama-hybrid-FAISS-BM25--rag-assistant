Interesting question; my first two stabs at this were wrong (as seen in the comments below). I'm assuming you don't want to concat the elements together, but instead want to create a proper table. If concat works for you, by all means use the other solution here as it's far more simple and elegant. "; for($i = 0; $i ".$row['someRecord']." "; } echo " "; } ?>
