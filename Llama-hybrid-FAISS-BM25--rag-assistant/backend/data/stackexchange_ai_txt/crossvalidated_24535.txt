How to bound the output of a regression model?

Suppose I have a data set, and have trained up a regression model (happens to be a bayesian linear model, I'm just using the R package). The model outputs a wide range of values, greater than 0 and less than 0, although the actual output can only be greater than 0. Is there an accepted away to apply bounds to the output of a model to "force" it into a possible value? Or is it perhaps an indicator that I'm doing something wrong or applying the wrong technique to my problem?
