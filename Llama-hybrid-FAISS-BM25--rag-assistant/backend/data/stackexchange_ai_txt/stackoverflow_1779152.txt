Making hand-constructed calls to facebook endpoints is tricky. Sometimes they need you to pass cookies that are in the facebook.com domain (impossible if you are an iframe web app), and they have other requirements like the one you hit, which I have also encountered. The "incompatible web browser" error is because you are not passing a user-agent header that Facebook recognizes as a legitimate web browser that a real person might be using, as opposed to a bot or some other automated process. Try passing a real web browser user agent, such as Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0) That should get you past this particular error
