JRE "is" the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) behind the curtains... From Wikipedia : Advantage: An applet can work on "all" installed versions of Java at the same time, rather than just the latest plug-in version only. However, if an applet requires a later version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) the client will be forced to wait during the large download. Disadvantage: Some applets require a specific JRE. This is discouraged.
