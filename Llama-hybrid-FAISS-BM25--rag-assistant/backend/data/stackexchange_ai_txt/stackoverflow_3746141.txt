This isn't really a question that can be completely answered on an Internet forum. First, it's a given that pretty much any web site can be built with either; secondly, building most websites with ASP.NET is also mostly a known quantity - ASP.NET is generally linear, in that developing any feature with it is simple function of developer time. So the real question is SharePoint - and would you save developer time by leveraging it's power, or spend more time working around it? Only an architect in your organization can fully answer this by: Understanding the requirements; Turning those requirements into questions; Standing up a test instance of SharePoint and spend some proof-of-concept time answering the questions. SharePoint does indeed offer great capabilities that would take hundreds or thounsands of developer hours to deliver from scratch, and it can be enriched with very small amounts of custom development - if you can align your requirements to its featureset. If not, you'll spend 3.5 years and 25,000 developer hours bending it to your needs (not that I have any experience doing such a thing :D)
