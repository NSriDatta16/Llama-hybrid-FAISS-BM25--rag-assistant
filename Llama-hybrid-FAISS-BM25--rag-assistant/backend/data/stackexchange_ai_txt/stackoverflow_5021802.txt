Android Crash Dump data Accessing on Device

This might be an obvious question but I really don't see how to access a crash dump that occurs on my Samsung Device when testing. I see core dump and then some options to like # 9900 to access it. It tells where the file went, but how do I access the directory from my PC and or copy it over to my PC. I have kies installed I tried switching also to mass storage but I just don't see how to access file system. Thanks
