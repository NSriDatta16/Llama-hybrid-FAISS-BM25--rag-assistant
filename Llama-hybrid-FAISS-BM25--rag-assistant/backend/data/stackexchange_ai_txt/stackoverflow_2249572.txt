Magento guest checkout won't make it to shipping info

For some odd reason when people try to use guest checkout it just allows them to enter billing information then when it supposed to go to shipping... it just loops back to the first checkout page... the the process keeps repeating anyone know where this may be coming from? the site is a2iwheels.com/checkout/onepage/
