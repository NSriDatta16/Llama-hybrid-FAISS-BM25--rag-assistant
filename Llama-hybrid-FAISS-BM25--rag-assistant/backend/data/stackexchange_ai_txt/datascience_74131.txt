Measuring chance ("risk") of being in some class

I don't know if this question fits better here or in statistics, but I think here is more appropriate. I have a dataset with several companies and its features and also I have the information if they "broke" in a near future or not. I want build a model that could measure the probability of a company to break in a near future. At first glance this seems a classification problem, yet I do not want to have a binary answer, but a number that measures the "risk" of this company to break. Can anyone suggest me a bibliography, or maybe suggest a (class of) model(s) on this kind of problem? Is survival analysis a good way to approach this problem? The features I have are not in a time series, though it is obtained from temporal date. There are features like chargeback rate, maturity of chargeback, number of transactions the company did in the past 3 months and its mean value and so on.
