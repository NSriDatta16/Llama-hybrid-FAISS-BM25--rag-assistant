Multiple tables or multiple dbs in Android app?

I am writing an Android storytelling app to create and edit stories with texts, pictures, sounds etc. So far I have one story, one database, one table, and everything works fine. Now I will move to multiple stories and I am thinking of whether to keep a single database with one table per story, or having multiple databases, or a combination of the two (like 10 tables per database). I will need to up/download stories to/from a storage service.
