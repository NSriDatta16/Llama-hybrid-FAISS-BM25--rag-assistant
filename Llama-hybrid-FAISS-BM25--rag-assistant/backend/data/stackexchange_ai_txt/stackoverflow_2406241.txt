How do I make Pseudo classes work with Internet Explorer 7/8?

I've written the following code to create a three-column layout where the first and last columns have no left and right margins respectively (by definition, the three columns will have the exact same class as they're dynamically generated--see last paragraph): #content { background-color:#edeff4; margin:0 auto 30px auto; padding:0 30px 30px 30px; width:900px; } .column { float:left; margin:0 20px; } #content .column:nth-child(1) { margin-left:0; } #content .column:nth-child(3) { margin-right:0; } .width_33 { width:273px; } HMTL: #IndexView.pName# #IndexView.titles# The problem is that this code does not work in Internet Explorer 7 and 8? The only pseudo class I can use with IE (in this case) would be "first-child," but this does not eliminate the right margin on the third and last column. Does anyone know of a way I can make this code work on IE 7/8? A important side note: The three columns are being generated dynamically through a query loop, and therefore the class attribute for each column will be identical.
