finding threshold of activation

Dear crossvalidated community, I am working on a serie of binary measures $y$ (0s and 1s), and an environamental variable $x$ (temperature). I suppose the existence of a $\bar x$ that acts like a "switch temperature". But I do not know how to model this behaviour to infer $\bar x$ . $$ y \sim 0; x $$ y \sim 1; x \geq \bar x $$ Maybe a logistic regression? I would like to do in in the probabilistic bayesian framework and code it with Stan.
