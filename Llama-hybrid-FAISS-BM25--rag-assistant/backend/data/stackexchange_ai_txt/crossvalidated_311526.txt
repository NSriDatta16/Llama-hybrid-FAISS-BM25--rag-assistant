What is the difference between Gaussian discriminant analysis and logistic regression?

As stated in this course pdf , Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) can also be expressed in the form of $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\theta^Tx)}$, where $\theta$ is some appropriate function of $Ï†$, $\Sigma$, $u_0$, and $u_1$. So why can't logistic regression predict model like them?
