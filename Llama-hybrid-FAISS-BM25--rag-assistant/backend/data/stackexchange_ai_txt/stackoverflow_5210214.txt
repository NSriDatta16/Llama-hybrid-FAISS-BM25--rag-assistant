According to my MIPS reference sheet , the following registers are callee-saves (have to be preserved by the called function) while the rest are caller-saves (aren't required to be preserved by a called function): $s0 - $s7 (registers 16-23), the saved temporaries $gp (register 28), the global pointer $sp (register 29), the stack pointer $fp (register 30), the frame pointer $rp (register 31), the return address (Note, $rp is listed as not saved in other versions of the cheat sheet .)
