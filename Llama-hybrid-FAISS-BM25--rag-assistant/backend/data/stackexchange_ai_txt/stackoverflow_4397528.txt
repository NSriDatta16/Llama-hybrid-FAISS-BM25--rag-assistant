As El Ronnoco said, if you want the selected tab in the ASP.NET Session, then you need to send it back to the server. You could do this with an AJAX call, or you could include it with another post you do in your application. However, if you simply want to maintain the selected tab for the client, you can do as RPM1984 suggested and store it in a cookie (or other local storage if HTML5 is allowed) and select that the tab last recorded in cookie/local storage upon loading the page. The following is off the top of my head so might have syntax errors (I'd need to see your tab and other markup to do a working solution): $("#index_0_li").click(function() { localStorage.setItem('SelectedTab', '#index_0_li'); }); $("#index_1_li").click(function() { localStorage.setItem('SelectedTab', '#index_1_li'); }); $(document).ready(function() { var index = localStorage.getItem('SelectedTab'); if (index !== null) { $(index).click(); } });
