I suspect you will get this warning if any of the predictions are 1 or 0, rather than all of them. This is because the contribution to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters will be zero for that pattern as it is proportional to $y_i \times (1 - y_i)$ which will be zero for such points. However, @Jarle_Tufto also is correct to point out that the logistic regression problem does not have a unique coefficient for this problem (see below - please forgive my ropey drawing) . Say 2/3 of the examples for x=0 have y = 0 and 1/3 y = 1 and all of the points at x=1 have y=1, then any solution that will give those values at those points will have the same value for the loss function. Adding a regularisation term to get it to choose the smallest slope resolves that indeterminancy (and probably generalise better)
