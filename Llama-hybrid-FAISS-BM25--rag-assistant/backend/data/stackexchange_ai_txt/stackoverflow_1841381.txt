CSS - Control Margin between and

I have a client that doesn't want any space between a paragraph and a list item. Is there a CSS way to control the margin between a tag and a tag? Naturally I can add a class such paragraphs but in a CMS world that is not practical. I need some kind of p + li { margin-top: 1px }; or something like that.
