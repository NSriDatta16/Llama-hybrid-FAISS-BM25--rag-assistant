Transfer with different sized state spaces in neural networks/deep reinforcement learning

Say we are transferring sequentially from environment 1-3 below, where the text corresponding to each environment describes its observation space. Env 1 observation: position of robot Env 2 observation: position of robot, position of object 1, velocity of object 1 Env 3 observation: position of robot, position of object 1, velocity of object 1, position of object 2 How do we setup the architecture for the value/policy network such that it can handle variable length observations like this?
