Give us some more hints about what you're trying to do. You can write a good old-fashioned cgi program in C++ easily enough, and run it with FastCGI. We used to do that all the time. You could write a C++ program embedding a lightweight HTTP server as well. Both of them are much bigger PITAs than using something like perl or ruby. So for why C++? Update Okay, got it. The main thing about FastCGI is that it avoids a fork-exec to run your CGI program, but it is a little bit different API. That's good, but you still have the problem of handling the HTTP stuff. There are, however, several very lightweight HTTP servers, like Cherokee and Lighttpd . In similar situations (building web interfaces for appliances) I've seen people use one of these and run their C/C++ programs under them as a CGI. Lighttpd in particular seems to concentrate on making CGI-like stuff fast and efficient. Another update. I just had cgicc pointed out to me: http://www.gnu.org/software/cgicc/ That might solve some problems.
