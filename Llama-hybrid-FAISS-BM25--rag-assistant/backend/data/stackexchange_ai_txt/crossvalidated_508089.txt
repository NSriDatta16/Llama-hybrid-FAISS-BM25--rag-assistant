You have to define "best parameters" and "better performance". Normally, you choose a loss function that's differentiable, but you actually care about some other metric, like accuracy, AUC, or average precision. If, for example, you care about AUC, and using focal loss produces higher validation AUC than cross entropy loss does, then use focal loss. In other words, the loss function you end up using is a (discrete) hyperparameter you tune to optimize the metric you care about.
