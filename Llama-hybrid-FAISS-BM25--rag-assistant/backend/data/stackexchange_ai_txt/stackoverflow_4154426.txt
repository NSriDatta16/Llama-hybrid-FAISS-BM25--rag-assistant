There is no com.inprise.vbroker.IIOP.Task in vbjclientorb.jar for AIX

We are migrating to VisiBroker 7.0. In our client application we started to use VBJ Client Runtime provided as a Java archive vbjclientorb.jar file. There is no com.inprise.vbroker.IIOP.Task in vbjclientorb.jar for AIX. But com.inprise.vbroker.IIOP.Connection class located in vbjclientorb.jar uses com.inprise.vbroker.IIOP.Task class. java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.inprise.vbroker.IIOP.Task at com.inprise.vbroker.IIOP.Connection.write(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.GIOP.OutputStream.write(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.GIOP.OutputStream.writeUnfragmented(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.GIOP.OutputStream.writeFragmented(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.GIOP.Message.write(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.GIOP.GiopConnection.send_message(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.GIOP.GiopConnection.send_message(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.GIOP.ProtocolConnector.invoke(Unknown Source) at com.inprise.vbroker.orb.DelegateImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) Is it a bug? Or we should include some additional jar?
