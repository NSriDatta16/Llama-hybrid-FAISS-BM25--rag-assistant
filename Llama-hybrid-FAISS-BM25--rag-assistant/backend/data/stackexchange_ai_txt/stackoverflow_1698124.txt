How to tell if a given path is mounted removable media in Mac OS X?

Given a path, in Mac OS X, is there a way to tell that it is a mounted CD or DVD, as opposed to a regular directory, a regular file, or mounted DMG or other mountable file type? Specifically I would like to know if it is a CD or DVD when a user supplies a path directly, or via the NSOpenPanel, or drags the CD onto the app. I need to take special action in these cases.
