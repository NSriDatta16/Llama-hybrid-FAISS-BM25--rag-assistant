How do I intentionally design an overfitting neural network?

To have a neural network that performs perfectly on training set, but poorly on validation set, what am I supposed to do? To simplify, let's consider it a CIFAR-10 classification task. For example, "no dropout" and "no regularization" would help, but "more layers" doesn't necessarily. I'm also wondering, do "batch size", choice of optimizer make any difference on overfitting?
