I would suggest looking into multiple imputation algorithms. Gary King has produced a package for R called Amelia that does very sophisticated multiple imputation and can handle time series quite well. Amelia treats all of the data as multivariate normal and performs multiple random draws from that distribution until the draws converge on the final imputed value. But there are a number of customization features that you can incorporate so that you can sculpt Amelia runs to your particular problem, such as including lags, leads, and polynomial expressions.
