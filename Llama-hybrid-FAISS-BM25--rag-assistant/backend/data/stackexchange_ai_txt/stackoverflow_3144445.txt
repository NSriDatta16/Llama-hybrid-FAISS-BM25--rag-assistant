Read chunks of data in Perl

What is a good way in Perl to split a line into pieces of varying length, when there is no delimiter I can use. My data is organized by column length, so the first variable is in positions 1-4, the second variable is positions 5-15, etc. There are many variables each with different lengths. Put another way, is there some way to use the split function based on the position in the string, not a matched expression? Thanks.
