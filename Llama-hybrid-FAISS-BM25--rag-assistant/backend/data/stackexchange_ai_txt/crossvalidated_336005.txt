What all does the training time for a neural network include?

I recently developed a DNN model and I want to know what exactly is training time and what all steps are included in it? For ex I carried out the following steps: Determined best Network Architecture by 5 fold CV ( using Back-propagation) Once I got the Best architecture I used unsupervised learning to get initial weights using unlabled data I applied back-propagation to fine tune the network with initial weights given by step 2 (It ran for 500 epochs) What is the training time in this procedure? Does it include all the steps or only steps 2 or 3? Or in general terms does the training time include time to run the code for the best architecture or it also includes the time taken to determine the best network architecture?
