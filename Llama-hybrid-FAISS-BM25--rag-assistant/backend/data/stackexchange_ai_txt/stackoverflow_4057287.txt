Effcient method for ajax autocomplete query on big db table and busy site

We're all familiar with the autocomplete tagging setup here on SO. I'm wondering what is the most efficient method for querying the tag table in this scenario. A busy site with many users tagging away with the autocomplete feature requires a lot of querying. Say at any one time there are 100 users typing an average of 10 characters to lookup/create their tags. That seems like a lot of queries on a single table and that's only one aspect of a busy site. So, is it just a matter of making sure you have a sane delay on the client side before a request is made, or is it smart indexing on the data table, or is it offloading the data on a regular basis to a more efficient server-side lookup store? I'd appreciate any tips. Using mysql and php.
