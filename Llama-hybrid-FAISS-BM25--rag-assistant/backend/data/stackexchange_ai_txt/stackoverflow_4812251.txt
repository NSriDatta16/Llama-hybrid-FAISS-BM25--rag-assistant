NSMakeRange crashing app

I'm trying to get a substring of a NSString using substringWithRange:NSMakeRange. I am getting the initial string from a saved dictionary, the saved string is written as agent_AGENTNAME, I'm trying to strip off the agent_ part. The code below works fine (feel free to critique it if it is crude) if I hard code the numbers in for the NSMakeRange - like so NSString* savedAgentName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", [thisfile substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(6,19)]]; but since everyone will obviously have names of different lengths I need to make this more dynamic. When I switch the code to this: NSString* savedAgentName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", [thisfile substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(6,[thisfile length])]]; it crashes my app. Why? Here's the larger chunk of code: //get saved agents savedAgents = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"Select An Agent", nil]; for(int f=0; f Thanks.
