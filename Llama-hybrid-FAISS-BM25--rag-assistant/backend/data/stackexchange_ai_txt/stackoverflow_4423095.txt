When we read the MS Excel's numeric cell value using Apache POI library, it read it as numeric. But sometime we want it to read as string (e.g. phone numbers, etc.). This is how I did it: Insert a new column with first cell =CONCATENATE("!",D2). I assume D2 is cell id of your phone-number column. Drag new cell up to end. Now if you read the cell using POI, it will read the formula instead of calculated value. Now do following: Add another column Select complete column created in step 1. and choose Edit->COPY Go to top cell of column created in step 3. and Select Edit->Paste Special In the opened window, Select "Values" radio button Select "OK" Now read using POI API ... after reading in Java ... just remove the first character i.e. "!"
