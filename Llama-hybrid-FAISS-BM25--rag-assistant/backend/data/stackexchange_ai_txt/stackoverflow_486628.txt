For me, I would tell the user of the FPGA that they must have one of the bits set to 1 on entry. However, if that's not your preferred solution, what's wrong with the idea of pre-feeding all the Current inputs initially into a big NOR gate (so that the output is true only when all inputs are false). All Current lines also continue through to their AND gates with the exception that Current[1] is OR'ed with the output of our NOR gate before entering it's AND gate That way, Current[1] would be true entering the AND gate, if all Currents are false. Keep in mind that I understand boolean algebra but I've never worked on raw hardware - I'm guessing you'll need to buffer all the input signals into the AND gates to ensure correct timing but i suspect you'll know that better than I. The following diagram is left in in case SO fixes its code/pre blocks - the latest SO update seems to have stuffed them up (leaving them proportional, not fixed-width, font). Anyway, eJames' graphical diagram is better. Here's my diagram, slightly less elegant than yours :-): +-------------------+ | | | +---- | Current[1]-----+------\ \ | |NOR|o--+ | Current[2-k]---+------/ / | | | +---- | | | +\ /+ | | \_/ | +---+ | OR | \ /Buffer \ / + --- | | +---+ +---+ |2-k| | 1 |
