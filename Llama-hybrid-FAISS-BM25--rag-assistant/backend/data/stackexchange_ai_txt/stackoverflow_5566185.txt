Cut off text exceeding a certain length

I have a list with texts with lengths ranging from 1 character to several thousands. I want to cut off all texts exceeding 255 characters. How can I do that? Do I have to check the length of each String and then cut it with (255) or is there a more elegant expression? Edit: like this 255. %> ... this is BSP Thanks in advance
