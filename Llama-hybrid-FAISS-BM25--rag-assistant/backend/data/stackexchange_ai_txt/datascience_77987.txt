Dataset to be used to learn NN regressions in classroom experiments

Can you suggest me datasets with intermediate size of about 1000-10000 to work with neural network regressions in classroom experiments? It seems that there are much more datasets for classification tasks than for regression tasks. I know two good datasets: Boston Housing dataset Auto MPG Data Set But they actually seem to be very small. On the other hand, I know other datasets such as Zillow price but they seem to be very large to explore different types of NN regressions in classroom experiments.
