The KEY s create indexes for these columns. Indexes are sorted and speed up searching. However, indexes need storage space and maintainace each time a row is inserted/deleted. For that reason you only index columns who are searched on a lot, or columns who need specific constraints. Note that regular indexes don't enforce the values to be unique, unlike the PRIMARY KEY. In your table the indexed columns are (probably) used in joins with other tables. When joining tables, the DBMS has to lookup values in the other tables and this goes a lot faster if the columns are indexed. (NOTE: since the table uses MyISAM, you won't have a "real" foreign-key ensuring integrity. For that you need to use InnoDB and setup relations)
