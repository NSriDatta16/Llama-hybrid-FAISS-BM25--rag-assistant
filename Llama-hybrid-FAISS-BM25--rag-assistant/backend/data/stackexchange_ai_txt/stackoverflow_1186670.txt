Large companies are like cargo ships. They know where the icebergs are, they can clearly see them: it just takes them a while to actually turn. These kind of organisations have massive amounts of smart people who's job it is to be interested in browser security (and other such issues), it's not that they aren't aware of the problem, it's pure logistics and bureaucracy. It takes testing, approval, and a considerable effort to actually roll out. Consider that a common platform is much easier to manage for centralised IT support, and consider that most such companies will handle roll outs for new software when they roll out new hardware, which is expensive and done on a alrge scale where they can maximise bulk buy deals. And be thankful it's just IE6. I had to do work for NN4 for a major bank not so very long ago.
