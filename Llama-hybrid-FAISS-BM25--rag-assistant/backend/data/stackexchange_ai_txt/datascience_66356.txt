Machine Learning methods for finding outliers

I have a csv files of thousands of lines, the data is put down into a Dataframe of columns. Some of the column have text information while others might have numbers. I want to detect anomalies or outliers inside this csv file. Being relatively new to this and not knowing much I would appreciate if I get some help or a small guidance and how I should tackle this problem. What methods or what is the best approach to find outliers in a Dataframe. My language of choice is Python
