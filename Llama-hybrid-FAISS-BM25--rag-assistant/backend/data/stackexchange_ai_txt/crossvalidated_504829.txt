Predictions from hurdle models in R

I am using hurdle models to predict a continuous cost variable that has many exact zeros. I have fitted a hurdle model with a binomial component and a gamma component, but when I am trying to combine the two components of the model to predict average costs, I seem to be calculating the predicted probabilities incorrectly. Specifically, I used predict, type = "response" in R and compared those predictions to the manual approach outlined in Zuur and Ieno's Beginner's Guide to Zero-Inflated Models in R on pages 128-129, and the two do not match. What am I doing wrong? Example data and code below. library(tidyverse) library(boot) ### DATA disease % mutate(costs_binary = ifelse(costs > 0, 1, 0)) ### HURDLE MODEL # gamma component hurdle_gamma 0), family = Gamma(link = "log")) # binomial component hurdle_binomial
