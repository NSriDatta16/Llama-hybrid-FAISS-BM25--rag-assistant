In Protocol Buffers, how to import a file from the upper level directory?

I have the following code in a protocol buffer file(pcfg_lm.proto): import "../types/language.proto"; package nlp; message PCFGProto { required Language lang = 1; } And of course there is a proto file exists at ../types/language.proto. However, when I issue the command: protoc pcfg_lm.proto --cpp_out=/tmp Here is the error message: ../types/language.proto: File not found. pcfg_lm.proto: Import "../types/language.proto" was not found or had errors. pcfg_lm.proto:6:12: "Language" is not defined. I think there must be some way to specify the file names in the upper level directories, without using the -I flag. But how do I do that?
