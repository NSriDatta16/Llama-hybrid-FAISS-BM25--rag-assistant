How to make article spinner regex?

Let's say I have teh following: {{Hello|Hi|Hey} {world|earth} | {Goodbye|farewell} {noobs|n3wbz|n00blets}} And I want that to turn into any of the following: Hello world Goodbye noobs Hi earth farewell n3wbz // etc. Paying attention to the way the "spinning" syntax is nested. It could be nested a billion layers deep for all we know. I can do this easy, except once they're nested like the above example my regex messes up and the results are not correct. Could someone show an example in either a .NET language or Python please?
