If we take "weights" to mean "average weight" and "supported" to mean "gives significant evidence for", then yes. The probability, given that the average weight is less that 85 kg, of seeing that confidence interval is very low. So seeing this evidence should cause significant updating towards the average weight being greater than 85 kg. However, if "supports" means "fully justifies", then no. This does not conclusively prove the claim. 5% of the time, 95% confidence intervals do not contain the true mean. That's what "95%" means.
