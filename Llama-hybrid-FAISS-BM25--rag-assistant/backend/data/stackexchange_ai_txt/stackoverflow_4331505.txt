how to set current image location in vb.net

How do I set the current image location in vb.net if I use the drag and drop even. It seems like the imagelocation doesn't work because I tried outputting the image location using messagebox. But it didn't show up anything. How do I get the image location of the file that I have just drop into the picturebox so that I could transfer it on another directory? Private Sub pb_DragDrop(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles pb.DragDrop Dim FileToMove As String Dim MoveLocation As String Try pb.Image = Image.FromFile(CType(e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop), Array).GetValue(0).ToString) FileToMove = pb.ImageLocation MoveLocation = "C:\pics\" + TextBox1.Text + ".jpg" '" If System.IO.File.Exists(FileToMove) = True Then System.IO.File.Move(FileToMove, MoveLocation) End If Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("Error Doing Drag/Drop") End Try End Sub
