I think Jeff Atwood hit the nail on the head in 2004 regarding stored procs: Who Needs Stored Procedures, Anyways? Having used both stored procedures and dynamic SQL extensively I definitely prefer the latter: easier to manage, better encapsulation, no BL in the data access layer, greater flexibility and much more. Virtually every major open-source PHP project uses dynamic SQL over stored procs (see: Drupal, Wordpress, Magento and many more). This conversation almost seems archaic: get yourself a good ORM , stop fretting over your data access and start building awesome applications.
