Does your custom property have a corresponding field in the database? I would try adding your field to the database first. Delete the entity from the Linq2SQL designer, save the designer file, drag the table back to the designer from the Database Explorer, and save again. This will recreate the entity with your desired property, and insure that all of the hooks are in place for SubmitChanges().
