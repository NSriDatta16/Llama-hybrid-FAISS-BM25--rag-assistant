I was having a similar problem with extra rows being inserted. It worked ok when I running an INSERT query from the command line in Perl, but no PHP script I could write would insert just one row. I even went so far as to try a different physical server, and then a virtual machine, all trying the simplest possible code: Eventually, I tried WGET-ing the URL for to my php script from my laptop, which only produced one new entry in PHPMyAdmin. I then had the genius idea of TRYING OTHER BROWSERS. Turned out, Chrome was uncouthly hitting the page several times for some reason. Putting a header( 'Location: http://5.87.12.89/~tsbertalan/done.html' ) ; line right after the mysql_query line solved the problem. I wouldn't even have noticed this if I had followed good practice and redirected to a landing page immediately after processing POST input, as I eventually intended to do.
