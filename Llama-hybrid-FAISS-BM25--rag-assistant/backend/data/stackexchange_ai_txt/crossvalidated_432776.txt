what does the length of each bar represents, in the context of discrete uniform distribution?

In probability theory and statistics, the discrete uniform distribution is a symmetric probability distribution whereby a finite number of values are equally likely to be observed; every one of n values has equal probability 1/n. Page 68 of "Kevin Patrick Murphy. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective." consider following figure as "uniform distribution". For illustration purposes, let us use a simple prior which puts uniform probability on 30 simple arithmetical concepts, such as “even numbers”, “odd numbers”, “prime numbers”, “numbers ending in 9”, etc. To make things more interesting, we make the concepts even and odd more likely apriori. We also include two “unnatural” concepts, namely “powers of 2, plus 37” and “powers of 2, except 32”, but give them low prior weight. See Figure 3.2(a) for a plot of this prior. We will consider a slightly more sophisticated prior later on. what does the length of each bar represents? Note: the sum of all of 32 items is equal to 1.0 first item represents 0.131510 3rd item represents 0.000263 what does this mean?
