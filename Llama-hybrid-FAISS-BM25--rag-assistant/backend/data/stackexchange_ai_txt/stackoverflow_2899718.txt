How about instead of using an ITimeProvider try this: public class User { public Func DateTimeProvider = () => DateTime.Now; public User() { this.CreationTime = DateTimeProvider(); } } And in your unit test: var user = new User(); user.DateTimeProvider = () => new DateTime(2010, 5, 24); I know that this is not very elegant but instead of messing with the model binder this could be a solution. If this doesn't feel like a good solution you could implement a custom model binder and override the CreateModel method where you would inject the dependencies in the constructor of the model.
