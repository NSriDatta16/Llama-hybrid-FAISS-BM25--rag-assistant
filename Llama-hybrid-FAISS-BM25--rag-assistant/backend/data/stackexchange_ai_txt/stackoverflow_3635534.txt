Implementing blowfish and RC5 in java

I wanted to develop code in java for a cryptographic algorithms like Blowfish,RC5. I searched on the internet too but I got to know that Blowfish has ready made methods available. So writing own methods is like 'reinventing wheel' so is the same case with 'RC5' too? If this is the case, can you please suggest me some algorithms of cryptography for which code can be developed within the duration of 2 months using 2 people having average knowledge about 'Java'?
