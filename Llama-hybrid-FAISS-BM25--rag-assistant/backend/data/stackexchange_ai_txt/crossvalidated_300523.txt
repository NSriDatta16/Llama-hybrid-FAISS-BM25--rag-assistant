Edit: I just saw that this is what @ttnphns proposed in the comments. I think a good approach for your data would be multinomial regression. You can find details on how to do that in this question: Can I use glm algorithms to do a multinomial logistic regression? Basically you 'll use a mixed-effects GLM with poisson distribution and the log link. The subject will be the random effect.
