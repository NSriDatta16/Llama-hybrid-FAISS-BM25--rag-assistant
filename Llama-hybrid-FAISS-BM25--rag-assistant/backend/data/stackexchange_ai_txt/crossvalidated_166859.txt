Can I use PCA to study how variables affect each other?

I'd like to know what PCA tells me about how the variables affect each other. For example, let's say I've three variables Cholesterol, Exercise, Calorie Intake and Sleep. I want to know how Exercise, Sleep and Calorie Intake affect Cholesterol. Will the Cholesterol be lower (or higher) if I eat more calories or if I exercise more? After PCA I get the following: Standard deviations: [1] 2.0562689 0.4926162 0.2796596 0.1543862 Rotation: PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 Cholesterol 0.36138659 -0.65658877 0.58202985 0.3154872 Exercise -0.08452251 -0.73016143 -0.59791083 -0.3197231 CalorieI 0.85667061 0.17337266 -0.07623608 -0.4798390 Sleep 0.35828920 0.07548102 -0.54583143 0.7536574 PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 Standard deviation 2.0563 0.49262 0.2797 0.15439 Proportion of Variance 0.9246 0.05307 0.0171 0.00521 Cumulative Proportion 0.9246 0.97769 0.9948 1.00000 What I understand from this is how each individual component account for the variance in the data. The only thing I can say here is that PC1 and PC2 has a cumulative variance which account for ~98% which I implicitly interpret as PC3 and PC4 having no affect on the data at all. I understand that PC1 and PC2 are enough to explain all the data from the four given variables but does it say anything about how the variables affect each other?
