C : files manipulation Can't figure out how to simplify this code with files manipulation

I have been working on this code but I can't find out what is wrong. This program does compile and run but it ends up having a fatal error. The program reads a file and collect the numbers in order to calculate the total (after having converted them to float). Then it reads the file and display the one that has less than 10.00 I have a file called myFile.txt, with the following content : James------ 07.50 Anthony--- 17.00 So the display should be The total is 24.50 Here is the one with less than 10.00 : James who has 07.50 And here is the code : int main() { int n =2, valueTest=0,count=0; FILE* file = NULL; float temp= 00.00f, average= 00.00f, flTen = 10.00f; float *totalNote = (float*)malloc(n*sizeof(float)); int position = 0; char selectionNote[5+1], nameBuffer[10+1], noteBuffer[5+1]; file = fopen("c:\\myFile.txt","r"); fseek(file,10,SEEK_SET); while(valueTest } I am pretty new to c and find it more difficult than c# or java. And I woud like to get some suggestions to help me to get better. I think this code could be simplier. Do you think the same ?
