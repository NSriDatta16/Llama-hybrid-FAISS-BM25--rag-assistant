Feature engineering with non-fixed length vectors?

I have a bunch of data that looks like this: [ [[3,1,4], [6,5,22], [1,-4,77]], # Observation One [[595,4,-3], [-123,3,9], [44,41,97], [12,-44,194]], # Observation Two [[-4,99,-22]] # Observation Three ... ] So - in general, each observation is composed of vectors that are size 3. Each observation does not have a fixed length. Basically, I have a bunch of observations that are not of the same length. I don't know how I would throw this at a standard machine learning classification algorithm. I had an idea of computing the pairwise distance matrix and re-scaling that to a fixed dimension as an input feature. This idea was inspired by image classification. Does anyone have any advice for me on how I could create a good fixed-length feature vector representation?
