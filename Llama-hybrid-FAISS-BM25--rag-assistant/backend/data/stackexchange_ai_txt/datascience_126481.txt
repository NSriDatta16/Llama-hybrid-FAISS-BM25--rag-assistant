Synchronous means that it happens at the very exact time. Similarity means that there are common patterns (potentially lagged in time). Since dtw is not enforcing focus on synchrony it is more a measure of similarity. Note that one main plus point for dtw is that you can apply it to time series which are unequally spaced. Then synchrony is hard to evaluate and you may prefer similarity
