Method to assess text credibility

I am searching for an automated method (ideally a python package) that produces a score to assess the credibility of a given text (e.g. from a webpage). I am not searching for: text complexity assessments (i.e. how long sentences are and how many difficult words are used) as for example flesch reading ease, smog index, flesch kincaid grade, coleman liau index, automated readability index, dale chall readability score, difficult words index, linsear write formula, or gunning fog. text coherence (i.e. how well the next sentence fit with the previous one) as for example Text Coherence Analysis Based on Deep Neural Network Why is complexity/coherence not the same credibility? Because many texts advertising for example homeopathy use long complex scientifically sounding and complex word loaded sentences while being nonsense in terms of trueness. Therefore I am wondering if there is any method to assess the credibility/reliability of a given piece of text/webpage information automatically?
