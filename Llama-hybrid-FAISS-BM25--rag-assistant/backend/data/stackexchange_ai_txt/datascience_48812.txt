Jupyter is the home of language-agnostic projects that began as part of IPython, such as the IPython Notebook. Jupyter was split from IPython starting with IPython 4.0 (released August 11, 2015). The parts of IPython which work for any language are now called Jupyter, while the parts specific to executing Python code remain as IPython. Jupyter projects include: Jupyter Notebook (based on IPython notebook) qtconsole Jupyter protocol JupyterHub (multi-user server)
