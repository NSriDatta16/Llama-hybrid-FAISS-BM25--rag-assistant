Cocoa tips for PHP developers?

I'm a PHP developer, and I use the MVC pattern and object-oriented code. I really want to write applications for the iPhone, but to do that I need to know Cocoa, but to do that I need to know Objective-C 2.0, but to do that I need to know C, and to do that I need to know about compiled languages (versus interpreted). Where should I begin? Do I really need to begin with plain old "C", as Joel would recommend? Caveat: I like to produce working widgets, not elegant theories.
