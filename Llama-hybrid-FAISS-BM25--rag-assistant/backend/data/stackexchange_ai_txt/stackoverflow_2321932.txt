Javascript show/hid div and change a css class based on which div is visible?

I have little piece of javascript to show/hide divs based on which link is clicked in a list. Its not very eligant, but it works fine. What I'd like to do is to assign an active state the a list item depending on which div is showing. Here is my JS and HTML: var ids=new Array('section1','section2','section3','section4'); function switchid(id){ hideallids(); showdiv(id); } function hideallids(){ //loop through the array and hide each element by id for (var i=0;i html: One Two Three Four 1111111 2222222 3333333 4444444 When section 2 (or whichever) is clicked, I'd like the class "activeItem" to be removed from the li it is currently on and applied to the current li. Is this possible with javascript? I think it is, but I can't figure out how to implement it client side. Thanks!
