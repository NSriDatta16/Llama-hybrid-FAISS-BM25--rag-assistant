It sounds like some of your questions are not necessarily specific to genetic programming; if that's true, you might have some luck asking the folks over at the NEAT Users Group . They primarily discuss the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (or NEAT) algorithm, which is a genetic algorithm used to evolve neural networks. But topics like elitism and crossover strategies are pretty general, and can apply to both GA and GP algorithms. Otherwise, as Dan and Ray have said, a lot of these decisions are made after experimentation with one's particular software and domain. Try applying your algorithm to different problems and pay attention to how it behaves -- after a while, you'll probably develop an intuition for what works and what doesn't.
