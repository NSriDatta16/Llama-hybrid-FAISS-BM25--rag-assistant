Heavily skewed distribution -- transform to normal?

I have the above distribution of data -- two things to note: 1) These are all integers [the x axis is measuring lag -- the number of days between an initial event and a final event], and 2) There actually are values going out towards 400, 500, etc., but they don't show up well on this chart because they're so few compared to the 20000+ "2" values. My audience here is interested in the average view of this data. When I reported the true average of 35, however, it communicated the wrong idea, since 95+% of the events happen in 8 days or less. I know that median would be a more reasonable measure here, but this particular audience is so non-mathy that median is not a clear measure. Therefore, I have been tasked with removing any outliers from this data in order to get a more representative "average" number. I know removing data is generally avoided, but I've been specifically requested to do it in this situation. Is there a way to transform this data to a more normal distribution so then standard deviation can be used on it? If not, what is the best way to transform and handle outliers in this particular set of data? I don't have much background in statistics so any advice would be greatly appreciated!
