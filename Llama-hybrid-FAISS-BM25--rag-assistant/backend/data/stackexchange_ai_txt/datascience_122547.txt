What can be the possible benefits of analysing rare words?

A few days ago, I was assigned the task to analyse rare words for apparently anything but it needs to be novel. But, after reading articles and research papers and my previous NLP and Computer Science experience, I don't understand what benefits can be extracted in analysing rare except for NER and tokenization problem. And a few statistical problem such as cultural shift, etc. Now, I am in a block and standstill state. If anyone could help with their more in-depth experience and insights it'll greatly be appreciated.
