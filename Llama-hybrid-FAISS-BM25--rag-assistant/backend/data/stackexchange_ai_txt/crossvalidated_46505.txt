Calculating distance metrics between a sample set and a point

i have a list of text files and i know that these texts belong to a group, by using this group of text files (i.e this is my sample set) i'd like to calculate Jaccard index and Edit distance for each text file that are not in the sample set. By doing so i'd like to generate two features of each text file which are the similarity/diversity of each file from the sample set of text files. After constructing my dataset, classification will be used. how can i achieve this? Problem arises when i try to calculate Jaccard index and Edit distance for each text file. i'm not sure i should calculate the Jaccard index and Edit distance for each text in sample set and take the average of them and use these as a feature, this can be computationally inefficient. P.S: my reputation is too low that i couldn't create the tags of jaccard-index, edit-distance,similarity and divergence
