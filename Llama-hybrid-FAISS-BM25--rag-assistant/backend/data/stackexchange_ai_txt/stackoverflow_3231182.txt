How to complete $.get() when a form is submitted using jQuery

I am using a third party shopping cart that sends a registration form to a .cgi script. I want to send information from that form to me, and the customer via a jQuery $.get() function call. The $.get calls a registration.mail.php script. The problem is that the form submitting seems to cancel out the ajax call before the ajax call can be completed. I can think of some inelegant solutions, and I have decided, because I'm about to travel, to use a counter and make the user click 'Register' twice. This solution hurts my soul obviously. Here's the Javascript, that lives in the footer: var getsuccess = false; $(document).ready(function() { $('form#registerWholesale').bind('submit', function() { $email = $('#email').val(); $username = $('#contactname').val(); $company = $('#company').val(); $phone = $('#billphone1').val(); $message = "A new customer has registered at the wholesale website. \n "; $message += "They have the username of: " + $username + ". \n"; $message += "Their company is: " + $company + ". \n"; $message += "Their email is: " + $email + ". \n"; $message += "Their phone is: " + $phone + ". \n"; $message += "Please help them ASAP. You can access the back end of the site at: http://location of website admin backend"; $.get('/mail.php', {from: 'orders@OurCompany.com', message: $message, email: $email, username: $username, company: $company}, function(data, textStatus, xhr) { getsuccess = true; }); if (getsuccess) { return true; }else{ return false; } }); And here is the registration.mail.php code. Thank you!
