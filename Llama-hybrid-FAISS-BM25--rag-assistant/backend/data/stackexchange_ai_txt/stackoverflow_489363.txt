My opinion is that you would greatly benefit yourself in keeping a light-weight development journal. Notes, sketches, times, dates, etc, designs. It's not an answer to your question, but it is a discipline that few developers have and one that they desperately need. Life is busy and people must learn to track / budget their time and discipline themselves to take on good behaviors and habits. I encourage you to fight and win this battle. Don't compromise something so easy to automation when there are greater gains if you improve your skills. You might also want to check out LifeHacker for some ideas. A bit of a non-answer, but I hope you find it helpful.
