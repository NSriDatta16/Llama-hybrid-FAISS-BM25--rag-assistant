1. Memory limits Well, size of System.Object without any properties is 8 bytes (2x32 bit pointers), or 16 bytes in 64-bit system. [EDIT:] Actually, I just checked in WinDbg, and the size is 12bytes on x86 (32-bit). So in a 32-bit system, you would need 24Gb ram (which you cannot have on a 32-bit system). 2. Program design I strongly believe that such a large list shouldn't be held in memory, but rather in some other storage medium. But in that case, you will always have the option to create a cached class wrapping a List, which would handle actual storage under the hood. So testing the size before adding is the wrong place to do the testing, your List implementation should do it itself if you find it necessary one day. 3. To be on the safe side Why not add a re-entrance counter inside each method to prevent a Stack Overflow? :) So, yes, it's crazy to test for that. :)
