Attachment_fu: can't disable :partition option

I'm trying to use the Attachment_Fu plugin in a Rails project, and want to customize the paths where uploaded files are saved. The documentation shows this option: :partition # Whether to partiton files in directories like /0000/0001/image.jpg. Default is true. (The 0001 part is an ID from a table.) I don't want that, so I set the partition option to false, like so: class Photo :image, :storage => :file_system, :max_size => 500.kilobytes, :resize_to => '320x200', :thumbnails => {:thumb => '100x100>' }, :partition => false validates_as_attachment end ...but the :partition => false option has no effect. Has anybody else encountered this problem? How did you fix it?
