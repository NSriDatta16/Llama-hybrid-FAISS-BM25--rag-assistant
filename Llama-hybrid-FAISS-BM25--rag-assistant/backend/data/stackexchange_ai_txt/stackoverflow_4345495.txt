You should always be developing with the latest SDK. You can set this in your project's properties under "Base SDK" in the "Architectures" section of your project's settings (right click on the project in the organizer, and go to "Get Info"). However, to make sure that your app runs on older devices, you would do this by setting the "iOS Deployment Target" to iOS 3.0 under the "Deployment" section of the project's settings. For the record, I said version 3.0 above because that's the lowest possible supported version that I see in my Xcode. I don't think it's possible to target 2.0 devices anymore.
