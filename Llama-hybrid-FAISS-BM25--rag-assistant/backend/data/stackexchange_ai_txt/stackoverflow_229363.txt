My usage of Hibernate has always been in the context of another framework (Spring, for example), where enabling caching is nearly trivial. A number of these projects have made use of caching via ehcache for some critical domain classes. Having said that, this is another area where we have to make trade-offs between resources - balancing retrieval performance against memory usage. Optimization without measurement has been shown again and again to be poor practice. Collect metrics about the performance of your application. Then decide how to address the slow spots. Caching may be the least of your worries.
