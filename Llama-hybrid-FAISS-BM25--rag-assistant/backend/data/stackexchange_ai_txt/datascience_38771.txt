How to create user and item profile in an item to item collaborative filtering? (Non-rating case)

I want to build a recommender system for a coupons website which should do the following: Given the past purchase behaviour of a user, recommend coupons which the user is likely to buy. The data does not have any ratings for coupons by the user. It tells if a user bought a certain coupon or not, which category did it belong to, what is the gender and location of the user who bought these coupons etc.? I am implementing an item to item collaborative filtering. Based on what I have learnt through videos available on this topic, the following is my approach: Build an item profile of all the coupons with attributes such as category of the coupon, location the coupon is available in and the days on which the coupon can be redeemed. Build a user profile of all the registered users with attributes such as age, gender, and location. Now I am making an item and user matrix, where I will have Coupons on the rows and Users in the columns. I will fill 0 and 1 depending on if a coupon C1 was bought by a user U1 in the past or not. In the same dataset, for the coupons for which I want to predict, I will calculate a score based on cosine similarity between items. My question is if I am using just 0s and 1s (coupon bought or not) to recommend coupons, what is the use of the item and user profile? How I can incorporate the intelligence in the recommendation system that if a user has bought more coupons from X category in the past than recommend him new Y coupons from the same category? I read online about using random forests etc. to calculate "weights" of the attributes in recommendation systems, where do they fit in this scenario? P.S. I am doing everything in R. Many thanks in advance for any advice/suggestions.
