I am not aware of a software implementation of the DCC model with an external regressor in the DCC equation. A simpler solution might be to obtain the fitted conditional correlations and covariances from a vanilla DCC model and then regress them on your external variable of interest. This is not nearly as elegant a solution, but much easier to implement.
