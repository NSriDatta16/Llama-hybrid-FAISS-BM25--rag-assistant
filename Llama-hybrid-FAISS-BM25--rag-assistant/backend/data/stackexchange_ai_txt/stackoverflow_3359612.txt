Referencing a column vector in a data frame within a loop

In a loop, I am trying to get a column vector of class factor into numeric. If there were not a loop, the code would look like c1$values But how do I reference c1$values with a loop? I have tried two approaches: get(paste('c',i,"$values", sep="")) just does not work even outside the loop, while get(paste('c',"1", sep=""))[[1]] works in itself (returns the column vector), but when trying to perform the operation: assign(get(paste("c","1", sep=""))[[1]], as.numeric(as.character(get(paste("c","1", sep=""))[[1]]))) returns an error of "invalid first argument". Any ideas? Thanks, Roberto
