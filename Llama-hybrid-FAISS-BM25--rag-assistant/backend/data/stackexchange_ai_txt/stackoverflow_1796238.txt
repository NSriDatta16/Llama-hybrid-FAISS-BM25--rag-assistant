Generating XHTML from Servlet after XSL Transformation

I've written a servlet that takes some xml and xsl and produces a PDF, using ITextRenderer, and displays it on the screen. However, what I wish to do now is to display the resulting XHTML from the transformation on a webpage. I've created a new servlet which gets the xml and xsl as normal, but I'm unsure how to get the resultant XHTML string. I've had a look online and tried using the javax.xml.transform.Transformer to create a DOMResult object, but I don't know how to pull out the html from this object (presuming it's there at all). Can anyone provide me with a little help on this please? Thanks in advance, -gearoid
