Time dependent representation for time series events with different time gaps?

In natural language processing, we can treat characters as evenly spaced time series in RNN models where time gaps are independent of the sequence and only sequential positions matter. If I want to encode five sentences(as five events) with different timestamp gaps into five time steps using a RNN model how can I encode the time spans(or silences)? The durations of the sentences(events) do not matter. I searched Google and found three related methods: here for Markov Jump Process and here for the duration of an event and here for images , but what I want is how to represent the time gaps between events in neural networks(events or natural language). I tried adding a special time token(represented as a vector) for every 10 seconds of silence(between every two sentences) and the performance seems acceptable, but are there any better or standard solutions?
