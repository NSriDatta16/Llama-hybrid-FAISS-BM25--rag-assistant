Insignificant OLS results but significant IV regression results

I do a regression (Y is a dependent variable and X is an independent variable) OLS gets insignificant results, while the IV regression gets significant results. I based on literature to suggest X is an endogenous variable. I also did Underidentification test, Weak identification test, Sargan test and endogeneity test (used ivreg2, ivregress and estate endog). The results of these tests all supported my IV regression How can I interpret the results? Thanks for your help.
