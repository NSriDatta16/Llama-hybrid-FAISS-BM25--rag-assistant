I know of no general guidelines that link variable selection with narrow distributions (I believe that is a helpful term for a single variable that shows a marked imbalance, within a larger dataset). Decisions about the best ways to address narrow distributions are often predicated on the nature of the research and the analytic methods one aims to use. For example, Gary King has written extensively on the use of logistic regression in the presence of binary outcomes that involve "rare events." There are other common guidelines involving case-control studies. The literature on survey research contains much material on sample weights. And so on. Variable selection (feature selection) is its own extremely broad and often contentious sub-field within statistics or machine learning. You'll find hundreds if not thousands of related posts on this site. If you explore them you'll come to find that a "do I have to?" stance is better replaced by one of "What approach will best achieve my goals? (which you'll need to specify)" or "What are the likely consequences of trying ___ ?"
