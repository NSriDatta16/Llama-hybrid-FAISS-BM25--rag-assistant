Could you make it a @staticmethod instead? That way, you can just swap the order of the decorators. class ModelA(Model): @staticmethod @connect.post_save(ModelB) def observe_model_b_saved(sender, instance, created, **kwargs): # do some stuff pass You'd have to refer to the class by full name instead of getting passed the cls argument, but this would allow you to keep a similar code organization.
