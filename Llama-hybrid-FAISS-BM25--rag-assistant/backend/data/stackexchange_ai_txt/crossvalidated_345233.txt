In short: there is no way to tell the optimal number of units in a hidden layer without actually trying. There is a number of heuristics, intuitions, rules of thumb, best practices etc, however, number of units in a layer is simply a hyperparameter that requires tuning like any other, and you will simply have to try several values to find the best one. Also, neural networks are usually quite robust, so a few units more or less should not make a big difference. For more details, see this answer . Also, the thread you linked contains some good hints.
