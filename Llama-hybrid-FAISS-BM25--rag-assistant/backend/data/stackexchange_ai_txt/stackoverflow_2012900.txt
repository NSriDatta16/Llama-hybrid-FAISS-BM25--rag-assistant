Simpler than SQLite

Do you know any SQLite-like database that stores its data in easily readable plain text format (like multi-line json or yaml)? I'd like to store some data along with my project in version control system but if I use sqlite I can't merge data changes that occurred in different working copies. I don't want to use just some kind of config file because I want my program to be able to modify this data and query it efficiently without loading all data into memory . Data in database might be accessed through some kind of sql dialect but that is not a requirement. EDIT: I am looking for something that builds and maintains index file for json/yaml/whatever that allows for accessing fragments of the data as fast as proper database can do it. I also require ability to modify the data so solutions that allow only for querying are not enough.
