So far, it looks like the idea of having software & your data hosted at msft's data centre. SOA seems to be related to what cloud is offering. No need to have local software (office will run from internet, your docs will be saved there. so that, you can access it anywhere). I think, the target could be big companies - thereby giving them services (software + hardware (data storage + processing power)) on subscription basis. An expert can shed light on how this can be useful? Will people be willing to put everything in the cloud?
