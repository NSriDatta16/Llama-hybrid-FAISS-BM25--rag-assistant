Here's the autoritative answer from the C99 Standard Document clause 6.7.8 (paragraph 10): If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized explicitly, its value is indeterminate. If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly, then: if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer; if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero; if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules; if it is a union, the Ô¨Årst named member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules.
