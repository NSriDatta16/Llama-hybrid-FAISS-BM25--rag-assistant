If you want to add more text/sentences traning data, you can use pre-trained word embeddings. Pretrained models like provides word vector representation of each and every dictionary word. It also provides 'most_smiliar' words. You can simply use sample sentence and generate new samples by doing permutations of each and every word with its most TOP_N similar words. e.g. if your sentence has 3 words, and if you choose 3 most similar for each words, you can upsample by 27 times.
