Another is a complex audio toolbar with controls to play/pause, ffd, and rewing the currently playing audio. A toolbar should not be an activity. It should be a widget. For this reason, I cannot have the audio toolbar and the audio listview in the same activity Sure you can, by making it a widget. Now, since the user would pop up the toolbar from anywhere in the app, I would love to know of a way to combine the current activity and the toolbar activity into one screen. Step #1: Convert the "toolbar activity" into a widget Step #2: Put the widget into the layout for your activity I was looking for a more elegant solution where I could have the audio toolbar pop up at the bottom of the screen the user is on, without exiting the activity he is currently doing. Step #1: Convert the "toolbar activity" into a widget. Step #2: Put the widget into the layout for your activity, specifically in a RelativeLayout , with the toolbar anchored to the bottom of the RelativeLayout , initially set with visibility of GONE . Step #3: Use a TranslateAnimation to display and hide the widget as needed, based on whatever trigger you were going to use. See here for a sample application demonstrating this technique.
