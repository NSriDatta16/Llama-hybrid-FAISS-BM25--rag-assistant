I don't have enough reputation to comment, so a new answer... In that case I think there are only two options: run a service that converts the existing video feed to a more useable feed (for example to wmv, is accepted by most clients), or create some kind of 'applet' (like in Flash) that updates the image every second or so? WebcamXP seems to support your camera ( http://www.webcamxp.com/ipcams.aspx ), so maybe that's an option?
