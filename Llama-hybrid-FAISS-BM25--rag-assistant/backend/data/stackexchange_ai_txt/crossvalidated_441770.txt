We are not doing anything different in either case, the method remains the same. It is the evaluation of the models which differs between stats and ML. Machine learning puts prediction as a first class citizen. Thus, model evaluation focuses more on evaluating how the estimator performs out of sample. This leads to cross validation and train/validation/test splits as the main method of model selection and assessment. Statistics puts inference as the first class citizen. Thus, using as much data as one has available becomes more important than determining if the model can accurately predict new data. In machine learning, a model with high RMSE might not be very valuable, but in statistics high RMSE does not necessarily mean the model is not fruitful.
