ASP.NET MVC null ViewResult

How should one deal with an MVC controller returning a null ViewResult? As an example I am creating a simple edit view: public ActionResult Edit(int id) { var person = (from p in context.SWLiftShare_Persons where p.id == id select p).SingleOrDefault(); if (person != null) { return View(person); } else return View(); } I guess in reality there's no point in checking for a null result in the controller because the view picks out properties from the model: Edit - Fields id: CollarNumber: Name: EmailAddress: I could just wrap everything in a etc. but that seems rather unelegant. Is there a better way to deal with this?
