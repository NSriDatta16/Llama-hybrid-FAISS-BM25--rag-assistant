For computer vision problems ConvNet produces remarkable success at recent years. It is a type of neural network and it doesn't unroll images into vectors as you mention. Hence, it can capture spatial relations between pixels better than fully connected neural network. Also it reduces number of parameters by using the same kernels (group of weights) all over the input space. It also known as LeNet named for Yann LeCun. If you are interested check his convnet papers. Also Alex Krizhevsky's paper on ImageNet at 2009 and consecutive papers describe how Convnet learns and what it learns.
