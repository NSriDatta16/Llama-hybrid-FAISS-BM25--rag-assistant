To start with, you have the equation wrong. The bias correction is not $$\log\left[\left(1-\frac{\tau}{\tau}\right)\left(\frac{\bar y}{1-\bar y}\right)\right],$$ it's $$\log\left[\left(\frac{1-\tau}{\tau}\right)\left(\frac{\bar y}{1-\bar y}\right)\right].$$ This not a bias correction for rare events generally (like the Firth correction). It's a bias correction specifically logistic regression and for case-control sampling: if you oversample individuals with $y=1$ relative to those with $y=0$ . And yes, this bias is only in the intercept -- a surprising and important fact. The bias being only in the intercept is unique to case-control sampling and unique to models for the odds ratio such as logistic regression. It's one of the reasons logistic regression has been so popular in epidemiology.
