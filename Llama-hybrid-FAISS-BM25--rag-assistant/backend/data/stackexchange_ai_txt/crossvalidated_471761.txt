Ok let us try to answer the question depending on the nature of your dependent/independent variables: For continuous data: unless you're fitting a classifier such as LDA or QDA, do not be worried about normality. Logistic regression works well with non-normal data and as far as I know, SVM is not affected by it either. The only problem would be if you are doing linear regression, but even then, normality rules only apply to the model residuals, not to your dependent/independent variables. Lack of normality becomes an issue when you want to get CI for your beta estimates or hypothesis testing (which rely on normality of residuals). For count data. I don't think there is a problem using any of the above models either. I routinely use count data in hierarchical clustering for my RNA-expression analysis, t-tests etc., but there may be models that are affected by this. Good luck!
