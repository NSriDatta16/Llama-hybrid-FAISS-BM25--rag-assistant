How do I set the ideal QPixmapCache::cacheLimit?

I have just started using QPixmapCache and I was wondering, since there is not much documentation, about how to adjust the size based on the system the application is running on. Some users might have lots of free memory while others have very little. I have no idea what the best setting would be. What would be the best way to detect the system (free) RAM and adjust the cache size to fit? http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qpixmapcache.html#setCacheLimit
