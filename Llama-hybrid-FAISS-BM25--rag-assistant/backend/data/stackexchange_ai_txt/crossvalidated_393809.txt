I don't believe there's any canonical way to approach this problem of yours, so I'll try to answer gathering what I know about each issue independently: Even in the case of sparsity, if some of your variables present some correlation, PCA will work just fine capture this. Why would you want to reduce dimensionality? Random forest has no explicit restrictions for high dimensional problems, this question backs this. Still, I guess the goal of PCA here would be to improve interpretability and performance of the random forest algorithms. But keep in mind PCA is quadratic on the number of features, so it has its cost. Finally, if you count data are in the same unit and range, there would be no need for standardization.
