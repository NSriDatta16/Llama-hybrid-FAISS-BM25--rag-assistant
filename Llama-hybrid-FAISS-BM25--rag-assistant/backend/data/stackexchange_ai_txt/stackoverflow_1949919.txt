You can merge the two list boxes into one with the help of groups (LVGF_GROUPID flag): one group for selected and one for not selected. You can also implement group membership changes with drag-drop between them. This way single drag-drop can move an item into the other group at the appropriate position, saving most/all of the other buttons. Additionaly the bottom of each group can have one pseudo item with help text (i.e. "Drag items here to...") that is visible only when relevant.
