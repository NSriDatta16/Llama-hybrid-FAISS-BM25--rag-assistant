I agree with tardate . I have paid my attention at filters too and have found the solution in face of project UrlRewriteFilter . The simple configuration like following: ^.+/resources/(.*)$ /resources/$1 helps to forward all requests for */resources path to /resources pass (including context path prefix). So I can simply put all my images and CSS files under resources folder and continue using relative URLs in my styles for background images and other cases.
