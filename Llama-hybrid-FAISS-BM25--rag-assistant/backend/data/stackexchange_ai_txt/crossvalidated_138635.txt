One way would be to analyze this would be with a logistic regression, something like this $$Pr(\text{Flower occupied}) = \text{time of day} + \text{noise?(Yes/No)} + \text{anything else}$$ or $$ \text{Number of flowers occupied/number of flowers in group} = ...$$ A very flexible modeling approach that could accommodate non-linear changes in activity, as temperature increases and decrease throughout the day, is generalized additive model (GAM) which can fit various forms of smooth curves to data. They can accommodate modeling probabilities and binomial frequencies. I do not use Python but the NumPy or SciPy packages probably can do these. The R package mgcv is what I use. If you use standard logistic regression you could fit a polynomial term such as time$^2$ and time$^3$ but these have drawbacks and limitations.
