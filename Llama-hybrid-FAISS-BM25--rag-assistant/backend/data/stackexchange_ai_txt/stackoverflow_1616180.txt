If you're trying to get the value of a after the script has run on the client-side (i.e. in the browser), you should just be able to retrieve it in the normal way. Take the following setup: index.html This file is your webpage. It contains some content, a tracking script that inserts an image and your own script. My Page My Content tracking.js This is the tracking code, presumably provided by the tracking company. var id = '1234foobar'; var visitorUserAgent = encodeURIComponent(navigator.userAgent); document.write( ' ' ); mycode.js If you know what variables (if any) the tracking code creates, you should be able to retrieve the variables themselves or at least the src attribute of the img tag that the tracking code creates. var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName('img'); alert([id, visitorUserAgent, imgs[imgs.length - 1].src].join('\n'));
