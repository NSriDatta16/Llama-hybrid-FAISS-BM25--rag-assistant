The web server should take care of the 33 % more space by GZIP-ing all text files so that should not be that big of a problem. This together with reducing the number of HTTP requests ( which is very important performance-wise ) makes the method worthwhile. Also, the images are still cached but now in the CSS file instead of in separate files. Preferably the embedding should be done with a build script that inserts the data URIs. That way we don't have to care about large chunks of base64-encoded data when editing the CSS files. Also, remember to have a good solution if images occur more than one time in the file, e.g. re-writing the CSS rules. We don't want the file to be larger than necessary. There are problems with IE though. IE Here is a good blog post about embedding images in CSS and how to fix the problems for IE: http://blog.meebo.com/?p=2320
