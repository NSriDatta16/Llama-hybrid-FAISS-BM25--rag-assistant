In Chatfield's Analysis of Time Series (1980), he gives a number of methods of estimating the autocovariance function, including the jack-knife method. He also notes that it can be shown that the variance of the autocorrelation coefficient at lag k, $r_k$ , is normally distributed at the limit, and that $\operatorname{Var}(r_k) \sim 1/N$ (where $N$ is the number of observations). These two observations are pretty much the core of the issue. He doesn't give a derivation for the first observation, but references Kendall & Stuart, The Advanced Theory of Statistics (1966). Now, we want $\alpha/2$ in both tails, for the two tail test, so we want the $1−\alpha/2$ quantile. Then see that $(1+1−\alpha)/2=1−\alpha/2 $ and multiply through by the standard deviation (i.e. square root of the variance as found above).
