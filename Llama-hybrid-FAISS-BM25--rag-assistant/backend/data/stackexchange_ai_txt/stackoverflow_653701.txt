jQuery: performing operations on an array of objects?

I have 4 jQuery objects (i.e. things constructed via $("ObjectID") ), and I would like to perform the same operation to all of them, in an elegant fashion. I would have thought that something like these would work, but it doesn't seem to: $([obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4]).change(function() { otherObj.show(); }); $([obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4]).attr("disabled", "disabled"); Is there a good syntax for this? It seems like a somewhat blinding oversight. Currently the best I'm seeing is $([obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4]).each( function() { this.change(function() { otherObj.show(); }));
