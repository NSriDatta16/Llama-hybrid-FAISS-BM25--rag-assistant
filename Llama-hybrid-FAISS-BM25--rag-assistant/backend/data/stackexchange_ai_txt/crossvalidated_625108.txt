Can I do a Meta-Analysis for Odds Ratio's for continuous predictor (age) with Binary outcome (Affliction, yes or no) in R?

I'm looking for a way to conduct a Meta-analysis on Odds Ratio's from several studies/article's. The thing is that my OR's are based on logistic regression's with continuous predictors (outcome is binary, affliction or not). So they are not based on frequencies of hits in experimental en control group. Can I do this analysis with the package metafor in R? And what kind of additional information, such as sample size (n), regression weights and CI's do I need to have R calculate standard errors to estimate the overall effect (OR) and make funnelplots? Hope any one can help me out!
