The big red X is the control that encountered a problem in running/interpreting the formula and gave up the ghost. Perhaps the formula was too complex and wieldy for the Chart control to handle it...Maybe, there's a more up-to-date version of the code that has lifted the restriction. There's bound to be something on codeplex.com for this. This can happen equally at design time also, when designing a form, and a control is dragged on to it, a few properties set here and there and to get a big red X, this was a common occurrence when a control misbehaves at design time also. Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
