How to compute threshold?

I would like to detect anomalies for univariate time series data. Most examples on internet show that, after you predict the model, you calculate a threshold for the training data and a MAE test loss and compare them to detect anomalies. So I am thinking is this the correct way of doing it? Shouldn't it be a different threshold value for each data? Also, why do all of the examples only compute MAE loss for anomalies?
