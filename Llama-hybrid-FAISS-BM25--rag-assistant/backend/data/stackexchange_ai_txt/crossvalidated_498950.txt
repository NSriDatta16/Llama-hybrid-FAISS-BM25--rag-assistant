Fitting an ARIMA subset model in R

Suppose I have a time series. After looking at the PACF plot, it largely decreases to zero after 3 lags, but there is also a PACF value that "pokes out" of the significant bounds at a far lag, say at lag 20. I want to include this lag in my model as a subset to the primary AR(3) model. So the model will look like all the co-efficients from AR(3) + the co-efficient at lag 20 of AR(20). or in other words $Z_t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^3 \phi_iZ_{t-i} + \phi_{20}Z_{t-20} + a_t$ where $a_t$ is white noise. How do I obtain the coefficients $\phi_i$ in R? Should I simply fit the entire time series to AR(20) and manually suppress all $\phi_i, i\in[4,19] = 0$ , regardless of what values it return?
