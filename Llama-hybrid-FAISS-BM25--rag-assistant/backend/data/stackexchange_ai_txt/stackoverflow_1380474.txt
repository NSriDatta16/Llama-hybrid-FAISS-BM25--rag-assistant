Many POS systems have a standalone capability so that the store can continue to trade even if the connection to the in-store server(s) is down. Typically this means a local database for price lookup etc, and local storage of transaction data until the server connection comes back up again. The hardware and licensing costs need to be as low as possible. Hence FoxPro was a good choice a few years ago, but a properly architected .NET application would be an excellent choice today.
