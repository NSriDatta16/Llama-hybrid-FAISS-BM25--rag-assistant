As mentioned in my previous answer you can acheive all that you need using session variables. Since you had mentioned about persisting DIV selection i had asked you to have that in a session variable. If you want other form data to be persisted as well dump them all in session variables(make sure that you clean them up as and when you are done with them) This would be the easiest way for you to meet your requirement. Also you are using Response.AppendHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1. Response.AppendHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0. Response.AppendHeader("Expires", "0"); // Proxies. you can simple use Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private); in your Page_load and acheive the same functionality Let me know if you have any sppecific concerns implementing this.
