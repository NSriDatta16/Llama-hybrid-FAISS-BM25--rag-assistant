For the Maven side, things looks ok, except that facelets should also be provided . Actually, I use the following dependency: javax javaee-api 6.0 provided For the JSF part, nothing in the server logs? Just in case, could you add the following to your web.xml to see if you get more useful output: javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE Development As a side note, you don't need your faces-config.xml as Facelets is the default view handler in JSF 2.0. But this shouldn't be a problem. PS: Personally, I prefer to map the Faces Servlet on something like *.jsf (to clearly de-correlate any mapped url from the actual .xhtml facelet page that will be processed by the Faces Servlet). See also JSF Facelets: Sometimes I see the URL is .jsf and sometimes .xhtml. Why?
