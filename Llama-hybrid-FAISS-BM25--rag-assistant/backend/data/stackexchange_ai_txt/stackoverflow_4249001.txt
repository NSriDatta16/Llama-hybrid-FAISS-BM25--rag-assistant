Drag from a ScrollPane to a target outside of the ScrollPane?

I haven't been able to find a non-hack way to use Drag and Drop with the AS3 ScrollPane component. Here's what I'm doing: I create a container mc, which I then add a bunch of children to. The children are what I want to drag. However, dragging is constrained to the boundaries of the ScrollPane. This seems to me like a limitation of the ScrollPane component. I know it can be worked around with attaching a dupe mc to the cursor pos, then manipulating other mcs on mouse up, but... doesn't that seem kind of lame to everybody? Thanks for any suggestions.
