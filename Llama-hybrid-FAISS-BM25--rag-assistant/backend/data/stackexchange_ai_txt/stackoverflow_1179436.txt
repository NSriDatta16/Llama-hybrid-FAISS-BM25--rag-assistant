Regex: how to determine odd/even number of occurrences of a char preceding a given char?

I would like to replace the | with OR only in unquoted terms, eg: "this | that" | "the | other" -> "this | that" OR "the | other" Yes, I could split on space or quote, get an array and iterate through it, and reconstruct the string, but that seems ... inelegant. So perhaps there's a regex way to do this by counting " s preceding | and obviously odd means the | is quoted and even means unquoted. (Note: Processing doesn't start until there is an even number of " if there is at least one " ).
