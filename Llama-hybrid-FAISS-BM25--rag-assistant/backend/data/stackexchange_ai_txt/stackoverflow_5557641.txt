How can I "reset" to its original state after it has been modified by JavaScript?

I have a DIV with a form in it. When users submit the form and it gets successfully submitted, I replace the form with a simple "everything is good now" message: $("#some_div").html("Yeah all good mate!"); Is there a good way to "reset" the div to its "original state" as per the HTML it has arrived with? I can only think of actually doing something like this: //before I change the DIV var originalState = $("#some_div").html(); //manipulate the DIV //... //push the state back $("#some_div").html(originalState); It doesn't look very elegant - I guess there is a better solution for this, no?
