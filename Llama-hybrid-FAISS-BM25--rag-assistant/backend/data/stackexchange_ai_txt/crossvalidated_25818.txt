Should I remove a variable from a PCA analysis if it is the only variable to load on a component?

I have four continuous variables drawn from secondary data of companies. The combination of these four variable represent my dependent variable. These four variables are real values. They are just only four values with no items. I am using PCA to combine them together. The results I have got are that three variables are categorized under one component and fourth is categoarized alone under the second component. Should I consider these two componenents as two dependent variables, one with three variables and the second one with one variable or should I just delete the second component?
