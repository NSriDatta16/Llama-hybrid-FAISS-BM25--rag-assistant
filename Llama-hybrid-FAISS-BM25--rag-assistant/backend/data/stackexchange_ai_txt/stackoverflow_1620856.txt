The URLs in Magento tell you where the template files are for a certain module. For example, when you're looking for catalogsearch/advanced/ , all template files are location in app /design/frontend/default/your-theme/ . Look inside that folder and it should be obvious. You will have a folder called catalogsearch and inside that a folder called advanced ; inside which there are two files: form.phtml result.phtml
