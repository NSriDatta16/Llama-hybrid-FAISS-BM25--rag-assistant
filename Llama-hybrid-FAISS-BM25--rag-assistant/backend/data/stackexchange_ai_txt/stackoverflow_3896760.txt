Why don't you just use the equivalent T-SQL statements?? Seems much easier and less confusing to me: ALTER TABLE dbo.Table1 ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Table1_Table2 FOREIGN KEY(Table2ID) REFERENCES dbo.Table2(ID) When I read this, I believe this is immediately clear what two tables are involved, and how they are connected ( Table1.Table2ID --(references)--> Table2.ID ) If you want to stay in the SSMS designer world: you could also create a database diagram of your tables involved, and then just drag&drop your Table2ID column from Table1 over to Table2 and drop it onto the ID column there - this would graphically tell SSMS what you want to do, and you just need to review your choices and click OK on the dialog that pops up.
