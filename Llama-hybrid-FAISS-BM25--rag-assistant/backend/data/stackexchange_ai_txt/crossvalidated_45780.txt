Learn a joint distribution from incomplete samples

Suppose I want to learn a joint distribution $p(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ and have a collection of samples $x^k_1, \ldots, x^k_n$ for each $k$. Assume some values $x^k_i$ are unknown, so the samples are incomplete. What are some ways to learn the distribution? I would be interested in an answer for a general distribution, but would also be interested if there is a simpler method for a Bayesian network.
