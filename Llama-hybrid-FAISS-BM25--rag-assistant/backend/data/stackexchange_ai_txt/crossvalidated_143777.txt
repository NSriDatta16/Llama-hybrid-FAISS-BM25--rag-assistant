problems in doing logistic regression with unbalanced sample, give me some references

I have a dataset with lots Y=0 and few Y=1. I have to run logistic regression, so I'm using a retrospective sample in order to get a more balanced sample. Could someone give me some references that explain which are the problems arising when I use logistic regression in an unbalanced sample? I kwow that the main problems are instability of estimated coefficients and poor predictive power of the model, but I need some references.
