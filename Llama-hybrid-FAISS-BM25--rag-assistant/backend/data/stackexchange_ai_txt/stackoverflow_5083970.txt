You cannot perform this kind of rich databinding with the WinForms CheckedListBox. You can set the DataSource and then the DisplayMember and ValueMember properties but from there on in you have to do the rest with code (including setting the Enabled and Checked properties) Set the basic binding as shown below: checkedListBox.DataSource = aList; checkedListBox.DisplayMember = "Name"; checkedListBox.ValueMember = "Name"; From there you will need to iterate over the datasource, setting the individual item properties as needed. One thing that you might be able to do (I haven't tried this but it should work) is subclass the CheckedListBox and but some custom binding code in the new class. That might give you a more elegant solution - removing code from the code behind, though depending on your situation might not be worth the effort.
