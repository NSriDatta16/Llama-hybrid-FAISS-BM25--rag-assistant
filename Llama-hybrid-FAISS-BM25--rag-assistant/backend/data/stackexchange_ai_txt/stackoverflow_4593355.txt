Using BETWEEN in CASE SQL statement

I want to get the avarage rate for all 12 months from our rate table and divide it by months, i started writing an SQL select with case, but i seem to be doing something wrong in the "Between" part..here's my SQL SELECT AVG(SELL_RATE), AVG(BUY_RATE), CASE MONTHS WHEN RATE_DATE( BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-01-31') THEN 'JANUARY' ELSE 'NOTHING' END AS 'MONTHS' FROM RATE WHERE CURRENCY_ID = CURRENCY -033'
