Mark Russinovich wrote an article Inside Windows NT Disk Defragmentation a while ago which gives in-depth details. If you really want to do this I would really advise you to use the built-in facilities for defragmenting. More so, on recent OSes I have never seen a need as a user to even care about defragmenting; it will be done automatically on a schedule and the NTFS folks at MS are definitely smarter at that stuff than you (sorry, but they do this for some time now, you don't).
