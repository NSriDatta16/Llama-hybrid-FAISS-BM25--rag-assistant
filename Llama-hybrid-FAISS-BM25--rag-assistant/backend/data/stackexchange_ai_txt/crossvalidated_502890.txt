Should I balance my dataset for binary classification?

I am running through a binary classification problem. My target variable is unbalanced the 1s are the 13% of the whole dataset and 0s 87%. Total number of observation 697, number of features 709. Features are time series (financial indeces). In here Imbalanced data, SMOTE and feature selection I read that feature selection should be applied before using SMOTE but I am kind of unsure if the balancing is really necessary. And also what kind of procedure if SMOTE (oversampling) or RandomUnderSampler (undersampling). Thanks, Luigi
