How to manage configuration files when collaborating?

I'm writing a short script with a few simple variables at the top of the page. I want to work on them with a friend, but we aren't sure how to manage the variables needing to be changed after pulling each time for one of us, adding unnecessary junk to git status. I thought about just creating different named branches for each of us, and then the master will just have example usernames set, but it seems silly to have to do all that extra work merging. We could have the variables passed to the script as options, but that isn't desired, nor is separating it out to another separate configuration file. It would be great to have something like a .gitignore but for only ignore a few lines in a file. How can this be elegantly managed? How is this problem usually managed?
