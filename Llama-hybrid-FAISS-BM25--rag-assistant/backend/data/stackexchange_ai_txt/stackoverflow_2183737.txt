What's the value of deleteUri ? Are you sure that the SMS has been written to the local storage before you're trying to delete it? If you're handling the SMS_RECEIVED broadcast, it's not guaranteed that the SMS will have been processed by the native SMS app yet... Also, I would note that the SMS content provider API isn't publicly documented by Android and could be subject to change in the future. But if you're only targeting Android 1.5 (or current devices), then you may be ok.
