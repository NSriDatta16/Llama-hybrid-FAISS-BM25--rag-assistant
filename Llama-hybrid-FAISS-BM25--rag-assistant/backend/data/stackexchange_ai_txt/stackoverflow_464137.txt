Embedding BBL File Contents in TeX Source

I need to embed the bibliography information from the .bbl file in the .tex source file. This, according to any number of places from Google, should be as easy as copying the contents of the .bbl file to the .tex file, replace the \bibliography{} command. However, when I do this, I get the following error: ./Witmer.tex:82: Undefined control sequence. \@listctr l.82 \bibitem{bhole-ner_over_time} The control sequence at the end of the top line of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue, and I'll forget about whatever was undefined. ./source.tex:82: You can't use `\relax' after \the. \c@ l.82 \bibitem{bhole-ner_over_time} I'm forgetting what you said and using zero instead. I have no idea what the problem is at this point. I'm including the cite package, and all is well when I use the .bbl file. I'm generating the bbl file with bibtex. The relevant section of the document: \bibliographystyle{plain} \begin{thebibliography}{9} ...trimmed for size... \bibitem{geo-spatialexpressions} Annette Herskovits. \newblock {\em Representation and processing of spatial expressions}. \newblock Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Mahwah, NJ, USA, 1998. \end{thebibliography} Update: Here's the problem and the proposed fix: The error basically means that the bibliography generation code is expecting that there should be some arguments to each \bibitem: \bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Herskovits}{1998}]{geo-spatialexpressions} Herskovits, A. \newblock 1998. \newblock {\em Representation and processing of spatial expressions}. \newblock Mahwah, NJ, USA: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. I was actually trying to use a style file that was messing with the definitions of \cite and the bibliography generation.
