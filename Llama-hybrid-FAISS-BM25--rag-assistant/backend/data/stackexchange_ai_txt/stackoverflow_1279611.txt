To achieve this effect: Group Header Record 1 Record 2 Record 3 Record 4 Record 5 Record 6 We had to manually organize our data like this: Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 And then we assigned numbers (0 to row count - 1) to each record. If the record mod column count was 0, update the first column. If 1, update the second column. Etc. As far as I know, there is no other way to do it.
