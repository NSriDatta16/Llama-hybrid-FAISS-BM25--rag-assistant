What is the best way to meaningfully compare the feature importances between parametric (Logit) and non-parametric models (RFs/XGB)?

I have applied 3 different models (Logit, RF and XGB) to my dataset with the aim of investigating their individual predictive performance. I have found the feature importance of the logistic regression model using the coefficients, and of the non-parametric models using the square root of the respective feature_importance_ attribute. The results are meaningful in that they allow me to compare which features are more important for each model individually, but I am unsure if I am able to compare across models using this data. For example, see the plots below of the feature importances. I want to be able to say, as an example, that the XGB model places more importance on the least important features than the Logit model, exhibited by the larger area around the inner circle of radius 0.2. Would this conclusion be sensible? If not, what would be the best way to approach this comparison, or is comparing across these models not good practice?
