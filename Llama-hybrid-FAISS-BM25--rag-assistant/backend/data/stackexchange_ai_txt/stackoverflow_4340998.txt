Some applications modify the actual call-in-progress screen, and I know the CityID thing that came pre-installed on my Fascinate (Tells me the city associated with the area code of the number being dialed or incoming) was able to interrupt a call right before it dialed the number to tell me to register the software. If you can make your own (full-screen) call-in-progress view then it sounds like you have a solution. Perhaps not the most elegant, but it solves the problem. I know this is possible to do because Opera-mini can go "full screen" and you can't drag down the task menu from the top; it is not visible to the user while in "full screen" mode.
