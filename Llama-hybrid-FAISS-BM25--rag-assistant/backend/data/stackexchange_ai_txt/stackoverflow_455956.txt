A bit of a curiosity: the hash trie saves space by interleaving in memory the key-arrays of trie nodes that happen not to collide. That is, if node 1 has keys A,B,D while node 2 has keys C,X,Y,Z, for example, then you can use the same contiguous storage for both nodes at once. It's generalized to different offsets and an arbitrary number of nodes; Knuth used this in his most-common-words program in Literate Programming . So this gives O(1) access to the keys of any given node, without reserving contiguous storage to it, albeit using contiguous storage for all nodes collectively.
