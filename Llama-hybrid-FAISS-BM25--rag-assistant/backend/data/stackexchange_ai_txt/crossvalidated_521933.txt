SARIMA with a year to year dataset

I have a time series dataset that has yearly data points, and we can see that there is recurring pattern every few years My question is : can I use SARIMA with this model, by changing my dataset as a time series dataset that has a frequency? as technically speaking there are no seasonality components, would that be frowned upon?
