high speed logging using log4net

I am interested in very high speed logging within log4net(around 10K messages per second). to that end i thought of implementing the following modules: protocol buffers based Layout (IRawlayout) - for superior serialization performance shared memory appender and Plugin - to reduce IPC between the logging application and the logging server. is this the way to integrate those technologies? i also considered using ETW within log4net but they seem to be too different to be elegantly intergrated.
