WinForms - DataGridView Inherits style from GroupBox

I have a weird problem, and I don't know if this is the default behaviour of .Net DataGridView inside a GroupBox/TabControl. I've created a new WinForm project from scratch, and created a GroupBox(changed the text style). Like this: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/65f5f2762d.png Then, I've created a simple DataGridView, no font style at all, like this: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/09f55f951a.png Then, in design mode, I dragged the DataGridView inside the GroupBox, and this sort of magic just happened: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/d0334132f0.png My question is, can I disable this behaviour? Cause if I chage the DataGridView style outside the GroupBox and then drag it into, lost all the style. Just for the record, this form has NO CODE at all. Thanks in advance.
