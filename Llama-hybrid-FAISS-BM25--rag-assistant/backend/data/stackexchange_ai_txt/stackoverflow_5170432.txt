As I understand from here Remote BLOB Storage is "an add-on feature pack for Microsoft SQL Server 2008" that USES the FILESTREAM feature of SQL 2008 R2 to store the files Sharepoint deals with. FILESTREAM allows large binary blocks of data to be stored not in the database, but outside on a specifically dedicated folder keeping the actual database small (and fast). With FILESTREAM uploading this data is also faster since the data doesn't need to be partioned into SQL's 8KB Pages. Note that backups still also backup this data. In fact, the whole thing is quite transparent to the connecting applications.
