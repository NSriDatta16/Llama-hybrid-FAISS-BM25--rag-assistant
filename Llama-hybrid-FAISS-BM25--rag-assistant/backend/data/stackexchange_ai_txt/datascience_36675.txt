The chicken egg dilemma What came first: the labeled data or the machine learning model? If you have labeled data, then you can train a machine learning model. If you have a trained machine learning model, then you can label data. Precision vs. Recall Suppose you are in case 2 (you have a model). Then how is the precision and recall of your model? Unless both are $100\%$, you might still want to label data. recall 100% | Most people will be at the lower-right quadrant (precision and recall will be $\lt100\%$). The goal will be to get as close as possible to $100\%$. Therefore, the model will output labels which can be the basis for manual labeling. Your case If you can label all rows with some rules and you are creating these rules, then, in fact, you are already manually labeling data. Further, you could use a decision tree later on, to model all your rules in order to deal with new data points that come your way.
