Object localization and text extraction using VGG

I'm new to Computer Vision and training a TensorFlow neural network using VGG16. The problem is quite simple: I'm training in a custom dataset to detect and localize numbers in a 100x100 image. The numbers (0 to 9) can appear in all x and y within the 100x100 image size. The model works very well when a single object (number) appears. However, when I have multiple objects in the image, the model can not handle the task. The expected result is something like this: How can I do it? The problem is in the model.predict() and how I pass the image, but I don't have a clue of what to do now.
