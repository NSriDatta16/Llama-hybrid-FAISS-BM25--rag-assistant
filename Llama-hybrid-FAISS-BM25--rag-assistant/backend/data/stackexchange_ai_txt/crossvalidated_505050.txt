What value for recall implies a logistic regression model is good?

I'm studying logistic regression using Python and about metrics to have a good model, I know this three: accuracy, precision and recall. In the same way, I was studying using a dataset about ads in social networks using the feature Year (years old of the customer) to estimate if these customers will purchase the advertised product. So, at the end my model's metrics were: Accuracy: 0.9375 Precision: 0.9473684210526315 Recall: 0.8181818181818182 Are these good metrics for my model?
