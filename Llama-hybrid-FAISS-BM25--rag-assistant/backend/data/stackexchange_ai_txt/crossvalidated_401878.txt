Understanding Strength and Correlation in Random Forest

In the original paper of Random Forest , the author introduces a concept of strength and correlation. In the appendix section, a step by step guide to calculating these values are given for the bootstrapping case. I have few doubts in this section. What does $sd(\theta)$ signify? (equation A2). As suggested by this paper , how the variance of margin is the correlation of two trees? From RF paper the equation of correlation is given by $$\bar{\rho} = \frac{var(margin)}{(E_{\theta}(sd(\theta)))^2}$$ where $\theta$ is a tree in a random forest.
