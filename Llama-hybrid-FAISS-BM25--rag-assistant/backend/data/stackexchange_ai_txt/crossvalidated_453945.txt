The usual way to assess predictive uncertainty for logistic regression is using cross-validation. If you want something that sort of looks like the OLS prediction interval, you can use something like below: import numpy as np import statsmodels.api as sm import pandas as pd from scipy.stats.distributions import norm n, p = 200, 3 # Generate data x = np.random.normal(size=(n, p)) par = np.r_[1, 0, -1] lpr = np.dot(x, par) pr = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-lpr)) y = (np.random.uniform(size=n) The bottom five lines are a plug-in estimate of the probability that the observed value and predicted value are the same, for each case.
