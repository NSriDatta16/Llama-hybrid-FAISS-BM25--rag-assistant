How to compute bits per character (BPC)?

In one of Alex Graves' papers (and several other authors as well) utilize the term bits per character (BPC). The paper that I am referencing here is "Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks" ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850 ). In the paper he defines BPC as $-\log_2 P(x_{t+1} | y_t)$, which is defined in Section 3.1 and results are shown in Table 1. How is this exactly calculated, especially when it comes to a recurrent neural network, such as a char-rnn? For example, given the input and prediction of a recurrent neural network, how do I compute this bits per character? Also, this question addresses this ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17797922/how-to-calculate-bits-per-character-of-a-string-bpc ) but none of the answers explain how it is calculated, especially when it comes to a RNN.
