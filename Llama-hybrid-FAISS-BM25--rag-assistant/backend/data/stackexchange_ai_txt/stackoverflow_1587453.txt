You should support both, from the beginning, because they fullfill different roles: the script-based build is the master: it's the only one used to create the final release, ideally used on a build machine. Use it for continuous, deployment and nightly builds the IDE-base build is left to the developers to maintain. If you use Eclipse, you should leverage WTP for web applications, for example. The idea is that as soon as you check in some code, it is validated using the master build system: you give your developers the freedom to choose their tool but still enforcing a common build system.
