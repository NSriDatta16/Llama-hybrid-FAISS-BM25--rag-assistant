How can I assess case-level uncertainty of classification using logistic regression?

I'm hoping to fit a binary logistic regression to be used to predict the binary outcome for new cases/observations. I'm wondering if there is any way to gauge uncertainty of a prediction for individual cases - for example, if I use my model to predict the binary outcome in 500 cases (which were not used to build the model), for each case, is it possible to get an idea of how certain the predicted outcome is? Since the outcome of logistic regression is a probability between 0 and 1, with a probability 0.5 corresponding to the binary outcome 1, is it logical to assume that how close the predicted probability for an individual case is to 1 or 0 corresponds to the uncertainty of the estimate for that case? If not, is there another way to achieve this, or a classification method other than logistic regression that might be more suitable? Hope this makes sense, thanks!
