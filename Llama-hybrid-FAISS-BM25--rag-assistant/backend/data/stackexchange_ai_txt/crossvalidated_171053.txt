Since both lines have positive skewness, I can infer that on average the amount of socks produced for both lines is less than the average. There is at least an outliner (e.g.: a day or days) that the workers generate more socks than expected. The first line is more positively skewed than the second line. A possible explanation is that workers work extremely hard on the days they know their boss come to visit them. The boss visits the first assembly line more often than the second line.
