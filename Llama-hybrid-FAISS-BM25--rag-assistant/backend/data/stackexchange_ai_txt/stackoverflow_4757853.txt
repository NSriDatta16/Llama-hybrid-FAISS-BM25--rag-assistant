It's impossible to say without knowing the exact specifications of your system, including system resources, number of users etc. Given that you will have very few update sources and many just viewing the data it would certainly be possible to implement this in XML. Depending on how you've built the auto-refresh function of the commentary you might already be using XML to send updates back. I suspect that whichever system you choose the main performance enhancement you could make would be to ensure that data that is frequently accessed is cached in memory and refreshed only when your data storage is updated.
