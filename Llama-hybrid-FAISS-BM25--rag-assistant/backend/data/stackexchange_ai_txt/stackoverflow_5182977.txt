You'll have to subscribe to the CollectionChanged event of _Organizations and refresh _OrganizationManagement. To preserve the bindings use something like this: private ObservableCollection _Organizations = new ObservableCollection (); private ObservableCollection _OrganizationManagement; GridOrganizationManagement.ItemsSource = _OrganizationManagement; _Organisations.CollectionChanged += (s,e) => { var newlist = new ObservableCollection (_Organizations.Where(p => p.Type == "DealerGroup").ToList()); _OrganizationManagement.Clear(); foreach(var o in newlist) _OrganizationManagement.Add(o); }
