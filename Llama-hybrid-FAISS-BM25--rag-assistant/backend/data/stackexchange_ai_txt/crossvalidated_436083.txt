Time series data can have both auto-projective structure as well as latent deterministic structure i.e. the presence and waiting to be doscovered structue (pulses, level/ste shifts,seasonal pulses and/or local time trends ). The idea here is to identify both. Closely follow the work of Tsay here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html and for a sometime useful software follow https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsoutliers/tsoutliers.pdf which requires the user to pre-specify the form of the auto-projective structure (arima). If the arima structure is not known then one needs to SIMULTANEOUSLY identify both as suggested here https://autobox.com/pdfs/ARIMA%20FLOW%20CHART.pdf in aniterative self-checking manner
