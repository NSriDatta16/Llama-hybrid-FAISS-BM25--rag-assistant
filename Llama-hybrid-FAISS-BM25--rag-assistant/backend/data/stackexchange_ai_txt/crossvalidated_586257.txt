Linear discriminant analysis-Do we maximize posterior or joint distribution?

My understanding is that in LDA, we maximize the joint density $ P(X,y) $ using $P(X|y)$ rather than posterior density $P(y|X)$ using $P(X|y)$ . In the book "Introduction to Statistical learning with R", the authors say otherwise. Though they do not provide a derivation, they say the expressions for $P(y|X)$ are to be maximised. https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf See equation 4.15 and 4.17 and paragraphs around them.
