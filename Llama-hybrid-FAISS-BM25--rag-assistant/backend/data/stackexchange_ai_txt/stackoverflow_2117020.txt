Insert a break point at NSDictionary *choresDictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary:[self createDictionaryFromChoreList]]; now when you step out drag your mouse over choresDictionary and check in the tooltip that its size is not 0x0 or you can simply do an NSLog of the choresDictionary like NSLog(@"%@",choresDictionary); I think your dictionary has 0 key key value pairs thats why you are getting null into your documents folder.
