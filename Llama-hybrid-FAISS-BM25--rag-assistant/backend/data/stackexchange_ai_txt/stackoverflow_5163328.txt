Unit testing singleton pattern method __clone() in php

I'm currently working on unit testing of a custom class I made, which is based on the singleton design pattern. Based on the code coverage report I have 95.45% of it covered. I am using PHPUnit to do the unit testing and I have been through this article by Sebastian Bergmann. The only problem I am left with is testing against class cloning throught the magic method __clone() . I have set that method as private to avoid instantiation private final function __clone() {} What would be the best way to write a test to make sure that the singleton isn't "clonable". (The same test could eventually be used to test the __constructor() ) Not really a question but is it just me or the tests runs awfully slow on a windows box compared to a *nix box?
