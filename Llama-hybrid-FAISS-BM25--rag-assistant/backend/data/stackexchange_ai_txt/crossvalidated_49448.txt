If you are looking for something introductory, I suggest you to have a look at John Kruschke's "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis". It's fun (believe me!) and not too technical, and will certainly work as an introduction to some of the topics you mentioned. It is really oriented as a "recipe-book". I mean, you will find some theoretical stuff and fundaments, but not in detail, because this was obviously written for people who need to conduct sound Bayesian data analysis right now. The book uses R and BUGS, but the scripts are available for JAGS too. I really recommend it, unless you are looking for more advanced stuff.
