GEE vs. fitting a simple model to each subject and then test the parameters across subjects

In my experiments, participants (N=50) are asked to play a decision-making game several times. I am interested in testing whether a certain factor "F" (present/absent) influences participants' decisions "D" ("chose D"/"didn't choose D"). I have run a GEE logistic regression in order to account for the repeated measures in the model. The editor of the manuscript isn't very fond of GEE (mostly because he "doesn't understand it very well"). Instead, he suggests we "fit a simple model to each subject and then test the parameters across subjects". To him, this approach is more straightforward. To me it sounds that running N regressions, and then running a t-test on the betas (if this is what he is suggesting) would mean losing a lot of power. I am looking for some evidence for this potential loss of power, or any other argument that indicates that in this situation, GEE is preferable to a two-step random effect analysis. Thanks in advance!
