What is the best structure to implement an Identity Map?

Although a DataTable is a memory hog, wouldn't a DataTable be the best choice to implement and IdentityMap if the set of objects is very large since retrieval time is O(1)? Update If I decide to use IDictionary, do I sacrifice speed when retrieving my objects?
