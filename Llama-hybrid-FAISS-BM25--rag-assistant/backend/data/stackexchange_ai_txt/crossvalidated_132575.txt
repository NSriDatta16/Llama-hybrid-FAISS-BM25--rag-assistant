Interpreting output of Cox regression model

I am trying to use two variables - activity score (ascore - a whole number indicating amount of activity) and gini (given by Gini-Simpson index - a value ranging between 0 and 1, indicating diversity of activity) to predict number of days they survived. Call: coxph(formula = Surv(NumDays, failed) ~ ascore + gini, data = records1) n= 47966, number of events= 39853 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) ascore -2.801e-03 9.972e-01 5.634e-05 -49.72 If my understanding of the above model is right, what this is saying is holding the other covariate constant, ​one​ additional activity ​reduces the hazard of animal dying by a factor of exp(ascore) = 0.9972 on an average that is by 0.28 percent while a unit of diversity(gini) causes a reduction in the hazard of animal dying by a factor of exp(ead) = 0.7761 on an average that is by 25.35 percent.​ Now a unit of activity is easily understandable to be 1 additional activity. But what does unit of diversity mean when I take gini which ranges from 0 to 1? So, what does a one unit rise in Gini-Simpson indicate? Also, how do I define what the original hazard is based on my model?
