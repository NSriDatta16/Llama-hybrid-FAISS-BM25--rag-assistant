While there may be hell of a lot of Big Data being produced by the mobile devices and such, there is little usable data in it. If you want to predict the urban travel patterns using foursquare, you may be off by an order of magnitude in estimated flows. Worse, you won't know if you are overestimated or underestimating these flows. You can get an insanely accurate picture of the urban travel patterns of maniacal foursquare users, but unless everyone is required (1) to keep a working smartphone, (2) to run the foursquare app all the time, and (3) to register at any place they stay at for longer than 10 minutes (i.e., get an electronic Census; let libertarians complain about Google and Facebook knowing everything about you), your data will contain unknown biases, and your electronic Deweys will continue to defeat the real-word Trumans (clickable): (source: whatisasurvey.info ) If anything, I would expect that this piece of history will be repeating itself, and some big "beer+diapers" forecasts produced from Big Data would be overturned by researchers using more rigorous sampling approaches. It is surprising that probability-based surveys remain accurate even despite falling response rates.
