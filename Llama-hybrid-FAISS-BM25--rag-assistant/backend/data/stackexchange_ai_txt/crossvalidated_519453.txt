Note that being tractable doesn't mean not scale invariant . For example, PCA is tractable but not scale invariant. Now let's look at the solution. $$\hat{\beta} = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1}X^TY$$ We have just one penalisation parameter, $\lambda$ which is added to $X^T X$ to form the penalty. Regardless of the units of each variable (columns of $X$ ) we have the same penalty. If I had $x_1$ in meters but then converted to km with the same penalty I wouldn't achieve the same fit to the data. Lets consider a simple numerical example, two variables with some R code. The main thing to consider is that, under OLS, if I multiply $x_1$ by a factor $k$ then the new $\beta_1$ would be divided by $k$ . In this numerical example I multiply $x_1$ by $100$ , but we can see that the resulting $\beta_1$ is only divided by $90$ . However, under OLS I recover this scaling factor of $100$ . set.seed(134221) x1 $coefficients[2]/fit1$ coefficients[2] [1] 100
