When you are saving, you are calling GetMachineStoreForDomain, but when you are retrieving, you are calling GetMachineStoreForAssembly. GetMachineStoreForAssembly is scoped to the assembly that the code is executing in, while the GetMachineStoreForDomain is scoped to the currently running AppDomain and the assembly where the code is executing. Just change your these calls to GetMachineStoreForApplication, and it should work.
