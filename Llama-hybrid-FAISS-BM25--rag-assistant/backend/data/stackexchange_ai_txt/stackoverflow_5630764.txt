You have a few more problems with elegance and other things that matter more. For a start your users would revolt against having to type a 0 that you don't do anything meaningful with. In fact you need to dedicate code to ignoring it! Keeping the count of consonants in the dict is rather inelegant. You don't check whether the user typed all letters. You don't handle uppercase. Here's some code that addresses those issues plus a few verbosities: input = "" # get input from user while len(input) != 3 or not input.isalpha(): input = raw_input("insert code:").lower() ocurrances = {"a":0, "e":0, "i":0, "o":0, "u":0} nconsonants = 0 for x in input: if x in ocurrances: ocurrances[x] += 1 #count vowels else: nconsonants += 1 #count consonants for x in ocurrances: if ocurrances[x]: print x + ",", print "were inserted", for x in ocurrances: if ocurrances[x]: print str(ocurrances[x]) + ",", print "times respectively" if nconsonants == 1: print "there was 1 consonant" else: print "there were %d consonants" % nconsonants and you might like to change "ocurrances" to "occurrences". By the way, if the number of vowels is less than 2, the output is not very pretty.
