You might review the TransferMode property of your binding to see if you meet the requirements to change it from its default value of "Buffered", to " Streamed " or " StreamedResponse ". Also, review the values for maxBufferPoolSize and maxBufferSize . Increasing the size of the internal buffers used can help with memory utilization, especially with processing large messages. maxReceivedMessageSize is also likely already set if your receiving large messages, but I would review that value as well. I've seen one of the values above, if your exceeding the threshold, fail with an obscure, memory related message. The original exception was actually hidden by the message that was surfaced to my application. Enabling WCF Tracing helped diagnose the problem and see the real error - I needed to increase the value of one, or more, of the binding properties above. I didn't get the feel for the binding your using from your post, but I believe that these settings are common across major ones. Check out MSDN documentation on basicHttpBinding for example. If it is truly LOH fragmentation there isn't anything to be done about it once tuning efforts have been exhausted. Rolling recycle of the application might be required to mitigate it (I hate recommending that) but if you've exhausted other efforts you might be left with that.
