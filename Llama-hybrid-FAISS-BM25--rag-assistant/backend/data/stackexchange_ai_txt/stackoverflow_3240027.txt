Modal views and touchesBegan

This question is a follow on from the following: UITouch - Event not responding I done more research and I know what the problem is, but I don't know how to solve it or even if it can be solved. I may have to take a new approach. I have a RootViewController and from this I load a second ViewController using the following code: [self presentModalViewController:newWorkoutViewController animated:YES]; I then have the following code in place in NewWorkoutViewController: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"New Workout Screen tapped"); } This method is not being actioned, I think this is because its a modal view. Is there anyway to detect taps on the screen in a modal view. Thanks Stephen
