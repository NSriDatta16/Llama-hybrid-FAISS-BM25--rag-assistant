CSS: Alternative method to positon absolute

I have the following mark up: Hello World Bye But i would like to have a paragraph of text under the 'playArea' div, but because all the divs inside playArea is absolute, the text doesnt appear at the bottom of the last absolute positioned div. I have looked into this and found an alternative by using float:left and clear:left however after using this method on the first div, you cannot position the div correctly as the starting point of the second div is under the first div and not at (0,0). Any ideas of how i can get by this. Thanks
