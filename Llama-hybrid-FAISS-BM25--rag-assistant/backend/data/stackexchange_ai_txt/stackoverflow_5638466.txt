Have fun playing with userData . Apparently it does what you want in IE6/7 Then localStorage for IE8/9 Or you can use the heavier store.js which does the feature detection for you and apparently works in IE6+. It should work in IE9 but no garantuees. I would recommend store.js as it's easier for maintenance and just works out of the box. You can also support other browsers that way.
