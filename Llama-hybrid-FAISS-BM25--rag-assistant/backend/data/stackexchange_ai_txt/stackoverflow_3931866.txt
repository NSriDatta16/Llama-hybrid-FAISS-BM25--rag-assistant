Well I commented already. Don't do JavaScript and any kind of login! But I am a nice guy so I'm still trying to help. Try the following (or check out the live example here: http://www.jsfiddle.net/spyAB/1/ ): function validate(loginForm) { var booValid = true; var strErrorMessage = ""; var minLength = 5; var maxLength = 10; if (loginForm.pword.value.length maxLength) { strErrorMessage = "pasword must not more than 10 characters\n"; booValid = false; } if (loginForm.loginid.value != "jss1@yahoo.com.au" && loginForm.loginid.value != "jss1@yahoo.com.au" && loginForm.loginid.value != "jss1@yahoo.com.au") { strErrorMessage += "Incorrect Login ID, Please try again\n"; booValid = false; } if (!booValid) { alert(strErrorMessage); } } You had one thing wrong: Why not compare the value of the pword field directly to your string instead of going for indexOf ? Are you using dropdown boxes? Also I took the liberty to insert += to your strErrorMessage as to concatenate the message with the previous password message. Also your return booValid was unnecessary. PS: I hope jss1@yahoo.com.au are not your real e-mail addresses. Never post your e-mail address in plain text like this or the spam bots will hunt you down.
