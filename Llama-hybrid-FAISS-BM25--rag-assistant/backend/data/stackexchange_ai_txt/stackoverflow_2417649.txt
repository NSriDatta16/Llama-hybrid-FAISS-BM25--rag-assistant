Whatever you do, it is giong to be terrible because it will involve: * Getting the total "weights" for all columns as ONE number (including applying the multiplier). * Getting a random number between 0 and that total. * Getting all entries and runing them along, deducting the weight from the random number and choosing the one entry when you run out of items. In average you will run along half the table. Performance - unless the table is small, then do it outside mySQL in memory - will be SLOW.
