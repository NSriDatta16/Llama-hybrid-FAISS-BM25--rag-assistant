Under what circumstance does $P(X|H) = P(H|X)$?

I came across a Machine Learning exam question regarding the difference between the Frequentist and Bayesian approach to classification; it specifically asked what condition must be met for the two to be equivalent. Formulating a mathematical answer isn't too tricky. Our hypothesis is that an observation $X$ from our dataset belongs to a particular class $H$, and we want the conditional probabilities to be equal such that: $$P(X|H) = P(H|X)$$ Apply Bayes theorem: $$ P(X|H) = \frac{P(X|H)P(H)}{P(X)}\ $$ Which simplifies to: $$ P(X) = P(H) $$ That's as far as I can get with respect to solving the problem. I have no idea how to put this into words, or give an example where this condition would be satisfied. Can someone please provide an intuitive explanation?
