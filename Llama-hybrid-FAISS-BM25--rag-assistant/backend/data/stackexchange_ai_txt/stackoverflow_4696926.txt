Please can you go and download this test application which mirrors exactly the scenario you are talking about: https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0Bw_NnV9fhgmgMThjNDgzOTgtODNiOC00NDE1LWEyMTYtNzVhOTMyNzlmZjZk&hl=en&authkey=CMuupNkC I've just created this. It's a service that effectively uses the same code as you. The only difference is that I have used the toolbox to drag and drop an eventlog on to the service designer - setting the log to 'Application' and the source to 'Service1'. Open a VS command prompt at the project folder, go to bin\debug and run installutil windowsservice1.exe - specifying some credentials (so you're installing the dev service directly from your bin output folder). Start the service and monitor the application log - it will write every ten seconds as you expect to see from your code. Assuming this works on your machine(tm) like it does on my machine(tm) then I would suggest that the problem is the event logging itself, or, horror of horrors - your service isn't running from your build output folder (most of the devs in my team insist on running their dev services from a different folder and then swear when they forget to actually update the binaries when they start debugging it!). As I suggested in my comment, you really need to be able to attach the debugger to this and breakpoint the callback to verify that it's not getting fired. I never rely on the eventlog for diagnostics messages simply because the log might be full, or permissions might prevent you etc etc - it might be a windows platform component, but it's not as reliable as I would like. The debugger, however, rarely lies (unless the deployed binaries are out of date ;) ). Compile a debug build of your project and make sure it's the one that is installed in the services list , start it up and then attach directly to the service exe (there's no point trying to attach to [service].vshost.exe - VS cannot auto-attach or host windows services as the only way they can run is via svchost.exe shelling them). Hope this helps.
