ObjectDataProvider in MVVM not necessary?

I have created a simple MVVM, with only three classes CashFlowView, CashFlowViewModel, CashFlowModel. I use an infragistic's 9.1 XamDataPresenter (or xamDataGrid). Inside my ViewModel: public ObservableCollection GetCashFlows() { return new ObservableCollection () { ... }; } ViewModel is connected to View by this: this.DataContext = new CashflowViewModel(); As long as I connect the grid to the ObjectDataProvider its perfectly running fine. But I wished I could just connect to a property within my ViewModel instead. According to Infragistics all I have to do is this: But in this case it seems I need to bind to a collection of another ViewModel to represent my rows inside the grid. And thats where I get confused. I tried this and it doesnt work: Inside the ViewModel: public ObservableCollection CashFlows { get { return new ObservableCollection (); } } But how do I create my second ViewModel (CashflowDataGridViewModel) ? I tried adding this proprty within this second ViewModel: public CashflowModel CashFlow { get { return new CashflowModel() {...}; } } But all I get shown on my view is "Cashflow" column header without any of the underlying headers of the actual cashflowModel class.
