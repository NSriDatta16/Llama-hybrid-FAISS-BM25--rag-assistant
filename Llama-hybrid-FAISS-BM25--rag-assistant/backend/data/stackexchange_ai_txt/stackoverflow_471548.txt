Moving a menu in Visual C#

I have a menu with the following structure (simplified for illustration purposes): Menu Bar |--File | |--Save | |--Exit |--Tools | |--Tool Category 1 | |--Tool Category 2 | |--Tool Category 3 |--Help |--About I want to reconstruct this as follows: Menu Bar |--File | |--Save | |--Exit |--Tool Category 1 |--Tool Category 2 |--Tool Category 3 |--Help |--About However, in Visual Studio 2008 Pro it won't let me drag these menu items other than reorganize them within the particular menu group they are already in. Is there a way for me to move them without completely rebuilding the menu bar? Note that there are actually many more menu items than those that I've shown.
