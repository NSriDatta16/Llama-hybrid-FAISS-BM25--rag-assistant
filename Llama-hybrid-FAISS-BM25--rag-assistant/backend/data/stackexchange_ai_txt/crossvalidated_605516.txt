I'm not equipped to answer all of these questions (I'm trying to figure out how to work with gamm4 models myself, and there appears to be a dearth of information on them). For a general background on using splines, I've found the following youtube tutorial to be useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgw4cu8hrZM , but it doesn't get into the peculiarities of gamm4 and its output at all. With that caveat, here are a few pointers that might help you (or others if you've already moved on) I'm not sure why you would want a continuous variable in the "by" statement. This is asking the model to create a separate smooth for each value of April_temp . Is that really what you want? (This, and other options, are explained in the video above). If you really want to put April_temp as a by variable in the spline, it should also be listed in the model, probably as a factor? If you want to estimate a different smooth for each value of WNS, then it needs to be included both inside and outside the smooth. If you want the same smooth with a different intercept, it would only be listed outside the smooth. Again, I found the video on youtube to be the most useful for interpreting splines in general. For combining information from the mer and gam components of the output? I'm still working on that! The youtube tutorial does cover model checking, but not all of them will get created automatically when using gamm4. That would be a good place to start though. Hopefully this helps address some of the questions. I've tended to move towards Bayesian models when I have random effects, non-linear responses, and splines to improve on my ability to check models, and perform hypothesis testing over time.
