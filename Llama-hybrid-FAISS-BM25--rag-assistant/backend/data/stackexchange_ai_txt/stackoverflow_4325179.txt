In addition to the responses here, I would add that frameworks often encourage programming practices that can lead to code reuse for future projects (especially MVC controllers). Well written code can often be adapted for use in another project, but I have had more success using modules as-is when then they are framework-based. I will also say that as someone with 17 years of professional experience, that I write better code when I am working within the restrictions of a framework. I think this is because my code ends up being more consistent and the conventions of the framework prevent me from cutting corners / taking shortcuts.
