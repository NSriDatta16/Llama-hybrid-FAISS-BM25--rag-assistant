Is a convolutional neural network unbiased? Is it a regularized multilayer perceptron?

"Is a convolutional neural network biased?" This came up in an interview I had a few years ago, and I’ve recently thought of it. I think it’s a misguided question. Imagine this related question. “Is a linear model biased?” I am not even sure what that means. Certainly we can say that the parameter estimates are unbiased under standard assumptions and the OLS estimator $\hat{\beta}_{ols}=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ , but we get a biased parameter estimate if we use regularized regression like ridge or LASSO. But it’s the same model either way, $\mathbb{E}[Y\vert X] = X\beta$ , just different ways of estimating the parameters. Back to CNNs, here’s what I think of a basic CNN with one $2\times 2$ filter over a $3\times 3$ image. We have one parameter per color, and instead of drawing connections from (for instance) the top left pixel to the bottom hidden neuron, CNN sets that weight as $0$ , so I have not drawn in a connection. Therefore, by forcing many parameters to be $0$ and others to be equal to each other, we regularize the fully-connected network that has the same number of neurons in the hidden layer (each pixel connected to each hidden neuron for a total of 36 parameters). That makes the CNN parameter vector biased (if the fully-connected later is unbiased). Throw in some maxpooling, and it certainly would be biased! Is this about right?
