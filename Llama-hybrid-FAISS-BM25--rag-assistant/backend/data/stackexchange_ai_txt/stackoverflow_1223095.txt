Lastly, if anyone has any other suggestions or tips that can help improve storage utilization, query performance and/or ease of use The StringListproperty is the way to go for the reasons mentioned above, but in actual usage one might want to add the geocells to ones own previously existing StringList so one could query against multiple properties. So, if you were to provide a lower level api it could work with full text search implementations like bill katz's def point2StringList(Point, stub="blah"): ..... return ["blah_1:a", "blah_2":"a3", "blah_3":"a3f" ....] def boundingbox2Wheresnippet(Box, stringlist="words", stub="blah"): ..... return "words='%s_3:a3f' AND words='%s_3:b4g' ..." %(stub) etc.
