A few ideas: Does the slow Windows box have a heavily fragmented hard-drive? Is it a specific database query that's taking a long time once the application is running, or are all interactions slow? Are the project files on a local filesystem? Is the database on a local filesystem? If so, does it have the same size data set as the other machines? If not, are they on different subnets or have different bandwidth available?
