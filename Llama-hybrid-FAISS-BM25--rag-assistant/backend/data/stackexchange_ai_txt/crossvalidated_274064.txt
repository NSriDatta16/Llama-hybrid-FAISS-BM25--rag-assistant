I think you had a small typo / error and dropped a $\alpha E[y_t^2]$ term. Your second bit of algebra is moving towards writing an AR(1) as an MA($\infty$) process, that is, the AR(1)'s World Representation. Other comments: A nice online text on time-series I like is https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/time_series_book.pdf The time series bible is probably Time Series Analysis by Hamilton.
