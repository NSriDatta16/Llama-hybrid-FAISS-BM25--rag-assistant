Best Way to Synchronize Multiple Excel Files to MS Access Table

We have a number of Excel-based membership rosters for a non-profit organization and we need to merge these into one master MS Access table. From time to time, we receive updated copies of the Excel-based membership rosters and I need to synchronize these with the master MS Access table. I'm looking for the optimal way to accomplish this. Since I am not a huge fan of Access VBA, I was thinking of writing a C# console app,leveraging Marcos Meli's FileHelpers library to communicate between Excel and Access. Do you have any recommendations for either a good approach for building myself or something off-the-shelf that could be used to accomplish this objective?
