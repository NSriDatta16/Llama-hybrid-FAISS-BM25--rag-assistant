Don't confuse the "mean" with the "median". There are always half members on each side of the "median", not the "mean". To illustrate, as an example, consider a group of 100 people, among them 35 have higher incomes, say, each has 1 million dollars per year, while other 65 have lower incomes, each has 0.1 million dollars per year. The mean (average) income for each person then is (35+6.5)/100 = 0.415 millions. Obviously, 65% of the group have their incomes below the mean.
