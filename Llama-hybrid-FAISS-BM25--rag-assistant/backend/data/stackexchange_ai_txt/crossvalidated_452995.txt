Evaluation clustering methods with external indices

I know this topic is kind of a recorrent question. I want to evaluate clustering methods, however I don't know which method to use because they are so many. There is precision and recall, there are external validity indices like jaccard, rand , ari, folkes-mallow, etc.. and there is the correct classification rate (CCR). I think precision, reccal and f1 are more used in the information retrieval context and not clustering. For evaluation of clustering methods should I use the external indices? Or should I use CCR? Is CCR considered a external validity indice? (Assuming I know the real clusters in data with simulated data)
