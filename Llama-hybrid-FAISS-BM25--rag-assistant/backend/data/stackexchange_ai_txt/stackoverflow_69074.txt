Check out the Stylesheets facility in Qt 4. While it's still a hassle, it's way easier than doing a full-on custom style. You can just adjust one visual facet at a time and try it out. It pays attention to inheritance. So if you style the font in QWidget, then every visual widget will also use that font. And so on.
