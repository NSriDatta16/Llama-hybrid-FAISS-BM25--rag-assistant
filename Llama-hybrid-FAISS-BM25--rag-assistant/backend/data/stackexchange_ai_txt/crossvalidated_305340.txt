A question about Omitted Variables in a regression

I've been working through some econometrics worksheets recently. I came to a problem that I was hoping to get some help with. Assume we have a model, (1) y i = β o + β 1 chem i + β 2 dist i + ε i and we know that E[ ε i | chem i , dist i ] = 0. Further, assume that we only have data to estimate the regression using the following model: (2) y i = β o + β 1 chem i + γ i . Then, on average, what will be the estimate of β̂1 if we exclude dist i from the regression, in terms of the parameters from model (1), and why? Many thanks.
