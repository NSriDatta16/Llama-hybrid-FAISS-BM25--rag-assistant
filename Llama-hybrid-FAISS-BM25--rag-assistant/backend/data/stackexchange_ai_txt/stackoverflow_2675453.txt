Tortoise SVN revision history

I want to know for how long the tortoise svn keeps the revision history. Say I have a file which I deleted from repository through repo browser an year ago, will I be able to still recover that file? If I am able to recover, I also want to know the method to permanently delete that earlier copy of file and related revisions history so that in future nobody is able to access that file. Is it possible? I have run into problems in my organisation as I did frequent updations and deletions assuming that file was getting deleted permanently. The file system of repository has bloated now. Please suggest how to fix it.
