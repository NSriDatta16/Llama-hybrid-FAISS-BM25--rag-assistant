How to render environment in Tensorforce?

How can one render the environment using the Tensorforce library? I've tried calling environment.render , but it says that the function does not exist. This is my code: from tensorforce.agents import Agent from tensorforce.environments import Environment from tensorforce.execution import Runner # Create an OpenAI-Gym environment environment = Environment.create(environment='gym', level='MountainCarContinuous-v0') agent = Agent.create(agent='random', environment=environment) # runner = Runner(agent=agent, environment=environment) # Initialize the runner # runner.run(num_episodes=NUM_EPISODES) # Start the runner # runner.close() # Train for ep in range(NUM_EPISODES): # Number of episodes print('********Episode ' + str(ep) + '********') # Initialize episode states = environment.reset() done = False step = 0 while not done: # Episode timestep actions = agent.act(states=states) states, done, reward = environment.execute(actions=actions) agent.observe(terminal=done, reward=reward) environment.render() # Gives error environment.close() agent.close() And this is the error I get: Traceback (most recent call last): File "c:\users\user\reinforcement learning\rl.py", line 179, in environment.render() AttributeError: 'OpenAIGym' object has no attribute 'render'
