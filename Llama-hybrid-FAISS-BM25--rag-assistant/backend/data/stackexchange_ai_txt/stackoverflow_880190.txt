To use winpcap's packet queue you'll have to invoke: pcap_sendqueue_alloc - to allocate a queue for raw packets; pcap_sendqueue_queue - to add raw packets to the queue (in pcap format); pcap_sendqueue_transmit - to send the queue. Yet, I don't see the point in your question that is not covered in winpcap docs (or Google).
