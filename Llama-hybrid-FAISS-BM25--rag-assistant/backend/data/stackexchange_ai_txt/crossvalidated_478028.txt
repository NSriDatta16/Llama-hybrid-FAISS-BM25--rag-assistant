First you need to know that machine learning algorithms are broadly divided into three categories- Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning But you should know that most production level machine learning pipelines use a combination of two or all of the three kinds of algorithms. Supervised Learning takes advantage of already known labels , like whether an email is reported spam or not, how much rainfall has occured in the last 7 days, whether a lump in body is carcinogenic or not etc. Where in Unsupervised Learning, the data is not labeled i.e. there are no clearly defined target variables (nature of email, amount of rainfall and nature of tumor are the target variables in the previous cases). Reinforcement Learning algorithms are complex and advanced where the model learns from its previous predictions and correctness. So, whenever there is a clearly defined target variable, you can apply a supervised learning algorithm. Regression and Classification fall into the supervised learning domain, and cannot be classified as unsupervised learning models . And, there are many supervised learning algorithms which are not regression or classification, for example- Naive Bayes Classifier Decision Tree Random Forest Support Vector Machine etc. These are just some examples of the supervised learning algorithms. And these, along with regression and classification, do not fall under unsupervised learning algorithms. Some of the most common unsupervised learning algorithms are- Clustering Neural Networks Anomaly Detection etc. Here's a diagram- Machine Learning Algorithms | | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | supervised learning unsupervised learning reinforcement learning | | |--->Naive Bayes Classifier |--->Clustering |--->Support Vector Machine |--->Neural Networks |--->Decision Tree |--->Anomaly Detection |--->Random Forest |--->Regression |--->Classification These questions are better suited for the Data Science Stack Exchange site.
