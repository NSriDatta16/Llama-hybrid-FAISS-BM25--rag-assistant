PHP doesn't natively support sending email, it hands that duty off to a mail transfer agent. You also need to have a mail server (sendmail, postfix, qmail, etc)) installed and configured on your server to actually do the work. That or there are PHP scripts that'll allow you to send email straight from PHP without a mail server (they just aren't the default ones included in PHP). A further issue might be that many viruses have propagated through the mail port over the years so many virus scanners and firewalls will prevent access unless they're configured to allow mail to operate. This is only likely a problem in Windows, and in a network where someone else is looking after the security and assumes the users are dumb (so you know - in the workplace).
