Poisson regression model selection

I'm in the process of learning about Poisson regression and i am wondering if anyone here could give me some valuable advice on model selection. I'm looking for values and tests like the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the Roc curve for logistic regression but instead more appropriate for count data. What's your process when comparing two Poisson regressions? Surely your selection cannot be only based on AIC values?
