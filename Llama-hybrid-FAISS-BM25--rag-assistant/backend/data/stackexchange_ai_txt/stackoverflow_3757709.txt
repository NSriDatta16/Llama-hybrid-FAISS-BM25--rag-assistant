jQuery - Draggable and different screens (fit to screen)

I have many draggable div's on my page $('#bibo').draggable({ addClasses: false, containment: 'window', zIndex: '999', stack: '.tko.sto' }); I save the new position on dragstop and put the new top and left values into the SQL. Ok, everything works great. But when I visit my Page with the Laptop (small screen) some div are out of the screen and a scrollbar is shown. Is it possible to fix this if the screen is too small? Thanks in advance!
