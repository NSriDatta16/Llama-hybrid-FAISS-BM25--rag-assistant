I think that, you are using Bayesian statistics here. The posterior probability is proportional to likelihood function, then you have P(model(parameters)|data) \propto L(data|model(parameters)). Therefore, you can have such problem. Actually, I have a similar problem. Nonetheless, I use greater bins. It is a possible solution, to avoid the problem for bins with zero value in the model.
