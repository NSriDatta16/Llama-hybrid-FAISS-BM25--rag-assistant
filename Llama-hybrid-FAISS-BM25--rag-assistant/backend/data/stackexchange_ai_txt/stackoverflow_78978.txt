Regex for Specific Tag

I'm working on a regular expression in a .NET project to get a specific tag. I would like to match the entire DIV tag and its contents: Test The first paragraph. The Store paragraph Code: Regex re = new Regex("( .*? )", RegexOptions.Multiline); if (re.IsMatch(test)) Console.WriteLine("it matches"); else Console.WriteLine("no match"); I want to match this: Anything could go in here...doesn't matter. Let's get it all I thought . was supposed to get all characters, but it seems to having trouble with the carriage returns. What is my regex missing? Thanks.
