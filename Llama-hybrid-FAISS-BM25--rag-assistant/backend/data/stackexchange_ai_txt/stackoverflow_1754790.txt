Why are the commas in my array reading as a string?

This is what I am trying to do: 1 - I have an array with a string. $photographer_array = "'Alberto Korda', 'Annie Leibowitz', 'Ansel Adams'"; 2 - I am trying to populate an array with that string. array($photographer_array); What it is doing is creating an array with one single entry including all the commas. Why is it reading the commas as a string? Is there anyway I can make it not read the commas as a string and instead use them to separate the values in the array?
