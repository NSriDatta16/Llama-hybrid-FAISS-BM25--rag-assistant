Resize AIR app window while dragging

So I've noticed Windows 7 has a disturbing tendency to prevent you from dragging the title bar of windows off the top of the screen. If you try - in this case, using an air app with a draggable area at the bottom of the window, allowing you to push the top of the window up past the screen - it just kicks the window back down far enough that the title bar is at the top of what it considers the 'visible area.' One solution would be to resize the app window as it moves, so that the title bar is always where windows wants it. How would you resize the window while you're dragging it, though? Would you do it like this? dragHitArea.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, function(e:MouseEvent):void{ stage.nativeWindow.height += 50; stage.nativeWindow.startMove(); stage.nativeWindow.height -= 50; }); see what's going on there? When I click, I'm doing startMove() , which is hooking into the OS' function for dragging a window around. I'm also increasing and decreasing the height of the window by 50 pixels - which should give me no net increase, right? Wrong - the first ' .height += ' gets executed, but the ' .height -= ' after the .startMove() never runs. Why?
