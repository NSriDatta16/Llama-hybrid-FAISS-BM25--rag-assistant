Standard deviations and confidence intervals (weighted) running average

My question is related to this one . I am calculating averages, actually as many as I have samples because I calculate a running average, and for equal weighting I know how to calculate the $95\%$ CI, with $\mu\pm1.96*\sigma_{original}$. However there are two things that I dont know how to do. Can I get the $\sigma_{original}$ from the same method (convolution through Fourier transform)? How do I calculate the $95\%$ CI if the weighting is not equal (so if I convolute with a window that is not flat)?
