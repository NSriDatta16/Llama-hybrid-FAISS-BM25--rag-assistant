Weather prediction algorithm variety

Currently there's a big 'storm' over the predictions by the MetOffice in the UK. They predicted a mild, wet winter, while we have the coldest temperature on record in Northern Ireland and solid snow on the ground, normally rare in December. It's something I'd love to have a play with, not that I'm claiming I can beat them, but was wondering what algorithms are out there currently that people are working with? What datasets do they base it on? Possibilities presumably include neural networks modelling input with fitness being the accuracy of the prediction, complex mathematical models, or even the 'same as yesterday' prediction which I've heard claim (although not seen evidence) that it's more reliable for single-day prediction (although obviously drops off after that). Ideally like to hear from some developers in weather centres or who get access to the supercomputers, it'd be interesting to hear approaches...
