If you're familiar with R (or Python, or many other statistical packages), using a sparse.model.matrix with a general model-builder like xgboost will automatically separate out the categories for variables and give you their relative importance. If you actually need to encode the model somewhere else instead of just making predictions on a new data set, many generalized linear models can give you coefficients, and as long as you cast your data as a sparse matrix, those individual categories will survive.
