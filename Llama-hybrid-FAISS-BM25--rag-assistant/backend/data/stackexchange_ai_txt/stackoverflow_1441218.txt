What im tyring to create is an application the utilizes book features like when the user drags a touch or just touches the right screen the page turns, the book im trying to create has atleats 300 pages. What i need is a starting point on how to access the text data and display it on a view. When the user changes the page the next set of text is accesed and displayed. How would i be able to model a book with so many pages? any help is appreciated PS: ive tried looking for simple tutorials but no luck
