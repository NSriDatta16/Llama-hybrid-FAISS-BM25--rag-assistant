Adding features to Sequences for Dense or LSTM

I am confused about the best way to add features to a CNN or LSTM model. Say I have input features where each example is an array of len 10: say [3, 5, 8, 9, 1, 7, 44, 12, 11, 6] and this goes in an array of arrays (X_train), and I pass all through the LSTM or Dense layers and it works just fine. My issue is that I would like to add an additional feature for each observation, the feature is also an array of length 10, where each position represents "time" for the previous features I described above, so what I want is that for each observation, we have [array of size 10 for some features], [array of size 10 for other features i.e. time]. Should I just extend the time array onto the previous array thereby creating one array of size 20 per example or there is a better way to handle this for training a neural network? Any points or ideas will be helpful. Thanks.
