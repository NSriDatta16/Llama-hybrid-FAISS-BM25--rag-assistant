See this article for a good explanation. This quote explains the heart of it: Self-organization does not mean that workers instead of managers engineer an organization design. It does not mean letting people do whatever they want to do. It means that management commits to guiding the evolution of behaviors that emerge from the interaction of independent agents instead of specifying in advance what effective behavior is. The team approaches a project, and, based on the project at hand, decides how best to allocate its resources to take advantage of each team member's various strengths.
