Is there a way to call ruby1.9 without loading rubygems?

So ruby 1.9 is really nice in that it'll automatically require rubygems, and hence when you call require 'somegem' without first requiring rubygems it'll work, and that's generally awesome. But I have a ton of shell scripts using ruby, and they generally don't rely on rubygems. Shell tools should run instantly, and loading rubygems for nothing is a major drag, mostly because it involves a bunch of disk operations with scattered small files. I want to be able to tell ruby, when running these shell scripts, to skip loading gems. Ideally, something like #!ruby --no-rubygems in the shebang line. Is there such a thing? Or maybe a compile option that'll tell ruby rubygems must be required manually?
