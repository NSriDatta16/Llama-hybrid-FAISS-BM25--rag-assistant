Graph Expansion

I'm currently working on an interesting graph problem, I can't find any algorithms or other stackoverflow questions which mention anything like this. If I have a graph (undirected, cyclic) and a list of commonly used paths, what is the best way to reduce the average path length by adding in N more edges? EDIT:: Important point, which might help, all paths start at the same node.
