Use a UIScrollView with 3 touches not one

I wanted to know If there is some way I could use three touches with a UIScrollView. What I want in the end is to have the UIScrollView only be passed one UITouch (or at least think it it has only one touch), but have three touches down. I want to use the let's just say the middle finger or find the average (x , y) of the three touches and use that (x , y) as my one touch being sent to the UIScrollView. If anyone knows or has any idea how I may accomplish this then please upload some code if possible.
