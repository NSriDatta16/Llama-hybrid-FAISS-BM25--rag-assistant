Splitting C++ Strings Onto Multiple Lines (Code Syntax, Not Parsing)

Not to be confused with how to split a string parsing wise, e.g.: Split a string in C++? I am a bit confused as to how to split a string onto multiple lines in c++. This sounds like a simple question, but take the following example: #include #include main() { //Gives error std::string my_val ="Hello world, this is an overly long string to have" + " on just one line"; std::cout I realize that I could use the std::string append() method, but I was wondering if there was any shorter/more elegant (e.g. more pythonlike, though obviously triple quotes etc. aren't supported in c++) way to break strings in c++ onto multiple lines for sake of readability. One place where this would be particularly desirable is when you're passing long string literals to a function (for example a sentence).
