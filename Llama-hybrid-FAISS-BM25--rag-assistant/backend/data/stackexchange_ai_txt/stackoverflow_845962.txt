I would say the best approach is to unit test the generation, and as part of the unit test, you might take a sample generated result (only enough to where the test tests something that you would consider significantly different over the other scenarios) and put that under a unit test to make sure that the generation is working correctly. Beyond that, there is little unit test value in defining every scenario in an automated way. There may be functional test value in putting together some functional test which exercise the generated code to perform whatever purpose you have in mind, in order to give wider coverage to the various potential units.
