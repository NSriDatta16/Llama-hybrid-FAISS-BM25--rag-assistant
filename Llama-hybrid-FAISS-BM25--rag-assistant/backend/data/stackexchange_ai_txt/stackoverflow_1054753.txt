I don't have enough reputation to comment, so I have to provide this as an answer instead even though it's not an appropriate answer to the question asked. Sorry. There is an Lua Obfuscator available here: http://www.capprime.com/CapprimeLuaObfuscator/CapprimeLuaObfuscator.aspx Full disclosure: I am the author of the obfuscator and I am aware it is not perfect. Feedback is welcome and encouraged (there is a feedback page available from the above page).
