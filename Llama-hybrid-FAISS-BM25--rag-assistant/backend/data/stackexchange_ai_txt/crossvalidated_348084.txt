deseason and 'reseason' data

I'm doing some work in time series analysis. I'm decomposing a time-series of a moving average as follows ma I then fit an auto arima model to this, and can make predictions and examine trends. My question is, how do I 'reseason' the data. If my autoarima and predictions are based off of deseasoned data, how do I translate this back to seasoned data. How do I translate my prediction into a real-world value?
