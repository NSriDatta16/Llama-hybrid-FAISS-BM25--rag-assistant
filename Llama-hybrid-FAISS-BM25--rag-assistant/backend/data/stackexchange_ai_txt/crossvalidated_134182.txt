Averaging over companies is a bad idea and could lead you to biased results because it would lead you to use group-level (averaged results) and individual-level results as the same while they are different entities (see an example in here ). The valid approach would be to use a multilevel model where where time is nested in companies. So simplifying it is: $$ y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1ij} + ... + \beta_k X_{kij} + b_i + \varepsilon_{ij} $$ where $\beta$ are fixed effects, $b_i$ is random intercept for each of the $i$'th companies and $j$ is an index of time. Different models are also possible, for example with random slopes. This kind of models are implemented in multiple software, including the great lme4 package for R.
