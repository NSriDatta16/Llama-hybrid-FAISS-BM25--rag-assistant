iPhone enterprise deployment

I am building an app using the apple "in-house" deployment of the enterprise program. But I want to distribute this app free of cost to few non member of enterprise. we cannot make those person an employee of the organization because of some company policy. Is this possible and is there any legal issues associated on apple side with this kind of distribution? Thanks in advance.
