You can use Ra-Ajax and have an iframe wrapped inside e.g. a Window control. Though in general terms I don't encourage people to use iframes (for anything ) Another alternative is to load the HTML on the server and send it directly into the Window as the content of a Label or something. Check out how this Ajax RSS parser is loading the RSS items in the source which can be downloaded here (Open Source - LGPL) (Disclaimer; I work with Ra-Ajax...)
