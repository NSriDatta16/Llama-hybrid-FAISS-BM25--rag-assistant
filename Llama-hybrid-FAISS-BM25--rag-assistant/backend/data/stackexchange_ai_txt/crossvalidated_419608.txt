In some sense you can use any data that is not part of your test set in any way you like during the training. E.g. balance classes, use data augmentation and so on. However, your test set should reflect your actual real world use case. So, if in the real world you get very imbalanced classes, you should see how you perform under those conditions. What you describe seems to fit into the approach, so that sounds fine. Depending on your prediction model there might be a need to adjust for the true prevalence of each class. Otherwise performance on the test set might suffer from having trained on balanced data. E.g. if you use logistic regression in a two class problem, you would want to adjust the intercept.
