Actually, for min/max it is easier to use Comparer .Default , which also supports IComparable , handles "lifted" operators, etc. You can get most of this for free if you use MiscUtil ; I wrote some code that provides access to generic operators, including generic extension methods for Sum , Average , etc. Unfortunately, operators can't appear on interfaces, and to make things worse the primitives don't actually have operators in the MethodInfo sense (this is provided directly in IL instead) - as discussed here .
