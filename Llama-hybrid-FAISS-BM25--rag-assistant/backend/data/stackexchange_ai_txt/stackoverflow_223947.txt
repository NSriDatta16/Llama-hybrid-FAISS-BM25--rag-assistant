VC does not simply link the library if you include the header-file. You have to tell the linker to use the library. For good reasons: You alredy have thousands of libs in your library folder. If MSVC had to search all of them each time you link your program it would have to wade through hundrets of megabytes of data. That would take quite a while, therefore it's not done by default. For VC you can also give a hint to the linker inside your source. To do so you add the following line somewhere in your source-code (the header of the lib may be a good place). #pragma comment(lib,"c:\\path_to_library\\libname.lib") That's not platform independet but the most convenient way to get a lib automatically linked to a project using MSVC. Another way is to simply add the linker to the project settings. The relevant info can be found lin the linker settings of your project. Don't forget to add the lib to the release and debug configurations.
