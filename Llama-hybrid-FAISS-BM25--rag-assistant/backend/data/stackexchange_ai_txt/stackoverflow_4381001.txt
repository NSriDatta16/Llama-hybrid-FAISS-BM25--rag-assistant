First, Oracle has built-in functionality for telling you the number of rows in a table (either use count(*) or search 'gather statistics oracle' for another option). But "stress testing a table" sounds to me like you're going down the wrong path. Most of the metrics you're mentioning ("time for inserts , inserts/time, table fragmentation[logical/physical] etc") are highly dependent on many factors: what OS Oracle's running on how the OS is tuned (i.e. other services running) how the specific Oracle instance is configured what underlying storage architecture Oracle's using (and how tablespaces are configured) what other queries are being executed in the database at the exact same time as your test But NONE of them would be related to the table design itself. Now, if you're wondering if your normalized (or de-normalized) table schema is hurting your application, that's another matter. As is performance being degraded by improper/unneeded/missing indexes, triggers, or a host of other problems. But if you really want an app that will give you real-time monitoring, check out Quest Software's Spotlight on Oracle . But it's definitely not free.
