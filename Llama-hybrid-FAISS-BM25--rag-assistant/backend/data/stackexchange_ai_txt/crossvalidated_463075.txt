What is the "tree" structure in Tree Parzen Estimators?

Context In Algorithms for Hyper-Parameter Optimization , the authors propose a "tree-structured" configuration space. Here, a configuration space is a space of hyperparameters. Questions What precisely is the tree in the tree Parzen estimator (TPE)? E.g. what precisely are the nodes and edges in the graph for the configuration space of the TPE? Are the nodes pairs (hyperparameter, value) and child nodes pairs (hyperparamter, quantile_val) where the quantile_val $\gamma$ is defined so that $p(y ? [paragraph before start of section 4.1] In section 4.1 they further state that the densities $\ell$ and $g$ are "tree-structured" -- how so? Outlook If there is a general (but precise) notion of using "trees" in sequential model-based global optimization (SMBO), I'd appreciate any references.
