How should I convert legacy ColdFusion code to a framework?

We have a medium sized ColdFusion code base for our Intranet and Website. For most of the history of the code we have used hard coded links in the cfm's for where to go and for what 'save' code to tun. In the last few years we've began using cfc's to handle more of the "navigational" code as well as more automated save code (implicitly calling the save process for a given cfc on init) Assuming that it makes sense to begin using a framework, is it better to begin using it for newer projects or attempt a full scale conversion? EDIT To avoid confusion, I'm sensing that by moving to more cfc based code we are going down the path of accidentally creating our own framework. It seems to me that taking a proactive step toward using a proper framework and allowing the cfc's to process data is probably a wiser choice.
