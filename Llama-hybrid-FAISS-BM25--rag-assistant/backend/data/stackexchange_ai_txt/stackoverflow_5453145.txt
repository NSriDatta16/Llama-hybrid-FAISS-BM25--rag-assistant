Approximate algorithm for minimum raggedness word wrap

I'm looking for an efficient algorithm (ideally, C-like pseudocode) to give an approximate solution to the following partition problem. Given a sequence S = { a_i : i =1,..., n } and a bound B , determine a partition of S into some number m of contiguous subsequences as follows. For each k , let s _ k be the sum of the elements of k -th subsequence. The partition must satisfy: s _ k â‰¤ B for each k (assume that the values of B and the a _ i are such that this is always possible) m is minimal (no smaller partition satisfies #1); some measure of dispersion (for example, the variance or the maximum pair-wise difference among the s _ k ) is minimal among all partitions of size m . I know that this is closely related to the minimum raggedness word wrap algorithm . I am looking for something that can give a "good enough" solution for small values of n (less than 15) without pulling out heavy ammunition like dynamic programming, but also something a little faster than brute force.
