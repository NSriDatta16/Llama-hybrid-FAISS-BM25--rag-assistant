What does "having excellent Likelihoods" mean ? (MCMC code)

I asked an astrophysicist about MontePython code (MCMC code). He told me that its team had excellent Likelihoods about a cosmological survey. What does "having excellent Likelihoods" mean ? I know the Likelihood can be computed by factorize all PDF (Probability Density Function) for given experimental or simulated data. I know also that the Likelihood is related to the $\chi^2$ by : $\ln \mathcal L = -\dfrac{1}{2}\,\chi^2$ . But there also the relation : $\chi^2 = (x-\bar x)^{T}\text{Cov}^{-1}(x-\bar x)$ Maybe saying that we have "excellent Likelihoods" means that we have a good data Covariance matrix " $\text{Cov}$ " ? then it would imply that with this covariance matrix " $\text{Cov}$ ", the $\chi^2$ associated is very minimal, wouldn't it ? (this matrix is related to $\sigma_i$ and whose inverse is the Fisher matrix (I am not sure of this)), is it right ? Any explanation is welcome.
