Have a look at: The Nachos for Java README - how to get, install, work with NachOS. The Projects and Nachos link on the left of the CS162 home page. Pay a special attention to How to use Eclipse for 162 projects . Some extras: Installation and configuration of nachos 5.0j for linux - the document consists mostly of screen captures so it's perfectly "understandable" even if it is in Spanish (I don't speak Spanish but still could get it). Nachos Tutorial .
