High explained variance but low p-value in output of factor analysis

I'm trying to perform a factor analysis on some survey data (bit new to the subject) using R's built-in factanal function, but I'm failing to interpret its output. My approach was to first perform a PCA to estimate the number of significant axes of variation in the data and then to take this as the number of factors in the function call. However, I obtain a p-value of 0 for the chi-squared test (which probably means the value is below machine precision). If I'm not mistaken, this would mean that this number of factors is not sufficient. However the SS of the loadings is high for this number (Cumulative Var is 0.886), and the p-value does not increase by adding more variables. What am I misunderstanding here? Output: Call: factanal(x = ., factors = 2, scores = "Bartlett", rotation = "promax", nstart = 100) Uniquenesses: extInv conseq affin intrinsieke focus zelfExpl 0.086 0.308 0.082 0.135 0.069 0.120 explBrdte explDpte toewijd tijd afh1 0.080 0.093 0.073 0.074 0.005 Loadings: Factor1 Factor2 extInv 0.921 conseq -0.205 -0.723 affin 0.424 0.696 intrinsieke -0.451 1.031 focus 0.843 0.230 zelfExpl 1.039 -0.460 explBrdte 1.015 -0.153 explDpte 0.756 0.338 toewijd 0.831 0.247 tijd 0.913 0.105 afh1 1.002 Factor1 Factor2 SS loadings 6.351 3.392 Proportion Var 0.577 0.308 Cumulative Var 0.577 0.886 Factor Correlations: Factor1 Factor2 Factor1 1.00 -0.43 Factor2 -0.43 1.00 Test of the hypothesis that 2 factors are sufficient.
