I haven't seen the code base but I assume it would be something like (pseudocode since I know as much about PHP as I do about the mating habits of white rhinos): string duration (n): // days if n >= 365 return str(int(n/365)) + " years" if n >= 30 return str(int(n/30)) + " months" if n >= 7 return str(int(n/7)) + " weeks" return str(int(n)) + " days" Adjust the value passed in and the denominators if you want a finer resolution than a single day (and allow for "1 month" instead of "1 months" ) and you're good to go. I wouldn't worry too much about the inaccuracies of the division (e.g., the average month has about 30.44 days) since it's only supposed to be an approximation.
