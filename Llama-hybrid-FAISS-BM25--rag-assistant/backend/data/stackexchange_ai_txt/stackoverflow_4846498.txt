Why am i getting a ctrl-J on the end of this PHP generated line?

Im trying to generate a Java WebStart JNLP file from PHP. I'll put the whole code at the end, but my specific problem is this line of PHP: " ?> The PHP generated line, I discovered after much struggling, is coming out with a ctrl-J on the end. This totally screws up Webstart. Why is it doing this and how do I stop it? The execution environment for the PHP is PHP5 on OpenSolaris. The full code for this file is below for reference. (Dont pay any attention to the Windows section, I'm working on a Mac. I'll fix it once the mac section works correctly.)
