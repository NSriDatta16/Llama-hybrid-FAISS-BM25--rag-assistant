The WSDL will tell you or, perferably, a SOAP library how to communitcate with the SOAP server. A SOAP service can be an interface to get data for almost anything. However, if the function names and parameters are not named well, it could be very vague what data you are to send to the SOAP service and what the response will be. Most of the time, it should be documented. You should get those documents or learn what the service actually does from the service provider. The WSDL is not really meant to be for human consumption. Though, if you are writing your own XML, then yes, you'd need to pay attention to the WSDL. If a library is creating the XML for you, it usually works with the WSDL to find out how to structure the XML and read the response.
