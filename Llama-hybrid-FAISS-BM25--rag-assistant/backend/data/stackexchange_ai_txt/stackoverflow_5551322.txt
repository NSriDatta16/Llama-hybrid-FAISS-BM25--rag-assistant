Rails and Socket.io (node.js)

I intend to use a Rails app to serve real-time data processed by a node.js server and Socket.io. In the Socket.io website, it says that: If you won't leverage Node.JS to serve your files, make sure to set the global WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION to the location of the WebSocketMain.swf file. What does it means exactly if I use rails to serve the static files? Also, from the FAQ: I want to host the Socket.IO client myself: If you're not relying on Node.JS serving Socket.IO clientside JavaScript files, make sure you set the WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION right after including socket.io.js with the location of the WebSocketMain.swf This is required in order for Socket.IO to find the .swf file required for Flash WebSocket. However, I don't quite get it. Thanks.
