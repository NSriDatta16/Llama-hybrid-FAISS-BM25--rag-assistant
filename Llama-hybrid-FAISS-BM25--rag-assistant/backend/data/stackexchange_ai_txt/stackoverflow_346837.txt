Why would I want to use the debug mode of the .NET compiler?

I was curious what the differences are between the debug and release modes of the .NET compiler and came across these questions about debug vs release in .NET and reasons that release will behave differently than debug . Up to this point I really haven't paid much attention to these compiler modes. Now I will. My question is, assuming that I am using a testing framework (NUnit) and TDD, would I run into any issues if I simply always compiled in release mode?
