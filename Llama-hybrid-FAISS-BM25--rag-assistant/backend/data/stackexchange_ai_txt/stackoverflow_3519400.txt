Can't understand this line of JavaScript

Thanks for your attention and time. I'm modifying an existing JavaScript but can't understand a line of code. Please help me understanding this line: rowArray[i].value = rows[i].getElementsByTagName('td')[sortOn].firstChild.nodeValue; I am clear till .getElementsByTagName('td') , sortOn is being passed in this function as a parameter. But I couldn't understand [sortOn].firstChild.nodeValue; Please guide me, thanks
