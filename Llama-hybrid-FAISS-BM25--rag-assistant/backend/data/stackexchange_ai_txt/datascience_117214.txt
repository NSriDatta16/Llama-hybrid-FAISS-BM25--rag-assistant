You can use transform after groupby to get the same dimension data out of it RAG["age2"] = RAG_df.groupby(['race','gender'])["age"].transform("mean") You can now substitute the missing values in age with the values in age2. Note: this won't work for all the data if you have missing values in your race or gender variables, which you seem to have, you will need to figure out something to fill those rows.
