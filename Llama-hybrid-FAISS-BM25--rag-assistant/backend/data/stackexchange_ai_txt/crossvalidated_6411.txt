I think that there's definitely a Bayesian shrinkage or prior correction that could help prediction but you might want to also consider another tack... Look up players in history, not just the last few years, who've had breakout seasons after a couple in the majors (dramatic increases perhaps 2x) and see how they did in the following year. It's possible the probability of maintaining performance there is the right predictor. There's a variety of ways to look at this problem but as mpiktas said, you're going to need more data. If you just want to deal with recent data then you're going to have to look at overall league stats, the pitchers he's up against, it's a complex problem. And then there's just considering Bautista's own data. Yes, that was his best year but it was also the first time since 2007 he had over 350 ABs (569). You might want to consider converting the percentage increase in performance.
