I don't think you want to calculate C(n,k) and then reduce mod 1009. The biggest one, C(1e15,5e14) will require something like 1e16 bits ~ 1000 terabytes Moreover executing the loop in snakiles answer 1e15 times seems like it might take a while. What you might use is, if n = n0 + n1*p + n2*p^2 ... + nd*p^d m = m0 + m1*p + m2*p^2 ... + md*p^d (where 0 then C(n,m) = C(n0,m0) * C(n1,m1) *... * C(nd, nd) mod p see, eg http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/granville/paper/binomial/html/binomial.html One way would be to use pascal's triangle to build a table of all C(m,n) for 0
