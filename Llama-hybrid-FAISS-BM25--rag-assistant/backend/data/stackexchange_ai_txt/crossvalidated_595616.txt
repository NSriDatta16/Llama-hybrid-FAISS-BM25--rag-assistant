Does it make sense to use neural network in place of polynomial regression to fit 1 dimensional functions when only 1 feature is available?

As title says I would like to understand why there are so many tutorials and notebooks showing how to fit 1 dimensional functions with neural networks instead of polynomial regression. What are the advantages of using MLPs? do they generalize better? 1re they more powerful function approximators?
