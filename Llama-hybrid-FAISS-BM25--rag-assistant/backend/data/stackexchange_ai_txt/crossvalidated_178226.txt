Do sampling methods (MCMC/SMC) work for combination of continuous and discrete random variables?

Consider a distribution $P = \frac{1}{2}P_1 + \frac{1}{2}P_2$ where $P_1, P_2$ are probability measures on a measurable space $(\mathbb R, \mathcal B)$ such that $P_1: A \to \int_A \mathcal N(x; 0, 1) d\mu(x)$ for all $A \in \mathcal B$, and $P_2 = \frac{1}{3} \delta_0 + \frac{2}{3} \delta_1$, i.e. a discrete distribution which assigns $0$ and $1$ probabilities $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$. What kind of proposal is chosen in this case and do we evaluate densities (as given in recipes for MCMC/SMC) or something else when calculating acceptance ratios (e.g. for Metropolis-Hastings) or importance weights (e.g. for Importance sampling, SMC, etc.)? Can you please point me to the correct resources?
