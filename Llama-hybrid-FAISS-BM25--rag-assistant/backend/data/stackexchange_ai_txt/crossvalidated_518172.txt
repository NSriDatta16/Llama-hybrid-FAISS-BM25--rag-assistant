Autocorrelation can be seen as a trend in a time series, albeit a wiggly one. Hence you can just crank up the k if you want to get the residuals as independent as possible. Effort should be included as an offset term using + offset(log(Effort_km2)) in the model formula. This turns the model into one for the response on the catch per unit effort scale. Making Effort_km2 a smooth term in the model is saying that the effort itself affects the response in a non-linear way. Using the offset gets a model for $\frac{\text{catch}}{\text{effort}}$ , without you having to modify the response counts themselves. You can combine multiple variables in the offset term, so you can include Effort and Area by summing the log effort and log area terms. If the fit is returned, you're just getting a singularity warning, look where the singularity os coming from. Often in these models it's the correlation term that can't be identified with a wiggly trend also in the model, for reasons due to the fact described above in my first paragraph. If you get a returned model, you can check this by looking at the estimate CAR(1) term and it's confidence interval with the intervals() function applied to the $lme component of the model fit. You can also try simpler models and build up from there; it is likely too that the multiple Year smooths are causing you fitting problems. Instead, try a model with just one Year smooth: s(Year, by = zone, bs = "tp") so that you just get a separate smooth per zone without the global smooth.
