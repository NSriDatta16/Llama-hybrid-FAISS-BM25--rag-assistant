The subjectivity in frequentist approaches is rampant in application of inference. When you test a hypothesis you set a confidence level, say 95% or 99%. Where does this come from? It doesn't come from anywhere but your own preferences or a prevailing practice in your field. Bayesian priors matter very little on large datasets, because when you update them with data, the posterior distribution will fade away from your prior as more and more data is processed. Having said that Bayesians start from subjective definition of probabilities, beliefs etc. This makes them different from frequentists, who think in terms of objective probabilities. In small data sets this matters. UPDATE: I hope you hate philosophy as much as I do, but they have some interesting thoughts from time to time, consider subjectivism . How do I know that I'm really on SE? What if it's my dream? etc. :)
