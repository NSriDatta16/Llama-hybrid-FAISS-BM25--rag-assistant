Your model can potentially be useful. As a first approach, I think you can give it a try. What I would do is working with a time series of bitcoin prizes (or returns), not just "bitcoin prize at time t", Your b and c variables could then work as external regressors. You can also treat b and c as variables evolving in time and work with multivariate time series model for a more complete study (current feelings on Bitcoin may affect its value today, but why not tomorrow or next week?) Prizes/returns from other cryptocurrencies are also a good source of information for the model. They could be included as components of the time series. Finally, avoid the so commonly made mistake of thinking that what people write on Twitter is a good estimate of what society actually thinks on a topic!
