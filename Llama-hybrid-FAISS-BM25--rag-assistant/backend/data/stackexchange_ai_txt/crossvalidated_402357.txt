Can regression trees outperform classification trees?

I'm learning about trees in my data science class recently and I know that the convention is to use regression trees when the response is continuous and classification trees when the response is categorical. However, let's say we have a dataset with a binary response, is there any justification to still use a regression tree over a classification tree? Moreover, are there real-world instances where a regression tree performs classification better than a traditional classification tree?
