Meta-learning, or “learning to learn,” is a machine learning paradigm that aims to find a model able to quickly adapt to novel concepts with a small new dataset. For instance, you might want to find a model that can learn to identify an new artist given a few examples of their art, and train that model using examples of other artists’ art.
