I've played with Telerik's new WebUITest studio and it does look pretty slick for UI testing. However, it is very expensive and Selenium is pretty attractive for free. If you are in a large organization with a distinct QA group doing testing then I'd check out Telerik. Otherwise, Selenium. BTW: I have to second stimmms' point about having a proper separation of concerns for your application unit testing - it makes all the difference.
