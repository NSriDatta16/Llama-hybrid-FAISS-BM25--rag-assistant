How do I use non-image/signal dataset to do classification problem via Convolution Neural Network

I googled most of topics over the Internet, and Convolution Neural Network is prevailing to apply to image/pattern recognition. Perhaps, it is more easily to understand the concept of this methodology. What if my dataset is composed of quantitative variable e.g., age,duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric), campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client. Also, categorical variables are job ( type of job) , marital status, and education. More detail information, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing One can use classic logistic regression or SVM on Bank Marketing, How about deep learning approach? How to implement? Any good explanation from image concept to non-image problem like Bank Marketing or other cases?
