Building Enterprise level Line of Business application in silverlight Pros and Cons

Currently i am working on developing one Warehouse solution from scratch, i am planning to build it in silverlight (as this solution will take around 8-10 months) and the programming will start from Feb 2010. I need to develop this application for one organization. Certain parts needs to be accessed by public which we are planning to build in ASP .Net 3.5 Now i just wanted to start a thread here for pros and cons of using silverlight, some of them i have already analyzed Pros : Rich UI Excellent user experience Reduction of scalability concerns New set of features like data binding, control template etc.. Speed of development (After initial learning curve..my experience says it is faster to develop it in silverlight) Other rich set of features coming up with SL 4.0 ( SL 4.0 ) Cons : Cross platform issues (moonlight is there but it may take some time) Cross browser issues (Chrome or other browsers) Learning curve Any other unknown risk (As there are not many enterprise level application developed in silverlight...or may be i am not aware) I have also got one link for Pros and cons of silverlight( here ) some of the cons might not be relevant with SL 4.0 Also i am having one good link for comparison between ASP .Net Ajax with Silverlight ( here ) EDIT : I have also found Technical Article series in code project (Just Type @ google "Adventures while building a Silverlight Enterprise application" and you will get it, i am trying to analyze this series as well) Please add some pros and cons if you find as i am trying to analyze it from all the angles. It will be of great help if you find any whitepaper on it.
