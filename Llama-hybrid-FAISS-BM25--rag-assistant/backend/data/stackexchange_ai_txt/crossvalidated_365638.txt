Decision Tree - What is more efficient a few nodes with hundreds of branches or hundreds of binary nodes (2 branches)?

To make it simple, let's imagine a single category which can have 500 different values. For example city: nameCity1, nameCity2, ..., nameCity500. What is more efficient, to have one single decision tree which will have 500 branches or to make some feature engineering and transform this category into 500 binary categories? So we will end up with 500 nodes with just two branches each. I am planned to use this in xgboost, but I guess same will apply to decision trees or boosted decision trees.
