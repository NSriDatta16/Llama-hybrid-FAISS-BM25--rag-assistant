What are the disadvantages of having a left skewed distribution?

I'm currently working on a classification problem and I've a numerical column which is left skewed. i've read many posts where people are recommending to take log transformation or boxcox transformation to fix the left skewness. So I was wondering what would happen If I left the skewness as it is and continue with my model building? Are there any advantages of fixing skewness for classification problem (knn, logistic regression)?
