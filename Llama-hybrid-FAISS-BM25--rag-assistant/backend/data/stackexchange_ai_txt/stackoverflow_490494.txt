This makes no sense. Especially with the CAST right back. The only thing I could see is if you are storing non- float information in a float and want it sorted asciibetically. I guess you might want this: 1 10 11 12 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 But usually when that kind of storage optimization is done (like SSN or a phone number stored in an int, say), there is implicit padding assumed on the left which means that any expected sort is really the same as the normal numerical sort.
