Carbon - OS X - Sending modified key events using CGEventPost

I'm trying to programmatically send modified keystrokes, for instance a capital "A". The problem is that the shift modifier does not seem to have any effect. In my code, I have two events, one for the shift key down, and another for the 'm' key down. CGEventRef mDown = CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent(NULL, (CGKeyCode)46, true); CGEventRef shiftDown = CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent(NULL, (CGKeyCode)56, true); CGEventPost(kCGAnnotatedSessionEventTap, shiftDown); CGEventPost(kCGAnnotatedSessionEventTap, mDown);} CFRelease(shiftDown); CFRelease(mDown); The result is unfortunately always a small case 'm'! Any help would be appreciated.
