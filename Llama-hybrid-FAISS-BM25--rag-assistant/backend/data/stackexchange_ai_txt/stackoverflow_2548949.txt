I have some suggestions: 1 - Only implement IXmlSerializable as a last resort and instead control XML serialization through attributes. It's simpler and easier to maintain. It also handles the properties being a null reference. [XmlRoot("sender")] public sealed class FaxSender { [XmlElement("name")] public string Name { get; set; } [XmlElement("organization")] public string Organization { get; set; } [XmlElement("phone_number")] public string PhoneNumber { get; set; } [XmlElement("fax_number")] public string FaxNumber { get; set; } [XmlElement("email_address")] public string EmailAddress { get; set; } // Remaining code omitted } 2 - Do not wrap code in a try\catch if the only thing you are going to do is rethrow every exception; 3 - The guideline for constants in .NET is to use PascalCase which would result in DefaultClassName instead of DEFAULT_CLASS_NAME .
