flash cs3 component problem

I have been using custom swc based components for my new flash game. I was nearly through with the engine development when I decided to update some of my placeholder graphics. I made the necessary changes only to find that my component wouldn't compile. I found this strange because I merely updated the graphics and some non-essential code needed to display the new graphics. Perhaps I changed a setting...? I fixed the problems the compiler reported and exported the new swc file. Success. I reloaded my components panel and dragged it on to the stage... Only to find an empty component! The component didn't even register in my library. It simply disappeared! Any suggestions? It's in as3 by the way.
