All are good, but only Delphi for PHP (RadPHP 3.0) has a designer, drag and drop controls, GUI editeor, huge set of components including Zend Framework , Facebook, database, etc. components. It is the best in town. RadPHP is the best of all; It has all the features the others have. Its designer is the best of all. You can design your page just like Dreamweaver (more than Dreamweaver). If you use RadPHP you will feel like using ASP.NET with Visual Studio (but the language is PHP ). It's too bad only a few know about this.
