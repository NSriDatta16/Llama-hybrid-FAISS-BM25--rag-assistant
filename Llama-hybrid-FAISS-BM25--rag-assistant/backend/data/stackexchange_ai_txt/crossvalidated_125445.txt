SVM parameters clarification

James et al. in An introduction to the statistical learning (p. 351) claim that the solution to the support vector classifier problem involves only the inner products of the observations. They stated that linear support vector classifier can be represented as where there are $n$ parameters $\alpha$. According to my understanding, $\beta$s are hyperplane parameters and $\alpha$s are coefficients of support vectors. My questions: How are $\alpha$s related to the $\beta$s? Any pointers are greatly welcome.
