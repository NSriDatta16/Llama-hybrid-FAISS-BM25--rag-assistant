I am having similar problem when trying to open a detail page in Market app using "market://details?id=pname:org.rabold.android.puzzleblox" URL from an application. I can create a shortcut using AnyCut like this: action: android.intent.action.VIEW data: market://details?id=pname:org.rabold.android.puzzleblox type: then it works fine. However, if I create an Android application with a button to launch Market with the same Uri as above, then I get an error in Market app like this: "Attention: A server error has occurred. Retry, or cancel and return to the previous screen." The code of my button's listener looks like this: okButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.okButton); okButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { public void onClick(View v) { Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("market://details?id=pname:org.rabold.android.puzzleblox")); //Uri.parse("market://search?q=pname:org.rabold.android.puzzleblox")); startActivity(intent); } }); Note in the above code, if I use 'search' instead of 'details' then it works. I'd like to use 'details' instead of 'search' because I know that my app will be available on Market when it's done. Thanks.
