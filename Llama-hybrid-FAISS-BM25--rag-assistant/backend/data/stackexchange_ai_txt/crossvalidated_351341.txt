Rejection sampling ! Suppose you've got a distribution $P$ that you'd like to sample from, but can't, and a proposal distribution $Q$ that is kinda like $P$ which you can sample from. Then if you can find a number $M$ which bounds $p(x)/q(x)$, to sample from $Q$: Draw a sample $x$ from $P$ Calculate a threshold $T =\frac{p(x)}{Mq(x)}$ Draw a random number $t \sim U(0, 1)$. If $t \leq T$, return $x$ Else go back to the beginning You might have to bound the support of $P$ and $Q$ in order for $M$ to exist, and the speed of this whole process hinges on how close your proposal $Q$ is to $P$. In your case, a good proposal would be the uniform distribution over the unit cube. If that isn't fast enough, the next places to look are at adaptive rejection sampling , Metropolis-Hastings MCMC , and then maybe an advanced MCMC scheme like NUTS .
