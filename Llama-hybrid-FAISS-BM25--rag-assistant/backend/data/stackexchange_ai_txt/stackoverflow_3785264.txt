There is no support for this out of the box with Java Webstart. There is a JNLP Download Servlet but it only supports a limited set of macros and cannot have any that are user defined. I think your best approach would be to use a templating engine like Velocity to write your own servlet for generating the JNLP file on the fly and populating it with your required arguments.
