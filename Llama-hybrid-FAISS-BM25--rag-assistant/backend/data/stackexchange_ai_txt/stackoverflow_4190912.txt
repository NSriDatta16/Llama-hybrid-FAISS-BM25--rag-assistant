How can I make a sortable, changeable, addable, removable web-page element?

I'm creating a web-app interface which will allow users to construct sentences by clicking on words/phrases. Each word of phrase will be contained in its own page element, eg. a . So the div class would need to allow: dragging into a different order relative to the other divs/words (ie. sorting) an X (only visible when hovering over) in the top right corner of its box to remove it completely upon clicking changing of font/text upon click actions be inserted into the page when the user wishes to add another word For instance, imagine this is the page (quote marks denote an element): " Hi, my name is " [Textbox] "I work at..." " and I was born in " [Combobox] The phrase in italics is 'inactive' and not part of the sentence, but if the user clicked it then it would change to " I work at " [Textbox] and a new div would be added eg. " And also at... " to allow further expansion. The phrases in bold would have a close button /clickable action to get rid of them or make them inactive again. Also they would be draggable to change the order. As you can see I would also need to dynamically insert new textboxes and comboboxes to accommodate more phrases requiring input. Could somebody give me a brief run down on what steps I need to take? I've seen sortable list elements in JQuery eg. http://jsfiddle.net/ctrlfrk/A4K4t/ which is a start. Would I just need to spruce this up with some basic JavaScript and CSS? Or would I need to use server-side scripting to dynamically add more page content? To summarize, I need the div to change font/text upon clicking, have a hover-over close button, remove and be inserted upon simple click events, and be sortable by dragging. I also need comboboxes/textboxes to be added/removed in parallel. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
