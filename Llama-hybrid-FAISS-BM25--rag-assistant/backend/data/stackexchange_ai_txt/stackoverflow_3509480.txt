Someone at MSFT who's related to the SQLExpress product told me today that it's so hard to figure out if it's installed already, they have a program that does it that's part of the bootstrapper package in Visual Studio. (I was ragging him about how difficult it is to install SQLServer.) Writing code in a .NET application to connect to and use a SQLServer database is not version-specific, and Microsoft is committed to maintaining backward compatibility.
