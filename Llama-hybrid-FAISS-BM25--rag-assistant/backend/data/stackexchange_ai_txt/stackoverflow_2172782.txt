libpcap IP Packet Reassembly

I'm looking for a sample code for IP packet reassembly in C with libpcap*. Is IP packet defragmentation implemented in libpcap library officially? I've found this proposal : http://www.mail-archive.com/tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org/msg02991.html[this][1] . Are there any implementation of defragmentation of IP packets. [1]: http://www.mail-archive.com/tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org/msg02991.html [+] *The reason for looking for the sample code is just for fun and learning and i don't want to spend too much time for writing code for IP packet reassembly.
