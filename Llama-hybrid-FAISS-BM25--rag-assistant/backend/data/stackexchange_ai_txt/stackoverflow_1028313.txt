How To Find Checked Out Files

I'm using Visual Source Safe 6.0d (work requirement) and I've been trying to hack together a little shell script to allow me to easily remove a source tree or warn me if I've got files checked out so I can make sure I don't accidentally delete work. Is there any way to tell if files are checked out other than checking the read-only bit on the files themselves? VSS doesn't seem to be writing any file (I took a snapshot of the dir before and after checking out a file and there was no difference in the files listed) I can't seem to find anything by Googling. I also checked the vssver.scc for differences and didn't find anything. Mind you, checking for writeable files isn't the worst thing in the world but it seems as if VSS makes several files in the source tree (*.ncb, *.scc, *.sln) writeable without me having checked anything out. I can simply exclude the files but I'm trying to find a bit more elegant solution.
