statistical modelling with 3 categorical predictor variables that are independent and a binary categorical response variable

How does one perform logistic regression when your response and predictor variables are factors with two levels.I have three predictor variables with levels yes or no. My response variable is dead or alive. How do I visualise the data and fit an appropriate model?
