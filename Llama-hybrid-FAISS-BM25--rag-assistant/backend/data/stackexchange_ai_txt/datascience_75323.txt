Info obtained from a confusion matrix

I am new to data science and I am trying to understand the use/importance of accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity and f1-score when I have a confusion matrix. I know how to compute all of them but I cannot really understand which of them to use each time. Could you give examples where for instance precision is a better metric that recall or where the f1-score gives essential information that I cannot get from the other terms ? In other words, in which cases should I use each of the aforementioned terms ?
