Properly organizing Kruskal-Wallis for two different analyses

I have the following data: Seven substances (hereafter S1–S7); Inside each substance, I have 30 scores (10 for each of three layers (let's call them A, B, and C)). The scores (1–5) are also ordinal. An example: S1 A - 10; B - 10; C - 10; S2 A - 10; B - 10; C - 10; And so on. So, I have two questions: Compare the effect of each S1-S7 on the scores; Compare the effect of each S1-S7 on the scores while considering the A, B, C layers. What's the correct way of organizing the data for this? For question (1) I think simply doing a scores ~ substances is enough, but how can I add the layers idea in (2)? Is it a simple two-way?
