How to measure weight similarity?

I'm doing some machine learning and get a set of optimum weights in the end. I'd like to verify that these weights are by and large the same no matter how many times I train on the data. I assume that my cost function has a global minimum. How can I measure the similarity between two set of weights that I got from training two times?
