The second one is impossible in your example , when $\beta$ is negative, your $exp(\beta)$ should be less than 1 but still bigger than zero. For example, $exp(-0.98)=0.3753111$. Which means your odds decreases by 37.5% or by 0.6246889 (relative to $1$) depending on different understanding of English. And the first one should be $exp(0.98)=2.66$ when coefficient is positve the odds should be bigger than one for multinominal logistic regression.
