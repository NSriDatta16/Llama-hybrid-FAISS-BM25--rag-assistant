jQuery and drop in table

I have the following code. When the table is empty in need to append to ti but if there's rows I need to insertBefore the row on which I drop. But the drop is only detected on the TABLE, the trace only show table even if I drop on a tr $("#mytable TABLE, #mytable TABLE").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { var target = $(event.target); var draggable = ui.draggable; trace(target[0].tagName) ; } });
