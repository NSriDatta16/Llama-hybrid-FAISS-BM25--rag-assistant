The conventional thing to do with equal ranks is to assign them the average of the ranks they would have got if they had been assigned separate ranks. So if expert A said {a, b, c, d, e} were the elite teasm and {x, y, z} were not then expert A has assigned rank 3 to the five elite teams (1+2+3+4+5)/5 and rank 7 to the other teams (6+7+8)/3. You can carry out the same procedure for the competition results and then compute Spearman's $\rho$.
