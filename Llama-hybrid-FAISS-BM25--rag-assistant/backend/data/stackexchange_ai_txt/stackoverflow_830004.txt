The things I'd consider: 1) Are you ever likely to want to scale it up massively? If so Oracle will allow a very straight forward route to a massively scalable platform (you can pretty much just back up the database and restore it to a full Oracle instance). 2) Are you going to want to scale moderately? If so then Oracle XE is limited to 4Gb total DB size where MySQL can perform reasonably with significantly more. 3) Would the other constraints on Oracle XE likely impact you? It will only support 1Gb of RAM and 1 CPU for instance. If you think you're likely to need more than this for decent performance it's a non-starter. See the FAQ ( http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/xe/pdf/dbxe_faq.pdf ) for more details. 4) Do you have skills in either in your organisation? Not only as a developer but also for support, back up strategy and so on. If there are skills in place then likely go with whichever you have the skills for. Make sure you speak to the support guys too and get their input. My gut feel says MySQL but use the above to weigh it up.
