The post shows a "Bayesian surprise" setting, where the data are surprisingly far from the center of the prior. In this setting, the location and shape of the posterior is sensitive to the rate of decrease of the tails of the prior and likelihood. for Normal data and prior, the posterior is Normal and is between the data mean and the prior mean for $t$ data and prior, sufficiently far apart, the posterior is bimodal for Laplace data and prior, the posterior is flat across a wide interval and other things for other examples I have an interactive version here , and Tony O'Hagan analysed the location problem completely in JASA in 1990
