C++ Where to define globals (Linker Error: Symbol already defined)

I googled for about 30 minutes now and didnt find anything related to my problem: I use Visual Studio C++ 2008, it declared a header for me called "stdafx.h" in this header i declared all stuff i need, an i want the global variables to be in there too, but when i want to use one of these variables, i get an error (at compiling time) my "stdafx.h" looks like this: #pragma once #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN // Exclude rarely-used stuff from Windows headers // Windows Header Files: windows header here.... // C RunTime Header Files compiler related standard headers here.... // TODO: reference additional headers your program requires here #ifndef aaab #include "codename.hpp" #define aaab #endif // and a load of other headers (all of my project) followed here ... ... ... and after the declarations i defined my globals like: Game *game; and i want to use them in "codename.cpp" here a short view of the class #include "stdafx.h" #define MAX_LOADSTRING 100 other class related stuff here.... main function here.... void test() { game = new Game(); // HERE IS THE ERROR }
