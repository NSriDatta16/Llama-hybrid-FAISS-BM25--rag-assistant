Get bounds of filters applied to Flash Sprite within Sprite

I have a Flash library with Sprite symbols composed of other sprites with design-time applied filters. I'm embedding those symbols into a Flex application like so: In this example, the SquareContainer symbol is 100px wide by 100px height; however it contains a child sprite with a glow and blur filter, that cause the sprite to appear to be significantly larger than 100x100. Since I cannot know for certain the composition of the container, I cannot use BitmapData.generateFilterRect() to get at the filters applied to nested sprites. How can I get the size of the sprite plus its filters?
