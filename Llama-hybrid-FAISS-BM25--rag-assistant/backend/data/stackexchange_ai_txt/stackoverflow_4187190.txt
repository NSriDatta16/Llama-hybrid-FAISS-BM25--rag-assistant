Web Deploy uses 2 means of communications: MSDeploy Agent (service) on IIS6+ and WMSvc handler on IIS7+. In your case the URL suggests that you are trying to use the handler, which won't work for IIS6. You dont need to use msdeploy.axd... in the url Make sure MSDeploy agent is started on the remote machine: net start msdepsvc
