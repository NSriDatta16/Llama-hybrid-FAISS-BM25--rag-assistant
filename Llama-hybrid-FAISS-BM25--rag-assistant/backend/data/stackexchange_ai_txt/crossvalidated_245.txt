Principal component scores are a group of scores that are obtained following a Principle Components Analysis (PCA). In PCA the relationships between a group of scores is analyzed such that an equal number of new "imaginary" variables (aka principle components) are created. The first of these new imaginary variables is maximally correlated with all of the original group of variables. The next is somewhat less correlated, and so forth until the point that if you used all of the principal components scores to predict any given variable from the initial group you would be able to explain all of its variance. The way in which PCA proceeds is complex and has certain restrictions. Among these is the restriction that the correlation between any two principal components (i.e. imaginary variables) is zero; thus it doesn't make sense to try to predict one principal component with another.
