If you have 10 points, I would say the only regularization "scheme" you'd even want to remotely consider is the fully bayesian one. Look up bayesian regression, bayesian testing, or whatever you're trying to do. There are packages that will help you, but you'll want to be involved in the priors. In many larger data situations, you're not as worried about them (for typical uses of L2 regularization, you've effectively got a prior mean of 0), but with your sample size, they are going to matter. Set them carefully, by thinking about what you know and don't know. You'll get "regularization," but it doesn't have to be the kind that just makes your coefficients smaller. Rather it could "shrink" them closer to a non-zero prior mean value, for instance.
