Neural networks aren't (probably) in this case arbitrary trees. They are probably networks with a constant structure, i.e. same nodes and connections, so 'breeding' them would involve 'averaging' the weights of nodes. You could average the weights for each pair of nodes in the two corresponding nets to produce the 'offspring' net. Or you could use a more complicated function dependent on ever-further sets of neighboring nodes â€“ the possibilities are Vast. My answer is incomplete if the assumption about the fixed structure is false or unwarranted.
