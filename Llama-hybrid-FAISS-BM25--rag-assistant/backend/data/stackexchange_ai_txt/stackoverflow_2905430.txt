Writing an http sniffer (or any other application level sniffer)

I am trying my hands understanding PCAP libraries. I am able to apply a filter and get the TCP payload at port 80. But what next ? How can I read the HTTP data - suppose I want to know the "User Agent" field value in the http header..how should I proceed ? I have searched the website (and googled a lot too), and could find a related thread here : writing a http sniffer . But this doesn't help me anywhere... Thanks !!
