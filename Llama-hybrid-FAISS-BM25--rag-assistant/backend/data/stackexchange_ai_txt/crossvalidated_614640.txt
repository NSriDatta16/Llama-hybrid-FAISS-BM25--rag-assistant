How expressing within and between groups variability?

I have a double question related with expressing the variability (as standard deviation) of a dataset. Let's say I want to give an average value of the nitrogen content in "fruits" (units: percentage over dry matter). I have the nitrogen content of apples, oranges and bananas. apples oranges bananas 1.15 3.15 5.15 1.16 3.16 5.16 1.18 3.18 5.18 The within-group variability is the same in all the groups (SD = 0.015). I think that the correct way to express the within-group variability is the average of the SD of every group. This is equivalent to the approach of ANOVA for within-group variation (root square of mean square within groups). The problem comes when I try to express the between-group variability. I can only think of 3 solutions: Calculating the mean for each group and using this 3 data forgetting the intragroup variability (with this approach we obtain a mean: 3.16 and a SD: 2) Calculating the mean and SD for each group and using an error propagation method for averages (see link) gives me a value of SD: 0.0088. Clearly, this is not expressing the intergroup variability. ( https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/science/biology/simple-error-propagation-formulas-for-simple-expressions-149357/ ) Using the ANOVA approach for between-group variation it gives me the sum of squares of 3*(-2)^2+3 0^2+3 2^2 = 24. Then I divided between the degrees of freedom (2) and then I took the squared root and I obtained SD: 3.46. This value seems too high (where this variability comes from?). Is valid some of these approaches? Why?
