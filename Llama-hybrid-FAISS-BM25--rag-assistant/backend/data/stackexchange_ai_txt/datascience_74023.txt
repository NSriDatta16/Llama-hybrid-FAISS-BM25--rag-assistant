How to find the average over an area of center for a given radius

I have an excel file which contains the lat and long values of the center of a Tropical Cyclone(TC). The excel file is as given below: 19.8 69.4 20 69 20.4 68.2 20.5 67.2 20.5 65.7 20.3 65 20.2 64.2 20.2 63.7 20.2 62.9 20.2 62.3 20.2 61.5 20.1 61 20.1 60.3 20 59.5 19.9 58.9 19.8 58.3 Also, I have an NC(NetCDF) file which is of that of air temperature(The link to the data is given) air_temp.nc . Now what I intend to do is average over an area of radius 2.5◦ on the storm center for the variable in the NC data i.e. for each lat long value I need to find the average over an area of average 2.5◦. I know how to find the simple average using NumPy mean for individual lat-long, but I am confused about how to find over an area for a given radius.
