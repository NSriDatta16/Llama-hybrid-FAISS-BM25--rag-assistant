I would suggest keeping all the tabs on one line (make it as wide as required) and scrolling to the current tab. (You'll want a drop-down menu listing all of the available tabs as well, for navigation.) The problem with what you're trying to do is that if you do get what you want, what happens when a tab in the top row is selected? You have a selected tab that is not connected to the current panel (separated by the bottom row of tabs), which is ugly or You move the top row of tabs to the bottom (adjacent to the panel) in which case you have the situation you're trying to avoid or You re-organise the tabs to put the selected one on the bottom, which makes a mess of navigation (it is impossible for a user to learn where the tabs are).
