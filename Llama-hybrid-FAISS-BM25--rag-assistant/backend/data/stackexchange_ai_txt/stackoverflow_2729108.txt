Let's try to understand how TeX works. What happens when you write the following? tex.exe myfile.tex TeX reads your file byte by byte. First of all, TeX converts each char to pair . Each character has category code and ascii code. Category code means that the character is an opening brace ( { ) or entrance into the mathematical mode ( $ ), symbol-macro ( ~ , for example) or letter ( A-Z , a-z ). If TeX gets chars with category code 11 (letters) or 12 (other symbols: digits, comma, period) TeX starts a paragraph. You want to cache all paragraphs. Suppose you changed something in your document. How can TeX check that all paragraphs after your changes is the same? May be you changed the category of some char. Me be you changed the meaning of some macro. Or you have removed } somewhere and thus changed the current font. To be sure that the paragraph is the same you must be sure that all characters in the paragraph is the same, that all character categories is the same, the current font is the same, all math fonts is the same, and the value of some internal variables is the same (for example, \hsize , \vsize , \pretolerance , \tolerance , \hypenpenalty , exhyphenpenalty , \widowpenalty , \spaceskip , ..., ........) You can be sure only that all paragraphed before your changes is the same. But in this case you must keep all states after each paragraph. Your system SuperCachedTeX is very complicated. Isn't it?
