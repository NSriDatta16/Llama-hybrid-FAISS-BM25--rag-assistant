This will actually never converge completely. This process can be modelled as a Markov chain. While asymptotically, the distribution of the orderings will converge to the stationary distribution, which has equal distribution to all card orderings, it will not, after any finite shuffling, be completely random. A simplified version of this problem is included in parts in https://galton.uchicago.edu/~lalley/Courses/313/ConvergenceRates.pdf .
