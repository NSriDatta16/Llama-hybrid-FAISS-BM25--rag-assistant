Which classification model should I choose and Why?

I am working on a research-based assignment where I suppose to build a 3-class (bad, medium, good) classification using SVM. The dataset provided is imbalanced. The train:test splitting ratio is 75:25 with stratified method. First Model - I did not oversample the data Second Model - I oversample minority class using RandomOverSampler() in the the train set Third Model - I oversample minority class using RandomOverSampler() in the original dataset, then only i split into train and test set. Based on all 3 models' result, which model should be chosen (even if there is room for improvement for both 3 models) in terms of logicalness, correctness and also why?
