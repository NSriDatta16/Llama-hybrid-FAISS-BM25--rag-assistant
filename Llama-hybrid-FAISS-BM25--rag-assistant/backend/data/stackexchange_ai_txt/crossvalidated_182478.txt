Bayesian vs. Frequentist calculation steps

This article contains an example of Bayesian vs. Frequentist philosophies. An old drug successfully treats 70% of patients. To test a new drug, researchers give it to 100 patients, 83 of whom recover. Based on this evidence, how certain should we be that the new drug is worse than, identical to, or better than the old one? Bayesian Solution: Under standard assumptions the ‘posterior’ probability the new drug is better than the old one is 0.89, the probability it’s the same is 0.11 (starting from a prior of 0.5), and the probability it’s worse is practically zero. Frequentist Solution: In our case, we need the fraction of the time we’d see 83 or more, or 57 or less recoveries, which is 0.006. This quantity is called a p-value. An oft-criticised convention is that a p-value less than 0.05 implies evidence against the null hypothesis, and our result of 0.006 certainly qualifies as such. My Question: How were the Bayesian and the Frequentist solutions arrived at? Please provide the steps. Thanks.
