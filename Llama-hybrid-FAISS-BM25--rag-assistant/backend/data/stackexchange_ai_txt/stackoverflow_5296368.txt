EDIT: Go into Eclipse -> Preferences Select Java -> Editor -> Content Assist In the box in the bottom "Auto-Activation", uncheck the checkbox "Enable Auto-Activation" See if this helps you. It will disabled the auto-fill, and you will need to press ctrl+space to activate the auto-fill. If this does not work, then: By using Eclipse I'd recommend not writing imports where you are importing android-specific classes. Eclipse is smart enough to suggest the classes you need when you need them, organizing your imports automatically. The only time I ever write the import statements is when I'm importing classes that I've written myself and when Eclipse can not find them. Let's say you need the class Bitmap from Android. In your class-file just write: private Bitmap myBitmap; And Eclipse will automatically suggest: android.graphics.Bitmap and import the correct class: import android.graphics.Bitmap;
