Summary of Ruby on Rails fundamental concepts

Being new to Rails, I am having a difficult time finding a website or reference that gives a run down summary of Ruby on Rails. I understand MVC, ActiveRecord, and that sort of stuff on a basic level, but I am having a hard time understanding some of the relationships and fundamentals. For instance: What are all naming conventions I need to be aware of? How should controller actions be structured and named? What are the best ways to render information in a view (via :content_for or render a partial) and what are ways I shouldn't use? What should go into a helper and what shouldn't? What are common pitfalls or something I need to do correctly from the very beginning? How can you modularize code? Is that what the lib folder is for? I have read a number of responses on StackOverflow in regards to this question, but all of them just point to a 300+ page book I need to read, whereas I just want a concise summary of what's important. Some resources I am already aware of, but do not offer a concise summary of fundamental concepts for new users: http://railscasts.com/ (good, but fragmented) http://guides.rubyonrails.org/ (assumes you already understand relationships between everything) http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ (paint by colors, no good summary) Rails AntiPatterns (great, but you have to read the whole thing before you understand anything) The Rails 3 Way (great, but again, you have to read the whole thing before you understand anything) Thank you for any help, references, or guidance you can provide! P.S. I would like this wiki to become a living document, so please add to it, edit it, etc. as you feel necessary.
