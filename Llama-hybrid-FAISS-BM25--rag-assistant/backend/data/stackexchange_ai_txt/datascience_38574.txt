What is a good method for detection of rare occurencies of speech in noisy audio data?

I have some audio recordings (with relatively static but noisy background, e.g., wind in an open area) with small number of short occurrences of speech (~1% of the total audio duration). What would be a good method to detect the speech occurences in an unsupervised manner? I have tried simple thresholding on a spectrogram, but this is problematic since: The intensity of the background can wary with time (i.e. noise is louder sometimes) Different speech segments need not to be similar to each other Often, speech is too quiet (compared to the average loudness of the background) and is overlaid by noise This may seem like quite a hard task, however I can easily notice the speech segments by listening to the audio/looking at the spectrogram, since spectrogram of speech has some distinct structure (although it is non-trivial to rely on the structure for detection as it is still quite non-regular). Note that I just want to detect intervals with something sounding like human speech (or, say, something distinct enough from the background, since data typically has no other sound sources besides background/speech).
