You have to go back to the motivation for a proper scoring rule, which you state loosely as "the agent with the least score makes the most accurate guesses." To be precise, the origin of scoring rules are to elicit probabilities that reflect true beliefs -as you state, a person can do no better than offer a probability corresponding to their belief when offered a scoring-rule as a reward. Scoring rules have been used to define what a probability means without referring to the limit of a large number of repetitions. Such a scoring rule is derived by taking expectation over the rule, hence the appearance of the mean over the set of predictions. So when you ask must "the statistical functional must be the mean?" you are really asking how can we take the expectation over a set of scores by some other method than the conventional use of the mean? I read into your concern that "proper scoring rules aren't on the same scale as probabilities" that perhaps you are looking to express how good or bad the computed score is? Aside from the Brier score, the log of the absolute difference between the offered probability and a 0,1 outcome is also a proper scoring rule, but that may not give more interpretable results, especially since it can diverge to extreme values for large errors. Buried in the derivation of scoring rules is that the decision maker has linear utility, hence expectation is taken over the scoring rule directly, not over the utility of the scoring rule outcome. (A person may be risk adverse to large deviations from the truth, and that would bias their elicited probabilities.) Perhaps you are implicitly thinking of a utility function that expresses how good or bad are the "probabilities of what people will choose" instead of just the probabilities themselves?
