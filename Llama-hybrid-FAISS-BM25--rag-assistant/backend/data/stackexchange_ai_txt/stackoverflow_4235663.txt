I realize that its been a while since the OP asked this question, but I've been thinking of doing something similar recently - My problem is representing an HTML page with multiple components (tiles) as an RSS feed. I am thinking of just embedding the XPath to the component (from the main page) as a rss/item/category tag: ... /component1/subcomponent2 Hopefully this helps someone else that comes looking :-).
