Summary statistics for two populations

I have two populations: part-time worker in the health industry (IND=17) and part-time worker in the financial industry (IND=12) For those two populations I have several variables (demographic variables and professional variables) What would be a good table to show the different populations of part-time workers (how similar/different they are)? Should I work with percentages or means? AGE 2 = 18-24 years old 3 = 25-29 years old 4 = 30-34 years old 5 = 35-39 years old 6 = 40-44 years old 7 = 45-49 years old 8 = 50-54 years old 9 = 55-59 years old 10 = 60-64 years old SEX 1.00 = Male 2.00 = Female EDU 1.00 = Pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education 2.00 = Apprenticeship/high school degree or equivalent 3.00 = College graduate 4.00 = Master degree 5.00 = PhD SIZE 1 = Less than 10 employees 2 = 10-49 employees 3 = 50-99 employees 4 = 100-249 employees 5 = 250-499 employees 6 = 500-999 employees 7 = 1000 employees or more FCT 1 = Marketing, sales, distribution management 2 = Production, manufacturing operations (purchases, process planning, storage etc.) 3 = Customer support (customer service, call center, counter, care) 4 = Infrastructure (IT operations and development, logistics) 5 = Research and development 6 = Internal services, finance/financial control, HR training 7 = Other COLLAR 1 = Blue collar worker 2 = White collar worker MGMT 1 = I do not manage other people 2 = I manage other people who are not managers 3 = I manage managers SCOPE 1 = My company only has employees in my own country 2 = My company has employees in more than one but less than 10 countries 3 = My company has employees in more than 10 countries TENURE 1 = Less than 1 year 2 = 1 year to less than 2 years 3 = 2 years to less than 5 years 4 = 5 years to less than 10 years 5 = 10 years to less than 20 years 6 = 20 years to less than 30 years 7 = 30 years and over
