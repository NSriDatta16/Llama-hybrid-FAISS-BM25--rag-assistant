Output of Scikit SVM in multiclass classification always gives same label

I am currently using Scikit learn with the following code: clf = svm.SVC(C=1.0, tol=1e-10, cache_size=600, kernel='rbf', gamma=0.0, class_weight='auto') and then do fit and predict for a set of data with 7 different labels. I got a weird output. No matter which cross validation technique I use the predicted label on the validation set is always going to be label 7. I try some other parameters, including the full default one ( svm.SVC() ) but as long as the kernel method I use is rbf instead of poly or linear it just would not work, while it work really fine for poly and linear . Besides I have already try prediction on train data instead of validation data and it perfectly fit. Does anyone see this kind of problem before and know what is going on here? I never look at my class distribution in detail but I know it should be around 30% of them are 7, 14% are 4. I even try a manual 1-vs-rest implementation and it is still not helpful.
