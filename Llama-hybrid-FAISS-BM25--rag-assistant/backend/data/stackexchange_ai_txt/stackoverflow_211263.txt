Halt storage access?

I am trying to construct a way to keep certain hard drive partitions/usb drives from being accessed for security reasons (protecting intellectual property). I was thinking that when windows attempts to access the "locked down drive/usb" the attempted is halted and returns something like "drive inaccessible" or something. It's just an idea, anyone thing it is plausible/possible? If so, any pointers? C/C++ -Thanks
