How to catch error in an ASP.NET MVC and display a gracious error message to the user?

I'm writing a very small application for my organization. As nobody seems to know what he wants, I've decide that I'll deploy a demo on our local server so people can get ideas on how to conceive the big thing. Now here's the problem: While developing on my laptop, when the application crashes, I get a yellow screen giving feedback on the problem ( to me ). But, if I decide to put the application online, I don't want those kind of yellow screen to be seen by others who are not developers (I know they might be a few because the demo is just a starting point). Is there anyway I can put a mechanism in place so that when there's an fatal error, the user can get a nice screen telling with an e-mail link telling him to send me an e-mail? Thanks for helping
