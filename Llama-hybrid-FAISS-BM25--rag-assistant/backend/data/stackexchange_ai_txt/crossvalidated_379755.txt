Ok, so as the comments say, you've got two primary choices depending on how you want to conceptualize your dependent variable. If you want to keep its ordered structure and treat it as a ordinal measure then you can do a proportional odds model (ordinal logistic regression). If you just treat them as separate levels with no ordering then you can just do a multinomial logistic regression. Mutlinomial logistic regression can be done with VGAM package. library(VGAM) some.model The interpretation is like binary logistic regression with more levels. I.e. It gives you the log odds of being in a level compared to the reference level of the DV, for each unit increase in the IV. You have to take the exponential of the betas before you interpret it, and the interpretation is in odds not in raw values. So for example, if you get a $\beta_{IV1}=0.7$ , then $e^{\beta_{IV1}}=e^{0.7}=2.01$ means being the effect of a one unit increase in IV 1 on the the odds of someone being in level 2 (of the DV) compared to level 1 is a 101% increase, or around twice the odds. So, in your case as IV1 increases the chances of the customer being "neutral" compared to "not satisfied" is increased by 100%. And so on, for your other levels of the DV. If you want to preserve the ordered structure of your dependent variable, the VGAM package will also do proportional odds models. model1 First start off by assuming the different levels have proportional odds, this assumes that the IV affects the levels of the DV equally. So each level will have a different intercept but only one $\beta$ per DV. These models capture the ordered nature of the DV, by fitting a cumulative odds model. You interpret by taking the exponential of the $\beta$ again, and this time it's the effect of one unit increase of IV1 is to in/decrease the cumulative odds ratio (compared to if you had not increased the IV) of being in level 2 or lower by whatever percent. The effect of IV1 on level 3 or lower is the same. But that doesn't mean the levels of the DV have the same odds because remember they have different intercepts. But then sometimes the IV has a different effect on the levels of the DV and so the odds are not proportional. You can check it by fitting the model and saying parallel=F . To know whether the assumption is violated or not, compare the fit of the models using a log likelihood ratio test 2*(logLik(model2)-logLik(model1)) which is distributed $\chi^2_{p(k-2)}$ where P is the number of parameters and k is number of levels of the DV. If setting parallel=F leads to a significantly better fit, then the assumption is broken. In fact, you can say only a specific IV has non proportional odds between levels of the DV, while the other IVs do have proportional odds by saying parallel=F~IV1 If the odds are non proportional, there will be different $\beta$ 's for each level of the DV. Now, after taking exponential of $\beta$ , the interpretation is the effect of a one unit increase in IV1 increases the odds ratio (compared to no increase in IV1) of the person being in level 2 or lower by this much. A one unit increase in IV1 increases the odds ratio (compared to no increase in IV1) of the person being in level 3 or lower by that much. Which approach you take depends on how you conceptualize your DV, but i do admit the multinomial approach is slightly less confusing.
