OK so It is as simple as this: and... public partial class $safeitemname$ : System.Web.UI.Page It threw me because the page won't compile and the page turns red with rage! This means you will have to put these $slightlystrangeparameters$ in once you have got your template item completed and built. Add the parameters in and export it as a template. Hope this helps someone else...
