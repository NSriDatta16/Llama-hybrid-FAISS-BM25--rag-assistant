For a web start application (such as you're talking about): javaws -uninstall You can also uninstall a specific Web Start application by providing the URL to the JNLP on the -unintall command line. When I've run into this problem, the root cause was a web server incorrectly applying an incorrect expiration date for the Web Start's JAR files. When I corrected this problem with my Apache HTTPD configuration, I stopped having the Web Start application not always update. It's worth checking out.
