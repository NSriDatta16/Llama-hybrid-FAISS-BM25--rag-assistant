I am a programmer, how do I get into field of Data Science?

First of all this term sounds so obscure. Anyways..I am a software programmer. One of the languages I can code is Python. Speaking of Data I can use SQL and can do Data Scraping. What I figured out so far after reading soo many articles that Data Science is all about good at: 1- Stats 2- Algebra 3- Data Analysis 4- Visualisation. 5- Machine Learning. What I know so far: 1- Python Programming 2- Data scrapping in Python Can you experts guide me or suggest a roadmap to brush up both theory and practical? I have given around 8 months of time frame to myself.
