Authorship of a delta method - Does R. Dorfman invented it?

I would like to define an authorship of a delta method, which I need to make a proper reference in my work. As far as I know, the earliest record is dated back to 1936 when Robert Dorfman has published his A Note on the δ-Method for Finding Variance Formulae in The Biometric Bulletin, 1, 129–137 (I have not found this article by myself, but I base this on some mention found in the internet.) Is it true that the author of delta method is R. Dorfman or someone else? Does anybody know where to reach this particular article or other from which this method comes?
