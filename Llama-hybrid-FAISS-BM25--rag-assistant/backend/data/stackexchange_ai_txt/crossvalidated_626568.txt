How to predict more than one future values in ARMA model

I want some help with predicting more than one future values in ARMA. I saw that the similar question has been asked here . But it is only helpful for predicting one future value. For estimation of the error terms for the time series $y_1\ldots y_n$ , I am using the following equation... $\epsilon_t = y_t-(\sum_{i=1}^p\phi_iy_{t-i}+\sum_{i=1}^q\theta_i\epsilon_{t-i})$ If I wanted to predict $y_{n+1}$ , I would use the following equation... $y_{t+1} = \sum_{i=1}^p\phi_iy_{t-i+1}+\sum_{i=1}^q\theta_i\epsilon_{t-i+1}$ Since $E(\epsilon_{t+1})=0$ ( reference ) But then if I want to predict the second value I will use the previous equation with subscript $t+2$ . But in that equation, I'll need $\epsilon+1$ since it will have the term $\theta_{0}\epsilon_{t+1}$ . And the process will go on. I can't use the value zero everywhere. What should I do in this case. Please help. P.S.: Currently, my algorithm is to estimate the future value $y_{t+1}$ and then calculate the error term $\epsilon_{t+1}$ using the same estimated value. And then I continue predicting the future values this way, but is this appropriate?
