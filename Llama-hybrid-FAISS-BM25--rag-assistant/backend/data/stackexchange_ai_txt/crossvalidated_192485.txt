Regression to the mean with correlated and cumulative past

My colleagues and I are posing this question to our intro statistics students, but are in disagreement about the answer: Suppose a student always got scores far above the class average throughout high-school. On her second-to-last mathematics exam she receives a score of 92%, well below her personal average, while the class average on this exam was 76%. On the one hand, considering only HER scores, regression to the mean may predict a final score above 92%. On the other hand, if there is correlation between the exams, then her score might be lower. Would love to hear thoughts about this.
