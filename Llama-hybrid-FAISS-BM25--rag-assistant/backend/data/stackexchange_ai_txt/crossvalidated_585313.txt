To obtain the transition matrix of the Markov chain, you just observe all the transitions many times and then compute the belonging transition frequencies which are the approximations for the transition probabilities. That is what you have done in creating the matrix RotationMatrix . How good are those approximations? If you can presume that those transition probabilities don't change and that you also have no measurement errors, the confidence intervals for their estimations can be computed in several ways . They depend, of course, on the number of observed transitions. However, if you suspect that those transition probabilities are varying and/or that your measurements have some error, those formulae might not apply anymore. In this case, you could just compute the estimations several times (e.g. using bootstrap ) and then take the sample variance. Finally, your question about how the start value affects the simulated sequence. Of course, the sequence depends on the starting point, but if the Markov chain is ergodic , the statistics are independent of the starting value.
