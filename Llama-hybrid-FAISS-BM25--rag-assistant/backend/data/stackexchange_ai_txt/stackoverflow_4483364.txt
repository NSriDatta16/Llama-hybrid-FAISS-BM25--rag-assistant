I've a draggable box with an append button to fill the box with elements. I would like to have a button wich duplicates this box with all of its functions and elements. my problem and question at the moment is; how can i duplicate the whole box? Including its elements and functions? Here is a preview of the code; http://jsfiddle.net/AttEb/
