How to compare two different algorithms for deep RL?

Assume we have two algorithms for a deep RL problem. We used them to train an agent for this environment and stored the rewards at each episode for these two different algorithms. My question is that how can we say which algorithm is better? Plot for all 50k episodes Plot for 50k episodes where we have only plotted once every 20 episodes Plot for 50k episodes where we have only plotted once every 200 episodes Another question, which plot is the one people use when they want to plot reward\return with respect to the episode numbers?
