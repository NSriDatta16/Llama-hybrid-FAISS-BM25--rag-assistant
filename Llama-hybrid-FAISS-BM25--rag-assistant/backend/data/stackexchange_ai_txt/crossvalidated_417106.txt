Average with ability to configure importance of peak values

I have list of numbers (about 200 numbers), where almost all numbers are in range of 100 - 10000 , but some numbers (very few, about 5-10 numbers) may have values more than 100000 (see attached graph). I need to get average value from all numbers but pay more attention to more frequent values (from 100 to 10000 ), rare values should not be ignored but don't affect the result as much as frequent values. Also, I'd like to configure importance of rare values with coefficient. What formula can I use for this case?
