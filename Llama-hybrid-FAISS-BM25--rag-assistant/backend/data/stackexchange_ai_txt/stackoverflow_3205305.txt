You could try the ''noac'' mount option from man nfs: In addition to preventing the client from caching file attributes, the noac option forces application writes to become synchronous so that local changes to a file become visible on the server immediately. That way, other clients can quickly detect recent writes when they check the file's attributes. Using the noac option provides greater cache coherence among NFS clients accessing the same files, but it extracts a significant performance penalty. As such, judicious use of file locking is encouraged instead. You could have two mounts, one for critical fast changing data that you need synchronized and another mount for other data. Also, look into NFS locking and its limitations . As for general advice: One way to truncate a file that is concurrently read from multiple hosts is to write the content into a temporary file and then rename that file to the final location. On the same filesystem this operation should be atomic.
