There is a problem with your plan. You cannot use ANOVA on stock market data. The statistical distribution involved in stock market data has been in dispute since 1963. That ended recently with someone doing a first principles derivation of the returns that would exist under a variety of circumstances. With the narrow exception of firms being merged out of existence for cash, you cannot use ANOVA. The distribution of returns, for equity securities that are going concerns, must be some form of transformation of the Cauchy distribution which is then truncated at -100%. You can show that the CDF of the Cauchy distribution is the limit of one of the integrals when the problem is converted to polar coordinates. In any circumstance, the solution is either a Cauchy distribution, or a deformation of the Cauchy distribution. The difficulty is that the Cauchy distribution lacks a mean, and therefore also lacks a variance. At first this is a strange idea, because you can add numbers up and divide the sample size and therefore you have a sample average. You, of course, have sample averages, but they mean nothing because there is no population average. Because returns are truncated your center of location is the mode and there is no standardized term in use for the scale parameter because truncation disrupts simple descriptors like the inter-quartile range. It better to think of the variance as a feature of a distribution than as something that must exist, like noses are a feature of most vertebrates. If you see something without a nose, its probably not a vertebrate. This also renders most algorithmic trading methods invalid. The field will have years of clean-up to do. While you should master ANOVA as it is a very useful tool, do not use it with stocks or anything else that grows at an exponential rate, such as cancer. You do want to master this tool because of its intrinsic value, nonetheless.
