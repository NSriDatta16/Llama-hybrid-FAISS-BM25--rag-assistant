The warning comes from Visual Studio's non-standard "safe" library checks introduced starting with MSVC 8.0. Microsoft has identified "potentially dangerous" APIs and has injected warnings discouraging their use. While it is technically possible to call std::copy in an unsafe way, 1) receiving this warning does not mean you are doing so, and 2) using std::copy as you normally should is not dangerous.
