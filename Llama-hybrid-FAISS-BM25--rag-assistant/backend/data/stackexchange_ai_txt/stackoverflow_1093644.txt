If you draw a line around everyone who can access private data, that is the extent that the data is encapsulated. If you use the friend keyword, that line has to be drawn around more things. Thus encapsulation is extended or broken, depending on your point of view. In general, I discourage the use of friend . Instead consider adding accessors for private data.
