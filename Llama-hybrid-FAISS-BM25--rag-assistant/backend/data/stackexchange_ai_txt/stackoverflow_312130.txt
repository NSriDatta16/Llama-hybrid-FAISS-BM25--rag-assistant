You are using something that is not a standard. Actually it is standard C but not C++. How peculiar is that! Explaining a bit more, run time sized stack arrays are not part of C++, but are part of C99, the latest standard for C. ThatÂ´s why some compilers will get it, while others will not. I would recommend refrain from using it, to avoid compiler compatibility issues. The alternate implementation of the functionality would be using new and delete, as posted by strager.
