The random forest should pick this up automatically from the data itself. If data closer to the present has a stronger effect on your y predictor than earlier lags, then the coefficients will be larger for more recent lags and smaller for earlier lags. The regression coefficients, i.e., "weights", should be wholly determined by the data. If you do want to try a weighted time series, you can use Holt Winters Triple Exponential smoothing on your score variable and then see if a regression model with additional lagged features beats the time series model.
