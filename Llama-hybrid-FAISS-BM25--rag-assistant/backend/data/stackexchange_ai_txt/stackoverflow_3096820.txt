Most current implementation methods for serializing objects in .NET (as of v4.0)

I have an simple custom object called MyObject (a couple of basic properties and a List(of MyObject) , so it's recursive) that I need to serialize for storage. I'm not sure if I'll serialize to XML or Binary yet, but I want to make sure I'm using the most up-to-date methods for doing it, as there are a few different namespaces involved and I might be missing something. To do XML, I'd use System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer To do binary, I'd use System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter There's also a System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter , but MSDN claims it's depreciated in favor of BinaryFormatter. I would have expected everything to be in the second namespace above - is there a newer version of the XmlSerializer that I should be using?
