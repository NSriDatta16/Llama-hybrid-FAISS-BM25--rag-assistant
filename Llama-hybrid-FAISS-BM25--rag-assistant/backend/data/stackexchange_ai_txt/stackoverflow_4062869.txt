Given the fact that the photo could be of up to 400KB the tinyblob won't do the job. How can I map this field? IIRC, Hibernate also uses the length attribute of the Column annotation when mapping a property as Lob . Try the following: @Lob @Column(nullable= false, length=400000) private byte[] photo; Is this the most elegant way of handling images? As others have stated, the (better) alternative would be to store them on the file system and to write the path in the database.
