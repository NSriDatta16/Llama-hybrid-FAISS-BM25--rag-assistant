Cross validation is just one of the methods for model selection http://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_selection.html . I would read on topics of model selection: cross validation, feature selection and evaluation. I am sorry for this general answer, but the topic is just too broad. As a starting point I would suggest Machine Learning by Thom Mitchell. Event if it was pusblished in 1998, many topics are still relevant and nicely introduced. Concretely model selection and evaluation. A more in depth book is Introduction to Statistical Learning , which is freely available.
