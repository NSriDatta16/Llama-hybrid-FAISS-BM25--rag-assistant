Trac accesses your repository directly - that's why it ignores authz that works for your webserver. See http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/AuthzPolicy and http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracFineGrainedPermissions if you need Trac to use authz for fine-grained browser access. From that I know - you can't use users from authz as Trac users, because authz doesn't store authentication passwords to recognize these users. See http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin for supported storages.
