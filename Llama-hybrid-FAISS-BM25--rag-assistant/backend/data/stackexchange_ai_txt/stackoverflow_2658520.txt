The illuminate Correlation Database is a new revolutionary non-relational database. The Correlation Database Management Dystem (CDBMS) is data model independent and designed to efficiently handle unplanned, ad hoc queries in an analytical system environment. Unlike relational database management systems or column-oriented databases, a correlation database uses a value-based storage (VBS) architecture in which each unique data value is stored only once and an auto-generated indexing system maintains the context for all values (data is 100% indexed). Queries are performed using natural language instead of SQL (NoSQL). Learn more at: www.datainnovationsgroup.com
