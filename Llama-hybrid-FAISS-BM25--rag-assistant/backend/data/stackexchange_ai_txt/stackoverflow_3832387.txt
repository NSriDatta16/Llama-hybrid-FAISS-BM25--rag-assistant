Javascript: Alert user without using an alert box

I'm trying to find an elegant way to inform a user that s/he is about to be logged out and I know that most browsers will give you some indication that a hidden tab has an alert box open. I would like to duplicate this functionality without actually showing an alert box. I have thought about forcing the tab/window to gain focus, but that is quite obtrusive and I hate it when websites do that to me, so I'm looking for something a little more subtle. Any ideas? Edit/Clarification: I already have a div that pops up if they are about to be logged out. My problem is that if they are on another tab, they won't be able to see that div, so I would like some way to notify the user that something important has happened on my tab so they go check it out and see the logout notice. The favicon idea listed below is an excellent idea, any others?
