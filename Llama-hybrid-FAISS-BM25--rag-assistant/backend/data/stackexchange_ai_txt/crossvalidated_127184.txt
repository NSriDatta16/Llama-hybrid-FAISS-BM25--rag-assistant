In actuality, both statistics can be misleading if you do not know or understand your hypothesis and experiment. Consider this gruesome example... Walking across two high rise buildings on a tightrope as opposed to walking on a plank. Let's say that the tightrope has a 1 inch diameter, whereas the plank is 12 inches wide. 5 people were asked to walk the rope and 5 were asked to walk the plank. We found the following results: The average distance of each step from the edge (or side) of the rope (inches): 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.1 The average distance of each step from the edge (or side) of the plank (inches): 5.5, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.1 Just as in your example, this example will results in equal standard deviations as the values for the plank are simply a +5 difference to those for the tightrope. However, if I told you that the standard deviation for each experiment was 0.2074 you might say well then the two experiments were equivalent. However, if I told you that the CV for the tightrope experiment was almost 61% compared to under 4% for the plank, you might be inclined to ask me how many people fell off of the rope.
