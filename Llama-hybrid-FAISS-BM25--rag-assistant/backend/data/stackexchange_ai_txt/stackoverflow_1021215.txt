Do you proficently use System.Web.UI.* controls? Not anymore. Don't you get confused by the page lifecycle? Used to. Particularly when custom/user controls were mixed in. Don't you feel like that putting a SQLDataSource on each page produces unmaintainable code? Sure it does, but no one forces you to use SqlDataSource. I prefer ObjectDataSource with 3tier architecture. Going MVC way is dissapointing sometimes. The obvious stuff like paging and sorting needs to get reinvented (open source stuff usually doesn't fits all your needs). Even more important - MVC project can easily become a real mess if you don't know what you are doing and not keeping it well organized. But in hands of professional - MVC is a nuclear weapon. Be careful. :)
