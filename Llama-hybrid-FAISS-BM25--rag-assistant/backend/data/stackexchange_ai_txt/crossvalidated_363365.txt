Where can I find pre-trained language models in English and German?

Where can I find (more) pre-trained language models? I am especially interested in neural network based models for English and German . I am aware only of Language Model on One Billion Word Benchmark and TF-LM: TensorFlow-based Language Modeling Toolkit . I am surprised not to find a greater wealth of models for different frameworks and languages.
