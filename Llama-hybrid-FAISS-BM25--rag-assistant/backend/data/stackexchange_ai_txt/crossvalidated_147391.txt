Understanding Zipf's law calculation for probability of a word

So, I am analyzing a a corpus of ~1,000,000 words and I am trying to understand how I can use Zipf's law. I found on some textbook slides the following formulas: $$f_r = c/r$$ $$p_r = k/r $$ where $f_r$ is the occurrence of a word at rank $r$, $p_r$ is the probability of the occurrence of a word at rank $r$, $c$ and $k$ are constants. I got three points, e.g: $$f_{10}=8800$$ $$f_{100}=930$$ $$f_{1000}=89$$ I succeeded in calculating $c$ by replacing the $f_r$ and the $r$ and then I average the various scores. But, how can I calculate $k$? how do I get $p_r$, is it a safe assumption to just do $f_r/total$ ?
