Where to learn probabilistic deep learning/baysian methods for machine learning

I have completed the machine learning course and deep learning specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera, and now learning TensorFlow 2 for Deep Learning Specialization by the imperial college of London, which is a course that teaches you how to use TensorFlow. However, when I head to the third course, it talks about Probabilistic Deep Learning. I do not have any idea of what bayesian is. For prerequisite, it recommends this course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning . I have watched the first few videos, but the way it teaches is not for me. I am wondering, are there any other sources of learning this topic. I know basic probability theory, both univariate and multivariate distributions, variance, MGFs, expectations, etc.
