Will demand for data scientist decrease because of AYASDI?

I am pursing Data Analyst course at Udacity. I came across this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z73Wd2T1xE Watching it lead me to wonder if Ayasdi products would reduce the demand for data scientists. I wish to compete in Kaggle contests but after watching the video, I feel that many of those problems can be easily solved using their platform and that I will be at disadvantage since I do not have access to their tools. Also I feel such tools would reduce the need of experts in data sciences. Now I am worried if I should continue with Nano Degree in Data Analyst at Udacity.
