drag and drop working funny when using variable draggables and droppables

i have some containers that contain some divs like: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i'm trying to drag tasks and drop them in one of the container divs, then reposition the dropped task so that it doesn't affect the other divs nor fall outside one of them and to do that i'm using the event onMouseOver to call the following function: function DragDrop(id) { $("#task" + id).draggable({ revert: 'invalid' }); for (var i = 0; i where: nameList = [container1, container2, container3]; the drag is working fine, but the drop is not really, it's just a mess! any help please?? when i hardcode the id and the container, then it works beautifully, but as soon as i use id in drop then it begins to work funny! any suggestions??? thanks a million in advance Lina
