There is no way this can be achieved using Apache POI. The only way I can think of to have Microsoft Word scroll to a specific range when a document is opened would be to include an AutoOpen VBA macro that selects the range. For example, to make the 9th paragraph be selected you would have to include the following VBA code (it goes without saying that this only works if macros are enabled): Public Sub AutoOpen() ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(9).Range.Select End Sub
