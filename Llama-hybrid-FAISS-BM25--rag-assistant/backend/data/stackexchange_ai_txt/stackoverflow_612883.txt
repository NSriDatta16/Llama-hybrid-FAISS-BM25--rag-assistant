Scrum teams vs. traditionally organized teams

To those of you who started using scrum in your development teams: Did you maintain the traditional teams or form new ones? At our organization we are split into database, product development and frontend developers (simplified!). I am interested in whether others actually reorganized their whole team structure due to scrum or if you formed dedicated project (?) teams combining e.g. one person of each "old" team.
