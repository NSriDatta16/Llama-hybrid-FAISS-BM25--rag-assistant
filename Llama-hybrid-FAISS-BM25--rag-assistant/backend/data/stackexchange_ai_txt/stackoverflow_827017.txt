I don't think Yahoo supports OpenID delegation. That is, StackOverflow and other RPs may perform discovery on your own identifier and set up the delegation auth request correctly, but Yahoo might be choosing (arguably contrary to the spec) to send an identity assertion for their own identifier rather than the one given by the RP. The specs haven't changed from OpenID 1.1 to 2.0. The specs do not suggest or endorse Yahoo!'s behavior, and only Yahoo can authoritatively comment on their reasoning. StackOverflow delegation still works. Yahoo broke you, it seems. I suggest you leverage what the delegation bought you by changing who you delegate authentication to. www.myopenid.com for example supports delegation. If you change your own identifier to point to that, you should be able to get back into StackOverflow as your old self again. :)
