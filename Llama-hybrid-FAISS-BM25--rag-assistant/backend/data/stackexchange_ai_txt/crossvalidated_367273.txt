I'm an engineer, so in my world, the applied statistician is what I see most, and get the most concrete value. If you are going to work in applied, then you need to be solidly grounded in practice over theory: whether or not it is elegant, the aircraft has to fly and not crash. When I think about this question the way I approach it, as many of my technical betters here have also done, is to think about "what does it look like in the real world with the presence of noise". The second thing that I do is, often, to make a simulation that allows me to get my hands around the question. Here is a very brief exploration: # show how the mean and the median differ with # respect to sample size # libraries library(reshape2) library(ggplot2) # sample sizes ssizes It gives this as the output: Note: be careful about the x-axis, because it is log-scaled, not uniform-scaled. I know that the mean and median are exactly the same. The code says it. The empirical realization is greatly sensitive to sample size, and if there aren't truly infinite samples, then they can't ever perfectly match with theory. You can think about whether the uncertainty in the median envelopes the estimated mean or vice versa. If the best estimate of the mean is within the 95% CI of the estimate for the median, then the data can't tell the difference. The data says they are the same in theory. If you get more data, then see what it says.
