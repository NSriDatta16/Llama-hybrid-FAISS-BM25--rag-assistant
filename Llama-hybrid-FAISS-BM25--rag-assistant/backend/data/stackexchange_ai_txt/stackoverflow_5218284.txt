Rather than prepackage your shared library, I would consider sharing the library project and having it as a dependency in your mobile applications' build process. That would allow you to share the code base, but have it built by the appropriate builders for your target devices. With a bit of IDE magic and some attention to detail, you should be able to pick up errors before anything is shipped out. Alternatively, set up your library project to use two separate builders to pick up errors. That would allow cleaner distribution, but you may run into problems trying to convince your IDE to treat the project as being device specific in order to identify problem areas. It would be likely that you would end up supporting the lowest common denominator device ( cough Blackberry), and forgoing the additional facilities of the more extensive Java implementation on Android. Unfortunately the answer will be one of experimentation. Try it and see what happens.
