ANN prediction accuracy

I'd like to discuss with you one thing, actually I'm confused. I'm trying to predict whether the tumor will metastasize in particular patient or not. We collected the data of ~60 patients and it looks like this: df Where the values of genes represent normalized relative expression level (biomarkers), factors corresponding to binary variables such as sex , organ_transplantation . My dependent variable is metastasis . I converted the other qualitative, nominal variables to factors with several levels, e.g. tumor_location stomach, large intestine, small intestine, other to 1-4, I hope it's correct. Moreover it's only part of independent variables. My df has ~60 rows (patients) and 15 independent variables. As I read, the optimal proportion is 10 observations per one independent variable. Unfortunately I don't have enough observations. Firstly I performed the logistic regression with all variables and it looks.... bad. I do not have statistical significance (pv vif() function. So I removed such variables. Finally from 15 independent variables I have 6. And they still don't look good regarding logistic regression (Wald's statistical significance). Nevertheless I decided to try this model out with the use of predict() function. I choose two approaches: same model (same variables) obtained by glm() with family = binomial(link="logit") - logistic regression and nnet() - artificial neural networks. I divided my data to train set (70%) and test set (30%) and run 1000 simulations of prediction: sims_lr % predict(test, type = "response") predicted.classes 0.5, 1,0) return(mean(predicted.classes == test$metastasis )) } k 0.5, 1,0) return(mean(predicted.classes.nn == test$metastasis )) } k Here's the comparison: As you see it doesn't look good... And I'm far from high prediction accuracy, nevertheless ANN worked better than logistic regression, hence I performed small experiment. I took the model with all variables and I performed 1000 prediction simulations using ANN but with 90 nodes and 10000 iterations . I took a while but result is as it should be... I'm very confused because prediction is fine, but it's based on non-influencing variables (mostly). So if I put some totally not related variables (with cancer and metastasis) such as hair length, height, car colour etc. I'll have also nice prediction only because I increased number of nodes and iterations? That's why I'm sceptical regarding this machine leering approach... Could you please give me some advice and tell whether my reasoning is correct?
