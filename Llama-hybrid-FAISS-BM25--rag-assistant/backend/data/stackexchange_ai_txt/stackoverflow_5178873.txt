Overwrite text file programmatically

I'm trying to overwrite a text file from android application, what I have done yet is, I have created one text file in one activity using: FileOutputStream create_file = null; OutputStreamWriter osw = null; create_file = openFileOutput("filename.txt", Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE); osw = new OutputStreamWriter(create_file); osw.write("text goes here"); osw.close(); create_file.close(); and I have opened that file in another activity read the contents line by line using: FileInputStream open_file = openFileInput("filename.txt"); InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(open_file); BufferedReader inRd = new BufferedReader(isr); while ((getText = inRd.readLine()) != null) { Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), getText, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } through this I have verified whether the content is stored or not, and made sure that the file exist with the content, but when I try to overwrite that file from another activity using: FileOutputStream create_file = null; OutputStreamWriter osw = null; create_file = new FileOutputStream(new File(PasswordUtil.pswrd_file), false); osw = new OutputStreamWriter(create_file); osw.write(getString); I'm getting one exception, java.io.FileNotFoundException:/ filename.txt (Read-only file system) Note: The text file is stored in Internal storage. Any help, thanks in advance.
