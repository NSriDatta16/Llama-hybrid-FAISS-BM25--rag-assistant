How to set threshold for bias in machine learning?

I have a large dataset containing the fitting results which contains ~10k observations. The dataset includes ~10k predicted values and actual values for different datasets, and we define $bias_i = actual_i - predicted_i$ , and overall bias is mean(bias). I need to evaluate whether the bias is large enough or not, so we want to set a threshold. I see one people using 1.5 * std(bias) as the threshold, and if overall bias My initial thought is: there might be a hypothesis test to test $H_0$ : overall bias = 0. and set the confidence interval $[0 Â± z*std(bias)/ \sqrt{n}]$ , where they set $z/ \sqrt{n}$ = 1.5. I am not sure this is correct.
