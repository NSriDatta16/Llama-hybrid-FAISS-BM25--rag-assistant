values not being copied to the next (local) environment?

Consider this output from browser() that is located inside calcDistance : Called from: calcDistance(object = rst, xy = xy[[i]][j, ], effect.distance = effect.distance) Browse[1]> ls.str() effect.distance : num 236 object : Formal class 'RasterLayer' [package "raster"] with 12 slots xy : Named num [1:2] -101.8 35.5 Browse[1]> debugging in: xyValues(object = object, xy = xy, buffer = effect.distance) debug: standardGeneric("xyValues") Browse[2]> ls.str() object : Formal class 'RasterLayer' [package "raster"] with 12 slots xy : Named num [1:2] -101.8 35.5 Functions are as follows: simulationRun > createDistRaster > calcDistance > raster::xyValues. In the above output, you only see the last two. xyValues is from raster package. First paragraph of code shows that three objects are present: effect.distance , object , xy . In second paragraph, we descend into xyValues by calling debug(xyValues). In third paragraph we can see that effect.distance is missing. My question is: Even though object and xy seem to be copied to the xyValues environment just fine, effect.distance is not. How could this be explained?
