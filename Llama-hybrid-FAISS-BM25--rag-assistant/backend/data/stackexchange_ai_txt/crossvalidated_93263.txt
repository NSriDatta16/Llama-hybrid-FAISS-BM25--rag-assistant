how do normality check in ks test assess for equivalence or difference in data sets?

I have a series of data of photon counts versus time. These data are periodic, then I can fold them and obtain an average profile of the data. Nonetheless, some variations appear sometime in the single profiles. To check if the average profile and the single ones are statistically different, they suggested me to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. I am new to this, but it seems very fascinating! However, the suggested procedure is based not directly on the two data set (the averaged one and the singles ones), but on the residuals. Basically, I should subtract the single profiles to the averaged one, and check if the residuals are normally distributed. What I do NOT understand is: how could the normality test on the residuals assess the equivalence or the difference of the two data sets?
