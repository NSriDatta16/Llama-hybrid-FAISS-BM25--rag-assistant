We can't compare AIC for models based on different data. Memorize that $AIC=2k-2ln(L)$ so it depends on value of log-likelihood function. It's value and structure depends on dataset applied. Therefore, you may compare AIC correctly only for models that use absolutely identical data, in order to investigate which set of parameters seems to be the most reasonable. Also pay attention that difference in AIC among your models is very huge that is not typical. So the difference between original scale and very coarse scale data seems to be very big.
