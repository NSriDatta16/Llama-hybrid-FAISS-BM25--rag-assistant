1) Every time you have a use or require statement, it searches through all the directories in lib in order. Each use lib does (at least) two stat calls. use lib is just a wrapper for pushing things onto @LIB... but it also searches for the presence of an arch directory and pushes that on to @LIB if it exists, too. You can reverse the change using the no lib pragma: no lib ('/home/zoul/opt/lib/perl/5.8', '/home/zoul/opt/share/perl/5.8', '/home/zoul/opt/lib/perl/5.8.8', '/home/zoul/opt/share/perl/5.8.8'); Better yet, you could modify your dev environment to match production, or even just symlink those directories to the real locations for your dev setup.
