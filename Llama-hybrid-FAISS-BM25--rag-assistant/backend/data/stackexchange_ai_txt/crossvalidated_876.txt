Keep in mind that ridge regression can't zero out coefficients; thus, you either end up including all the coefficients in the model, or none of them. In contrast, the LASSO does both parameter shrinkage and variable selection automatically. If some of your covariates are highly correlated, you may want to look at the Elastic Net [3] instead of the LASSO. I'd personally recommend using the Non-Negative Garotte (NNG) [1] as it's consistent in terms of estimation and variable selection [2]. Unlike LASSO and ridge regression, NNG requires an initial estimate that is then shrunk towards the origin. In the original paper, Breiman recommends the least-squares solution for the initial estimate (you may however want to start the search from a ridge regression solution and use something like GCV to select the penalty parameter). In terms of available software, I've implemented the original NNG in MATLAB (based on Breiman's original FORTRAN code). You can download it from: http://www.emakalic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/nngarotte.zip BTW, if you prefer a Bayesian solution, check out [4,5]. References: [1] Breiman, L.
