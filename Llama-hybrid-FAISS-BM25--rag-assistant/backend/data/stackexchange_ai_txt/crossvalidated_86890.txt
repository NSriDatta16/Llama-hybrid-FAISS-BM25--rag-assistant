One or two factor analyses?

I'm in the process of planning a scale development project and stuck with a question: I have two constructs that will each form an axis of a matrix. Both constructs can correlate and can be related, but don't need to. They don't form a total score together at the end. I will use a scale for each construct to determine the organization's position on each axis of the matrix. If I'm developing items for each construct, do I need two or one exploratory factor analyses? My idea was a different factor analysis for each construct to find out the domains/factors of each construct. However, I saw a paper that analyzed two different constructs within one factor analysis. Won't items in both constructs just cross-load, so basically form a cluster in my matrix if I do it in one factor analysis? Sorry if this might seem to be a trivial question for some, I'm just confused at the moment. Thank you!
