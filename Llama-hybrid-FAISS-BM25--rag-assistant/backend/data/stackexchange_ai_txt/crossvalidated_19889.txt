What programming language do you recommend to prototype a machine learning problem?

Currently working in Octave, but due to the poor documentation progress is very slow. What language is easy to learn and use, and well documented to solve machine learning problems? I am looking to prototype on a small dataset (thousands of examples), so speed is not important. EDIT: I am developing a recommendation engine. So, I am interested in using Regularized Linear Regression, Neural Nets, SVN or Collaborative Filtering.
