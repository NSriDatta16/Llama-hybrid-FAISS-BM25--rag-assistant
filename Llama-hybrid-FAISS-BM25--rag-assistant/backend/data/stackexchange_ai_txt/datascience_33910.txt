Number of features of the model must match the input. Model n_features is `N` and input n_features is `X`.

I am new to data science and trying get some results. I'm applying Decision Tree Classifier . When my train and test datasets' size are not equal I get an error `Number of features of the model must match the input. Model n_features is N (no. of entries in training datasets) and input n_features is X (no. of entries in test datasets). If I have 100 entries in my dataset and parameter for split is test_size=0.30 as: import pandas as pd from pandas import Series, DataFrame import numpy as np from sklearn import tree from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split data=pd.read_csv("ndata.csv") X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.dis, data.gen, test_size=0.30, random_state=42) c = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier() y_test_size = y_test.size y_train_size = y_train.size X_train = [X_train] y_train = [y_train] X_test = [X_test] y_test = [y_test] c.fit(X_train, y_train) accu_train = np.sum(c.predict(X_train) == y_train)/y_train_size accu_test = np.sum(c.predict(X_test) == y_test)/y_test_size print("Accuracy on Train: ", accu_train) print("Accuracy on Test: ", accu_test) And the error occurs as follows: ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) in () 24 25 accu_train = np.sum(c.predict(X_train) == y_train)/y_train_size ---> 26 accu_test = np.sum(c.predict(X_test) == y_test)/y_test_size 27 28 print("Accuracy on Train: ", accu_train) ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/tree/tree.py in predict(self, X, check_input) 410 """ 411 check_is_fitted(self, 'tree_') --> 412 X = self._validate_X_predict(X, check_input) 413 proba = self.tree_.predict(X) 414 n_samples = X.shape[0] ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/tree/tree.py in _validate_X_predict(self, X, check_input) 382 "match the input.

Is it necessary to have dataset size of both train and test equal?
