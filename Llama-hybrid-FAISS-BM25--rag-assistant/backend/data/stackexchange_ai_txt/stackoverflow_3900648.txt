Ladislav Mrnka is right but that was caused by a copy paste error. I did solve it on my own, so in case someone has the same problem is will post how to fix it explicitly. To fix it i had to also put the name of the field, and change the Storage attribute like so for : the table person has the "Name" and in the Person Object has the private instance variable "_Name" the property must be set up as: [DataMember] [Column(Name="Name",Storage="_Name")] public String Name { get{...} set{...} } Also should mention that I only successfully got it to work when the intance variable was private and the property was public.
