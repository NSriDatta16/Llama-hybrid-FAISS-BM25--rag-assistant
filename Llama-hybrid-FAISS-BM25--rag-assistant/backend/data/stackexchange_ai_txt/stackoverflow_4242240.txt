drag and scroll script

I'm trying to make a scrolling calendar script using jquery (similar to the one on an iPad) So, I want to record the yPosition of the mousedown and the mouseup and move a div accordingly. I tried recording the mouse positions using two variables, one to be recorded on the mousedown event and one to be recorded on a mouseup event... but right now the problem is that the variable value is not carried through, so on the mouseup the value of the mousedown is back to 0. what would I do to carry the value? Thanks a lot in advance! The code is below: jQuery(document).ready(function(){ var yStart = 0; var yEnd = 0; $("#year").mousedown (function(e){ var yStart = e.pageY; $(".yStart").text (yStart +"ho"+ yEnd); }).mouseup (function(e){ var yEnd = e.pageY; $(".yEnd").text (yStart +"ho"+ yEnd); }); if (yStart>yEnd) { $("#year ul").animate({top:'-='+liHeight},"fast"); };
