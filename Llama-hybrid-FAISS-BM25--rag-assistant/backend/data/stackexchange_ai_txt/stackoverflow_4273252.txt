Detect inserted USB on Windows

I am currently writing a security tool in python that runs as a daemon on a host computer. Whenever a usb storage device is detected, it will copy all of the files from the usb to some dir on the host computer. Is there any easy way to do this sort of usb detection / interface? Thanks in advance!
