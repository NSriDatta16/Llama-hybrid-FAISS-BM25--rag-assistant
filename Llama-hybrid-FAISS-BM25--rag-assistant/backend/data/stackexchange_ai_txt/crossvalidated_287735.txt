Three factors with two levels: Compare one cell with all the others

I have three independent variables ( A , B , C ) with two levels each ( low , high ) as well as a metric dependent variable X . I now want to test whether respondents that reported to be high on each of the three independent variables have -- on average -- higher values on X . In order to do so I created a new grouping variable where participants that reported high on A, B, and C are classified with 1 and all other with 0 . I then calculated a simple t-Test to compare the two groups. My question: Is this the most reasonable way to answer my research question? I was also thinking about ANOVA with contrasts but could not figure out how to do this in my case with R . I read a few online tutorials but could not come up with a solution (e.g., [1] , [2] ). Contrasts might especially be of interest in order to test -- in addition to my original research question -- which variable outcome (high A , high B or high C ) is more important to explain outcomes in X . MWE: data$groups
