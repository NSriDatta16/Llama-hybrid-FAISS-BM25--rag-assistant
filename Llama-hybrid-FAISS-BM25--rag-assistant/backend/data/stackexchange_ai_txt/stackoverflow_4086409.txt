If I understand you correctly, you are creating a new node with some children, and you want this new node to replace an existing node in your page. You can either: Remove all children of the existing node, and add the new children to the existing node Add all the children to another node (I think that is what you are doing: adding to the fragment ), then remove the existing node, and add the node to that place. See removeChild and appendChild
