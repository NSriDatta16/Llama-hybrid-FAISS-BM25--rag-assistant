The proper way to do this is by specifying the factory class when getting a new TransformerFactory. I dont think calling a specific factory implementation will work - I believe the default system transformer might still be returned (at least thats what happened when I had xalan and saxon in the classpath). example: TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance("org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl",null); or for saxon TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance("net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl",null); Javadocs: Obtain a new instance of a TransformerFactory from factory class name. This function is useful when there are multiple providers in the classpath. It gives more control to the application as it can specify which provider should be loaded. Once an application has obtained a reference to a TransformerFactory it can use the factory to configure and obtain transformer instances.
