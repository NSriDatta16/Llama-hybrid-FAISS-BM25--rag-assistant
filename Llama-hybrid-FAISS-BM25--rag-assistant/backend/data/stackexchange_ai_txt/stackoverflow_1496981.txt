WPF Dragging causes renderer to stop

I'm having a problem with my WPF app, where any sort of drag operation stops the UI from updating. The issue seems periodic, as in, the item drags, stops, drags again, stops, etc. in 2 second intervals. It's affecting all controls, including scroll bars. If checked this question as well as this one, and it doesn't seem to be caused by window transparencies. I'm running Win7 x64 with .NET 3.5sp1. Does anyone know what might be causing this, or a way of figuring out what might be causing this?
