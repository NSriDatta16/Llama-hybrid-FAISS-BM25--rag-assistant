Perl multidimensional array question

I have a program that prints out the location of commas in a paragraph of text in the form For example if the paragraph is one,two,three three and a half four,five six seven,eight The program will print 0:4 0:8 2:5 4:6 I would like to use this output to create an array where the numbers after the colon are listed across columns in the row specified by the index before the colon. The array formed by the coordinates above would be 4 8 5 6 so array[0,0] = 4, array[0,1] = 8 array[1,0] = empty array[2,0] = 5 etc... I bet this is simple but I need help to write it. $data_file="file.out"; open(DAT, $data_file) || die("Could not open file!"); @raw_data= ; close(DAT); my %array; my $line = 0; foreach $newline(@raw_data) { chomp; while ( $newline=~m/(,|;|:|and)/) { push @{ $array{$line} }, pos($newline); # autovivification } $line++; }
