What does a differenced time series mean for forecast?

I understand that differencing is a way to make a non stationary time series, stationary. From https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html they talk about first order differencing and second order differencing, but I'm trying to wrap my head around what this means for your forecast. When you forecast a first order differenced time series are you just forecasting the rate of change in the original data? I see that Hyndman states a second ordered time series would be the rate of change of change, but why is that useful to forecast? If point 1 is true, would it be possible to turn that result into a result on the scale of the non stationarized data (i.e. if you were to forecast the non differenced data, would it be possible to turn the first differenced forecast into a result of the non differenced data)
