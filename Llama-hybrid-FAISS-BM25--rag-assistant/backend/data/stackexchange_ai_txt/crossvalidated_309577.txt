The answer to your first question regarding the predictions at the terminal nodes is yes. You can think of your decision tree dividing up your data into disjoint subsets. For example, if you have 8 terminal nodes, each of your data will fall into one and only one of these 8 terminal node "groups". From here, we can see it should be reasonable to choose the mean of the data points in a terminal node as the predicted value of that terminal node. For your second question: if you are building multiple trees off of the exact same dataset using the same split criterion (e.g. variance reduction), you will get the same decision tree every time. If you're trying to build a random forest ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest ), you'll be generating new bootstrapped datasets to build additional trees, not re-using the same exact dataset for every tree.
