RIM has only released an Eclipse Plugin on OS X. The JDE is Windows-only and probably will always be Windows-only (RIM is trying to phase out the JDE and is encouraging all developers to move to the Eclipse platform). Keep in mind that the Eclipse plugin for OS X is still VERY new and still has some rough edges - I tried it out and it crashed on more than one occasion! Also, there is no simulator available on OS X yet so you'll need a physical device to deploy and test on (I think it has to be a 9800 but I could be wrong). RIM has promised a simulator on OS X but probably not for another 6 months or so.
