Is it possible to run Spiking Neural Network (SNN) on the current von neumann architecture?

I am a new to Spiking Neural network (SNN). I read a couple of papers about it. Some of them highlighted that SNN is a kind of a hardware-dependent model that can efficiently work on neuromorphic hardware. I am not sure whether this means that SNN can't work on von neumann architecture or not. I am just wondering if it could be possible to run SNN on von neumann architecture like most of the current traditional Artificial Neural Network.
