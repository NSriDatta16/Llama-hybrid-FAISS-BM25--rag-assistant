Silverlight: is there a way to allow a user to open a file from isolated storage?

I'd like to allow a user to open files in their own client applications via Silverlight. I'd like this to work similarly to WebDAV, in the sense that they could read/write the file back into Silverlight's isolated storage... Is it possible to construct a file:// link to an isolated storage file? Is there a uri scheme that is defined for silverlight in a browser that has the silverlight plugin? Am I totally nuts?
