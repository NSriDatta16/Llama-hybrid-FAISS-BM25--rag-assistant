Creating a timed validation with PHP and MySQL

How would I go about creating a system in which a user must click a link to validate something. Let us say that on my website, each user has their own folders that are not shared. I want their to be an option for each user on their account page in which they can create a trust with another user to access each others folders. Perhaps by typing in the name of the user in which they want to create a trust with. So in this case, user Jim types into his create trust input box "Tom", and so a trust needs to be established. I figure, A) There will need to be something that stores Jim's request, B. then assigns it as unverified, C. and finally then sends the vaerification link to Tom. Tom then recieves a message somehow? (not sure yet), perhaps with something to check and see if there are any verification links for Tom? and then Tom clicks the verification link sent to verify that he wants to also establish a trust with Jim. once Tom clicks it, A. tells whatever it is that stored Jim's request that Tom accepted, B. assigns validation as verified C. notifies Jim that Tom's request has been accepted or declined., HOWEVER there also needs to be a way to remove the validation storage (whatever it will be) if 24 hours runs up, or Tom declines Jim's request. Can anyone please help me? :)
