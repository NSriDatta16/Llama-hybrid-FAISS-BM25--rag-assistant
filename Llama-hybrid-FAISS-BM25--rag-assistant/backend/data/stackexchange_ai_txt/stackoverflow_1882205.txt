How do I detect support for contentEditable via JavaScript?

I've been searching for this for a couple of days now and so far, the best I can come up with is checking the list below. I really don't like to check for support based on User-Agent, especially since it can be spoofed. I've also heard of at least one instance where the list below is incorrect (noted below). Is Internet Explorer? Is WebKit? (But I've read that mobile Safari doesn't support it) Is Opera? Is Gecko and version >= 1.9? (meaning Firefox 3 or later) Is there a better method based on testing for support directly via JavaScript, or is this pretty much the only way to test for support?
