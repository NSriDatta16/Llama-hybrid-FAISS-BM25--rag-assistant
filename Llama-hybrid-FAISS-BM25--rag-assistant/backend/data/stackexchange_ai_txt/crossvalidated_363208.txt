Deterministic or stochastic universe in frequentist statistics?

Does frequentist statistics take a stand on whether the universe / world (or at least the processes that are being modeled) is deterministic or stochastic? If so, where in the methodology does that matter? For a related question about the Bayesian point of view, see "Deterministic or stochastic universe in Bayesian statistics?" .
