Should PC vectors be of unit length, when used for projection?

I am using principal component analysis (PCA) for noise reduction, i.e. projecting a point from the original space to the reduced space, and then back to the original one. For this sort of usage, is it necessary that the PC vectors have unit length? When I try to scale them, I am getting different results, so I suspect they must be unit length, I'd just like to get confirmation and explanation as to why this is.
