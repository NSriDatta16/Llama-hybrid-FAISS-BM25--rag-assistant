Here is a description of what virtual functions are. There is no way to implement virtual functions in plain C, because C has no notion of inheritance. Update: As is discussed in the comments below, it is possible to do something similar to virtual functions in straight C using structures and function pointers. However, if you are accustomed to a language like C++ that has "true" virtual functions, you will probably find the C approximation far less elegant and harder to use.
