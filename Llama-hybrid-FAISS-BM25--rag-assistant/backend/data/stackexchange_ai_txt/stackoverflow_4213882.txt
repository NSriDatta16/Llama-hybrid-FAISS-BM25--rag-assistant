How to sync chrome extension options

I've made a Chrome extension with an options page. The data is saved in localstorage and works just fine. Chrome doesn't sync the localstorage to the cloud, just the extensions. This means that any user data will not sync to other computers of the same google account. I can not find an API at http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/docs.html which allows me to sync the user-chosen preferences. What methods do you suggest?
