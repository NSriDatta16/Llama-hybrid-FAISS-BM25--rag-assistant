Why does a Daemon randomly stop?

This is sort of related to a previous, yet so far unsuccessful question of mine . I have a daemon that is placed in the LaunchAgents folder (on Mac) and it should run perpetually in the background, but after a couple of days it just stops for no apparent reason. I have no idea why and thus my question: What are the reasons that a daemon might randomly stop? Thanks for the help!
