The posterior density $$\pi(\theta|x)\propto \frac{e^\theta}{1+\theta^2}\mathbb I_{\theta is an increasing function (in $\theta$ ): $$ \frac{\text d}{\text d\theta} \{\theta-\log(1+\theta^2)\}=1-\frac{2\theta}{1+\theta^2}=\frac{(1-\theta)^2}{1+\theta^2}\ge 0$$ Therefore, maximising the surface $$\int_{d-\delta}^{\min(d+\delta,x)} \frac{e^\theta}{1+\theta^2}\,\text d\theta$$ should prove straightforward. If not, note that the surface decreases when $d+\delta$ overshoots $x$ (hence $d+\delta\le x$ ) and, on the opposite, that it increases with $d$ when $d+\delta\le x$ . Hence $$d^\star(x) = x-\delta$$ is the optimal Bayesian decision . Note: This exercise is somewhat related to Example 4.2 in my book , which points out the surprising phenomenon that, under a double exponential prior on $\theta$ and a Cauchy observation $x$ with median $\theta$ , the MAP is always zero.
