Well, it's not the greatest use of CPU cycles, removing bytes from a List(Of Byte) is an O(n) operation. Making the overall processing step O(n^2). It is still quite difficult to put any kind of pressure on the cpu doing so, serial ports are glacially slow. You should only ever modify working code if you have measured it to be a perf problem. If you're not there yet then consider creating a new array or List from the old one. That's O(n), the extra storage cannot hurt considering the slow data rates. The code should be cleaner too. As far as threading goes, be sure to do this in the DataReceived handler. That's thread-safe and avoids putting undue pressure on the UI thread in case you invoke.
