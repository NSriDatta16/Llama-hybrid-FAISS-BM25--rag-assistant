PHP - SQLite vs SQLite3

I've made a web application using SQLite (2.8.17), I've only now discovered that there's an SQLite3. It somehow eluded my attention when making the web application, probably due to the lack of documentation for the php functions. I'm wondering, what are the benefits of using SQLite3 over SQLite? Is it considerably faster?
