This answer was merged from another thread asking about predictions zero-inflated regression model, but it also applies to the Tweedie GLM model. Regression-like models predict mean of some distribution (normal for linear regression, Bernoulli for logistic regression, Poisson for Poisson regression etc.). In the case of zero-inflated regression you predict mean of the zero inflated- something distribution (e.g. Poisson, binomial). When the probability density function of the non-inflated distribution is $f$, then probability density function of zero-inflated distribution is a mixture of point mass at zero and $f$: $$ f_\text{zeroinfl}(y) = \pi \,I_{\{0\}}(y) + (1-\pi)\, f(y) $$ where $I$ is an indicator function. Zero-inflated regression model predicts mean of $f_\text{zeroinfl}(y)$, i.e. $$ \mu_i = \pi \cdot 0 + (1-\pi)\, g^{-1}(x_i'\beta) $$ where $g^{-1}$ is an inverse of the link function. So since you are predicting the mean of this distribution, you won't see the excess zeros in your predictions since the zeros are not the mean of the distribution (while they shrink the mean towards zero), the same as linear regression does not predict the residuals. This is illustrated on the plot below, where values of random variable $Y$ are plotted against $X$, where $Y$ follows a zero-inflated Poisson distribution with mean conditional on $X$. The black points are the actual data that were used to fit the zero-inflated Poisson regression model, the red points are the predictions, and the blue points are means of $Y$ within the six arbitrary groups of $X$ values. As you can see, clearly the zero inflated Poisson regression model estimates $E(Y|X)$.
