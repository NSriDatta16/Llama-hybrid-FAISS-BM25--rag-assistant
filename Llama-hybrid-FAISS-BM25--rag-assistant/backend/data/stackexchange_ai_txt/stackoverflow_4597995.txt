You can achieve the same effect as with criteria.listDistinct if you change the criteria query to include distinct root entity results transformer like this: results = criteria.list(max:params.max, offset:params.offset){ children{ books{ like('title',"%book") } } resultTransformer Criteria.DISTINCT_ROOT_ENTITY order("id","asc") } There is however a reason why grails does not return paged results for the listDistinct call so it might be a case to resort to an HQL query with the in operator
