@Dave you were right! Here the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test should have been applied! It is a pity that you did not provide this in the form of an answer, but only a comment. However, I decided to answer my question myself, because maybe someone will have a similar problem someday. Below is the same graph as in my question, but now I have used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as a pair-wise test. A small update for @Alexis Dear @Alexis, you ask if I understand this. Well, I must admit, not too much. As I wrote, I am self-taught. Moreover, English is not my mother tongue. So I am apprehensive that what I am writing looks like gibberish. Let me write what I understand. First, I look at the classic box-plot. What do I see here? I can see the medians are almost identical. I can see that the averages must be very close to the medians and they should also be very similar. I can see that x1 has a slightly larger interquartile range and x3 has a larger range of value. I also see quite significant differences in Tukey fences. So my first conclusion is that there is something different. Then I look at the numbers. name n min q1 mean median q3 max sd kurtosis skewness SW.stat SW.p nout 1 x1 750 -7.28 -1.64 0.0233 0 1.76 7.48 2.50 -0.210 -0.00270 0.999 8.39e- 1 4 2 x2 750 -5.49 -0.780 0.00846 0 0.816 5.90 1.36 1.83 -0.00685 0.980 1.76e- 8 21 3 x3 750 -11.1 -0.762 -0.0266 0 0.719 12.6 1.86 15.5 0.482 0.776 8.59e-31 37 Again, I see that both the medians and the mean are not different at all. I also confirm my observations regarding the range of values and the interquartile range. I also see that only about the x1 samples I can say that they come from the normal distribution. I also see a wide variety of kurtosis and the number of outliers. And now I ask myself. Could the differences I perceive be coincidental? Is there any test tool that I could prove with the assumed level of confidence that these differences are statistically real? Will I even ask meaningful questions? If you have answers to any of the questions that bother me, please answer them. The overriding idea on a CV is that we all learn from each other. And I am very eager to learn something.
