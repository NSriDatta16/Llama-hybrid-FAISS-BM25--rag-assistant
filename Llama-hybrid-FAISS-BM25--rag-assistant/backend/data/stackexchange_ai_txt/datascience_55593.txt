Doing some research, I found a paper which proves that sorting can be done with at most 3 layers, and that their solution is optimal if you restrict the size of the network to be polynomial w.r.t. to the number of input numbers: Kai-Yeung Siu, Jehoshua Bruck, Thomas Kailath, Thomas Hofmeister, Depth Efficient Neural Networks for Division and Related Problems (1993), see Theorem 7 on page 955 (page 10 in the PDF).
