If you really want to discover causal relationships, you need to engage in causality. But you might be okay with only detecting stochastic dependencies because you have reason to believe that, in your case, correlation is causation. In this case, you could e.g. try some (linear) regression methods to find the effects that environmental parameters have on bird abundance. But PCA is rather a linear dimensionality reduction method. So I wouldn't see any immediate usage. Also, I don't really see what "to use PCA with only the bird abundance data" could refer to, which would help you understand better the connection between environmental and bird abundance data.
