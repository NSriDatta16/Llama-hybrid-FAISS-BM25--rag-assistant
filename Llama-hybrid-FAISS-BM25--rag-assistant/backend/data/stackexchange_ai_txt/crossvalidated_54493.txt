It means probability element. This paragraph is taken from the following book chapter: Order Statistics If $X$ is such that the probability $X\leq x$ is $F(x)$, or briefly if $$ Pr(X\leq x)=F(x), $$ then we say that $X$ is a random variable which has the cdf $F(x)$. If $F(x)$ has a continuous derivative $f(x)$, then $f(x)dx$ is called the probability element of $X$, and $f(x)$ the probability density function (pdf) of $X$. I think it would have something to do with measure theory as well. Going over a Probability Theory course might help too.
