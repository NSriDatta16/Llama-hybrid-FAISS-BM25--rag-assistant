I don't have a solution, but made an observation. Looking at this example on Vector Behavior on the OL Examples website, if features are partially visible (i.e. placed on the border of the viewport), they remain partially hidden when dragged into full view. Only fully visible upon release of the mouse button. My point being that it seems to be a display issue more than a load issue, if that wasn't apparent already... Will keep an eye on the question, curious to the answer. :-)
