Here is an example of how to use git and branches. $ git branch * master organize $ git branch networking $ git checkout networking $ git branch master * networking organize Now Master has been updated many times since anyone has done anything on networking $ git pull origin networking From github.com:dlundquist/Asteroids * branch networking -> FETCH_HEAD CONFLICT (rename/delete): Rename src/ServerClientThread.java->src/ServerConnectionThread.java in 92d5b7c4e7c4110803eabf5d5152e7f2a337d722 and deleted in HEAD Auto-merging src/Actor.java Auto-merging src/Asteroids.java CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/Asteroids.java Auto-merging src/BasicWeapon.java CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/BasicWeapon.java CONFLICT (delete/modify): src/DedicatedServer.java deleted in HEAD and modified in 92d5b7c4e7c4110803eabf5d5152e7f2a337d722. Version 92d5b7c4e7c4110803eabf5d5152e7f2a337d722 of src/DedicatedServer.java left in tree. Auto-merging src/MainMenu.java CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/MainMenu.java CONFLICT (delete/modify): src/NetworkClientThread.java deleted in HEAD and modified in 92d5b7c4e7c4110803eabf5d5152e7f2a337d722. Version 92d5b7c4e7c4110803eabf5d5152e7f2a337d722 of src/NetworkClientThread.java left in tree. CONFLICT (delete/modify): src/NetworkUpdate.java deleted in HEAD and modified in 92d5b7c4e7c4110803eabf5d5152e7f2a337d722. Version 92d5b7c4e7c4110803eabf5d5152e7f2a337d722 of src/NetworkUpdate.java left in tree. Auto-merging src/ScenePanel.java CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/ScenePanel.java Auto-merging src/Shield.java CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/Shield.java Auto-merging src/Sprite.java Auto-merging src/TripleShotWeapon.java Auto-merging src/Weapon.java Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. mjolnir:Asteroids Durandal$ git status # On branch networking # Changes to be committed: # # modified: src/Actor.java # modified: src/Sprite.java # modified: src/TripleShotWeapon.java # modified: src/Weapon.java # # Unmerged paths: # (use "git add/rm ..." as appropriate to mark resolution) # # both modified: src/Asteroids.java # both modified: src/BasicWeapon.java # deleted by us: src/DedicatedServer.java # both modified: src/MainMenu.java # deleted by us: src/NetworkClientThread.java # deleted by us: src/NetworkUpdate.java # both modified: src/ScenePanel.java # added by them: src/ServerConnectionThread.java # both modified: src/Shield.java Woah, git is really mad. It looks like Master is too far ahead of Networking for git to do all the work for me. $ git reset --hard networking HEAD is now at 20d6ee8 done tweaking game on the main branch. Fixed a few bugs with the TripleShotWeapon. Rebalanced the gameMechanics() in Asteroids to increase the difficulty as the levels increase. mjolnir:Asteroids Durandal$ git status # On branch networking nothing to commit (working directory clean) Ok, now I am "back in time" when networking last pushed to origin. But I really should go back and merge with Master now before I do any work. Other wise it will be even hard to merge. Time spent merging files $ git add (insert conflict resolved files here) $ git commit -a -m "Merged networking with master" $ git checkout master $ git branch * master networking organize Now lets apply our changes. $ git merge networking Already up-to-date. You might want to do this if you like the "Yeah!" $ git merge origin networking Already up-to-date. Yeeah! Push our changes to the world $ git push origin master
