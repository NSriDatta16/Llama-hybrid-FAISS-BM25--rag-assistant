If you're looking for alternatives, one of my favorites is a ten-line HTTP POST file upload handler (PHP, .NET, Java, etc.) + one webserver. When the script validates max file size, and possibly extracts the width & height, it inserts a row into the database. Retrieval need not go through the script. Standard file hosting will work. This would require you to open port 80. You needn't complicate this with SOAP or anything. A regular upload handler would do the job. Then there's WebDAV, along the same lines. Of course, with this method, you'd have to monitor the filesystem and adjust the database accordingly. You could use a polling service or hook into file system events. Actually, you could also inject an ISAPI filter or Apache handler to perform the database updates. You could use FTP. Add an extension to ProFTPd that will update the database and keep everything in sync. Lots of ways to avoid putting image data into tables. If you opt for the database solution, just be sure to segment your BLOBs into separate tables. Separate table spaces / devices / partitions, if you can. Or, use Oracle and ignore everything I've said.
