My friend had this problem when she wanted to disable taps after an action for a specified period of time. What you want to do is leverage the NSObject's performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: method. - (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { userInteractionEnabled = NO; [self performSelector:@selector(enableUserInteraction) withObject:nil afterDelay: 1]; } - (void)enableUserInteraction { userInteractionEnabled = YES; } This is rough as I likely don't have the syntax right, but you ought to be able to follow this, and you can use it wherever you deem fit. Disable user interaction, then set up a timer event to call a function to reenable it after a specified period of time.
