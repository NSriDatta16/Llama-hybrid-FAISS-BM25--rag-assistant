sharepoint data view web part xslt without schema

I'm trying to use a data view web part (via SPD 2007) to consume the results of a SOAP-based web service and render portions of said results using XSL transforms. The problem I'm having is that the designer isn't much help because the schema for the web service doesn't actually include the elements of the results, so there's no way to drag and drop from the data source into the web part, and the manual transforms I've attempted aren't working. Here is the definition of the web service: string And the definition of the response: string The query definition is no problem - you just supply a stock ticker symbol as a string. You'll see what I'm talking about in the results, though. It defines the result as just a string. In SPD2007, the data source pretty much only includes soap:Envelope/soap:Body/GetQuoteResponse/GetQuoteResult , but the actual results contained in the result string look like this: MSFT 28.465 3/3/2010 1:24pm +0.005 28.52 28.61 28.35 28380812 249.7B 28.46 +0.02% 14.87 - 31.50 1.815 15.68 Microsoft Corpora I've tried setting up an XSL stylesheet like this in the data view web part: ' This does pretty much what you would expect: it renders the entire result string. However, if I replace with I get nothing. What's going on? how do I use XSL to pick out the XML in the string result without a schema?
