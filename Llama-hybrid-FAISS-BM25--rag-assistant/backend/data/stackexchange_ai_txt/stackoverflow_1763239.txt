Microsoft SharePoint Search - Ignore sections of the page

I am using Microsoft SharePoint Search (MOSS) to search all pages on a website. My problem is that when you search for a word that appears in the header, footer, menu or tag cloud section of the website, that word will appear on every page, so the search server will bring you a list of results for that search term: every page on the website. Ideally I want to tell the search server to ignore certain HTML sections in its search index. This website seems to describe my problem, and a guy says "why not hide those sections of your website if the User Agent is the search server. The problem with that approach is that most of the sections I hide contain links to other pages (menu's and tag clouds) and so the crawler will hit a dead end and won't crawl very far. Anyone got any suggestions on how to solve this problem?
