Degree of Freedom of Null Model in Logistic Regression

I built a logistic regression in R using 6 predictor variables and the output is as shown: fracmodel = glm(frx ~ age + meds + weight + hip_bmd + fall_risk + tneck, family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = fracture) summary(fracmodel) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.782151 0.824666 -2.161 0.03069 * age 0.013800 0.006251 2.208 0.02727 * meds1 -0.200508 0.072979 -2.747 0.00601 ** weight 0.014985 0.003543 4.229 2.34e-05 *** hip_bmd -3.278159 0.675582 -4.852 1.22e-06 *** fall_risk1 0.219837 0.091021 2.415 0.01572 * tneck -0.150665 0.105696 -1.425 0.15402 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 5173.2 on 6365 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 5055.7 on 6359 degrees of freedom (93 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 5069.7 I tried to derive MC facdden's R2 using an additional NULL model defined as below nullmodel |z|) (Intercept) -1.81177 0.03581 -50.59 But if I had used the formula for R2 as R2 = 1- fracmodel$deviance/fracmodel$null.deviance I should have obtained the same answer. But I'm not. Then I noticed that the degrees of freedom for NULL Deviance are different for the fitted model and the NULL model. There are 6459 observations . DF for NULL deviance in fitted model is 6365 but for the NULL model is 6458 . What is the reason for the variation in degrees of freedom. Which one should I use to derive MCFadden's R squared?
