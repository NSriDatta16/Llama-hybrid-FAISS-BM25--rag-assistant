In C#, you can use a Regex.Match to pull out substrings if you use groups in the regex (note this is not tested...). There is probably a similar mechanism in Java, but I don't know it off the top of my head: var myString = @"Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar Distance:29km(about 31 mins)"; var myRegex = @".*:(\d*)km.*"; var match = Regex.Match(myString, myRegex); if (match.Success) { // match.Groups contains the match "groups" in the regex (things surrounded by parentheses) // match.Groups[0] is the entire match, and in this case match.Groups[1] is the km value var km = match.Groups[1].Value; }
