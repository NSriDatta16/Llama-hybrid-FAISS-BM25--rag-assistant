Let's start with k-means: If you add class information on top of it, you get the learning vector quantization (LVQ). On the other hand, if you impose a topology on the means (force them on an elastic net), you get the self-organizing map. Now, the two are independent: you can enrich k-means by both class information and topology (i.e. impose a topology on LVQ) and obtain a supervised SOM.
