The printed representation of various objects which appears at the REPL is the product of a multimethod called print-method . It resides in the file core_print.clj in Clojure's sources, which constitutes part of what goes in the clojure.core namespace. The problem here is that for objects implementing clojure.lang.IDeref -- the Java interface for things deref / @ can operate on -- print-method includes the value behind the object in the printed representation. To this end, it needs to deref the object, and although special provisions are made for printing failed Agents and pending Futures, Delays are always forced. Actually I'm inclined to consider this a bug, or at best a situation in need of an improvement. As a workaround for now, take extra care not to print unforced delays.
