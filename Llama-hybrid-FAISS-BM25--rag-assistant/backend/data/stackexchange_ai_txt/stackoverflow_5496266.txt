Microsoft's Parallel Patterns Library: anyone looked to see how hard it'd be to port to POSIX / Linux?

The book has been released: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/03/15/10139453.aspx I just wonder, has anyone gone through the implementation and seen how easy it'd be to steal / port to POSIX? Does it use Managed C++ extensions, for example? Any thoughts on it in general, or its Aynchronous Agents library? It'd be nice it there was a std::, or boost:: equivalent.
