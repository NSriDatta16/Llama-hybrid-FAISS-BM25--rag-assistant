Mongo collection doc organisation and query

I have logbook documents with a list of logs embedded: { type:'logbook', name:'my book', userRef:2, cdate: ...., logs: [ { color: 'red', weight: 200, cdate: ..., foo: 'bar' }, { color: 'blue', weight: 100, cdate: ..., foo: 'bar' }, { color: 'green', weight: 240, cdate: ..., foo: 'bar' } ] I would like to show paginated ordered log entries for a given logbook. Is it possible to extract those from such a structure with mongo ? If not should I have a logEntries collection for logs instead ? Thanks
