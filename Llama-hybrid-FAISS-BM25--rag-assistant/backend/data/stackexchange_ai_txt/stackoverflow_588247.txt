After some more trial and error I found that the DirectoryNotFound exception occurs when my data files are located in subfolders of a subfolder. If data files are located in the project root or in a first level subfolder everything works as expected. The problem seems also to be related to the fact that in some of these subfolders I had some files marked as Include and some as Data. This probably causes some confusion during deployment in which the data files doesn't get deployed. Finally, what I had to do to get things the way I wanted was to uninstall any previous version of the app. Next, organizing my data files in the project like this: \Testfiles\Filegroup1\data1.txt \Testfiles\Filegroup1\data2.txt \Testfiles\Filegroup2\moredata1.txt \Testfiles\Filegroup2\moredata2.txt Then I mark all files within each folder as Data. Now everything gets deployed nice and dandy and the loader doesn't crash at startup.
