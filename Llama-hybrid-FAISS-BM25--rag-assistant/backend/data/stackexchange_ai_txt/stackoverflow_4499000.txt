Magento - How do I add an invoice fee to an order during checkout process

How do I add an invoice fee to an order with my payment module? I guess this should be done during the checkout process through my payment method model. Perhaps I should create and add an item/product to the cart/quote/order object? I don't know how to do any of these things though. Please help
