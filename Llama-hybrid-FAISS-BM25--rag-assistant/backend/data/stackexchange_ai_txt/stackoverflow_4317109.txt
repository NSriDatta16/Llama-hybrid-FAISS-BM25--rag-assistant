There are a few possible approaches: 1. Use an XmlAdapter You could leverage JAXB's XmlAdapter. Here you would create a version of the classes with the extra field (the adapted classes could extend the original). Then convert between them in the adapter. Since the alternate version of the class would contain the extra field it would marshal out. http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/07/xmladapter-jaxbs-secret-weapon.html 2. Use Binder If you marshal target is DOM, then you could leverage JAXB's Binder. It is intended for infoset preservation, but after a marshal it does maintain a link between the objects and the DOM nodes. Once the marshal is complete you could use the binder to find an object's associated node and update it. http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/09/jaxb-xml-infoset-preservation.html 3. Wrap the Output Target If your output target is something like a ContentHandler or XMLStreamWriter then when the appropriate state is reached you could trigger additional events to be called on the nested marshal target.
