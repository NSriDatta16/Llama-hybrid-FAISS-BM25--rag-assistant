Deep learning models heavily rely on stochastic processes such as weight initialization, back-propagation, etc. For evaluation and comparison of different models, there are methods that are generally referred to as Cross-Validation . The most popular type of CV is the k-Fold CV , and if your model training comprises hyperparameter tuning, you must use the Nested k-Fold CV .
