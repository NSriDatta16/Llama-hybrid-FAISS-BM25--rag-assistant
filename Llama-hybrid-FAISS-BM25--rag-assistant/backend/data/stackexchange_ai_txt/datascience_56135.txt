Predict when a customer would buy from previous buying history (Mining Buying patterns)

I'm trying to predict when a customer would buy a product(which month of the year) based on the historical transactions. I have 3 years transactions data and good amount of customers are frequent ones. Or basically want to mine the historical transaction data, and see for a set of customers (in a Geo/type of customer etc.) which months are likely period of buying a product X. Can someone please advice which Machine learning technique or statistical approach would be best in this case. I am trying - Decision tree classification/Logistic regression model taking month as predictor variable. - Statistical analysis to see which month is more significant for a set of customers.
