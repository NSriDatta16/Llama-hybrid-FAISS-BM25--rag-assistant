How to predict Time to Failure

I have a data set that contain only two columns , first is independent variable which is sensor measurements and the other column is the target which is time to failure in any time unit. The problem states that the data are time series , while i know that in time series the index of the data is the time in days or months or years. I thought in survival analysis , and simple linear regression , but I don't know if either approaches can help me to solve this problem ? So, How can I think for a solution for this problem
