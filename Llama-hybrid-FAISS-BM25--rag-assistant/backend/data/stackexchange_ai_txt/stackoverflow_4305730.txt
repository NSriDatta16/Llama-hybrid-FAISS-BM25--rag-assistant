You probably want to use the tagfile feature . When you generate the documentation for A, make sure the GENERATE_TAGFILE option is set. When you generate the documentation for B, set the value of TAGFILES to include the result from A. [Update to address relative paths] Doxygen is fairly fragile when it comes to [relative] paths. You clearly understand that using an absolute path will solve the problem. You could try taking a value from the environment, e.g. using TAGFILES = ext1/ext1.tag=$(PWD)/../ext1/html to create an absolute path. It's not ideal, but a lot of the values in the Doxyfile depend on where doxygen is run, and not where the configuration file lives.
