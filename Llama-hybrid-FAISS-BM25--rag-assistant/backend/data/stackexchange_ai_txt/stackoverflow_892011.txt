iphone cocoa : how to drag an image along a path

I am trying to figure out how can you drag an image while constraining its movement along a certain path. I tried several tricks including animation along a path, but couldn't get the animation to play and pause and play backwards - so that seems out of the question. Any ideas ? anyone ?
