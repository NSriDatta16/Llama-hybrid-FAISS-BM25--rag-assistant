Velocity is only an estimation. Naively, if you have a given velocity v with a team of 4 developers, then schedule your iteration with a velocity of (v/4)*number_of_developers You can fudge this value if the members you are losing are particularly stronger or weaker than the average. This is basically what PivotalTracker does with its team strength metric.
