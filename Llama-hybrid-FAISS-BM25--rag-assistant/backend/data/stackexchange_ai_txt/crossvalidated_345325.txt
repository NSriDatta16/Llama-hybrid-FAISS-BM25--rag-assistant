The usual sample variance still works because the strong law still holds for ergodic Markov chains. That is, we can apply a strong law of large numbers. If the Markov chain used in MCMC is Harris ergodic (irreducible, aperiodic, and Harris recurrent), the strong law of large numbers holds for functions with finite expectations. That is for Markov chain samples $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$, with stationary distribution $\pi$, and a function $f$ such that $\int f \pi(dx) The above is called the Birkhoff ergodic theorem , and essentially why MCMC is used so widely. Most reaonsbale MCMC algorithms usually satisfy the Harris ergodicity conditions. So essentially, if you can write the sample variance as a function of Monte Carlo averages, strong consistency would follow naturally. The Math post here does exactly that.
