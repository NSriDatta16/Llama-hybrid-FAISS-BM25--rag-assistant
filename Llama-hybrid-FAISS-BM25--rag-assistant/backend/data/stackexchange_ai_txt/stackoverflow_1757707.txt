First you should check that you are using Map correctly, good hashCode() method for keys, initial capacity for Map, right Map implementation etc. like many other answers describe. Then I would suggest using a profiler to see what is actually happening and where the execution time is spent. Is, for example, hashCode() method executed for billions of times? If that doesn't help, how about using something like EHCache or memcached ? Yes, they are products for caching but you could configure them so that they will have enough capacity and will never evict any values from cache storage. Another option would be some database engine that is lighter weight than full SQL RDBMS. Something like Berkeley DB , maybe. Note, that I have personally no experience of these products' performance, but they could be worth the try.
