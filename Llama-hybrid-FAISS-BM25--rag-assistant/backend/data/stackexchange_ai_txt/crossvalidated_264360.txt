Boruta 'all-relevant' feature selection vs Random Forest 'variables of importance'

Can someone explain the difference between variables of importance from random forest vs all-relevant features from Boruta feature selection? For example, if one were to build a model (could be any model) using a sub-set of 'important' or 'relevant'features, would it be better to use the output from Boruta all-relevant feature selection, or the Random Forest 'variable of importance'? Is one method preferred over the other? If so why?
