mySQL date range problem

Hey all i am in need of a little help with figuring out how to get a range of days for my select query. Here is the code i am trying out: select id, idNumber, theDateStart, theDateEnd from clients WHERE idNumber = '010203' AND theDateStart >= '2010-04-09' AND theDateEnd This is what the data in the table looks like: TheDateStart = 2010-04-09 TheDateEnd = 2010-04-11 When testing that code above, it does not populate anything. If i take out the TheEndDate, it populates but with some other tables data as well which it should not do (it should only get one record). I know the problem is within the two date's. I'm not sure how to go about getting a date range for theDateStart and theDateEnd since if someone tries it, say, on 2010-04-10, it still needs to know its within rage of the 2010-04-09 - 2010-04-11. But right now, it does not... Any help would be great! :o) David
