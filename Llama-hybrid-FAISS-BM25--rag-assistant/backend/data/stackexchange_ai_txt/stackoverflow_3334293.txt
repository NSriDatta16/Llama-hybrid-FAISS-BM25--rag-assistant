ORPG Engine Development, structuring the code (C++, 2D)

I've been working on a game 2d ORPG Engine with a friend of mine, however we're having some troubles organizing and structuring the code. I could use some pointers, guides, tutorials, etc. on how to keep the code flexible, extendible and maintainable. Thanks for your time, Xeross
