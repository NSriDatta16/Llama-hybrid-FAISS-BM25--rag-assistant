What are the advantages and disadvantages of incremental learning?

Generally speaking, it's to save spaces with incremental learning. According to the question in stackoverflow , it also said that. But what are the disadvantages? What I know from my experiments are two points: Train with subsets of data but shouldn't be too small . I prepared very small datasets and the predict result is much worse. When training for a very long time, some older behaviors will be forgotten due to the multiple training epochs. That's all from my experience when training with xgboost incrementally. Or anything else?
