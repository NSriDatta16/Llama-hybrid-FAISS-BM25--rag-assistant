Start with 1 project and build something functional. Only add new projects as growth demands. I've started new projects like this, planning a grandiose VS solution with an impressive-looking number of separate projects, but it ends up being a waste of time. You'll end up trying to fit your design into your project structure, which is stupid - the project structure is there to help you . The only way to know for sure how you'll need to organize your code is by having code to organize. It's much easier to do it incrementally as you build, than try to do it all upfront.
