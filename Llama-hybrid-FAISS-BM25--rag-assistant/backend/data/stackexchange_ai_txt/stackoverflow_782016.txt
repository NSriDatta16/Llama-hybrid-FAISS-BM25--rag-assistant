I have to admit, I would think that Flash (or even a blast from the past, Director) would be far less fragile than Mono. They also don't require a large runtime install. I'm not speaking of Flash running in a browser, I'm speaking of Flash running as an application on the local machine. Linux support would, admittedly, be sketchy.
