SQL server 2008 domain change

In the near future, my organisation will have to change both the machine name and the Windows domain for one of our SQL servers. The server is running SQL Server 2008 Enterprise Edition and the OS is Windows Server 2008 Standard edition. I have found good references to handle the change of machine name, but can anyone help with what should be done to accommodate the change of domain? Any help much appreciated.
