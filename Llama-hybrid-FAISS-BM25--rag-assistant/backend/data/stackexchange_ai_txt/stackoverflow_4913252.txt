jquery-ui : drag and drop doesn't allow me to drag more than one instance of element

I am developing a small web application that uses jquery's drag and drop. Problem is as following: I've got a toolbox, where users can see a list of items. I'd like to give them the ability to drag as many items from that toolbox to the main canvas (or page). Currently, after the first element is dragged, all of a sudden the css class that the toolbox was previously given (ui-draggable) disappears, and the element can no longer be dragged. If you look at this code example (somebody else provided it, not me), you'll see the same issue. http://examples.placona.co.uk/drag_drop Once you drag one of the items from the left, you can no longer drag any more of them (let alone drop them) Why does this happen? Is there any work around?
