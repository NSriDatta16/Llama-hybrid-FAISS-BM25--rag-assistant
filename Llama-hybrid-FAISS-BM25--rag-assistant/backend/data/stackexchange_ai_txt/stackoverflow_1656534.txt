For the most part, the only web pages in the public folder will be purely static (custom 404 pages, FAQ, etc). If you have a piece of static HTML that you'd like to be displayed in a lot of pages, a partial is what you're looking for. A partial doesn't have to be tied to a controller. You can create the sub-directory: /views/static and fill it with a whole bunch of partials, so you would have: /views/static/_my_first_partial.html.erb /views/static/_my_second_partial.html.erb and anywhere you want those fragments, you can do: render :partial => "static/my_first_partial" and voila, you're done!
