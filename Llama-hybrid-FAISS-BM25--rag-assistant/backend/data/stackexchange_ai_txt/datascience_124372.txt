Supervised Learning methods are characterized for using a target value to drive the learning process. I uderstand that your question comes from the impression that a time series doesn't have a "target" variable, as the series contains both the features (past) and the target (future), but those methods are supervised learning methods because they learn how to map past features with future values using the values contained in the series itself. Another way of seeing this is imagining time series forecasting methods as supervised learning methods with features $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, ..., y_{t-w}$ and target $y_t$ . Then you can imagine a "typical" supervised learning dataset where each row contains the target value $y_t$ for a period $t$ and the associated features as columns.
