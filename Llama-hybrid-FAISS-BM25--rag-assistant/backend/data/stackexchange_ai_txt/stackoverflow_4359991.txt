How to develop a plan for your javascript

my exposure to web development has primarily, the front end HTML, CSS with some JQuery thrown in for simple animations. However I am working on a pretty big project right now for work. This will include a ton of javascript functions involving, Object calls, AJAX calls and so forth. I have a good grasp of functions and all that, but as development is continuing, I am worried about keeping all of the calls organized and flowing efficiently. So I am curious about what subjects are out there to help effectively plan out something like this, it doesn't necessarily have to be about Javascript, but planning any sort of project to ensure that your code is easily manageable, and everything is in it's proper place. This is a new type of development for me, coming from HTML and CSS, and I want to make sure that the foundation of this project is rock solid.
