You are looking to create a parse tree to find multi-token clauses. Here is code to generate a parse tree: import spacy from nltk import Tree nlp = spacy.load('en') def to_nltk_tree(node): if node.n_lefts + node.n_rights > 0: return Tree(node.orth_, [to_nltk_tree(child) for child in node.children]) else: return node.orth_ query = u'tell me about people in konoha who have wind style chakra and are above jonin level' doc = nlp(query) [to_nltk_tree(sent.root).pretty_print() for sent in doc.sents] Output: tell ____|______ | about | | | people | ______|_____ | | have | | _____|____________ | | | | | are | | | | | | | | | | chakra above | | | | | | | in | | style level | | | | | | me konoha who and wind jonin From that parse tree, you can then select the phrases.
