The best route to take is to go into your magento directory and (ALWAYS BACKUP FIRST!) remove all your .htaccess edits. If there is a .htaccess file for your admin directory specifically, that would be the best place to start (temporarily?) removing these edits. Then slowly put them back into place to find out your problem and fix it. Good luck! Dennis M.
