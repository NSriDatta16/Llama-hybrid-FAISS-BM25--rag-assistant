Pre-treatment period in difference-in-differences model

I want to evaluate the consequences of a policy change using a difference-in-differences (DiD) setup. I have quarterly data over ten years before the treatment ( $t_{-10}$ , $t_{-9}$ , ..., $t_{-1}$ ) and ten years after the treatment ( $t_{+1}$ , $t_{+2}$ , ..., $t_{+10}$ ). However, in the pre-treatment period, it seems that the parallel trends assumption holds from $t_{-10}$ to $t_{-5}$ but not afterwards (i.e., from $t_{-5}$ to $t_{-1}$ ). It looks like the agents anticipate the policy change. Is it possible in this case to only use the data from $t_{-10}$ to $t_{-5}$ for the pre-treatment period (and drop the observations from $t_{-5}$ to $t_{-1}$ ) in order to obtain an unbiased DiD estimate?
