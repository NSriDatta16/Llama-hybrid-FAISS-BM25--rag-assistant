EDIT This one works better: http://jsfiddle.net/kW369/ , I've left the old one too. Nice question! This is the default behaviour in jQuery and I think it's right that it works this way... it is a strange thing to have the need to drop an item onto itself. Anyway try this jsFiddle which is a partial solution to your problem. It works by detecting the position of the dragged div and see it if collapses with the first div position. I know this is not the most clear solution but it's the only one I was able to come up with. Also, this has a bug because the position gets calculated using the top left corner of the div so if you are dropping the first div onto the second by placing the mouse inside the second div BUT the top left corner of the div you're dragging is on top of the first one it will behave like you dropped it onto both divs. You should use mouse position instead of ui.position['top'] and ui.position['top'] and left to detect the position more precisely.
