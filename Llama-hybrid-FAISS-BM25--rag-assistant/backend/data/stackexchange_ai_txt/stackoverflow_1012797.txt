You need at least two testcases to get 100% coverage. One where some_condition is true and one where it is not. If you have that you should get 100% coverage. Though you should see 100% coverage as perfect. You would need 3 tests for that in this case so all combinations can be tested. Look up cyclomatic complexity to learn more about that.
