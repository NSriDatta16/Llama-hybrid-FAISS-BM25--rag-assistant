Full message source: A Little Bird: This Week We Love... 17 September 2010 body{ background-color: #FFA6C9; margin:0; padding:0; } a{ color: #275571; } th.website p{ margin: 0; padding: 0; } For more suggestions please visit www.A-LittleBird.com Restaurants: Hel Yes! The latest in East London cool is a Finnish pop-up restaurant in a disused warehouse near Old Street. &nbsp;It sounds crazy, but it’s true. &nbsp;Commissioned by The Finnish Institute for the London Design Festival, there are bowed Aspen branches over the tables, light installation sculptures and trendy Finnish waiters in Heikki Salonen outfits. &nbsp;Best of all though, is the food which is part foraged locally, part sourced from Finland and changes daily. &nbsp;Think sea bass tartar with archipelago bread, lamb neck with dill and liquorice crème brûlée. They are hoping to extend their 3 week stay but until then you’ll have to hurry to get a table as they are almost booked out. &nbsp;Alternatively, turn up for a cocktail – we found the Purple Lumi, vodka and mixed forest berries, went down a treat – and the bar is open until 1am. What: Pop-up Finnish restaurant Hel Yes! When: Wed: 5pm-1am, dinner 7-11pm; Thurs-Sat: 11am-1am, dinner 7-11pm and Sun: 12-5pm.

Website: Apple Shopping: Kerry Taylor Vintage Fashion and Textile Auction Kerry Taylor is the force who runs Sotheby’s couture&nbsp;auctions where frocks go for fortunes. But Taylor also runs her own auction house in South London where you can get fantastic items at much more affordable prices. We once scored a whole slew of Chanel and Ferragamo shoes for about £100. This season’s auction has a wide range of items from every decade, including loads of particularly good Ossie Clarke and some unusual 80′s pieces. You can visit Taylor’s warehouse (vintage fashion heaven ), where everything is on display two days before the auction, or check out the lots online. You can bid online too, or by telephone, though the actual auction is always good sport, not only for the thrill of making your own bids, but because you get to see costume designers battling it out with vintage dealers. What: Kerry Taylor's Vintage Fashion and Textiles Auction When: Auction: Tues 28 Sept, 10.30am. Viewing: Sun 26, 12-4pm &amp; Mon 27 Sept, 9.30-5pm Where: Kerry Taylor Auctions LLP, Unit C25, Parkhall Road Trading Estate, 40 Martell Road, Dulwich, SE21 8EN Tel: 020 8676 4600 Website: Kerry Taylor Auctions And finally...
