(quated part is no more important since you edited your post about team size) If you are doing some small project on your own, maybe you shouldn't use code versioning at all because you probably don't need it. Code versioning helps you with central code storage, multi-person development code merging (several people working on the same file and then commit changes) and code branching to name the most important ones. If I were you, and I would be the only person developing something simple, I wouldn't use it, because it would also be a bit of a time-overkill. But otherwise source control doesn't address technology like .Net framework version. Code control only stores files (with history) and is able to merge text files. Written in whatever language possible. If you are part of a team I'd suggest using Subversion + TortoiseSVN + AnkhSVN And No, CruiseControl is not a code versioning system. It's a continuous integration system .
