Disclaimer: Distributed Objects are not available on iPhone . Why do you find distributed objects inelegant? They sounds like a good match here: transparent marshalling of fundamental types and Objective-C classes it doesn't really matter wether clients are local or remote not much additional work for Cocoa-based applications The documentation might make it sound like more work then it actually is, but all you basically have to do is to use protocols cleanly and export, or respectively connect to, the servers root object. The rest should happen automagically behind the scenes for you in the given scenario.
