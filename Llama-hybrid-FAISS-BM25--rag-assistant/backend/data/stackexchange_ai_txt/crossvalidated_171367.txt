How to find Rubin’s Missing Data Mechanism for one specific Variable?

There is lots of literature regarding to the treatment of Missing Data like Multiple Imputation and so on. And I know there is help from graphics but graphics are not as explicit as a test. But I haven’t yet found any concrete strategy on how to diagnose the Missing Data Mechanism apart from Little’s Test that is more for global assessment of the Missing Data Mechanism of a whole data set and apart from t-tests. Here my example: X … pretestscore R … missingness indicator variable for X, where R = 0 is observed and R = 1 is missing Y … actual testscore (numeric variable) I have a predictor variable X and its missingness indicator variable R. (And I have other categorial covariates Z that can also have missing values). First the taxonomy: 1) MCAR P(R = 1|X obs , X miss , Z) = P(R = 1) Means: the probability of missing values in X (R=1) does neither depend on the observed values of X or another covariates nor on the missing values itself. 2) MAR P(R = 1|X obs , X miss , Z) = P(R = 1|X obs , Z) 3) NMAR P(R = 1|X obs , X miss , Z)! = P(R = 1|X obs , Z) Here is my try to find the Mechanism: I did a t-test on R and Y obs -> there is a significant Bonferroni-corrected result and a Cohen’s d from about 0.27. To check I performed a simple linear regression E(Y obs |R): the coefficients are significant, but the R² is near 0 (0.02). I conclude that a linear regression is not a fitting model for my data points. I performed a logistic regression (R|Y obs ) and AIC is again miserable from about 14000 or so. The numerical prestest variable X will actually be categorized in the end to predict testscore Y. So why not the other way round. I orderd all values of Y and categorized them into quartiles and performed a Chi²-test. The significant result supports the stochastic-dependance-hypothesis between R and Y. My first issue : the t-test shows a significant difference in the means but the linear regression model's determination coefficient R² says the model doesn't fit. Can I then because of a significant t-test mathematical-logically conclude a stochastic dependence between R and Y obs ? (Well, I think no!) If so, the Mechanism would be at least MAR, if not NMAR, because pretest and actual test scores are correlated? My second issue : I know one cannot infer stochastic independence from regessional independence. But in this case I’m wondering because it's a binary independant variable. So E(R|Y) = P(R = 1|Y) (the regression is the probability). As the AIC says there is no regressional depencance I conclude that there is no stochastical dependance as well. Is my thinking correct? Now on the contrary my result from the chi²-test shows stochastic dependance between R and Y. I'm confused. Is there nowhere a step-by-step-recipe on how to diagnose the Missing Data Mechanism. How do you do it? What if there is a dependance between R and Y if I control for another variable, say type of school. I can hardly control for all covariates (gender, subject, retention, mother tongue...) Thanks for any hints.
