Have a look at Jeff Richter PowerThreading library available here . This library has AsyncEnumerator class which leverages 'yield' keyword for performing async operations in a synchrous manner. There is a screencast about this class, available here: http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Jeffrey-Richter-and-his-AsyncEnumerator/ Hope this helps. Valve.
