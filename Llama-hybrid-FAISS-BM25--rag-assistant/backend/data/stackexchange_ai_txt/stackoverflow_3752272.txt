Make sure your substring call returns the correct result. If possible, use static methods from the Path class instead. Take a look at the MSDN page for File.Move and pay attention to what parameters are expected -- you should provide two valid full file names (e.g. C:\Blah\myFile.txt ). "Access denied" error message might happen if the user picks a folder they don't have write access to in the folder browser dialog. That's a scenario you'll have to handle in your code, perhaps by catching the UnauthorizedAccessException . Update: the destination file should also point to a filename. So you'll need to do something like this: var origFileName = Path.GetFileName(strPath); strNewpath = Path.Combine(folderborwser1.SelectedPath, origFileName); File.Move(strPath, strNewpath);
