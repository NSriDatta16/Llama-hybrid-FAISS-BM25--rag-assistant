The problem is that the tutorial you're looking at is from mid-2009, when the storage client library was an add-on that was distributed as a sample with the SDK. With the latest SDK (which I see you're using), the Azure storage support is now officially part of the SDK. The reference you're looking for is Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient. Take a look at the Azure platform training kit - they should have updated samples. Also: when you create a new cloud project with v1.2, you'll see that you automatically get references to the Azure dll's and don't need to manually add them. This includes: Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Diagnostics Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient
