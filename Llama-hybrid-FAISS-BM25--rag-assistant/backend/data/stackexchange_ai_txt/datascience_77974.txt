The validation set is used just to give an indication about the network's performance. The hyperparameters are tuned based on the training data itself. Based on the optimizer, the neural network calculates the loss for a training sample. Based on the computed loss, the weights of the network are updated. This is repeated for every sample in the training set. The validation set just uses the latest weights of the network on unseen data to check the model's performance.
