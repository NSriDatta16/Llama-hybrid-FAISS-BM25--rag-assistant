Doesn't look like the error is haml or json related -- I think it's in the @organization.accumulated_credits assignment; looks like it doesn't exist Can you confirm that exists (either through schema.rb or using the console?) @organization.update_attribute('accumulated_credits', '0') ... NoMethodError (undefined method `accumulated_credits=' for # ):
