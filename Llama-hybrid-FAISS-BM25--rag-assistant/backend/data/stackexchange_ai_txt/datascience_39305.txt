Relation between amount of training samples and model depth?

When I add more hidden layers to my CNN (e.g. Dense Layers) it seems that the model needs more training samples to produce good results for classes with few training samples. In the single layer case the model provided better results, even for classes with few samples. (multi-class text classification with >10 classes) Is there any evidence that my assumption is correct?
