How to force a piece of text to be 'direction ltr' inside a 'direction rtl' paragraph

So, phone numbers are always ltr (left to right). Working on a multilingual website I need to insert a phone number (with a '+' prefix and numbers separated by '-') inside a text paragraph that has direction rtl (for relevant languages of course) So I have something like this: .ltr #test {direction:ltr} .rtl #test {direction:rtl} #phone {direction:ltr} Please call to +44-123-321 for some help. Please call to +44-123-321 for some help. Of course this is not working because ' direction ' only works for block elements and ' span ' is an inline element. I need the phone number to be inside the paragraph so I can't change ' span ' to ' display:inline ' I'm being clear? How to make it work?
