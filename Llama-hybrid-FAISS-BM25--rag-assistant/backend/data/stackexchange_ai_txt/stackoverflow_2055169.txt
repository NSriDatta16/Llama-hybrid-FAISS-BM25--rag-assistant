I have programmed a few websites with Lua. The first one was a raid planner for my World of Warcraft guild (that's often how you start programming in Lua...). I used mod_lua with an alpha version of Apache 2.4 for that. Two others were small contests sites for customers, developed with WSAPI, Nginx, Spawn-fcgi and Orbit. This setup is damn fast, faster than mod_lua and anything else I have seen. The pages would display instantly as if they were in cache ! The experience was very pleasant and Lua makes you quickly productive. But you better be well organized. Lua is missing a lot of batteries when it comes to web development, so you often have to implement your own and it can become messy. So I suggest you plan what you will need before you start. I used my own Lua "ORM" with MySQL and a forked version of Lua Pages for the templates. Have a look here if you want to give Lua+Wsapi+Nginx a try : http://mascarenhas.github.com/2009/10/24/wsapi-nginx-fcgi.html I think it is the best setup.
