Raphael-GWT: fill image of a shape (Rect) appears offset. How to resolve this?

I'm wondering about the behavior of {Shape}.attr("fill","url({image.path})") . when applying a fill image to a shape: public class AppMapCanvas extends Raphael { public AppMapCanvas(int width, int height) { super(width, height); this.hCenter = width / 2; this.vCenter = height / 2; ... Rect rect = this.new Rect(hCenter, vCenter, 144, 40, 4); rect.attr("fill", "url('../images/app-module-1-bg.png')"); // The background image seem to teal accross the canvas behind the shape, thus gets weird positioning (an illustration snapshot is enclosed - i marked the original image borders in red). This seem to resolve itself in the presence of an animation along a path (a mere path.M(0,0) is sufficiant). How can i position the fill-image properly in the first place?
