Yes, it is an excellent method. Usually, priors are built from less. That is a very defensible solution to constructing a prior density. EDIT See Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition by Andrew Gelman, John B. Carlin, Hal S. Stern, David B. Dunson, Aki Vehtari, Donald B. Rubin see the segments on the use of historical data and informative priors in the index See also Introduction to Bayesian Statistics by William M Bolstad and James M Curran. See the chapter on robust Bayesian methods. There is an article by Jaynes at http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/highly.informative.priors.pdf on highly informative priors. There is also this article at Hamra, Ghassan et al. “Integrating Informative Priors from Experimental Research with Bayesian Methods: An Example from Radiation Epidemiology.” Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.) 24.1 (2013): 90–95. PMC. Web. 5 Apr. 2018. EDIT How interesting, I am working on a similar problem assuming LGD is loss given default. So, since I do not know your methodology, but I presume it is some form of regression, I would recommend looking at the Bolstad method of mixing prior results from the literature with a flat prior. These leaves the center of location intact but spreads out the uncertainty. To provide an example, let us imagine you know that $\hat{\beta}_x=1.23$ in the literature with a variance of $.000001$ so it is estimated to a precision less than your least significant digit. You could construct a prior distribution around the literature's center of location but with a high variance. How high is high would, of course, depend upon the scaling of your literature, but you want it to be high enough that you have captured all reasonable estimates of the parameter in the dense region of your prior. This is the difficulty of Bayesian methods, they depend on judgment to some extent. How the joint distribution of parameters works will also be a judgment call. While you could take the naive Bayes approach of no covariance if there is a published covariance matrix then it should be the starting point of your search. What you are wanting your Bayesian method to do is guide your estimator into the region that is most likely the true region. You should add variance to your estimators to account for the cultural and legal differences surrounding losses. I would love to give you a clear answer that every editor in the journals would take, but the most you can do is hunt the statistical literature for "informative prior" and "highly informative prior." There would also be content on robust methods and mixture priors. Gelman's section on the use of historical data would also be of use. He anticipates a body of literature from which to construct the prior. This is problematic since no one is actually performing the same exact research in question. One approach that could be taken is to grab Cox's axiomatic approach where probability is grounded in logic. Hence, you need to construct a logical framework for the construction of the prior. Hence your real job is disclosure and reasonableness and not a precise algebraic formulation.
