Why must a CNN have a fixed input size?

Right now I'm studying Convolutional Neural Networks. Why must a CNN have a fixed input size? I know that it is possible to overcome this problem (with fully convolutional neural networks etc...), and I also know that it is due to the fully connected layers placed at the end of the network. But why? I can not understand what the presence of the fully connected layers implies and why we are forced to have a fixed input size.
