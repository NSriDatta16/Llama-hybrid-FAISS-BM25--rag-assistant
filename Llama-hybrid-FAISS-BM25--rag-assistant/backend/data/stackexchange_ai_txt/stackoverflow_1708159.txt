Repository Pattern: Is it only for database source?

I was wondering if i can use the Repository Pattern for anything other than a database layer? I have used the pattern for a shopcart where I stored shopcart items in an array in ShopCartRepository class. I then got the data from the ShopCartRepository using a ShopCartController class. As mentioned the ShopCartRepository only deals with an array and therefore not a database. Is this a "legal" approach for using the Repository Pattern?
