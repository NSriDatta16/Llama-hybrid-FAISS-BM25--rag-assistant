The F-stat contains a ratio which describes the increased error in going from a full model to the reduced model ("reduced" because it has a subset of explanatory $x$ variables so its average residuals are not smaller). In a similar spirit, we could measure model similarity by examining the increase in error in swapping the betas (i.e. applying $\beta_0$ to $Y_1$ and $\beta_1$ to $Y_0$ ). Let the residual matrix of data i under model j be: $\mathcal{E}_{i|j} = \beta_j X - Y_i$ we can compute the mean squared error of these as: $MSE_{i|j} = \frac{1}{N_i} Tr (\mathcal{E}_{i|j}\mathcal{E}_{i|j}^T)$ so that the "swapped increase in mse" is: $\frac{MSE' - MSE}{MSE}$ where $MSE' = MSE_{0|1} + MSE_{1|0}$ is the swapped mean square error and $MSE = MSE_{0|0} + MSE_{1|1}$ is the original mean square error.
