Excel's SUMIF() -Formula might help you accomplish this. as described, the syntax is SUMIF(range, criteria, sum_range) Searches fields within range that match criteria and sums up the values in sum_range (at the same index where the criteria has been found in range, respectively). you might want to create a matrix for each number/search criteria to sum up and compare... Another approach : For a certain Column (let's take C) make a temporary column and add a 1 as value to each line. For example, in Column "Sum A:" type the formula: =IF($A2=D$1,1,0) Whereas D1 is the cell containing the number 3792 (in top) and the 2 in C2 is the current line the formula stands in. You would just be able to drag it to the right and to the bottom. This would be the result: A B C D E F G 3792 3805 3806 3823 3892 3792 Widget A 1 3792 Widget A 1 3792 Widget A 1 3792 Widget A 1 3792 Widget A 1 3792 Widget A 1 3792 Widget A 1 3805 Widget B 1 3805 Widget B 1 3806 Widget C 1 3823 Widget D 1 3823 Widget D 1 3823 Widget D 1 3892 Widget E 1 3892 Widget E 1 3892 Widget E 1 SUM: 7 2 1 3 3 You just simply sum up at the end and you got your results. If another number should be added than 1 , simply add another column containing the appropriate value, you then replace it in the IF -formula. you might want to automate this even more using a HLOOKUP() for the widget number's at the top. regards
