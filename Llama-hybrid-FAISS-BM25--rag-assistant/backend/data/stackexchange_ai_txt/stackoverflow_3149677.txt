how to open vCard bydefault in outlook 2007/03?

I have generated the the vCard from asp.net + c# application. While ending up. browsers pops up for "open with /Save as" box. I don't want to appear this box. rather than that , I want to directly set the generated .vcf file to open with outlook 2007 or 03. what hae to do ? My code is: S ystem.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter htmlWrite = new HtmlTextWriter(stringWrite); //vCard Begin stringWrite.WriteLine("BEGIN:VCARD"); stringWrite.WriteLine("VERSION:2.1"); //Name stringWrite.WriteLine("N:" + nameLast + ";" + nameFirst + ";" + nameMiddle + ";" + nameTitle); //Full Name stringWrite.WriteLine("FN:" + nameFirst + " " + nameMiddle + " " + nameLast); //Organisation stringWrite.WriteLine("ORG:" + company + ";" + department); //URL stringWrite.WriteLine("URL;WORK:" + uRL); //Title stringWrite.WriteLine("TITLE:" + title); //Profession stringWrite.WriteLine("ROLE:" + profession); //Telephone stringWrite.WriteLine("TEL;WORK;VOICE:" + telephone); //Fax stringWrite.WriteLine("TEL;WORK;FAX:" + fax); //Mobile stringWrite.WriteLine("TEL;CELL;VOICE:" + mobile); //Email stringWrite.WriteLine("EMAIL;PREF;INTERNET:" + email); //Address stringWrite.WriteLine("ADR;WORK;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:" + ";" + office + ";" + addressTitle + "=0D" + streetName + ";" + city + ";" + region + ";" + postCode + ";" + country); //Revision Date //Not needed //stringWrite.WriteLine("REV:" + DateTime.Today.Year.ToString() + // DateTime.Today.Month.ToString() + DateTime.Today.Day.ToString() + "T" + // DateTime.Now.Hour.ToString() + DateTime.Now.Minute.ToString() + // DateTime.Now.Second.ToString() + "Z"); //vCard End stringWrite.WriteLine("END:VCARD"); response.Write(stringWrite.ToString()); response.AppendHeader("Hi", "PMTS"); response.End();
