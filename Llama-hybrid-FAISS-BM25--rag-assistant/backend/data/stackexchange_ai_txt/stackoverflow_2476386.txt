AS3 - Event listener that only fires once

I'm looking for a way to add an EventListener which will automatically removes itself after the first time it fires, but I can't figure a way of doing this the way I want to. I found this function ( here ) : public class EventUtil { public static function addOnceEventListener(dispatcher:IEventDispatcher,eventType:String,listener:Function):void { var f:Function = function(e:Event):void { dispatcher.removeEventListener(eventType,f); listener(e); } dispatcher.addEventListener(eventType,f); } } But instead of having to write : EventUtil.addOnceEventListener( dispatcher, eventType, listener ); I would like to use it the usual way : dispatcher.addOnceEventListener( eventType, listener ); Has anybody got an idea of how this could be done? Any help would be greatly apprecitated. (I know that Robert Penner's Signals can do this, but I can't use them since it would mean a lot of code rewriting that I can't afford for my current project)
