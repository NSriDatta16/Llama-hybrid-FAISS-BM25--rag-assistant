Many ways to approach this. You can use WinInet API, WinHTTP API, WinHTTPRequest, or XMLHTTPRequest. I prefer the lower leveled Winsock, and you can read about it here: http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?t=334645 . Winsock is a bit more complicated, and but a bit more powerful, in my opinion. If you want to do it simple and sweet, XML HTTP Request is the way to go, I use it in javascript too. Try something like: Set myMSXML = New MSXML.XMLHTTPRequest myMSXML.open "POST", URL, True myMSXML.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" myMSXML.setRequestHeader "User-Agent", "Firefox 3.6.4" myMSXML.OnReadyStateChange = (Shown below) myMSXML.send YourPostDataString And the OnReadyStateChange function: Dim HttpResponse As String HttpResponse = myMSXML.responseText If you find my code not working, or you're a bit confused, I'm sorry, I'm a bit rusty with VB nowadays. You can check out the official Microsoft documentation on XMLHTTPRequest here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms759148%28VS.85%29.aspx
