How does the ingragistics control operate? Does it become a gif/png/etc? Or is it ActiveX/flash/etc? For image-based graphs, there are a range of tools that will do the job of scraping html+images to pdf, including HTMLDOC, ABCpdf, etc. Generate your PDF, and use the file as an attachment. You'll still need a web-server to generate the image - but you never have to view the page; it becomes essentially a glorified web-service.
