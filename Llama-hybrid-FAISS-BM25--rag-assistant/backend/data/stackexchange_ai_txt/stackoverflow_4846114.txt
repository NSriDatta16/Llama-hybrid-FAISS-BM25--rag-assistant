Normally this kind of thing is organized by the use of templates in some markup language (the "View" in MVC - often using HTML or XML). I actually don't know much about Qt, but perhaps your classes actually behave as templates. You would probably have 3 templates: The Add item template The Edit item template The Item Form template The form template would be imported somewhere in the middle of templates #1 and #2.
