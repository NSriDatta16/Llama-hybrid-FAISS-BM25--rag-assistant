You cannot make AJAX requests that are to a different domain than the one the script is currently on. Perhaps you can make a script on your server which issues the cross-site request, if necessary. An example of the script that would be on your server: $curl_res = curl_init("http://schoolprove.nl/nieuw/index.php/leerlingen/checkvoortgang/"); curl_setopt($curl_res, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($curl_res, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "decrease_id=" . $_POST[ 'decrease_id'] . "&user_id=" . $_POST['user_id']); curl_exec($curl_res);
