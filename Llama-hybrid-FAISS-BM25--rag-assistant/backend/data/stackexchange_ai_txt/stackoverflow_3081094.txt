It may not be as bad as you think - a project can always refer to its own classes without needing an explicit reference. However, when this kind of structural problem crops up, it's usually telling you there's a flaw in the overall design. I'd guess that there's an implicit third project that you haven't defined yet, that your Organization and Contact projects will each need a reference to. Once you've moved the class in question into the new project, create a reference to it in each of your existing ones, and you'll be all set. Of course, this may necessitate other structural changes - sorting out this kind of problem can turn out to be a real can of worms. Bottom line: circular references usually indicate that there's a bit more thought needed to work out what the dependencies in your object model really are.
