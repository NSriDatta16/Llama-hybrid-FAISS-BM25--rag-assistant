How to use features with lags of different lengths in LSTM?

I'm trying to predict a time series, let's say I have 3 features and a target variable. I used the standard approach when feature lags have the same length, for example, 10. Then the size of my batch will be (32, 10, 3) . But looking at the autocorrelation graphs, I want to use a lag length of 10 for the first feature, 5 for the second, and 7 for the third. How can I construct a batch in this case? My architecture looks like this: inp = Input(shape=(10, 3, batch_size=None) x = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)(inp) x = Flatten()(x) x = Dropout(0.2)(x) out = Dense(2, activation='linear')(x)
