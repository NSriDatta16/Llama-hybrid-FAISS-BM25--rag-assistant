Can you change the unit of prediction in a statistical model?

If I do a time series ARIMA model data on monthly data, all future predictions will be at the monthly level. Is it wrong to take 12 future predictions, add them together, and then say that this will be the cumulative prediction for the next year? Then, I could do bootstrap method to get confidence interval. Here, I would take a random sample with repeats for whole dataset, fit model, make 12 month prediction, add the 12 month predictions to get cumulative year end prediction .... repeat this process many times ... and then have a bell curve distribution of all cumulative predictions, and take 5 and 95 percentiles of bell curve to get confidences intervals. The reason I am asking is because I only have 24 months of data. If I want to start with yearly model, it is impossible to fit time series model on 2 data points. But if I use months, its much easier to fit time series model on 24 points and make 12 month prediction, and then add it at the year end .... indirectly a "hack" for this situation. Statistically is this ok?
