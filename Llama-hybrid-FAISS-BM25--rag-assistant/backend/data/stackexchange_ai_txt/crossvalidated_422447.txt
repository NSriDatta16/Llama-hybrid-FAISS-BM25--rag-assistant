Violation of Independence of Observations - Logistic Regression

Apologies if this seems a basic question but I can't find enough detailed information about what exactly constitutes a violation of independent observations. The regression I'm wanting to run is based on the following: I have some eye-tracking data in which I code a 0 or 1 if the participant's eyes fell in a particular area of the screen for each frame of a video I'm playing. I'm trying to evaluate if heart rate and pupil size are able to predict whether or not their eyes will be in the area of interest. My problem is that for each participant I have 21600 data points (at most, this number can vary as due to the population I'm working with there are some missing data chunks). Is it appropriate to put all my participants' data into 1 big dataset for the regression, or does having multiple samples from the same participant violate the assumption of independent observations? If it does violate this, then what are my options? I could condense everyone's data down to a single proportion of time spent in the area of interest alongside mean heart rate and pupil size, but this will only leave me with 15 samples in total which I don't think is enough to really run a regression on? Alternately, I could run an independent regression for each participant, but I would like to be able to condense it into a group level analysis if I can. Thanks!
