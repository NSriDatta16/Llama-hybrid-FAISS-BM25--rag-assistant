What are you doing before retrieval ? Also a 'SET NAMES utf8;'? Otherwise, MySQL will silently convert to the charset the connection indicates as used. If not even that, what does a SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM table; show? Having a table with a default charset does not mean the column is. i.e, this is valid: . CREATE TABLE test ( `name` varchar(10) character set latin1 ) CHARSET=utf8
