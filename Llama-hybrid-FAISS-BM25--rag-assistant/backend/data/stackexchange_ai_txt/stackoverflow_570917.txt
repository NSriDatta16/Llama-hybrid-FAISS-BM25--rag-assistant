You can create three div's. The first div (top-left) would have a width set at, say, 50% of the container (e.g. viewport) and float left . The second div (top-right) would have a width set at, say, 50% of the container (e.g. viewport) and float right . The third div (bottom-center) would have a witdh set at, say, 100% of the container (e.g. viewport) use the CSS 'clear:both' to position itself immediately below the tallest of the two floats. To center, use a smaller width (e.g. 50% or 20em) and set the CSS margin-left and margin-right to auto (see example below.) The above will dynamically pack the three divs to accommodate any wrapping and vertical growing (including because of the increase of font size by the user for accessibility purposes) inside any of the three div's.
