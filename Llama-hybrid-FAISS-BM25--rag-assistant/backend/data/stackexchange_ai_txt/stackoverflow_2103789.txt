The OID part of the MAC address you give (01:00:0C) isn't the same as the one used for IPv4 multicast (01:00:5E), so you can't use anything in Winsock to send this packet. Even raw sockets won't work, because that doesn't let you dig down to the Ethernet layer. What you need is WinPCap or something like it, with which you can construct raw Ethernet frames and receive answering packets at that same level.
