How can I generate data from a SVM?

I would like to generate samples from a support vector machine, with a Gaussian kernel and a fixed C and sigma ? For examples (x1,x2) and corresponding class label y Effectively I would like to generate a dataset such that I know a C and sigma that work well on it. Then knowing these values I can access various method of hyper-parameter optimisation methods? I've seen how it can be done with Gaussian processes but they are probabilistic so I'm not really sure how or if it can be done with SVMs? Or is there a different way to construct a dataset to assess hyper-parameter optimisation routines?
