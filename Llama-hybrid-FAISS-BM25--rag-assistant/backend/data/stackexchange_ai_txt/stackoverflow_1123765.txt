Interface builder doesn't support specifying relationships between sibling elements; the Cocoa layout engine does everything relative to the containing view. I'd recommend creating a single UITextView that contains both paragraphs, inserting a single empty line between them. Keep each paragraph in its own instance variable, though, and when either one is updated, update the display as well, reconstructing the combined text from the two separate paragraphs.
