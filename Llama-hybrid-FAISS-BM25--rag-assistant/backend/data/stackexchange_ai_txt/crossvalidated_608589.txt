The MAP estimator can have non-zero probability mass at a point (even if the posterior distribution is always continuous) The linked article is actually a bit misleading on this point, since even under the stipulated model all the relevant distributions are still continuous, so there is still zero probability mass at the point $\beta=0$ . This is typical in penalised regression models, so it is misleading to describe things in the way the author has done. The issue here is really about the difference between properties of a posterior distribution, versus properties of a point estimator formed by taking the posterior mode (called the MAP estimator ). In regard to your first query, you should note that probability mass refers to actual probability ---not probability density--- so if a random variable has any continuous distribution then it has zero probability mass at any single point. This is true of the normal distribution, just as with other continuous distributions. The stipulated model in the linked post also uses a continuous prior distribution for the coefficient parameter in the regression. The real issue here (which is obscured by the misleading language of the linked post) is that the estimator $\hat{\beta}$ used in penalised regression analysis can have a non-zero probability of being zero even when you use a continuous prior distribution for the true coefficient parameter . To see this, we first note that the estimator is obtained by maximising the log-likelihood plus penalty, which is equivalent to a MAP estimator (see this related answer for how these two approaches link to each other). Under certain specifications of the penalty function (equivalently the prior in Bayesian analysis) the MAP estimator has a non-zero probability of being equal to zero. In other words, it is possible to have: $$\mathbb{P}(\beta=0) = 0 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \mathbb{P}(\hat{\beta} = 0) > 0.$$ This possibility may seem a bit subtle and it requires some explanation. A continuous prior leads to a continuous posterior in the regression analysis, so there is zero probability mass a posteriori at any given point in the parameter space. However, although every parameter value has zero probability mass a posteriori , the mode of the posterior (which is used as the point estimator) may be the same under a wide enough set of sampling outcomes that it has a non-zero probability of falling at a given point. This is a common occurrence in penalised regression analysis.
