css to replace characters in paragraph tag

Already checked exisitng questions for this, but didn't find an exact match. My aim is to replace characters (like spaces) on a webpage with a small image using css. Example: This is a text becomes: ThisIMGisIMGaIMGtext (where IMG stands for a visible image (middot-pic for a space f.e.)) I cannot think of a suitable css selector. But myabe one of you guys (or girls) know a solution. Is this possible at all?
