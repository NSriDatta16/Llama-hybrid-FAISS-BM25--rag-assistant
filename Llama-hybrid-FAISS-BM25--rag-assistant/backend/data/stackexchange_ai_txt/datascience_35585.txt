If you read the entire file without skipping jumbled lines, does it stil work? What values appear in those jumbled cells? You could go down the road of imputation , i.e. filling the missing gaps, based on something you can deduce from the data that is there. Example are: fill-forward : fill will preceding non-missing value fill-backwards : fill with following non-missing value average-filling : if numerical, fill gaps with the mean/median etc. of that column. You could also use something like a moving average. model-based : fill missing values using e.g. a regression model on available values (this needs a target variable, or at least timestamps) One last snity-check: I assume it isn't possible for you to try creating the CSV file again and addressing the problem at its source?
