As per the definition of the option tag by the w3c : "This attribute allows authors to specify a shorter label for an option than the content of the OPTION element. When specified, user agents should use the value of this attribute rather than the content of the OPTION element as the option label." David's answer is pretty good, I just wanted to add a link to the official definition. :D
