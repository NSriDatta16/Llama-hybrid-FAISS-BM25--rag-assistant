I suspect most NB implementations allow for the estimation of the conditional probabilities with the Laplace correction , which gives a MAP solution to the Bayesian NB classifier (with a particular Dirichlet prior). As @Zhubarb (+1) points out, Bayesian treatments of NB classifiers have already been derived and implemented (Rennie's thesis/papers are well worth reading). However, the independence assumption of NB is almost always wrong, in which case making the model more strongly dependent on that assumption (via a full Bayesian treatment) might not be a good thing to do.
