Categorical predictors with multiple levels result in multiple parameters being estimated, and with just main effects of the predictor included in the model, each parameter estimate represents a contrast among a given level and the last level (in the parameterization used in the Ordinal Regression). Some of these might be significant while the omnibus test for the predictor might not be. Omnibus tests tend to reflect sort of averages of these individual effects. This is true here as it is in any linear or generalized linear model. There's nothing special about ordinal regression in this regard.
