It's fine to subscribe to the base class event, even though I usually find it more elegant to override the OnSomeEvent method. That's really just a question of style. Anyway, in that case you don't have the option to override the method... You could override OnPropertyChanged , as suggested by Markus HÃ¼tter, but that option isn't always available (not all events are related to a property change).
