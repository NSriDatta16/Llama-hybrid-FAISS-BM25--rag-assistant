If all members a guaranteed to be of type int you can use a pointer to int and increment it: int *value = &(values.v_move); int *quantity = &(quantities.qtt_move); int i; average = 0; // although it should work, a good practice many times IMHO is to add a null as the last member in struct and change the condition to quantity[i] != null. for (i = 0; i (Since the order of members in a struct is guaranteed to be as declared)
