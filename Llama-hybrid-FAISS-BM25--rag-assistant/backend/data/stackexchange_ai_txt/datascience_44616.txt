I haven't tried testing images from a custom dataset on AlignedReID but I have used another implementation laid out in the paper In Defense of the Triplet Loss for Person Re-identification . The model is a simple feed-forward CNN which returns a 128 dimensional feature vector for each image. You can find the feature vectors for test images from your custom dataset and associate images with identities based on Euclidean distance for instance. You can find the Github repository here .
