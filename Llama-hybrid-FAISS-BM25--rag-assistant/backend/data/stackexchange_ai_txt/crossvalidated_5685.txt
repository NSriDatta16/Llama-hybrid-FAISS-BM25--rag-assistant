It may not make sense to take an unweighted average of all $N$ observations if the subjects are divided among $k$ subpopulations [=groups] - unless the sample sizes in the groups are proportional to the sizes of the subpopulations. Otherwise, what characteristic[s] of interest would an unweighted average estimate? Your sample design seems to be that of a 1-way MANOVA - so you could finesse the issue of unequal treatment [=group] means by including [vector] group-effect terms in a MANOVA model. Then the logical thing is to test first for no group differences [with the appropriate MANOVA procedure] - and if it appears there are none - the $N$ observations can then be averaged and tested using Hotelling's-$T^2$.
