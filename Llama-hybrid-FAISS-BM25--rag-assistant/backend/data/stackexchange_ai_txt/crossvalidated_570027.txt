As the training set increases, the estimation precision improves, and the expected value of the squared error goes down.*,** As the test set gets smaller simultaneously, the variance of the test error increases. This is what you see in all of the pictures. *The mean squared error is an estimate of that, and it goes down on average across the possible samples from the population or the data generating process, though it may not do that in some particular samples. **Thus regarding Does that mean that the predictive capability of a model is always better when we use all observations as training data? (And in which case if we want a good predictive model, we should use all observations to make our model if possible) - Generally yes.
