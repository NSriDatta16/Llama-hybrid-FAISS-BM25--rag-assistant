Magento - Query for Product Options

I want to write a controller that finds the different options for a given product (eg. Large, Medium, Small, Red, Blue etc...). Can anyone show me the code I would write into my controller? Additional details I'm getting closer, but I still can't figure it out. Here's the code I wrote in my controller $db = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($productId); print_r($db->getOptions()); // returns an empty array echo $db->getHasOptions(); // echos 1 But when I do the print_r() on the second line, the getOptions returns an empty array. The third line echo's the value 1, which means there SHOULD BE options. Additional Details I tried clockworkgeek's solution of $db->getProductOptions() , that returned nothing. I tried $db->getProductOptionsCollection() , and got this output Array ( [totalRecords] => 0 [items] => Array ( ) ) What's wrong with my code such that it is not returning the allowable product options?
