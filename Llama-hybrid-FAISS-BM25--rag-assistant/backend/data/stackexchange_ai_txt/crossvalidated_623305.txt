Yes. No. What you probably want is a case-cohort analysis, where you weight the selected observations according to their selection probabilities: a weight of 1 for cases and approximately 20 for controls. The 'approximately 20' comes from 0.5% of cases -> 5% of control -> 1 in 20 non-cases selected. Operationally, in R you can use survival::cch or survey::twophase and survey::svycoxph and I think there are implementations in Stata and SAS. If you just ignore the sampling, as you would with a case-control logistic regression, you get slightly biased hazard ratios and a badly biased baseline hazard curve.
