XCode 4 unable to attach to iPhone Simulator - double application

when I run my application in iPhone simulator it works fine the first time. But the second time the application is duplicated (two same icons) and XCode tries endlessly to attach the debugger. The problem began when I renamed my project. What is the problem and what could be done? Thanks!
