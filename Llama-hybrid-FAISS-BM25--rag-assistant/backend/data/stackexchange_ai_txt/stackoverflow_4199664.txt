I would highly suggest that you hold out with the release until you have at least one or two big names. This is the chicken and the egg but you need to have a viable product before you sell it. If your businesses don't see the value in your product now, they never will. It sounds like you're planning to woo them with thousands of users but there's no reason thousands of people would download the app if it's useless at the time of purchase. If you can get one major business to back you, then sell the app and use that as leverage against the other companies to get them to join ship. Hope this helps.
