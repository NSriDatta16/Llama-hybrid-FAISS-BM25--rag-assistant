In light of the clarifications in the comments to the question, I'd suggest using logistic regression with indicator variables for each region and a linear trend over year, and also consider adding an interaction between year and region to allow the linear trend to differ between regions. If you want something simpler, you could apply Pearson's chi-squared test to the data for each year separately. It looks like there is very strong evidence that region 1 has higher death rates than either of the other two regions in all years except 2008, when region 3 had too few cases to be able to estimate the proportion of deaths with any precision. Statistics can say nothing about the reason that region 1 differs from the others, of course.
