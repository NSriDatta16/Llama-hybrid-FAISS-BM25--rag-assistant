Difference Between Hadoop Mapreduce(Java) and RHadoop mapreduce

I understand Hadoop MapReduce and its features but I am confused about R MapReduce. One difference I have read is that R utilizes maximum RAM. So do perform parallel processing integrated R with Hadoop. My doubt is: R can do all stats, math and data science related stuff, but why R MapReduce? Is there any new task I can achieve by using R MapReduce instead of Hadoop MapReduce? If yes, please specify. We can achieve the task by using R with Hadoop (directly) but what is the importance of MapReduce in R and how it is different from normal MapReduce?
