It really depends on your requirements you can store filenames/paths using anything that implements Collection if you have a small number of files and/or a flat directory structure if looking up files is performance critical you should use a data structure that gives you fast search, like a HashSet if memory space is an issue (e.g. on mobile devices) and your number of files is high and/or your directory structure deep you should use a data structure that allows for compact storage, like a trie If the data structure allows, I would store File s rather than String s however because there is no additional overhead and File obviously offers convenient file handling methods.
