Program to analyze a lot of XMLs

I have a lot of XML files and I'd like to generate a report from them. The report should provide information such as: root 100% a*1 90% b*1 80% c*5 40% meaning that all documents have a root element, 90% have one a element in the root, 80% have one b element in the root, 40% have 5 c elements in b . If for example some documents have 4 c elements, some 5 and some 6, it should say something like: c*4.3 4 6 40% meaning that 40% have between 4 and 6 c elements there, and the average is 4.3. I am looking for free software, if it doesn't exist I'll write it. I was about to do it, but I thought about checking it. I may not be the first one to have to analyze and get an structural overview of thousand of XML files.
