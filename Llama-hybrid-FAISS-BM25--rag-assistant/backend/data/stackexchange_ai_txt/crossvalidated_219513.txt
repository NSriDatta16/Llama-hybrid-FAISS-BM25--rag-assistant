A very interesting example are unit root tests in econometrics. While there are plenty of choices available to test against or for a unit root in the lag polynomial of a time series (e.g., the (Augmented) Dickey Fuller Test or the KPSS test), the problem can be circumvented completely when one uses Bayesian analysis. Sims pointed this out in his provocative paper titled Understanding Unit Rooters: A Helicopter Tour from 1991. Unit root tests remain valid and used in econometrics. While I personally would attribute this mostly to people being reluctant to adjust to Bayesian practices, many conservative econometricians defend the practice of unit root tests by saying that a Bayesian view of the world contradicts the premise of econometric research. (That is, economists think of the world as a place with fixed parameters, not random parameters that are governed by some hyperparameter.)
