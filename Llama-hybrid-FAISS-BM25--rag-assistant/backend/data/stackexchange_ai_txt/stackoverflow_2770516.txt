Yeah...I don't think anyone posing the question actually expected the device to "sense" a hover or mouseover. Actually you'd have to be pretty arrogant to assume someone actually meant that. Some method of triggering those event handlers is what is desired. I can definitely see a use for them in "hint" text appearing above items. And whomever said not using mouse events makes a cleaner, simpler experience is taking their own opinion a bit too seriously. Those can greatly enhance a web page/application experience or make them worse. It's a matter of prudent usage. The only answer anyone provided here worthwhile is whomever said it is best to have an alternate site optimized for mobile. Or possibly use a content management system that generates the page based on the browser type (similar to how Wikipedia works).
