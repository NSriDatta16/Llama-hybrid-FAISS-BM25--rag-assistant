There really isn't much of a difference. A strained distinction between the two might be consideration of the data generating process (what statisticians call the likelihood). Statisticians care about this because different likelihoods lead to different types of inference. A hotly debated example of this would be the linear probability model (essentially linear regression on binary data) versus logistic regression. I won't spark the debate here, only offer it to you for future research. In general, machine learning doesn't seem to make many statistical assumptions about the data. Leo Brieman's Two Cultures paper does a better job of elaborating on this difference. To the extent there is a difference between the two (I'm not certain there really is), this would be it.
