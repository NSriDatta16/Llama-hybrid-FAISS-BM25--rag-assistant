Why does the prior determine the range of the posterior

Often I have read that in Bayesian analysis that when the data is large enough that the prior may not have much influence on the distribution of the posterior. But I have not found this when fitting some models. In the example below, I can force the samples to be in a specific range by setting these values in the prior i.e. values of alpha are in the range (0.1, 0.5) whereas in the simulated data it should be $\approx -5$ . What am I misunderstanding please? library(rjags) load.module("glm") mod
