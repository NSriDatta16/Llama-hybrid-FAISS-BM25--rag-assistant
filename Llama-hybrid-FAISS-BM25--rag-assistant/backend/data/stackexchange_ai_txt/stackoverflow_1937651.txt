If you're trying to stop people from subverting a license scheme by setting the clock back, you need to store the highest time you've seen so far in some sort of encrypted and secure storage, and then disable the program if either the time goes less than the highest you've seen (with some allowance for NTP clock adjustments and DST changes of course), or if they somehow tamper with or delete the secure store.
