I have seen this with the web application we are supporting - a stray GET request out of the blue for an already logged in user, wrecking the server-side state and resulting in an error on the subsequent legitimate POST request. Since in our case the URLs use URL-rewriting attaching sessionid to the URL such GETs would also sometimes have old sessionid. In the specific log file that lead to nailing this issue these stray requests had the agent string different (though valid) from the rest in the same session. I am convinced that rather than the browser itself it's some plugin/extension. There is a possibility that a proxy does it or even malware. We overcame this particular problem by forbidding GET requests to the URI in question. However, now I am dealing with a similar problem where a POST request appears out of nowhere where it shouldn't and the only difference is in the "accept" header.
