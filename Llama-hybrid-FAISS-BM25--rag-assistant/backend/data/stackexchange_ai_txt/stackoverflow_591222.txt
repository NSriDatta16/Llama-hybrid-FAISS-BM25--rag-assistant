Cannot connect to SQL Server remotely or locally after reboot

After some network maintenance last weekend, we had some trouble with our development server which led to us restart it. Some updates were installed during the restart, which may or may not have been a factor. Since then, we have been unable to connect to SQL Server 2005, even locally via Management Studio. Depending on the protocol used for the connection attempt, we get one of the following two errors: When you try to connect to the instance by using the named pipes protocol or the shared memory protocol, you receive the following error message: No process is on the other end of the pipe. When you try to connect to the instance by using the TCP/IP protocol, you receive the following error message: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. The aforementioned protocols are all enabled, and the SQL services are all running happily (apart from the SQL Server Agent, which cannot connect to SQL Server either). We also checked the Surface Area Configuration tool to ensure it accepts connections. It's not a certificates problem (as seen online) as we don't use encrypted connections. Any suggestions? Otherwise we will probably resort to a full reinstall. ** UPDATE ** Further clues: We can connect to Integration Services, but nothing else We can connect to the instance of SQL Server Embedded Edition running on the same server
