This is a very good question and +1 for keeping the Magento wording in your CSS ! What I personnally do in order not to confuse developpers that may use my module is that I create a skin subfolder dedicated to the module. This way, it will be whether easy to find and cut/paste its css rules and images in the right theme folder whether running correctly for non experimented users. 1- Create the folder and files architecture Like : /skin/frontend/default/default/[your_module_name]/css/styles.css /skin/frontend/default/default/[your_module_name]/images/ (containing all your module's images) 2- Edit your /skin/frontend/default/default/[your_module_name]/css/styles.css ...as usual but containing only CSS classes related to your module, ie : .block-myblock .block-title strong { background-image:url(../images/i_block-myblock.gif); } 3- Call the CSS file from the layout XML of your module Open, let's say /app/design/frontend/default/default/layout/[your_module_name].xml and add the following lines after the first opening node like this : skin_css [your_module_name]/css/styles.css . . . This should work while being respectful of Magento standards, not polluting existing themes and giving no headaches to developpers who wish to fully merge your skin with theirs.
