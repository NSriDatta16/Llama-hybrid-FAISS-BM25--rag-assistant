I'd have the question of what part of IT does he really want as there are more than a few different parts: Project Manager - Perhaps as a creative director he oversaw projects and can handle schedules and budgets, but this is a part of IT. Quality Analyst - Testing can be a common entry point as while this does require attention to detail, there aren't a lot of technical skills like a developer would have. Tech Support/help desk - Instead of trying out something, one has to handle given problems and give solutions to people. Business Analyst - While this is a bit of a decoding job, his advertising background may be useful in knowing how some people would like a system to work. System Administrator - If he wants the power trip of being given big responsibility and deal with possible bureaucracies. Those are a few possibilities where he has to figure out which role he wants, what is he prepared to do to fit that role well and why he should get that entry level job in IT.
