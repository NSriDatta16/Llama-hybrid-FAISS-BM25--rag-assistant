Principal components regression vs other regression models following PCA

My understanding of principal components regression (PCR) is that it is a linear regression performed on all or a subset of predictors obtained via PCA. All the resources I've read only apply linear regression following the PCA step, but I've found nothing that explicitly warns against using other regression models. Does the regression model in PCR always have to be linear/OLS or can we use other GLM regression models (such as logistic, Poisson, or negative binomial regression)?
