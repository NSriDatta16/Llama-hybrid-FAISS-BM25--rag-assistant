The Art Of Computer Programming Vol.2 Chapter 3 has all the different methods used. I highly recommend reading the entire chapter. The simplest and most obvious method is by using the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF): $F^{-1}(p)$, which is also the quantile function. Generate uniform random numbers and plug them into the inverse CDF, you'll get what you're looking for. This is what I usually do in Excel NORMS.INV(RAND()) , because I'm too lazy to code Box-Mueller myself. This is not the method used for Normal distribution. For "named" distributions, such as gaussian, there are often more efficient methods e.g. Box-Mueller. Inverse CDF computation can be expensive, because rarely you have the closed form expressions. There are, of course, approximations, such as this for Gaussian inverse CDF. In contrast, Box Muller approach uses certain properties of Gaussian distribution to reduce the algorithm to calculation of closed form expressions using square root, log and sine functions, all of which are implemented in the transcendental function modules of CPUs these days. The specialized random number generators will exploit special features of the distributions to get performance or precision edge over the generic method described above. A very different approach is used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. I'm not getting into this unless it's what you're looking for.
