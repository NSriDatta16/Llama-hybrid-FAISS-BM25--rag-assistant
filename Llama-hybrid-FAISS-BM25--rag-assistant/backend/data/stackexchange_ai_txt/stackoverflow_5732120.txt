GWT image cropping vs. drag'n'drop problem in browser

Using GWT, I am displaying an image on the web page and my goal is to allow the user to crop it. The user draws an imaginary boundary box by clicking on a specific part of the image, moving the mouse, and releasing it somewhere else. With the use of MouseDownHandler() and MouseUpHandler() , I am planning to record the start and end corners of the mouse cursor. However, when I deploy my work on the web, there is this problem: When the user clicks on the image and tries to draw the imaginary bounding box, the web browser (Google Chrome in my case) detects it as a drag and drop operation. Therefore, I cannot get my mouseDown() and mouseUp() functions to work. How can I avoid the browser to do a drag and drop operation? The code: public void onModuleLoad(){ RootPanel.get().add(img1); img1.addMouseDownHandler(new MouseDownHandler() { @Override public void onMouseDown(MouseDownEvent event) { startX = event.getX(); startY = event.getY(); } }); img1.addMouseUpHandler(new MouseUpHandler() { @Override public void onMouseUp(MouseUpEvent event) { endX = event.getX(); endY = event.getY(); img1.setVisibleRect(startX, startY, endX-startX, endY-startY); } }); }
