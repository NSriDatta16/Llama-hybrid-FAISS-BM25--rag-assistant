Provide step by step multi-option instructions in MediaWiki pages

We have a wiki page in MediaWiki with instructions like this: complete instruction 1 also in case A do this complete instruction 2 also in case B do this complete instruction 3 etc Is there a way to show just the lines / paragraphs in which we are interested? E.g. someone could show all rows or hide certain rows, preferably at the touch of a button. I assume it is some combination of tables, ToggleDisplay and templates but I don't know more than that. Any else know?
