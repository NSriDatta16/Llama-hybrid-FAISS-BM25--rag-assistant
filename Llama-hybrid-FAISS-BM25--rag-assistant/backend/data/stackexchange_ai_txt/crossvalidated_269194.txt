It can be useful to call linear regression machine learning because doing so generally implies a couple important things about how you went about solving your problem: You decided it wasn't necessary to check causal assumptions and prior theory behind your explanatory variables. It signals that your model was not intended to explain but to predict. This is perfectly reasonable in a lot of settings, for example, predicting email spam based on keywords. There isn't really a lot of literature on which words predict spam, and there are so many words it doesn't make sense to think through the theoretical significance of each word You didn't check for variable significance or use p-values but instead likely opted for a holdout set or cross validation to assess out-of-sample predictive performance. This can be perfectly valid if - back to the email spam example - if really all you care about is producing a model that effectively predicts spam, even if this comes at at the cost of including variables that might not pass traditional significance tests. However, if your model is more intended to explain than predict, and you do rigorously check your model's theoretical causal assumptions, etc then yes, it is rather silly to call it machine learning.
