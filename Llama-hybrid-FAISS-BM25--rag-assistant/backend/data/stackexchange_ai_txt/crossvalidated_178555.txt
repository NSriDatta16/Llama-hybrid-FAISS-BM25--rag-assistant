Standardizing data (mean = 0, SD = 1) while avoiding look-ahead bias

I'm running a predictive model. Over 60 months, every month I get a median value from a data set. To avoid look-ahead bias, I can only use the current and prior median values found up until this current month. I need to standardise the current median value every month to have a mean = 0 and std.dev = 1. The formula I use in excel is: =IFERROR((A1-AVERAGE(A$1:A1))/STDEV.P(A$1:N1),0) Since the average and stdev values used in the formula are not based on the entire sample of 60 months' data, the standardisation is not perfect. But how else can this be achieved if look-ahead bias is to be avoided?
