Drag & Drop involving accordion panes (VB/ASP)

I have an accordion control in ASP 3.5, with multiple accordion panes. For the sake of simplicity, I will only focus on one pane as the problem is pane specific. Using JQuery, I created a draggable function and applied it to my .drag CSS class. On Page_Load, I create a bunch of image objects and assign that class to them, in addition to an image. Once I load the page, I can drag all the images around as intended. What I can't do, however, is drag those images outside of the accordion panel they were created in! Is there a way around that? I tried using this, but to no avail: $(function () { $(".drag").draggable({ containment: 'document' }); }); Is there something in the actual aspx page that I should be focusing on? I'm adding the images to a panel in my accordion pane, and it looks like this: Chassis I appreciate any guidance!
