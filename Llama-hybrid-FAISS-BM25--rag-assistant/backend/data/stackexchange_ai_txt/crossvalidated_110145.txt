Random Forest Usage

Random Forest Usage: I have run random forest in R. It gave me confusion matrix and variable importance. Variable importance can be used to rank importance of variables in the model. My question is how i can use random forest for classification, like decision tree. I have also run decision tree. It gave me RULES to classify my data. Can random forest produce same classification? Or any kind of classification criteria? Did i miss something in random forest code?
