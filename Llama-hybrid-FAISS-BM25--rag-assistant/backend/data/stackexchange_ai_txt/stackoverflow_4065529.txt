Lawnchair is optional with PhoneGap projects - it doesn't depend on PhoneGap, nor vice versa. It's a thin wrapper around the native storage APIs for each platform, including SQLite. Because it doesn't do a whole lot, there isn't much of a performance hit - the benefit is that you have a unified API to lots of different data stores. One thing to note is that Lawnchair is a strictly key value based store - with the SQLite adapater, for instance, it sets up a single Lawnchair table with two fields (key and value). If you have a large relational dataset, you may want to use the SQLite APIs directly rather than switching to a key-value interface.
