The Data Contract Serializer used by default in WCF does not support XML attributes for performance reasons (the DCS is about 10% faster on average than the XML serializer). So if you really want to use the DCS, you cannot use this structure you have - it would have to be changed. Or you need to use the XmlSerializer with WCF, as Greg showed in his answer - that works, too, but you lose the performance benefit (plus all other benefits) of the DCS.
