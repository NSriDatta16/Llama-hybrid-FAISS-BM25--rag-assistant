Knowing what exogenous variable cause quasi-separation

I'm trying to build a classifier using a logistic regression and statsmodel is telling me that there is an issue of quasi-separation. Well this isn't an issue! This is exactly what i'm trying to do: predicting the Endogenous Variable using the Exogenous Variable! The real problem is that i can't find the output telling me what variable cause it and what are the associated values. Can anyone hint me where to find that? Here is my error message Possibly complete quasi-separation: A fraction 0.62 of observations can be perfectly predicted. This might indicate that there is complete quasi-separation. In this case some parameters will not be identified. I'm using Python 3.4 and statsmodel 0.6.1
