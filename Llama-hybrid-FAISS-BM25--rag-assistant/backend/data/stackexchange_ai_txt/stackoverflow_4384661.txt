It is quite possible that whatever automated analysis that Google does on the ads submitted is being confused by the Flex framework. You could try creating an ActionScript project instead of Flex project in Flash builder and see if that makes any difference. If you use an ActionScript project you won't be able to use MXML for creating the ad, but you might not really even want to drag in the Flex framework, since it takes a while to load (the first time at least).
