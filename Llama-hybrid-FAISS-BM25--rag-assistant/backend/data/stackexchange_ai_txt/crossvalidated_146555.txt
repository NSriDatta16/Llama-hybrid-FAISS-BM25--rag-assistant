My goal is simply to ... find statistically significant predictive results. Also, is there a particular market you would look at (energy, rates, equities)? Most if not all the established and liquid financial markets will be very hard to predict whatever model you will use. If markets were relatively easy to predict, market participant would try to exploit that to make money. By doing that they would eliminate the predictability. This brings a contradiction, and thus the markets are not easy to predict. Lastly, is GARCH only used for forecasting volatility? The professor I mentioned seemed to suggest I should turn toward GARCH or ARIMA-GARCH models to model stock returns. I read some papers that seemed to imply it could also be used for actual returns... GARCH model is used for modelling the conditional variance of the disturbance term of the conditional mean model for a dependent variable $y_t$. E.g. if you have a conditional mean model $y_t=\alpha+\epsilon_t$, the GARCH model will describe the conditional variance of $\epsilon_t$. Sometimes the conditional mean model is "empty" ($y_t=\epsilon_t$), then GARCH model is used to model the conditional variance of $y_t$ itself. Even if you are primarily interested in the conditional mean model (e.g. you want to predict stock returns using an ARMA model), a GARCH model combined with a model for the conditional mean can be useful. If the conditional variance of the dependent variable is time-varying, that should be accounted for, and a GARCH model does exactly that. If a time-varying conditional variance is neglected, the conditional mean model may (and likely will) be invalid. Would the AR and MA components in an ARIMA-GARCH model differ from those in an ARMA model? Yes. That also illustrates my last remark above. From what I vaguely understood, ARIMA and GARCH are two completely separate things (with the former being used to predict the actual time series and the other to predict its volatility). This is true. But as I have already explained, the two models can work together nicely.
