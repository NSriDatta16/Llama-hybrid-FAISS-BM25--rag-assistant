What kind of descriptor should I use for seal cub detection?

I have a project to detect and count seal cubs (the animal) in an aerial image which is taken from beach. The seal cubs are black and small compared to adult seals which are brown and large. Some seal cubs are overlapped/partly occluded. The beach color is near yellow however there're some black rocks that increase the detection difficulty. What kind of descriptor is most suitable for my project? HOG, SIFT, Haar-like features? I'm asking for the theory part of this problem. I think to implement my project, the first step should be choose correct descriptor that can most represent the object, then (combine several weak features, not necessary?) train a classifier using machine learning method like boosting/SVM/neural_network, am I right?
