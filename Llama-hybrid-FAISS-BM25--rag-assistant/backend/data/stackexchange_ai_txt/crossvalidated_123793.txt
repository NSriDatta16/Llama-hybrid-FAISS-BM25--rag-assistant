combining subjective probability estimates and statistical estimates for forecasting

At the end of the year forecasters usually struggle year to predict landing estimate for the financial year due to variety of reasons including volatility, unreliable demand projections, inventory control etc. . For example: a statistical method based on time series extrapolation would say we would end up at 100 - 110 Million Dollars. There is always going to be subjective/judgmental involved in forecasting. A judgmental forecast would end up in between 115 - 125 Millions. This year we plan to use a cool tool called Subjective Probability Interval Estimate (SPIES) which was recently published in Harvard Business Review that provides us the confidence interval of subjective estimates and we plan to collect year end estimates from multiple stake holders (Example: Marketing/Finance/Sales Force). As an example lets say we have 3 forecast, the first generated by a statistcal method, the second and third generated by SPIES tool from above: Statsitcal Forecast: 100 - 110 Judgmental Forecast 1: 115 - 125 Judgmental forecast 2: 95 - 105 My Questions is two fold: Is it possible to combine the interval estimates from the forecast above ? Would Averaging the low and upper intervals work ? If yes, how should I go about it ? Many Thanks for your help.
