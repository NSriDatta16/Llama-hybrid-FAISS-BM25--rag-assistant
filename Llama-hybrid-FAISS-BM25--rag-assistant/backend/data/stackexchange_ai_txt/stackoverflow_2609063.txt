Communication between .net winform and webform

I need to make a webform communicate with a winform and back to the webform. The reason for this is it exists a webform software already made, and now it's needed the behavior of a .net component only available for winforms. We've tried going with Process.Start and shell.execute but with this approach the software hangs or it takes too long to respond. The webform also needs to be called from client pcs in the network, I think this adds another problem due to the non possibility of calling the execution of a file from a webform remotelly, but I dont know much about this technical issue we've read some articles about embedding a winform in a webform, sending data from a winform to a webform, etc. and we would like to know what's the recommend approach (if there is any) for handdling a situation like this.
