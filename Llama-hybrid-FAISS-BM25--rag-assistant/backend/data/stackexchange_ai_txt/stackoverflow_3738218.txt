Windows and I believe Unix/Linux, allows this, and in the early days, when RAM was limited, encouraged it use. However, this was a trade-off between conserving memory, and preserving memory protection. As memory addressing ranges grew, and RAM became cheap, it was largely decided that it wasn't worth the trouble. (In Win16, I believe doing this was the default; under Win32, it requires some manual steps to use it) In some specialized environments (embedded systems for example), it may still be worthwhile (but embedded system rarely need to run two copies of the same app) UPDATE: In Windows, you can have a resource-only DLL, which can be marked "shared". That's probably the best way to handle what you want.
