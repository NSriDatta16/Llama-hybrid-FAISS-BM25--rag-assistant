@Colin HEBERT has answered this. I'd just like to point out a possible source of the OP's confusion. There are actually two different relations here: the EQ relation (i.e. x.equals(y) == true ) is transitive. the NE relation (i.e. x.equals(y) == false ) is NOT transitive. Furthermore, the transitivity property only allows you to reason about to chains involving one relation; i.e. x EQ y && y EQ Z implies x EQ Z . The question tries to use transitivity to reason about x NE y && y EQ z ... and it doesn't apply to that case.
