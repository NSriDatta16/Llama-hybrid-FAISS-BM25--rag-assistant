Having trouble developing accurate CNN architectures

This has always perplexed me and I haven't been able to find helpful resources online. So I'm working with image analysis and wonder if there are any rule of thumbs for setting up a CNN depending on what you plan to accomplish. You have the MNIST dataset which works well with 2Conv2FC layers. Then you could attempt to analyze more complicated images or try to look for certain features within images. At my current state, I really wouldn't know how to start these problems. Is it just trial and error?
