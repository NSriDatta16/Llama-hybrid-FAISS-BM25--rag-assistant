Well, I'd store them as six digit hex codes. That opens up the interesting possibility of actually searching for colors between other colors. If you really want to make it powerful, keep the R, G, B hex numbers in three columns. That lets you find colors which contain so much red, or ones that are similar to another color (sort by average difference of the three values).
