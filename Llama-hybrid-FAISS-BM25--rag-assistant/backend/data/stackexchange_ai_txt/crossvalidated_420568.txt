This is an example of an experiment where interventions are assigned by cluster (school). Of they were assigned in a randomized fashion, it's a cluster randomized trial, which would simplify the analysis (you do not need to worry about the rather choice being based on expected outcomes). There are whole books on this topic (e.g. "Cluster Randomised Trials" by Hayes and Moulton). It seems e.g. a model (e.g. ANCOVA or non parametric) on the summary outcomes by cluster works well for few clusters, while with many clusters a mixed effects model with a random cluster effect (e.g. logistic regression) is a good choice.
