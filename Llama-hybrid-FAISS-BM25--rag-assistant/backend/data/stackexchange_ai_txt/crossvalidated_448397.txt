The two major limitations of PCA: 1) It assumes linear relationship between variables. 2) The components are much harder to interpret than the original data. If the limitations outweigh the benefit, one should not use it; hence, pca should not always be used. IMO, it is better to not use PCA, unless there is a good reason to.
