Efficient storage of binary files in a git repository

I would like to have a git repository that consists mainly of binary files. I need to keep track of the changed, added and removed files to the repository, but I don't want for git to version the content of the files themselves. In other words, I just need for git to keep track of changes (change log), but not the content. Is this even possible with git? Should I be using something else for this?
