First, there's no reason to not call it a "dataset". There is no universally agreed upon term(s) for "fake" vs "simulated" vs ... data. If the goal is to be completely clear, it's best to actually devote a sentence, rather than a word, to qualify what this dataset is. After that, you can relax the designation and just refer to your data as data. "Synthetic", "artificial" does not distinguish from other MCMC sampled "simulated" datasets in my mind. Using a quasirandom number generator with a fixed seed (as proper training would dictate) also creates a synthetic or artificial dataset. If the point of curating a dataset for a specific illustration, rather than generating an instance or realization from a probability model, I think it's better to call such a dataset an " example dataset ". Data like these are akin to Anscombe's quartet: totally abstract and not-plausible, but meant to illustrate a point.
