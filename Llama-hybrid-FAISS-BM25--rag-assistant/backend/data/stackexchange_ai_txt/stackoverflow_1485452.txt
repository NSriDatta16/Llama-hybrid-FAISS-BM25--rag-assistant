I began using Trac when I began working with another developer on an application. Its a great way to assign tasks, track bugs and features, versions, etc. I am using along with Subversion. Like many others have mentioned, you need a way to assign jobs, track bugs, and of course version control, which is critical. Communication is paramount! Email, upcoming Google Wave, a free IRC server, something that is readily accessible and your peers will use. Everyone needs to be on the same page, nothing worse than working on a feature or block of code to find out that someone else has been addressing the same issue. Good luck! It is quite an different atmosphere when you are leading and managing. Be open to suggestions from the team.
