I would recommend you the " Dragon book ": Compilers, Principles-Techniques-Tools from Aho, Sethi and Ullman. (It is rather expensive to buy but you for sure will find it in a library). There you will find anything you will need to parse strings and build finite automatons. There is no place I could find with a goto . Usually the states are a data table and transitions are functions like accept_space()
