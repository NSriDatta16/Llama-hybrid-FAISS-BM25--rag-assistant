No, Perl doesn't have an inbuilt "diff" facility. Either you use an external module, or use Perl's data structures(hashes, arrays etc) or you create filehandles for both files, and iterate the files using the filehandle (while loops), comparing them line by line. This method assumes your files are sorted. Another not so elegant way is to call "diff" from Perl, but I advise against that. Lastly, if Perl is not a must, just use the Unix diff utility (write a shell script).
