Can deep belief networks be applied to sparse feature vectors/classification problems?

I am trying to beat the performance of an SVM classifier in a text classification task. Input is a bag of words model of sentences with 1 representing presence and 0 representing absence. Output is 1 of 4 possible labels. Are DBNs directly applicable to this class of problems? I get an error of 0.38 on the test set and I could not make it any better. Please refer me to papers/posts where I can find similar problems/applications.
