Unless your software is security related, I think a better approach would to change your licensing plan to make the software free for home users that barely use the software and expensive for organizations. Organizations rarely use cracked software, due to the legal issues, where as home users that are occasional users don't like to spend $100s for using the software once in a while. This would take away the motivation of crackers to crack the software.
