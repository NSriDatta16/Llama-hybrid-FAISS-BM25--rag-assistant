OK, so you're asking for opinions here.... I would choice any other storage mechanism over simpledb. For example, you could easily go with MongoDB as a document storage alternative to a relational DB and get more benefits than with SimpleDB. As far as wanting a short unique URL, you can search and find a ruby implementation to turn an ID into a shorted ID. http://blog.kischuk.com/2008/06/23/create-tinyurl-like-urls-in-ruby/ That implementation will turn 1174229 into "7sH_" (according to the post. YMMV) So, you'd have something like class Survey include Mongoid::Document def to_param generate_url(self.id) end end in routes resources :surverys, :path=>'' And that would create http://yourapp/7sh_ Of course this technique can work for non-mongo installs.
