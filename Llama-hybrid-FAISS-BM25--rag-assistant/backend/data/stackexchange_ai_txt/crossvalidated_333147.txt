Finding the mean of right-censored values

I wanted to check how fast an average colleague of mine is able to complete a puzzle, so I ran some experiments. The problem is they weren't done in exactly 50 minutes, I always got bored and moved on to the next person. Hence my data is right-censored at 50. Let's say it looks like this: Aaron: 34 Betty: X Cecil: X Dave: 18 Elias: 47 Fredric: 39 Greta: 37 Howard: X Ingrid: X Joy: 29 Kristine: 34 Lou: 32 Margret: X Nigel: 40 An X means that they did not complete it in 50 minutes. How do I use this data to find how fast on average person in my company is in completing the puzzle? To be more clear: How do I find the mean or the median of the above data with a bootstrap confidence interval? I don't want to just throw out the data where the person did not complete the task within 50 minutes, but I don't know how to incorporate those data points in my analysis.
