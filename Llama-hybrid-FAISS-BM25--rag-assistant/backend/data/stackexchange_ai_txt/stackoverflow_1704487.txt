Algorithm to flatten peak usage over time?

I have an environment that serves many devices spread across 3 time zones by receiving and sending data during the wee hours of the night. The distribution of these devices was determined pseudo-randomly based on an identification number and a simple calculation using a modulo operation. The result of such a calculation creates an unnecessary artificial peak which consumes more resources than I'd like during certain hours of the night. As part of our protocol I can instruct devices when to connect to our system on subsequent nights. I am seeking an algorithm which can generally distribute the peak into a more level line (albeit generally higher at most times) or at least a shove in the right direction - meaning what sort of terminology should I spend my time reading about. I have available to me identification numbers for devices, the current time, and the device's time zone as inputs for performing calculation. I can also perform some up front analytical calculations to create pools from which to draw slots from, though I feel this approach may be less elegant than I am hoping for (though a learning algorithm may not be a bad thing...). (Ultimately and somewhat less relevant I will be implementing this algorithm using C#.)
