A lot of MSDN examples and Visual Studio itself encourage the "smart form" antipattern where you drag stuff on the canvas and wire up some small code and you have a working something. They are aiming at easy entry-level without a lot of complications with this stuff. It would be more optimal is to have a worker thread to do anything IO intensive and keep your GUI responsive (unless the goal is to get something working in 10 minutes).
