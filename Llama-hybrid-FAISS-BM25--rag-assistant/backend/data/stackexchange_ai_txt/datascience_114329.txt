You need some form of untouched data to give a true representation of how your pipeline will perform in production. Once you use your holdout set to tune the threshold, you no longer have a holdout set. Use your CV on your train data to tune this threshold - do final checks on holdout. I would encourage you to plot your thresholds/probabilities - then fine-tune the threshold to solve your business problem. For example, if you really don't want False positives - choose your metrics appropriately -> and therefore your thresholds.
