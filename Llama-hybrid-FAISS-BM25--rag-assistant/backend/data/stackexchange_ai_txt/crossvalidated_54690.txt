Kriging with with an anisotropic variogram would seem to fit your case. Kriging calculates the values at the new to-be-interpolated locations as a weighted average. The kriging weights are based on the covariance structure of the observations (captured by the variogram model), where in general observations that are closer to the to-be-estimated location get a higher weight. When using an anisotropic variogram model, the covariance structure varies per direction, e.g. in a north-south direction an observation would get a higher/lower weight than an observation at a similar distance in the east-west direction. Practically, I know that gstat supports anisotropic variogram models. You can use gstat as a stand alone program, although I greatly prefer the interface it has with R. See this tutorial of using gstat in R for more details, including an example of how to fit an anisotropic variogram model.
