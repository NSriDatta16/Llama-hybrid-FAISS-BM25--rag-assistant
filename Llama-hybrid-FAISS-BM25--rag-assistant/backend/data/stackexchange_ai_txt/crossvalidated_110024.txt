This isn't really an answer , but a report on 'what I did in the end'. I would very much appreciate it if those who kindly provided the answers above would glance over the following text and see if it's "ok". User whuber suggested considering each combination of techniques in turn, but in what follows, I've opted just to consider each technique individually. It feels much simpler to me, and simplicity is what I'm aiming for, but I would be interested to know if it's still statistically sound. Here is what I wrote... To give a rough idea of the relative effectiveness of each technique, we perform a logistic regression analysis. The four techniques provide four binomial input variables, while the output variable is the success rate for each task. Since the success rates are quite low, a Poisson model is appropriate. In the following table, we gather the coefficients of this model. The standard deviations are around a couple of percent, so we give the figures to one decimal place. $$ \begin{array}{lrrrr} & \mbox{Task $1$} & \mbox{Task $2$} & \mbox{Task $3$} & \mbox{Task $4$} \\ (intercept) & 3.6 & -17.1 & 4.3 & -17.1 \\ \mbox{Technique $Z$} & 0.5 & 23.2 & 1.8 & 23.3 \\ \mbox{Technique $A$} & 2.7 & -1.4 & -0.4 & -1.6 \\ \mbox{Technique $B$} & 1.1 & 2.5 & 2.3 & 2.5 \\ \mbox{Technique $C$} & 1.6 & 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.5 \\ \end{array} $$ The smaller the coefficient, the less the technique contributes to the success rate; indeed, when the coefficient is negative, the technique is actually a hindrance. The `intercept' coefficients represent the success rate averaged across all techniques. In summary, we find that Technique $Z$ has by far the highest impact, and that Technique $A$ tend to decrease the success rate except when performing Task $1$. Techniques $B$ and $C$ are consistently helpful. This is the R script I ran in order to justify the text above It's just a slightly modified version of whuber's script. technique And this is the data that running that script produces: ======================== Task 1 ====================== Actual Mean SD Z p Min Max (Intercept) 3.563 3.565 0.032 111.734 0 3.480 3.641 A 0.471 0.470 0.009 50.772 0 0.449 0.493 B 2.693 2.692 0.025 106.485 0 2.633 2.761 C 1.103 1.102 0.012 89.164 0 1.062 1.133 D 1.556 1.556 0.015 107.043 0 1.512 1.598 ======================== Task 2 ====================== Actual Mean SD Z p Min Max (Intercept) -17.104 -17.105 0.022 -760.229 0 -17.174 -17.048 A 23.216 23.220 0.017 1402.716 0 23.187 23.268 B -1.403 -1.400 0.021 -68.192 0 -1.454 -1.329 C 2.454 2.451 0.028 86.965 0 2.383 2.519 D 0.220 0.221 0.014 15.949 0 0.189 0.260 ======================== Task 3 ====================== Actual Mean SD Z p Min Max (Intercept) 4.253 4.255 0.023 181.558 0 4.198 4.308 A 1.789 1.786 0.018 98.931 0 1.742 1.832 B -0.406 -0.404 0.013 -31.285 0 -0.444 -0.369 C 2.342 2.341 0.020 116.633 0 2.292 2.395 D 0.574 0.573 0.011 49.948 0 0.538 0.595 ======================== Task 4 ====================== Actual Mean SD Z p Min Max (Intercept) -17.066 -17.068 0.019 -906.664 0 -17.120 -17.020 A 23.268 23.269 0.014 1673.551 0 23.241 23.307 B -1.621 -1.619 0.019 -84.484 0 -1.672 -1.571 C 2.451 2.452 0.024 102.533 0 2.403 2.504 D 0.480 0.479 0.015 32.899 0 0.447 0.515
