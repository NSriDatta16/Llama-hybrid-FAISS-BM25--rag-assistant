since an employee can be in only one department, the average number of employees is just the total # of employees over the total number of departments. So how about: SELECT dept.name, COUNT(emp.id) AS employeeCount FROM emp INNER JOIN dept ON emp.deptId = dept.id GROUP BY dept.name HAVING (COUNT(emp.id) > (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emp) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dept))
