credible intervals for functions of hyperparameters

If I have a statistic $\nu(x, y)$ which is a function of hyperparameters (say just two for ease of explanation) $x$ and $y$ of a distribution $F(t|x , y)$ and associated prior $g(x,y)$ which is the proper way to compute $\alpha \%$ credible interval for $\nu\left(x_m,y_m\right)$ around the "mode" MLE value of $g(x,y)$ which occurs at $\left(x_{m},y_{m}\right)$ Identify two curves/loops $y(x)$ which have sub-maximum likelihood values of $\alpha/2$ and $\left(1-\alpha/2\right)$ and for each compute the line-integral average value of $\nu_{\alpha/2}(x,y(x))$ and $\nu_{\left(1-\alpha/2\right)}(x,y(x))$ Using the likelihood distribution $g(x,y)$ to compute the 1-D distribution $h\left(\nu\right)$ and then pick of values from the CDF $H(\nu=\alpha/2)$ and $H(\nu=1-\alpha/2)$. Will $\nu \left(x_m, y_m \right)$ necessarily occupy any special place in the distribution $h\left(\nu\right)$, like its mean, median, or mode? which is correct? Or is something else the correct way?
