It is for this very reason I switched from ASP.NET to developing in Silverlight and leveraging its MVVM pattern. Even with ASP.NET's GridView item templates, each item cannot be directly bound to, be made aware of, or reference another item in the same template. Your code behind must know, to some degree (which usually is the fullest), the composition hierarchy of your view controls. Here's what you could do to get closer to the "better binding world" though. You would still bind your combo boxes to the same list data sources, but when each row of items/controls is created, you would associate each item with an object (i.e. tag item). Then in your controls' event handling, you would retrieve other controls associated with the tag item associated with the control that raised the event and do what you will with them. I know, not the best idea, but just off the top of my head. Maybe when I've had time to think more on this I can update this post.
