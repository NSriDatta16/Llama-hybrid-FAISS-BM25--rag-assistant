Findbugs using jsr305 annotations in eclipse is not finding bugs

I've been experimenting with the jsr 305 annotations for use with Findbugs, specifically the @CheckForNull annotation which would have avoided a bug I just found making it out to customers. I've added jsr305.jar and annotations.jar to my build path but the bugs aren't found by findbugs. I'm using Eclipse with the Eclipse Findbugs plugin. Below is some sample code which shows the same bug but doesn't when I run findbugs over it find the bug. I have tried this in Eclipse Galileo and Ganymede. public class FindBugsAnnotationsTest { ArrayList canBeNull; @CheckForNull public List getCanBeNull() { return canBeNull; } public void shouldGetFindbugsWarning() { canBeNull.add("a string"); getCanBeNull().add("a string"); } }
