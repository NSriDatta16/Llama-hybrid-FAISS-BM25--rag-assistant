This Stack Overflow question contains some anserws which could be helpful: What is the best third-party WinForms grid for .NET? You could try Syncfusion's grid , which allows cell merging. Merged cells allow users to display adjoining cells with like values as a single cell. The merging is dynamic. If a cell's value changes, the grid will automatically adjust the merged cells. alt text http://www.syncfusion.com/products/Grid/Windows/features/General_Features/images/gridmergedcells.png Or the XtraGrid (DevExpress) : You can enhance data readability by using the automatic cell merging feature of the XtraGrid. When enabled, neighboring column cells that have identical values are merged into a single cell. If a column is sorted, cell merging has the effect of grouping data - the number of cells within the column will match the number of unique values it holds. (source: devexpress.com )
