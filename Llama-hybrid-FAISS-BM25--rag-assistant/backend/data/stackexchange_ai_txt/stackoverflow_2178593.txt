Integrating Magento with SAP ECC 6.0 Backend

I'm a freshly graduated (read: inexperienced) developer who's been tasked with determining the feasibility of integrating Magento with an SAP-based backend. No developer at our company has any experience working with either SAP or Magento, so I was hoping that the Stack Overflow community may be able to point me in the right direction with my research. We're a small company (four full-time developers) and the timeline on this project would be tight, so I'm trying to gather as much information as possible. The client has a tiered pricing structure, tax calculation logic, promotional deals, and automatic freight determination all implemented in an SAP ECC 6.0 system. They would like to migrate all their online stores over to Magento while continuing to utilize all existing functionality in SAP. The idea is to accomplish this by overriding certain modules in Magento to place remote calls to SAP BAPIs. I've investigated SAPRFC , which looks promising but relatively stale in terms of update frequency. Do any developers have experience using SAPRFC with SAP ECC 6.0 (with or without Magento integration)? If so, what were your experiences, and what were the biggest risk factors involved? Any comments, suggestions, or links to resources would be greatly appreciated.
