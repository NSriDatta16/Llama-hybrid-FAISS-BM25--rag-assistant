Although I honestly recommend Lekensteyn's answer, there's also another solution. Your mod_rewrite rule basically moves /brochure.phpcat_path=123 to /brochure/123 . You can simply fix your relative URLs and set the correct path. Your must understand that these paths are parsed by the browser so the actual server file system structure has nothing to do with it. E.g.: css/style.css will become ../css/style.css
