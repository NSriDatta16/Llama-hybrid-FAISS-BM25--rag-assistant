How do you organise/layout your test scripts

I'm interested in how others organise their test scripts or have seen good test scripts organised anywhere they've worked. Also, what level of detail is in those test scripts. This specifically relates to test scripts created for manual testing as opposed to those created for any automated test purposes. The problem as I see it is this, there is a lot of complexity in test scripts but without the benefit of the principles used in organising a complex or large code base. You need to be able to specify what a piece of code should do but without boring someone to death as they read it. Also, How do you layout test scripts, I'm not keen to create fully specified scripts suitable to be run by data entry types as that isn't the team we have and the overhead of maintaining them seems too high. Also, it feels to me that specifying the process in such detail removes responsibility from the person actually doing the testing for the quality of the product. Do people specify every button click and value to be entered? If not then what level of detail is specified.
