Got a scrollable div, draggables still get dropped on hidden elements?

ok i've got a scrollable div, but when i drag my draggable outside of that overflowed div and try and drop it on a different drop zone. it gets dropped onto the hidden elements underneath the drop zone i want it to get applied to. is there any to give the drop that i can see "priority" ?
