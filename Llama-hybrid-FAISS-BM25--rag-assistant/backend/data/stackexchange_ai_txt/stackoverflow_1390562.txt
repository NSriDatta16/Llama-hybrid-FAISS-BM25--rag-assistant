Framebuffer Objects (FBO) are just a basic tool that cannot be used to manipulate images directly. If you know how to render your image manipulations in OpenGL to the screen, you can then use FBOs to render them off-screen. So they are in fact useful for this task, since you are not limited by the resolution of your screen and don't have to distract the user with thousands of flashing images. However, the manipulation itself happens in OpenGL, probably in the fragment shader. Visit to the OpenGL forum to get some advice how to start with OpenGL basics. They also have quite a few links to sample code .
