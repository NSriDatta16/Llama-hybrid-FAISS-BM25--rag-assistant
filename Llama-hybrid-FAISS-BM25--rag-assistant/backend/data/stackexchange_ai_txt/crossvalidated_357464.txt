Zero Centering Data

Does zero centering your data make it more linearly separable or does that not affect the separability? I read that by zero-centering the data, it allows algorithms to train faster because small changes in the features shift the decision to one side or the other. For example, with zero-centered data using logistic regression, a small change would shift the point to one of the side of the sigmoid.
