How can I measure noise-reduction after applying an autoencoder?

In my setting I have 21 numerical features (and ten thousands of rows) and I assume that they are noisy measurements of the real features. In order to learn the real features I think about applying an autoencoder. I thought about adding one hidden layer with 6 hidden layers. Then I would apply 21 output layers to reconstruct the features. The final aim is to use the features in a binary classification model. How can I measure the noise reduction - the gain from applying the autoencoder - in this setting (besiders fitting my model and observing the accuracy)?
