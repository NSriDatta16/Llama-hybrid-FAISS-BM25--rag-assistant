Well you can use parse_url to get the host: $info = parse_url($url); $host = $info['host']; Then, you can do some fancy stuff to get only the TLD and the Host $host_names = explode(".", $host); $bottom_host_name = $host_names[count($host_names)-2] . "." . $host_names[count($host_names)-1]; Not very elegant, but should work. If you want an explanation, here it goes: First we grab everything between the scheme ( http:// , etc), by using parse_url 's capabilities to... well.... parse URL's. :) Then we take the host name, and separate it into an array based on where the periods fall, so test.world.hello.myname would become: array("test", "world", "hello", "myname"); After that, we take the number of elements in the array (4). Then, we subtract 2 from it to get the second to last string (the hostname, or example , in your example) Then, we subtract 1 from it to get the last string (because array keys start at 0), also known as the TLD Then we combine those two parts with a period, and you have your base host name.
