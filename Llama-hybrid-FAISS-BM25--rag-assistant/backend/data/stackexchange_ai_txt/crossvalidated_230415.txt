Is there any *mathematical* basis for the Bayesian vs frequentist debate?

It says on Wikipedia that: the mathematics [of probability] is largely independent of any interpretation of probability. Question: Then if we want to be mathematically correct, shouldn't we disallow any interpretation of probability? I.e., are both Bayesian and frequentism mathematically incorrect? I don't like philosophy, but I do like math, and I want to work exclusively within the framework of Kolmogorov's axioms. If this is my goal, should it follow from what it says on Wikipedia that I should reject both Bayesianism and frequentism? If the concepts are purely philosophical and not at all mathematical, then why do they appear in statistics in the first place? Background/Context: This blog post doesn't quite say the same thing, but it does argue that attempting to classify techniques as "Bayesian" or "frequentist" is counter-productive from a pragmatic perspective. If the quote from Wikipedia is true, then it seems like from a philosophical perspective attempting to classify statistical methods is also counter-productive -- if a method is mathematically correct, then it is valid to use the method when the assumptions of the underlying mathematics hold, otherwise, if it is not mathematically correct or if the assumptions do not hold, then it is invalid to use it. On the other hand, a lot of people seem to identify "Bayesian inference" with probability theory (i.e. Kolmogorov's axioms), although I'm not quite sure why. Some examples are Jaynes's treatise on Bayesian inference called "Probability", as well as James Stone's book "Bayes' Rule". So if I took these claims at face value, that means I should prefer Bayesianism. However, Casella and Berger's book seems like it is frequentist because it discusses maximum likelihood estimators but ignores maximum a posteriori estimators, but it also seems like everything therein is mathematically correct. So then wouldn't it follow that the only mathematically correct version of statistics is that which refuses to be anything but entirely agnostic with respect to Bayesianism and frequentism? If methods with both classifications are mathematically correct, then isn't it improper practice to prefer some over the others, because that would be prioritizing vague, ill-defined philosophy over precise, well-defined mathematics? Summary: In short, I don't understand what the mathematical basis is for the Bayesian versus frequentist debate, and if there is no mathematical basis for the debate (which is what Wikipedia claims), I don't understand why it is tolerated at all in academic discourse.
