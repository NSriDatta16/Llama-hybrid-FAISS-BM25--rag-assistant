I will assume that the "probability of interest" is the probability you get from the estimated logistic regression model. To use that as a probability of course is assuming that the model is a reasonably good approximation $^\dagger$ , and that the person you use it for is from the same population that your data was sampled from. First, the logistic regression model is $$\DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} p=\P(\text{Hired} =1 | x)=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 x + \dotsm}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 x + \dotsm}} $$ so you just need to insert the value of $x$ for the person of interest, and the estimated coefficients, to get the estimated probability for that person. To do that in R you use the predict method for class "glm", that is, predict.glm . To get information on that you type in R ?predict.glm example(predict.glm) and study the output. For your data, you will need a new dataframe with the data for the person of interest (or multiple such persons). To make that I will assume that your variables educ ation and exper ience are measured in years, and that sex is 0/1. Then do mynewdata and study the output ... $^\dagger$ For a logistic regression model, assuming that variables like educ ation and exper ience (with a large range of values) is acting linearly, is a very strong assumption. It could be, for instance, that very high values for exper ience, correlating with high age, lowers the probability, a non-monotonic effect that cannot be represented linearly. So I would look into representing those via splines, that is, replacing your glm call with something like library(splines) > test
