What's a good number of emails per hour sent from an ASP.NET C# script on a Windows server?

We are regularly sending out bulk emails (no spam, of course, just newsletters) for our customers, using Windows 2003, 2008 and 2008 R2 servers in Germany and the USA, and the number of mails we manage to send in one hour varies between 5.000 and 12.000, depending on whether we use a pickup folder, the local SMTP or a commercial SMTP server. We are using simple straightforward scripts with standard .NET libs or MailBee components. Is that good? Average? Bad? Is there any obvious bottleneck (i.e. would it make sense to write a multi-threaded scripts or is it the connection to the mail server that limits the speed?)?
