Sycorax is right to point out that “accuracy” has a specific, technical meaning in machine learning (and it is a surprisingly bad performance metric). However, if you mean “accuracy” more colloquially, what you mean makes sense. You want to see how good each particular measurement is. You have the true observation, and you have the predicted observation. Subtract one from the other. Since you are using MSE and $R^2$ (watch out for using $R^2$ in a nonlinear model, however), you seem to be interested in some kind of squares error, so square the difference between the true and predicted value. $$L(y_i, \hat{y}_i)=(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2$$ If you sum over $i$ and divide by the number of observations, that is the MSE.
