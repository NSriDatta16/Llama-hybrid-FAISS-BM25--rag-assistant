Using Session will improve performance and reduce load on your server but it can adversely affect your scalability . You can reduce such effect by making such storage as short as possible, usually down to redirects when I am using RPG . You need to focus on your bottleneck. What is the problem you are trying to solve? Do you have a database which has reached its resource limit (so use session)? Or you are experiencing a load on the server where Web Server is running out of resources (use requery)?
