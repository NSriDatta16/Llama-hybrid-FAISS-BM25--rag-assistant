To be honest, I'm not entirely certain as to why the conventions were originally developed. I suspect they had to do with how other frameworks were evolving at the time -- in particular, RoR was spiking in popularity, and this was how they defined application resources. (At the time of the original MVC iteration, I was just starting at Zend; I did a rewrite in fall of 2006, but the goal of that was to keep it as consistent with what had been developed previously, while simultaneously offering better and more flexibility.) We've continued along the paragigm as it reinforces the idea that all items under the application/ hierarchy are resources , and not your library code. This is particularly important due to the fact that you may have non-class code within this tree (view scripts, layouts, etc.). However, this has certainly made for a few headaches -- the introduction of the resource loader shows that we had a problem we needed to resolve. The resource loader basically addresses the symptoms, but not necessarily the root cause (poor conventions). As we work on ZF2, this is something we will be revisiting. If you're interested in posting your thoughts, I invite you to do so on the zf-contributors mailing list.
