Distribution of estimator of AR(1) parameter in presence of unit root

I want to apply the unit root test to the original equation before writing it in the Dickey-Fuller form. The original equation is: $$ Y_t=b Y_{t-1} + u_t. $$ I want to test for unit root directly by testing if $b=1$. I read in Enders's book "Applied Time Series Econometrics" that this is equivalent to the Dickey-Fuller test. However he didn't mention what critical value to compare to. My $t$-test for $b=1$ hypothesis is $-1$. Can you please help me with the critical value? Assume, the critical value is $-1.95$; what conclusion about unit root can I draw from my test?
