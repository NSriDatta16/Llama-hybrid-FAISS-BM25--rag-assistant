As you've noted pointers will larger. Depending on the processor architecture so might also be ints and/or longs . Strings should stay the same size but be aligned differently in memory for efficiency. Generally, memory alignment of data structures on 64-bit boundaries will cause increased fragmentation in most cases. Also your process address space may appear (in many architectures) to be much larger with stack frame pointers appearing in high memory (and growing downwards) but as these are invariably virtual memory pointers the actual physical memory in use by your application is usually considerably smaller.
