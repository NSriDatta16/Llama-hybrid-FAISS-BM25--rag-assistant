How to find a measurable indicator of a condition using random forest

I have data for 50 patients. This data comprises a different set of variables, of which one of them is a binary variable. For example, the presence of a given symptom (1= have the symptom, 0 = doesn't have the symptom). I want to know what are the traits that define that a given person may develop this symptom. In order to do this, I want to assess the minimum number of variables that define the whole set of patients with a 1. In other words, what is the combination of variables that all the patients with this symptom have in common. I believe you can do this with random forest classifier, but I'm not sure how. A notebook, or any kind of information on how to develop it, as well as other machine learning techniques to solve this problem would be helpful.
