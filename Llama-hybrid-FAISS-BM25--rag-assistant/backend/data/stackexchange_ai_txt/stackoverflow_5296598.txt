So I think that you just want to retrieve those objects in order to show an overview / list, and you are not going to actually 'do' something with those objects (unless perhaps loading one of them) ? In that case, I think that it is better for you to work with 'projections'. Here's the scenario: You'll have to create a (simple) class that just contains the properties that you want to show (where you're interested in). You'll have to 'import' that class into NHibernate, so that NHibernate knows of its existence. Next, you can create your Criteria statement like you have it now. (Working with your domain classes). Then, you should specify how the projection should look like. That is, how the properties of your Item entity map to the properties of your 'DTO'/View class (= the simple class you just created). Specify that an AliasToBean ResultTransformer should be used. Then, execute your Criteria query. NHibernate will be able to produce the simplest possible query that is needed in order to retrieve all the data that is necessary. I've explained something similar here
