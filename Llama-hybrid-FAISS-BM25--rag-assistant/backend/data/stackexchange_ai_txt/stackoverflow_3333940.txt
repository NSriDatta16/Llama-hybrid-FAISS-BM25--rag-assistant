ASP.NET dynamic user interface OR form designer

I need to create an application that allows users to design forms for various purposes. basically users should be able to design a form just like developers can do it in design mode using Visual studio (drag and drop controls and add data). for example users should be able to create a set of questions for a survey and as part of questionnaire, they should be able to select various controls and create a template for the questionnaire and save it down in the database, which could then be used by other set of users who actually need to answer that questionnaire. Is this possible to achieve? is there any component that does this already? any help will be appreciated. thanks. Please let me know if the question is not clear, I can add more detail.
