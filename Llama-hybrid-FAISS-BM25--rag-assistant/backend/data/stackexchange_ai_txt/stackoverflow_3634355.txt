If you follow normalisation rules, you'll omit calculated values, such as Totals and generate them on the fly. However, there sometimes occasions when you might choose to de-normalise a little and store such values explicitly. In terms of storage space, it's generally not an issue on most platforms these days, so storing the extra data is not a problem. And sometimes you can improve performance or simplify your code, when de-normalising in this way. Equally, you decision can also effect maintainability, or perhaps increase complexity. In your example, if you store the total against the order, every time you amend an item you are hitting the workitem table and then you have to update the order table as well. There seems to be little benefit to this, so I wouldn't go this route... but as I said, there are occasions where you might sensibly choose to store data, rather than derive it on the fly.
