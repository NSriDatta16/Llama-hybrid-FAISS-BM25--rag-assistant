How does Grails know to apply a "layout" to pages it renders?

I've been going through the book "The Definitive Guide to Grails" (Rocher/Brown) and in Chapter 04, this mysterious thing called a "layout" just appeared with no explanation. (And there's no "layout" in the index. As far as I know, it's never explained.) How does the system know to "inherit" the pages from layout/main.gsp? There's nothing about "layouts" in the index, and it seems to have just appeared. On their sample app, a simple store site, the URL mappings for the / homepage say "/"(controller:"store") and store controller's empty "index" closure package com.g2one.gtunes class StoreController { def index = { } } simply tells it to render store/index.gsp The store/index.gsp just has a few lines of HTML; no layout gets included with any directive gTunes Store Your online music store and storage service! Manage your own library, browse music and purchase new tracks as they become available When I run the sample the page shown for "/" isn't just this simple HTML, it's the contents of "layouts/main.gsp" with this information magically inserted inside it. I don't see how the information in layout/main.gsp gets applied to the page, how the elements get mixed together. I've been following through the book page by page and this functionality just "appeared" with no explanation.
