The way fonts are embedded has changed between 3 and 4. Are you sure your Verdana font is getting embedded and displayed and not the default font? Here's some info on font embedding in 4 from the docs. I think you will probably need to pay attention to the embedAsCFF property, which you will likely want to set to false. Hope that helps. http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f5f.html
