copy directly to %WINDIR%\Assembly. Advantage: Straightforward. Disadvantage: AFAIK, %WINDIR%\Assembly just happens to be where it is right now, and it's location is subject to change. This would make it break in future versions of windows or if that folder's behavior chaneges. This probably isn't the right way. Extreme Disadvantage: As said by madmath: just copying your assembly into c:\windows\assembly won't work. Explorer only shows a simplified view of the folder, which contains in fact lots of different folders for different kinds of assemblies. Doing a copy in it from an installer won't trigger all the operations done by explorer on a drag-and-drop. (written here because I don't have enough reputation yet to comment on other posts).
