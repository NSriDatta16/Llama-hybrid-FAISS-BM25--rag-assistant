Impact of change in independent variable on probability in logistic regression

Take the following logistic regression: $$\log(o) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$$ We know that increasing $x$ by 1 increases the log-odds of the event by $\beta_1$ , and multiply the odds of the event by $e^{\beta_1}$ . But what is the impact of an increase of 1 in $x$ on the probability of the event?
