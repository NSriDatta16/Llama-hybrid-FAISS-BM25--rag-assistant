Primarily, if they are not independent, the complexity of the problem explodes. Admittedly, the assumption of iid is sometimes poor and the complexity is then justified. Indeed, if you take treat time of discovery as a measure of complexity, typical linear regression has been around for ages, and only works properly if there is independence between Y and the error term. Linear regression is ancient, and highly versatile otherwise. If Y is correlated with itself, say over time, then you have autocorrelation, and it becomes substantially harder and the development and maturation of time series is far far later.
