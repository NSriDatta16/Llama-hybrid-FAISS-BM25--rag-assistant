Assuming each of the 36 combinations has an equal probability, we just have to add the values of each of the 36 combinations and divide by 36 to get the average: 1 possibility: 11 3 possibilities: 12, 21, 22 5 possibilities: 13, 23, 31, 32, 33 7 possibilities: 14, 24, 34, 41, 42, 43, 44 9 possibilities: 15, 25, 35, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 11 possibilities: 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 (1*1 + 2*3 + 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 + 6*11) / 36 = 4.47222..
