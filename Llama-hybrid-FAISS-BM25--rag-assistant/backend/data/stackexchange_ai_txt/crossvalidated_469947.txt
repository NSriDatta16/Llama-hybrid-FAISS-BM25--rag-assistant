If you managed to get a low test error with your simple model then you will probably get a good fitting as well with other models. However, unlike other models, a random forest classifier (RFC) offers a really nice way to test whether or not the model has learned your intuition/information about the importance of features. This can be done through the feature importance property of RFC. See this as an example.
