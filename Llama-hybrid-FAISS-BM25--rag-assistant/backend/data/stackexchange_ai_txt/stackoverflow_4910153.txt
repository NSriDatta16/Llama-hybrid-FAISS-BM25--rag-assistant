The area above the yellow paragraph as you put it, is not actually above it. The green div contains the yellow paragraph. The yellow paragraph has a margin of 70px, pushing away from the green edges of its container. The yellow paragraph has a height set to it, hence we cannot see the yellow pushing away from the green on the bottom edge.
