Logistic regression is a probability model. Probabilities are only really interesting if they differ from 0.5, so "imbalance" is expected and is of no consequence. Logistic regression can handle extreme degrees of imbalance and still provide trustworthy estimates of conditional probabilities. The idea that you need to delete some of the sample in order to fit the model violates statistical principles and is inefficient at best. Samples are too precious to waste. All that's required of successful logistic modeling is a certain absolute frequency in each of the Y categories (ignore relative frequency). Think of it this way: if you try to balance the sample in some way your analysis will not apply to any future dataset. The intercept of the model will be ruined.
