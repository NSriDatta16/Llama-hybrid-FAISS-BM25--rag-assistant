How to handle string encoding in java?

I was really discouraged by java's string encoding. There are many auto conversions in it. and I can't found the regular. Anyone have good idea? for example: In a jsp page, it has such link http://localhost:8080/helloworld/hello?world=凹ㄉ And then we need to process it, so we do this: String a = new String(request.getParameter("world").toString().getBytes("ISO-8859-1"), "UTF-8"); a = "http://localhost/" + a; And when I debug it, I found a is right. And then I pass this to a session object: request.getSession().setAttribute("hello", a); Later in a jsp page with encoding "Big5", and i try to get the attribute and display, And i found the characters "凹ㄉ" are corrupted. How can I solve this?
