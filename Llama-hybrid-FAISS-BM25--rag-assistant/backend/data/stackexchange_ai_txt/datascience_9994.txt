Well, I would say knowing the intricacies of 1 or 2 algorithms in detail( like the inner workings of their parameters) is definitely better than knowing how to run a bunch of them. I have been in the Analytics area for about 11 years and a Data Scientist for 2.5 years and I'm speaking from experience. On the other hand, you should definitely be aware of other things out there (more recent algorithms like deep learning, SVM, XGboost etc.) which might be more applicable to your problem at hand. I think Dr. Andrew Ng's course goes into a quite a few details of some algorithms and it's a good start. As others have pointed out, http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/ is a good book and it has videos to go with it. This is my personal opinion, the algorithms which you shouldn't miss out on are: (Know these in detail): 1) Multiple linear regression 2) Logistic regression 3) Common techniques of dimensionality reduction like PCA 4) K-means clustering 5) Non-linear regression 6) Optimization methods: gradient based search methods, linear programming and discrete optimization 7) Concepts and algorithms in feature engineering 8) Simple time-series forecasting methods More Esoteric algorithms: 1) Random Forests 2) SVM 3) deep learning 4) Other methods of dimensionality reduction like LDA 5) Other kernel based methods 6) Genetic algorithms 7) XgBoost 8) Dynamic regression 9) GARCH/ARCH methods 10) Structural equation modeling 11) Box Jenkins methods in time-series forecasting 12) Information theory: information gain, mutual gain etc.
