If it's conceivable that the application can be tested with a lot of coverage (i.e. going through every dialog, error message, and situation imaginable) you may be able to work with your access log files - compare the list of JS files to those fetched after period x of heavy use. An alternative implementation of this would be setting up a "honeypot" (see my answer to this question ). Both these methods are of course "soft" in that their quality relies in how throroughly the application is actually used during testing time. If you have any way of grep ping all script references, that would be preferable. Maybe you can do a global search on {anything}.js , that would match most ways how to embed a JS file.
