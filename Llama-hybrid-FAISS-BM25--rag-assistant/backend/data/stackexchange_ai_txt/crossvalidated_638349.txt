The basic algorithm processes vertices in order. But why should the storage order of vertices—merely a technical detail of the graph representation—be given a preference? igraph processes vertices in a random order to eliminate bias. When I run this with different random seeds, I get really different community structures. This makes me question that any of these community structures reflect the underlying structure. This is precisely the main advantage of randomized methods. If we run the algorithm several times, and get completely different community structures, then you we that the result is meaningless. If we get comparable results between different runs, then we can be more confident about the result. Deterministic algorithms do not make it possible to check whether the result is meaningful in similar ways.
