What you are looking for is the expected profit from the bet. It's denoted $E(X)$ where $X$ is a "placeholder" for the random profit you would get from a game. Notice that the profit can also be negative. For the bet on red your expected profit is, as you correctly calculated, \begin{align} E(X) &= P(X=-1)\times(-1) + P(X=1)\times1\\ &= 0.53\times(-1) + 0.47\times1\\ &= -0.06 \end{align} meaning that you will on average lose 6 cents for each dollar you play. Now lets say you play two games on red, with a random profit of $X_1$ and $X_2$ . Now we are interested in the expected value of the total profit $X_1 + X_2$ , which is $E(X_1 + X_2)$ . It turns out that you can calculate the expected value for each variable separately. So, for two games we get, \begin{align} E(X_1 + X_2) &= E(X_1) + E(X_2)\\ &= (-0.06) + (-0.06) = -0.12 \end{align} which is just twice the loss from one game. For $n$ games the loss will simply be $n\times(-0.06)$ , so the number of games multiplied by the expected loss in each game.
