Custom fields can't be displayed in Gantt view's left pane (SharePoint 2010)

I created a custom field type that inherits from SPFieldNumber. Then I created a column of this type in a list and created a Gantt View. The problem is that the column doesn't show in the Gantt view's left pane. Any help on this issue would be much appreciated. Thanks!
