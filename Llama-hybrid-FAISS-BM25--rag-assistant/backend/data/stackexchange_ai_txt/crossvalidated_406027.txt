The best formal tests come from relaxing the linearity assumption, then seeing if removing the nonlinearities damages the explained variation in Y. For example you can expand X using a regression spline and test the nonlinear components. My RMS Course Notes goes into details. But once you've allowed for the possibility of nonlinearity, you distort statistical inference by removing the nonlinear terms. The real numerator degrees of freedom for the regression are the number of chances to give the model, which must take into account the nonlinear terms. So the best advice overall is to allow effects not known to be linear to be be nonlinear and be done with it. This will preserve confidence interval coverage, etc.
