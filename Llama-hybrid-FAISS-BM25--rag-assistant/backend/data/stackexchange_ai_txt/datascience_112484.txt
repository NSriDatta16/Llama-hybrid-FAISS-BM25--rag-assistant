What's the input shape for an SVM classifier?

I have a dataset with tensors (there are 12 classes) of shape (700,2000) - height is 700 and width is 2000. I would like to try to use an SVM classifier (just to see how it does). My question is - how do I input the data? Do I flatten it? So the input arrays would be 1 dimensional with length 700*2000 ?
