Here is one approach (if I understand what you are trying for). If the time of the transaction is short enough that each second can be considered independent of the others and the different devices are independent of each other (you will want to think through these assumptions, time of day may make all devices more likely or less likely to request a transaction), then we can model this as a binomial problem. The average number of transactions per second is $\frac{156000}{3600} = 43.33$, and with 4500 devices that works out to a probability of about $0.00963$ of each device requesting a transaction each second. If you want enough servers that you can handle all requests 95% of the time then the binomial tells us that for the given probability and 4500 devices then 54 servers will be enough to cover 95.18% of cases (this is just finding the value from the binomial that includes at least 95% probability). That would mean that during just under 5% of seconds you would receive more requests that you have servers and some requests would need to wait (though if transactions take a fraction of a second, some servers could be ready again). If things are not independent, or tranactions could last more than a second, or other complications, then you will want to look into queuing theory for tools to help you figure this out.
