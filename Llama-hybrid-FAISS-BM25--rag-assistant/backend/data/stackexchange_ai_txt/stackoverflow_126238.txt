Need advice: Structure of Rails views for submenus?

Imagine to have two RESTful controllers (UsersController, OffersController) and a PagesController (used for static content such as index, about and so on) in your application. You have the following routes defined: map.with_options :controller => 'pages' do |pages| pages.root :action => 'index' # static home page pages.about :action => 'about' # static about page # maybe more static pages... end map.resources :users # RESTful UsersController map.resources :posts # RESTful PostsController Your application layout looks like this: Demo Application maybe more links... maybe more links The problem with the layout is that I want only one #submenu to be visible at any time. All other submenus can be completely skipped (don't need to rendered at all). Take the Admin menu for example: This menu should be active for all RESTful paths in the application except for offers_path . Active means that the submenu is visible. The only solution I can think of to achieve this is to build a lot complicated if conditions and that sucks (really complicated to write and to maintain). I'm looking for an elegant solution? I hope someone understands my question - if there's something unclear just comment the question and I'm going to explain it in more detail.
