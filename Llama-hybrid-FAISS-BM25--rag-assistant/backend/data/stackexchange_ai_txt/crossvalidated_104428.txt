e1071 svm predicted probabilties are all 0.5

My svm classifier model always predict 0.5 as probabilities. svm.model which is strange because the same call without probabilities actually makes different classifications: > svm.pred head(svm.pred) 1 2 3 4 5 6 f t f t f f Levels: f t Can someone explain what I am doing wrong?
