Javascript - getting path of file dropped into HTA

I am building a little HTA for personal use, and would like to be able to drag and drop a file to the interface. Once the file is dropped, I would either automatically run it (assuming it fits some parameters I set, like file extension), or at least fill in the input box on the HTA interface. I've searched extensively, but can't find a solution. Thoughts?
