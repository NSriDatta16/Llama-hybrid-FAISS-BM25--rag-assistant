How can i show what days and times has the most activity on a website using PHP and MySQL?

I want to make a bar diagram on my website that shows what days of the week and times-of-day has the most activity/logins. So i'm wondering if someone could give me some tips on how they would do this? How i should organize the database table(s), what data to gather, and how i can present the data recorded as a bargraph using PHP.
