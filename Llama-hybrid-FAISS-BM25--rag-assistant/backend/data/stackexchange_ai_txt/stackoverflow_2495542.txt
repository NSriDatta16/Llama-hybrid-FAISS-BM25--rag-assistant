Here is where the trouble begins when building Lingua::LinkParser : LinkParser.xs:5:27: error: link-includes.h: No such file or directory I think you need to install Link Grammar first. If you look at the Makefile.PL that comes with the distribution, you can see the following comments: # 'LIBS' => "-L/dbrian/link-grammar-4.4.3/link-grammar/.libs/ -llink-grammar", # 'INC' => "-I/dbrian/link-grammar-4.4.3/link-grammar/" which means (very indirectly) that you either do not have Link Grammar installed on your system or it is installed in a non-standard location. If it is not installed, install it first. If it is installed, specify the correct location for INC and LIBS . As the README states: Before you build this package, it is highly recommended that you install the link parser package with make install , which will put the libs, headers, and dictionary files in standard locations. This build no longer prompts for package directories, so if you want to build with non-standard locations, you'll need to edit Makefile.PL to make that happen. In particular, pay attention to the INCLUDE parameter.
