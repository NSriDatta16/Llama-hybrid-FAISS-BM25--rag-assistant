jquery animate

i need to use the animate property for a less than usual activity. i am new at jquery so i dont know if this thing works right out of the box for jquery but lets see. $('#Zoom').toggle(function() { img.removeAttribute("height"); $("#draggable").draggable(); }, the above function zooms into an image by removing the height constraint and displays the image its entire resolution. can i somehow make this transition animate?
