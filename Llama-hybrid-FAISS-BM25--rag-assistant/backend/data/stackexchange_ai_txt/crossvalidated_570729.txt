Which NLP methods use gradient and activation methods?

I am doing a literature review of gradient-based methods for NLP. Yet, apart from linear and logistic regression, I have little knowledge of other methods using the gradient. So I have no knowledge of methods using gradient-based methods for NLP. From what I have read I have decided to search in three directions (gradient based methods using 1. activation 2. hidden state 3. integrated gradient). So my question is : "Which NLP methods use gradient and activation methods?" Browsing for "gradient" and "activation" I've only found Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) so far, the example is on Computer Vision (and there is a disclaimer on the Medium article that the Grad-CAM can be difficult to wrap your head around ;p) PS: let me know if this question is more suitable to Data science site.
