My answer may surprise you. I'll answer it within the expected utility theory, and beyond it. Beyond Expected Utility Expected utility theory itslef is not the only way of decision making. Whether you use utility theory or not depends on the applications. For instance, in wealth management some advisors use prospect theory instead of expected utility. Kahneman got Nobel prize in Economics for his work on this theory. It brought up behavioral aspects of decision making in economics beyond the expected utility theory. Practically, in a traditional portfolio choice approach , wealth advisors attempt to construct the client's utility function, then use it to select the best portfolio on the efficient frontier. In prospect theory approach the advisors attempt to construct the value function instead of the utility function, and use the former to pick the best portfolio. Within expected utility theory I can imagine cases in which two choices yield identical expected utilities but their distributions for the utility vary greatly. Surely decisions should be made based on the whole distribution and not the expectation alone? Now, even in traditional utility theory this is taken care of. For instance they have a notion of risk aversion and stochastic dominance . A risk averse person will not pick the decision solely based on expected utility. That would be a risk neutral person . Risk averse people will prefer decisions with lower entropy when presented with decisions having the same expected utility, for instance. This is called stochastic dominance. The analogy would be looking at two nromal distributions with the same mean but different dispersions. Yes, these are different distributions, and the dispersion matters in many applications. However, this doesn't diminish the importance of knowing the mean. To fully define the normal distribution you need to know both mean and the dispersion, and the mean itself informs us a lot about the distribution. Similarly, expected utility is not the only thing you'll ever need to know about the agent's utility function, but it is a lot of information nevertheless.
