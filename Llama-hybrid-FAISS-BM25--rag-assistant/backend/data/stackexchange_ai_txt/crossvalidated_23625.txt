From an organisational perspective, be it government with policy options or a company looking to roll out a new process/product, the use of a simple cost-benefit analysis can help too. I have argued in the past that (ignoring political reasons) given the known cost of a new initiative, what is the break even point for numbers of people who must be affected positively by that initiative? For example, if the new initiative is to get more unemployed people into work, and the initiative costs $100,000 , does it achieve a reduction in unemployment transfers of at least $100,000 ? If not, then the effect of the initiative is not practically significant. For health outcomes, the value of a statistical life takes on importance. This is because health benefits are accrued over a lifetime (and therefore the benefits are adjusted downwards in value based on a discount rate ). So then instead of statistical significance, one gets arguments over how to estimate the value of a statistical life, and what discount rate should apply.
