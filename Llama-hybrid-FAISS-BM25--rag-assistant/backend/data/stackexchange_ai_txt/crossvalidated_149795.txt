I believe you know how to check whether the data is stationary or not by looking at the ACF & PACF plots. To do this in Minitab, we use Stat - Time Series - Autocorrelation and Stat - Time Series - Partial Autocorrelation . With no data given here I would suggest you to refer this document . Hope this helps !
