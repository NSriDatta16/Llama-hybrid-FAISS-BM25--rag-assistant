I find myself wondering what it is you are attempting to achieve? If you simply want to reduce boilerplate code (15 common use Foo declarations in every file), you can use a module like ToolKit to create a standard set of modules to use: Put this into Powerboy.pm: package Powerboy; use base 'ToolSet'; ToolSet->use_pragma( 'strict' ); ToolSet->use_pragma( 'warnings' ); ToolSet->export( 'DBI' => undef, # Export the default set of symbols ); 1; And then in your scripts, simply do: use Powerboy; # We have strict, warnings and DBI now.
