Does it make sense to make a conditional Markovianity assumption?

Please do excuse if the title is somewhat vague. As we know, a discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of random variables $S_1,S_2,\cdots$ with the Markov property - i.e. \begin{equation} P[S_{t+1}=s_{t+1}\mid S_{t}=s_{t},\cdots,S_{1}=s_{1}]=P[S_{t+1}=s_{t+1}\mid S_{t}=s_{t}] \end{equation} Could the Markov property be extended by considering the same process conditional on, say, another variable $X$ ? - i.e. \begin{equation} P[S_{t+1}=s_{t+1}\mid S_{t}=s_{t},\cdots,S_{1}=s_{1},X]=P[S_{t+1}=s_{t+1}\mid S_{t}=s_{t},X] \end{equation} Thanks in advance.
