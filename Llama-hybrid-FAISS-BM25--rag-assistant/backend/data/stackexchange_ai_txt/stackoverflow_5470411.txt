Does SVN offer a queuing system for updates?

On our setup, if any more than about 20 people try to svn update simultaneously, the whole thing grinds to a halt. We can limit our number of connections to 20, and if you try to svn update and there are already 20 connections, you are told to try again later, but I was hoping to set up a more elegant user experience. Before I attempt to code a bespoke solution, is there anything off-the-shelf that will put additional svn update requests into a queue, that will begin your svn update as soon as the number of connections drops below 20 (and you are first in the queue) and that will show you where you are in the queue? Thanks Tim
