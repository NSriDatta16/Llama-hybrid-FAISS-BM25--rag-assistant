eval is equally "evil" at all times. If you see it as evil, then it's equally evil at all times. The reasons many describe it as evil don't go away with context. Using eval() is generally a bad idea because it decreases readability of code, it impairs the ability for you to predict the code path before runtime (which has possible security implications), and hence affects the ability to analyze and debug code. Using eval() can also prevent the evaluated code and the code surrounding it from being optimised by an opcode cache such as the Zend Opcache integrated into PHP 5.5 and above, or by a JIT compiler such as the one in HHVM. Furthermore, there is no situation for which it is absolutely necessary to use eval() - PHP is a fully-capable programming language without it. Regardless of what you want to use eval() for, there will be another way of doing it, in PHP. Whether or not you actually see these as evils or you can personally justify using eval() is up to you. To some, the pitfalls are too great to ever justify it, and to others, eval() is a handy shortcut.
