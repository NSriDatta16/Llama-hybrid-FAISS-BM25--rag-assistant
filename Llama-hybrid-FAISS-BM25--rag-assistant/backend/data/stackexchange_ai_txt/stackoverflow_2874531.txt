Scripting languages are programming languages where the programs are typically delivered to end users in a readable textual form and where there is a program that can apparently execute that program directly. (The program may well compile the script internally; that's not relevant here because it is not visible to the user.) It's relatively common for scripting languages to be able to support an interactive session where users can just type in their program and have it execute immediately. This is because this is a trivial extension of the essential requirement from the first paragraph; the main extra requirement is the addition of a mechanism to figure out when a typed-in statement is complete so that it can be sent to the execution engine.
