Understanding of threshold value in a neural network

Consider the hypothetical neural network here $o_1$ is the output of neuron 1. $o_2$ is the output of neuron 2. $w_1$ is the weight of connection between 1 and 3. $w_2$ is the weight of connection between 2 and 3. So the input to neuron 3 is $i =o_1w_1 +o_2w_2$ Let the activation function of neuron 3 be sigmoid function. $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ and the threshold value of neuron 3 be $\theta$. Therefore, output of neuron 3 will be $f(i)$ if $i\geq\theta$ and $0$ if $i\lt\theta$. Am I correct?
