Are innovations $0$ for the first term in a differenced series?

I'm working on an unassessed course problem, Consider a time series consisting of quarterly observations of temperature in a city. The seasonally differenced time series $\{x_t\}$ with $D=1$ is modelled with an $\text{ARMA}(1,1)$ process $$x_t=1+\frac{1}{3}x_{t-1}+\epsilon_t+\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{t-1},$$ where $\epsilon_t$ is white noise with variance $2$ . Two year data (8 observations in total) on the time series $\{y_t\}$ are provided in the next table. $$\begin{matrix}t&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8\\ y_t&7&15&19&9&8&13&20&7\end{matrix}$$ Based on the data above, provide a $95$ % predictive interval of $x_{10}$ . The seasonally differenced time series should be $$x_t=(1-B^4)^1y_t=y_t-y_{t-4}.$$ The answer booklet contains the line (edited for clarity) We need to compute $\epsilon_8$ . We back-track from $\epsilon_6$ : \begin{align} \epsilon_6 & = x_6&&-1&&-\frac{1}{3}x_5&&-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_5 \\ & = (y_6-y_2)&&-1&&-\frac{1}{3}(y_5-y_1)&&-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_5 \\ & = (13-15)&&-1&&-\frac{1}{3}(8-7)&&-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_5 \\ & = -2&&-1&&-\frac{1}{3}\times1&&-\frac{1}{2}\times\color{red}{0} \\ & = -\frac{10}{3}. \end{align} Why does $\epsilon_5=0$ ? Is it because $x_5$ is the first $x_t$ defined? If so, why should that follow? Perhaps the first defined term in a differenced series is conventionally assigned an innovation of $0$ .
