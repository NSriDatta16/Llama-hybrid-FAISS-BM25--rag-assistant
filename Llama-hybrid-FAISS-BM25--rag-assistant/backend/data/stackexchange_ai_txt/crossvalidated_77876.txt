Why would scaling features decrease SVM performance?

I have used scaling on features of a model which contains 40 features (all columns are numbers) and a binary output variable. This is the Kaggle contest here I've scaled the features assuming it would deliver better performance, but with a rbf kernel SVM, the accuracy with 10 fold CV fell from 0.92 to 0.87 Here is a box plot of features before and after scaling: What I would like to know is why scaling decreases classifier performance? I have not seen any discussions that point at this type of outcome.
