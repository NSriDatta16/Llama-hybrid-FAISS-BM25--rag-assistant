While PHP supports many two way hashing algorithms I do not see it being useful in this example. What you need to do is: Load the row from storage by the provided id Check that the owner of the row is the authenticated user and if not throw an exception and inform the user not to do that again But if your heart is set on hashing just pick one of the algorithms provided .
