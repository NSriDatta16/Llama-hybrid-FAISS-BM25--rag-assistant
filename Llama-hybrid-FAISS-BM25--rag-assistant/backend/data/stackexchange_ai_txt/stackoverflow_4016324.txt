Yes, it would be faster to use plain variable names in code instead of using string identifiers. But sometimes you don't know those names during build-time. Then you need an approach to handle names dynamically. An alternative approach could be to just use primitive integers instead of strings. The integer values could possibly be generated using a hash or a lookup table of strings. But using strings wouldn't violently slow down your program, unless you have a lot of strings of very huge length which all have the same starting characters and only have a few different characters at the end. Normally, comparing strings should lead to a false result relatively early and only for the "true match" it is necessary to compare the two strings completely. However, the comparison of some strings to find objects within a well-organized search structure (like trees etc.) is not the bottleneck of 3D engines and, thus, should not be part of optimization issues
