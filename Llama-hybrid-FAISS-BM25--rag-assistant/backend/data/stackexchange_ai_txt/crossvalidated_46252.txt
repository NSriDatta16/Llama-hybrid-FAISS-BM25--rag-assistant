Machine learning book with code examples

I am studying Machine Learning and implementing ML algorithms with Matlab. I follow Ethem Alpaydin, Duda and Hart, Bishop and Mitchell's books. However none of them exactly give the pseudo codes and algorithm based examples and code snippets as usual. Are there any books which follow topics with code examples with Matlab or Java or Python?
