As with many things, it depends on what you want to get out of it. The neat thing about the arithmetic average is that if you have one, and you know the total number of values, you can multiply the two and get the total sum. If that property is important, you use the arithmetic average. Something neat about the geometric average is that it respects compounding, making it appropriate for financial comparisons of total wealth under various courses of action. But I don't know of a strict rule, other than that I can list many examples where one is appropriate and the other is not. But sometimes it's not even that clear.
