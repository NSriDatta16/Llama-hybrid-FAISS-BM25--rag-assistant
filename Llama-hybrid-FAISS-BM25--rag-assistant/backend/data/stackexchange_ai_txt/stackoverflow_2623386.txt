I hate to throw a more complicated answer in here but one thing you can do to help simplify things is to use pseudo namespaces. Here is an example: // In cart.js var CartNS = {}; CartNS.getCartItems = function(){ function text here... } // In checkout.js CartNS.getCartItems(); By organizing things into namespaces it can make it easier to deal with scope issues (one of the most difficult concepts in JavaScript) and it makes it a little easier to find things as well. This is also a way to simulate Classes in JavaScript. A decent example to get you started is: 3 ways to define a JavaScript class
