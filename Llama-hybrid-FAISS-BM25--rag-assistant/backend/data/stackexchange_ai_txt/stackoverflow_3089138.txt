I don't know, but if you find yourself using the standard Java reflection APIs a lot, maybe there is something not quite right about the way you design and implement Java programs. Java is primarily designed as a staticly typed language, and works very well when used that way. While dynamic typing and (particularly) reflection can get you out of difficult problems, it is generally a good idea to restrict their use because: they reduces performance, they makes your source code more complex and less readable, and they make your code more fragile. Hiding the reflection behind a library layer or within a Sping-like framework addresses the readability issue but not the performance or fragility issues. (There are other approaches that do address all of the issues ... but without more information about why you are doing so much reflective programming, it is not clear they are relevant.)
