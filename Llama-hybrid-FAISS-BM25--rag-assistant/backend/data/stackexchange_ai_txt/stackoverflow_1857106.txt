I guess there are many aspects that benefit from special attention in functional languages, one that comes to mind is: Functional languages use recursion a lot. So any implementation should try to optimize this case. E.g. identify tail-recursion and transform into a loop internally (thus saving function call overheads like stack save / restore).
