Best graduate level text for econometric time series?

I am a masters student studying economics. The program that I am attending is extremely quantitative with a heavy focus on econometrics. I am looking for a text on time series analysis. I really want something applied but rigorous enough to be considered for an introductory PhD course. I want a text that will be useful in the long run...a reference that I will continue to use later in my career as either an economic consultant or PhD student. Thanks for the help.
