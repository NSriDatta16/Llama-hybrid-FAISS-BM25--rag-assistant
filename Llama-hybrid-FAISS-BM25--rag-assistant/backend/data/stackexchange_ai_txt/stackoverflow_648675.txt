Use case for nested/multiple list comprehensions or generator expressions. When is it more elegant?

I see this kind of thing sometimes: (k for k in (j for j in (i for i in xrange(10)))) Now this really bends my brain, and I would rather it wasn't presented in this way. Are there any use-cases, or examples of having used these nested expressions where it was more elegant and more readable than if it had been a nested loop? Edit: Thanks for the examples of ways to simplify this. It's not actually what I asked for, I was wondering if there were any times when it was elegant.
