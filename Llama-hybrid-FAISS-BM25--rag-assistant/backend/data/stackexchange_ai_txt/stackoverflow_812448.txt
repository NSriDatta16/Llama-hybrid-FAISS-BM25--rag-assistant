Is Developing Maven war apps in MyEclipse worth it?

My organization has made an upper level decision to move to maven as the standard build tool for Java projects. I have been tasked with helping our local teams migrate projects over to maven. One of the core tools that is in play is the MyEclipse IDE. MyEclipse seems to have had a "fun" history with the maven team as evidenced in various places, especially when dealing with war projects. I haven't encountered problems with simple jar projects...yet. After fighting with MyEclipse and failing to make it recognize a war project easily, the question becomes, is MyEclipse worth it for developing maven war apps? If so, is there a way to get MyEclipse to play nicely with a war project that I've not found? Or, am I simply better off suggesting its time to use Eclipse Java EE edition with m2eclipse?
