I googled and I found this: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsbuild/thread/56dd11d1-d920-4fd1-939b-2c65d264b250 It says: ' When we build with code coverage enabled, VS makes some changes to the config file and the same will be restored back once the build is over. If its MSBuild(IDE), VS will tell you that the config file got modified outside VS two times. I observed that the above error occures when there is only one such notification - means when VS fails to restore the config file. I restored the config file using the backup copy and its started working fine. :) '
