Check the developer.android.com site. Data Storage : http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#pref The SharedPreferences class provides a general framework that allows you to save and retrieve persistent key-value pairs of primitive data types If primitive types is all you need, and the boundary is your application (no multi process stuff), then you should be OK with just using SharedPrefs. Anything else (files,sqlLite) is overkill. SharedPrefs has a clean api that should be sufficient for your needs. See the developer.android.com site for shared pref usage.
