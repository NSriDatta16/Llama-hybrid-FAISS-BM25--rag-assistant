In case it wasn't clear: This is a REALLY bad idea. The System name space should be considered reserved and verboten. If Microsoft decides to introduce a class in a framework update that conflicts with your System.mycrap.blah identifier in the future, you're going to have some pretty hefty refactoring on your hands, and, in the case of an app that's deployed to a client, an emergency update and potential liability for system downtime. You wouldn't create your own class called "String." By the same token (pun), don't use reserved namespaces. Also, the namespace "System" doesn't really describe the contents of your namespace. Typically, namespaces should mean something - like, BlogEngine, DatabaseCore, etc. Slapping everything into System is a lot like naming all of your variables "x," or "temp," and implies that the creator doesn't really understand the point of this level of code delineation and organization.
