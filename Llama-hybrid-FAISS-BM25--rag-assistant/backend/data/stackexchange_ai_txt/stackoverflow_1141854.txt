Is this debate a new "vim versus emacs" debate? I am a Python/Django programmer and thus far I've never found a problem in that language/framework that would lead me to switch to Ruby/Rails. I can imagine that it would be the same if I were experienced with Ruby/Rails. Both have similar philosophy and do the job in a fast and elegant way. The better choice is what you already know.
