Multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting for multiple treatment?

I am analyzing observational study data. My predictor variable is tg4 with 4 categories (0,1,2,3) and my response variable is dm (0,1). my analysis step as follow: I use mice package to impute missing data as follow chi % mice(seed = 123, print = FALSE, m=5) Covariate balance assessment using standardized mean differences (SMD) (I tried to use tableone package) but it does not work because I have 5 imputed datasets. calculating propensity score using multinomial logistic regression. calculating weight calculating pooled hazard ratio for all dataset suvtime Thank you for your help.
