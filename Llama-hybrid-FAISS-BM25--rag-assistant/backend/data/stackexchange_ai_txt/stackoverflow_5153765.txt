OK, second attempt :-) I did some testing http://jsfiddle.net/7h6Vn/ which should work in all browsers. However the key CSS property that I needed to add to make it work in IE6 is the background-color: white; line in the #nav li a rule. If you take that out then the hover animation is broken after the first time. I only have IE6 so this may not solve the problem for all IE versions. Edit: This seems to fix the hovering but you might have to play with setting the background-color to something different for your menu. Also crediting the site that jogged my memory about the background-color fix - http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/09/02/how-to-make-cleartype-font-face-fonts-and-css-visual-filters-play-nicely-together/ Edit 2: OK, this http://jsfiddle.net/7h6Vn/1/ definitely works (mouse over the result area). I'm linking to your image to show the hover fade animation. Whilst playing around to get this working I also experienced the same problem as was solved here . One last point to note is that I needed to add the CSS opacity filter for IE which is non-standard, so you might want to put that in a separate IE specific CSS file. I'm not sure this is exactly what you want but it was fun playing around with this nonetheless.
