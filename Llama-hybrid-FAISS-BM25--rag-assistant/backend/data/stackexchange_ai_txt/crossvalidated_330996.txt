What affects converging speed when training a CNN model?

I have a CNN model with user-defined loss function. The model can not be optimized by SGD, but with AdaDelta, it converges to its theoretical value in less than 100 loops on MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN datasets. In some papers, it says it always takes several hundreds and thousands loop before convergence when training a model. Is it because the model is too complex (5 conv/pool layers) and the dataset too easy to fit?
