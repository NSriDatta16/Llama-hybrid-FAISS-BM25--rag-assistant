HTML no matter what version is just a semantic markup for a collection of data. If using a list to split apart the articles makes sense semantically, then that is the correct way. If it does not, then it is incorrect. If you are just worried about minimalistic bytes to send across the wire, then you could do without the list in any version of html and replace it with paragraph tags. Typically semantic markup has a little more to do with how you are presenting the data, than just the data alone. For instance, if you want to use something like EasySlider , then you have to put the items in a list because that is the convention it uses. The same data presented in a different way could require an entirely different markup.
