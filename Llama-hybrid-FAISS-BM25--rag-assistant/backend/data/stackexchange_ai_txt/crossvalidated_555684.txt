Can I use all estimates in a first differenced regression to apply to levels?

I have a time series y where I took the first differences, y’, and an independent variable x where I also took the first differences to get x’. When I run a regression between y’ and independent variable x’, I get: y’ = Bx’ and Pearson r = r I am aware that B can be thought of as the B when thinking about levels because y’ = Bx’ is easily solved for y = Bx (so B is estimated to be the same for levels) , but I cannot figure out if I can do the same for r. In general, I’m hoping someone can clear up what isn’t explicitly said often - the idea that if I want to find a relationship between y and x, I can take the first differences of both variables and get regression results. I am essentially wondering if all results from that differenced regression can be interpreted as if we did the regression on the levels aka the interpretation remains the same. Thank you.
