In Flask request is a thread-safe global, so you actually do import it: from flask import request I'm not sure this feature is related to WSGI as other WSGI micro-frameworks do pass request as a view function argument. "Global" request object is a feature of Flask. Flask also encourages to store user's data which is valid for a single request in a similar object called flask.g: To share data that is valid for one request only from one function to another, a global variable is not good enough because it would break in threaded environments. Flask provides you with a special object that ensures it is only valid for the active request and that will return different values for each request. In a nutshell: it does the right thing, like it does for request and session.
