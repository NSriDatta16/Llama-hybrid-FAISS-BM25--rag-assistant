For anyone in the situation of trying to continue supporting VB6 code into the future, I would strongly recommend looking at REAL Studio (formerly REALBasic) http://www.realsoftware.com/ It's a really excellent package that is very compatible with VB6 - especially in combination with the Windows Functionality Suite: http://www.arbpmembers.org/windows-functionality-suite Other libraries add massive sets of capabilities: http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/realbasic/plugins.shtml Many more libraries and controls are listed here: http://www.rbgarage.arbpmembers.org/rbg/ Additionally I believe it has COM interop so you should be able to keep using any custom COM controls you have purchased. Finally, RB can now be deployed to Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and even as a stand-alone web application server. It's a very flexible platform, would be easy for VB6 programmers to convert to, and has a relatively large community of developers. I ported a relatively complex VB6 application (actually a text adventure game engine originally written in VB3) to REALBasic in an afternoon with minimal trouble.
