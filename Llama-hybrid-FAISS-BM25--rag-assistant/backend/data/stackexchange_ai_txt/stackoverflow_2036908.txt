The order by clause is used to order your data set. For example, select * from customers order by customer_id asc will give you a list of customers in order of customer id from lowest to highest. The group by clause is used to aggregate your data. For example, select customer_id, sum(sale_price), max(sale_price) from customers group by customer_id order by customer_id asc will give you each customer along with their total sales and maximum sale, again ordered by customer id. In other words, grouping allows you to combine multiple rows from the database into a single output row, based on some criteria, and select functions of those fields not involved in the grouping (minimum, maximum, total, average and so on).
