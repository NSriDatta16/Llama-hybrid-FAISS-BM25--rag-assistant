If you're sure that it changes at one point, you can do two plots: one for the prebreak realizations and one for the postbreak realizations. If you're not sure that it only changes at a point, you can break things up into smaller subsets and look at them all separately. Here's some illustrative R code that uses the lattice package and conditions on blocks of the time period: library(lattice) rprocess Obviously it could be improved a lot. If you can plot the data before averaging, you probably want to do that as well -- you'd like to use the graphics to complement your model/analysis and to convince the readers that it's appropriate, and that's much less compelling if only processed data are presented.
