ASP.NET multiple types of controls to insert a record

ASP.NET newbie here. I would like to create a form with multiple types of controls for inserting a single record into a database table. This record has a "Type" field which is a foreign key, and I would like to populate a combobox with the possible values for it. I tried drag'n'dropping the table in design view (like in windows forms), but it always generates a gridview. How can I make it generate a form where I can specify the types of controls? Thanks in advance
