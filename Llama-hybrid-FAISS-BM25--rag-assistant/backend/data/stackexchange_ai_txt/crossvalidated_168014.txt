Where can I read about gamma coefficient in SVM in scikit-learn?

Scikit learn support vector machine algorithm have a couple of coefficients which meaning I can not understand. gamma : float, optional (default=0.0) Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’. If gamma is 0.0 then 1/n_features will be used instead. and coef0 : float, optional (default=0.0) Independent term in kernel function. It is only significant in ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’. I tried to google for gamma in support vector machines, but have not found anything relevant. Can anyone explain me what is the meaning of these parameters and reasonable value for them.
