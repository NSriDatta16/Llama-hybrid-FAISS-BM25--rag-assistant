Infragistics license file add itself to project?

I have a solution in VB.NET .NET 2 Use Infragistics components all over the application. One day decided to add floating toolbar support to our Forms. Our forms inherit one base form - BaseForm. This base form is used in multiple projects in the solution. So, on the BaseForm was added a UltraToolbarsManager . Since, a nightmare began: the licenses.licx started to create and add itself to the project on every form opened in designer.... licenses.licx contains: Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars.UltraToolbarsManager, Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinToolbars.v6.3, Version=6.3.20063.53, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7dd5c3163f2cd0cb What to do? Why does this license file appear in the inherited forms?
