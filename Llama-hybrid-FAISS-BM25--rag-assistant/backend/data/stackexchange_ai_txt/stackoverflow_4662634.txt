Do what everyone else does; AND binds tighter than OR (see e.g. C Operator Precedence Table ). This is the convention that everyone expects, so adopt the principle of least surprise . This choice isn't arbitrary. It stems from the fact that AND and OR follow a similar relationship to multiply and add, respectively; see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic#Other_notations . Note also that users of your language should be heavily encouraged to use parentheses to make their intentions clear to readers of their code. But that's up to them!
