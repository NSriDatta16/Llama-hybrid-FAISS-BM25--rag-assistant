Is it OK to overlay a line chart overtop a bar chart to show averages in different categories?

I'm a software developer and not a data visualization expert by any means. I was sent a screenshot of how my client wants some data visualized. Each bar is the average score for your team. The points in the line are supposed to represent the overall average of all users in the system so that a team leader can figure out if their team's score is above or below average. The examples I find on the internet typically compare a single score with a straight horizontal line showing the overall average. Is using a connected line that way fine? Is there a better way this data could be visualized?
