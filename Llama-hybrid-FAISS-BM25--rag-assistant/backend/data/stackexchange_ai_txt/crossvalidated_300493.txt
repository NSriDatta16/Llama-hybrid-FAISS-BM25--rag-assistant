SVM works through the minimization of a loss function, and in this case, the loss function would just try to minimize whatever data you have (even if "logically impossible") - So I don't really see the problem? I don't think SVM assumes that there is no noise present (which is how I understand what you are saying), but rather it just doesn't explicitly assume a model on the noise (like you would in the probabilistic case). Loss functions and probability models on the noise are very similar in some sense, some are even equivalent in some sense (squared loss and Gaussian-noise models often coincide).
