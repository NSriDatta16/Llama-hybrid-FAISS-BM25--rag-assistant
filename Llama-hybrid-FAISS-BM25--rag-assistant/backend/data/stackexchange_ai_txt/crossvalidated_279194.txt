The interaction tests if there is evidence that the two slopes are different from one another. Looking at there being an effect of Repeated 1 but not Repeated 2 tells you that there is evidence that Repeated 1 is not different from zero , while there is evidence that Repeated 2 is different from zero . The tests are just making different comparisons: The interaction asks, "Are these two slopes different from one another?" The simple slopes analyses ask, "Is this slope different from zero?" What can happen is: One slope is different form zero, the other is not different from zero, but they both are not different from one another . Which one should you trust? It depends on your research question: Are you interested in a difference between slopes? Then the interaction term is what you want to look at. Are you interested in each of the two is different from zero? Then you should look at the simple slopes. Traditionally, people do not examine the simple slopes unless the interaction is "significant" (I'm aware you're in a Bayesian framework here, but that's the traditional approach, which employs NHST).
