Bias means that the expected value of the estimator is not equal to the population parameter. Intuitively in a regression analysis, this would mean that the estimate of one of the parameters is too high or too low. However, ordinary least squares regression estimates are BLUE, which stands for best linear unbiased estimators. In other forms of regression, the parameter estimates may be biased. This can be a good idea, because there is often a tradeoff between bias and variance. For example, ridge regression is sometimes used to reduce the variance of estimates when there is collinearity. A simple example may illustrate this better, although not in the regression context. Suppose you weigh 150 pounds (verified on a balance scale that has you in one basket and a pile of weights in the other basket). Now, you have two bathroom scales. You weigh yourself 5 times on each. Scale 1 gives weights of 152, 151, 151.5, 150.5 and 152. Scale 2 gives weights of 145, 155, 154, 146 and 150. Scale 1 is biased, but has lower variance; the average of the weights is not your true weight. Scale 2 is unbiased (the average is 150), but has much higher variance. Which scale is "better"? It depends on what you want the scale to do.
