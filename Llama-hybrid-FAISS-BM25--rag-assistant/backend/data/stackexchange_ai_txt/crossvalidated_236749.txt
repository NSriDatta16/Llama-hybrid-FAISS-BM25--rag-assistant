$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(z)\Phi^2(z+q)\,\mathrm dz=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(y-q)\Phi^2(y)\,\mathrm dy.$$ Integrals of this type have no known analytical solution in terms of other well-known functions, but see David Robertson's comment re special functions. The value of the first integral that you seek is the probability that a $N(q,1)$ random variable is larger than both of two other independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. See this answer of mine for more discussion of the case when $\Phi^2(y)$ is replaced by $\Phi^n(y), n \geq 2.$ Indeed, the value of the first integral as a probability makes the interpretation of your derivation of $\int\phi(z)\Phi^2(z)dz=\frac{1}{3}$ straightforward: the probability that one specific random variable among $3$ iid random variables has the largest value is $\frac 13$ (since all three random variables are equally likely to be the largest.)
