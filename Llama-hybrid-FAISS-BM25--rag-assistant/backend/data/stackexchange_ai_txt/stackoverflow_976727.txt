How can I create a IDataObject instance with Delphi?

This C++ code shows how OLE can be used to simulate a file drag and drop to simulate a 'Send to...' operation . This will open the standard mail client with the selected file(s) as an attachment, a very interesting alternative to the mailto: protocol handler. Which is the best (short and safe) way to create the neccessary instance of IDataObject in Delphi? I have found some code here but maybe there is a better solution.
