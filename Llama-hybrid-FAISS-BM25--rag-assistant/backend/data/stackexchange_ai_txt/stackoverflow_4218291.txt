Interesting I wrote this exact operation last night using fclabels: withGame :: (r :-> r', s :-> s') -> GameMonad r' s' a -> GameMonad r s a withGame (l1,l2) act = do (r,s) askM l1 getM l2 (a, s') GameMonad is a new type that is a monad transformer stack of state, reader, IO. I'm also using a bit of applicative functor style code don't let it put you off, it's pretty much the same as mokus.
