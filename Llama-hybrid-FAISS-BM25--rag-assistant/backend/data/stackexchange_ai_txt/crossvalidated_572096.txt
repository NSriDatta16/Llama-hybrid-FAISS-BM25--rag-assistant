I would like to perform a statistical test that will quantify this difference and then I can choose a threshold and decide accordingly if these are similar enough for my application or not. A statistical test will be based on statistical variations and will rank samples based on probability. For instance the chi-squared test and Kolmogornov-Smirnov will assume a particular distribution or particular assumptions about the distribution and compute a statistic with those assumptions. You might want to look to other measures of distance instead. Measures that are not inspired by statistical hypothesis testing. My question is - which statistical test or model or method is adequate for that assuming the distribution is similar to what you see in the examples Those two images are not enough to create a model of the data and come up with an appropriate distance measure for which you can select a cut-off value. To come up with a model requires an understanding of the process that generates the data. You can not just look at two examples of data output and decide what would be a good model from which a distance measure can be defined. (However if you have thousands of examples, then you could use some neural network to come up with a model learned from the examples).
