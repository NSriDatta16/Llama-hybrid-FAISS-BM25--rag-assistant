There may be a few reasons for this: They didn't know what they were doing. I'm working in code now that appears to have been written by someone new to Java and new to programming. It's unfortunately far too common to come across poorly designed code than to find good, clean, well-maintained code written by someone with a solid understanding of the platform. This is partly because of the next point. The List changes were patched without wanting to make wholesale changes. If the rest of the code uses the array, someone may not have wanted to bother with making all the other changes. While Collections are the more OO/Java way to do things, if the list is static, an array is actually "easier" to work with since they can still be iterated with for(:) like a Collection but accessed with [] instead of get() . Personally, not a good enough reason to use arrays but maybe that's just me. Maybe they wanted it to be clear that the length of the data is final . If they had just used an unmodifiable list, a List would still be the means for referring to the data and anyone not paying attention to the rest of the (hopefully commented) code might try to add to the List which would result in a run-time UnsupportedOperationException. Making it an array makes it's usage clear.
