When upgrading an Assembly, what's the best way to migrate files in Isolated Storage?

I have a .Net 2.0 C# application that occasionally gets updated and the Assembly Version and File Version are incremented. This is all working fine, but it also breaks storing xml settings files in Isolated Storage. (The xml files are generated by DevExpress XtraGridView.SaveLayoutToXml()) Is there a way to copy these files from the old folder in isolated storage to the new folder. i.e. From Appname\1.0.0.0 to Appname\1.0.1.0 Or is there a better place to store these xml files, that won't change when the File Version of the app changes? I don't want to store these files in the application's .exe folder, as the app is not allowed to write to that folder in Vista without Admin privileges.
