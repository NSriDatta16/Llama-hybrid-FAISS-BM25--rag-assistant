Multicollinearity in linear or logistic regression does not impact the model performance it only impacts how model coefficient are interpreted. Multicollinearity leads to a problem where small change in one variable can lead to drastic changes in coefficients. A neural network is black box model in nature so if its performs to a given expectation (good accuracy) we never know the impact of multicollinearity. Thats why i think most blogs say that neural network are not affected by multicollinearity
