Building on BruceET's point, I thought it would be interesting to include an addendum to my post, namely the idea that we may choose a confidence region to minimize its volume subject to meeting its coverage constraint. For simplicity, I will work with the one dimensional case, letting $T_n$ denote some absolutely continuous pivotal statistic with known invertible CDF $F$ , differentiable density $f$ , and $q$ quantile given by $t_q\equiv F^{-1}(q).$ Then we wish to choose $q_1$ to minimize the length of the $1-\alpha$ CI: $$t_{1-\alpha+q_1}-t_{q_1}=F^{-1}(1-\alpha+q_1)-F^{-1}(q_1),$$ giving first order condition $$ (f(t_{1-\alpha+q_1}))^{-1}-(f(t_{q_1}))^{-1}=0\\ \implies f(t_{1-\alpha+q_1})=f(t_{q_1}),$$ and it suffices that $f'(t_{1-\alpha+q_1}) for the second order condition to be met. For symmetric density, such as in the normal case, this implies $q_1=\alpha/2.$
