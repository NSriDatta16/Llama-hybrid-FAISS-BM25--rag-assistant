jQuery validator error placement (.rules("add"))

I have a jquery popup, which has a list of text boxes to insert phone numbers. The user can choose to add more text boxes if they want. Each time they add a text box, I am adding a jquery required validator like so: $("#phoneNumberTxt" + i).rules("add", { required: true, messages: { required: "Phone number is required." } }); On the line with the text box, there are multiple text boxes. I am trying to pipe all the errors to a div to the left of all the text boxes (1 div per row). Is there a way to tell the above validator where to display the error message?
