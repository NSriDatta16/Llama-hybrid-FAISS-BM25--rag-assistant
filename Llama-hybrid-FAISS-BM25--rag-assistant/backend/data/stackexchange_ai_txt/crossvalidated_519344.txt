Can I use a binary logistic regression for repeated measures data?

For this particular study, I had 3 monkeys complete 3 tasks, each task has a binary outcome (Win/Lose). A task is considered complete when they reach a criterion of 85% accuracy in their most recent 120 trials. So for each monkey I have lists, varying in length, of W's and L's. Originally I planed on using a Fisher's exact test, for each individual monkey, to compare the number of Wins and Losses for Test 1 and 2, and then for Test 1 and 3, and for Test 2 and 3. However, I've read that it is not appropriate to use a Fisher's exact test for repeated measures data and was told it may be possible to use a binary logistic regression instead. I've been looking into the binary logistic regression and have found mixed reviews on whether this test is appropriate for repeated measures data. I suppose my question is if binary logistic regression would work for this dataset? and if not, what other model would be more appropriate?
