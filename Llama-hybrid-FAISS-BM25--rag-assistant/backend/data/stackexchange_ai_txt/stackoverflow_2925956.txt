As with all new technologies make sure your website degrades gracefully. So don't use the new tag as the main part of your website, but you can provide a little widget or something(which is not necessary or part of the main content) which uses it. Or if you use the tag make sure that you have a backup Flash way of viewing the video as well(especially since the codecs supported by is completely fragmented at the moment!) Make sure that people on older/IE browsers can still see what your site is about and ensure it looks decent to them. I have to do the same thing with the CSS3 features that I make use of in my work.
