How can I access CodeIgniter session cookie using Javascript?

I'm using CodeIgniter's session library , which is really easy to access on the server side. On the client side, the session cookie looks like this (I bolded the part I'm interested in): a:7:{s:10:"session_id";s:32:"47fe66476b098ff092f2fbdddfa53ffa";s:10:"ip_address";s:9:"127.0.0.1";s:10:"user_agent";s:50:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv";s:13:"last_activity";s:10:"1296180527";s:7:"user_id";s:3:"895";s:8: "username";s:8:"Summer N" ;s:6:"status";s:1:"1";}fc0f1e75c097be7970b815a630bf33ef Ahem. I want to access "username", which is currently set as the 8-character string Summer N. Is there an obvious way to parse this in javascript? Should I just use a regex? Or is the better way going to be creating my own "user" cookie with a simpler data format, and just letting CI's sessions do their own thing separately?
