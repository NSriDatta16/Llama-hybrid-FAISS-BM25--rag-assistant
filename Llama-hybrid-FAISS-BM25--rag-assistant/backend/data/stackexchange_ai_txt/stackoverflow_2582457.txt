php regular expression help finding multiple filenames only not full URL

I am trying to fix a regular expression i have been using in php it finds all find filenames within a sentence / paragraph. The file names always look like this: /this-a-valid-page.php From help i have received on SOF my old pattern was modified to this which avoids full urls which is the issue i was having, but this pattern only finds one occurance at the beginning of a string, nothing inside the string. /^\/(.*?).php/ I have a live example here: http://vzio.com/upload/reg_pattern.php
