You are on the right track. In touchesBegan you should store the position where the user first touches the screen. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; self.startPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; } Similar code in touchesEnded gives you the final position. By comparing the two positions you can determine the direction of movement. If the x-coordinate has moved beyond a certain tolerance you have a left or right swipe. - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint endPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; if (startPosition.x You do not need touchesMoved unless you want to detect and track a swipe while the user is still touching the screen. It may also be worth testing that the user has moved a minimal distance before deciding they have performed a swipe.
