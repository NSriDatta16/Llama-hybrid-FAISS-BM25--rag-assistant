General approach to work with text of phone calls (topics, promises, sentiments, etc.)

I have an NLP task. There is a text (telephone conversations). Voice is already converted into text and is divided into agent and customer paragraphs. I need to understand what approach is the best one for the next tasks: Who is the customer and who is the agent? Customer Name The topic of conversation Promises made by the operator to the customer (for example, "I call back tomorrow") Negative Sentiment (if there is something in the conversation that the subscriber is not happy with) I am just trying to understand how to handle it. Is it possible to create some kind of general approach for this? If yes, for which packages/publications/books could I pay my attention?
