Your application will get a WM_SYSCOMMAND message with SC_SCREENSAVE as a command id when the Screen Saver is about to kick in. Would that do? there's also the SC_MONITORPOWER command id when the monitor is about to blank (also a WM_SYSCOMMAND message). Edit: looking at the comments, it appears that you don't care about whether the user is inative, but rather whether your application is inactive. This is easy. If your app is minimized, then the user isn't interacting with it. If your app is not the foreground application, that's a good inicator as well. You could also pay attention to messages in your pump to notice if there have been any user input messages to your app, In C++ adding code to the pump is trivial, in delphi you can use a WH_GETMESSAGE hook to monitor the pump hook into the message loop that TApplication implements. Or GetLastInputInfo
