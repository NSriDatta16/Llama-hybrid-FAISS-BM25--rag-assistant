'NSInvalidArgumentException' UIButton IBAction Error

I have a button in a view which refuses to work. I've got in working in a blank, default view application from X-Code, but in none of my applications will it work, instead it gives me the following error. Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[UIViewController showVicInfo:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x3c084f0' The debugger isn't any help either. I've made sure that I hook up the button to the file's owner (not the other way around) as well. Below is the code for the action. And I know it's not the alert view, because the breakpoint doesn't even reach there. about.h @interface about : UIViewController { } -(IBAction)showVicInfo:(id)sender; about.m -(IBAction)showVicInfo:(id)sender { UIAlertView *myAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"No Internet Connection" message:@"You require an internet connection via WiFi or cellular network for iFirelert to work." delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK, thanks" otherButtonTitles:nil]; [myAlert show]; [myAlert release]; } Update: FYI this is how I went about creating the button,if it helps. Created new view (File>New File>UIViewControllerSubclass w/XIB for interface) Added -(IBAction)showInfo:(id)sender; to about.h Added -(IBAction)showVicInfo:(id)sender { UIAlertView *myAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"No Internet Connection" message:@"You require an internet connection via WiFi or cellular network for iFirelert to work." delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK, thanks" otherButtonTitles:nil]; [myAlert show]; [myAlert release]; } to about.m Opened About.xib in Interface Builder, dragged a Rectangular Button onto the View Hooked up the button to the -showVicInfo action by ctrl-clicking the button to the File's Owner property (not the other way around). Checked the File's Owner was set to "about" class which it is. And then built and run with failure in X-Code. Update 2: OK, I've worked out it must be a setting or something in my existing project.I've copied the two class files and XIB file which does work in another X-Code project, but the button also throws the same error in the existing app.
