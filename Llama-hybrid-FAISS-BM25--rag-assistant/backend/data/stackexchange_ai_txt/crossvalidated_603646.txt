I considered commenting but apparently I haven't got enough reputation. I can't answer your question per se, but here are some recommendations: In general, autocorrelation plots reveal a considerable amount of information to characterize a time series. If you obtain two quite different autocorrelation plots, it is sufficient to claim that two series are different. You can fit a (S)ARIMA(X) model and compare statistically significant estimates for both series. If any of these are different, the series would not have a similarity. You can perhaps do a regression using lags of one series as explanatory variables of the other series (Xt-1 to predict Yt and Yt-1 to predict Xt). I think if either one of these appear to be statistically significant, the series would not be similar. If you had more than two time series, you could take an experimental design approach, considering (S)ARIMA(X) parameters as individual observations.
