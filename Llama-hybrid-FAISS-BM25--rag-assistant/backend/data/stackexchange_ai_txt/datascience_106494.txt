How to customize logistic regression for this case?

I have a binary classification problem, with a dataset comprising of several features. When I train LogisticRegression on it, I get large number of false positives and false negatives. This is totally ok, however I would like to train my model such that the data which consists of larger feature value of some specific feature f1 is given more weightage, with weight proportional to value of f1 . The end goal is to train the model to be more precise on data where feature f1 is large such that false positives and false negatives contain mostly the ones with lower f1 values. Is there any way to approach this problem?
