It sounds like you're a developer and that's what you want to continue doing. If that's the case, I would recommend a joint venture. That is, partner with someone who has the marketing skills that you need to get your product out to a wide range of people. As far as places to look for those types of people, I would start at jvnotifypro.com and branch out from there looking for other sites similar to it. I believe at that site they have a few posts that mention some of those other sites. Depending on your marketing budget, you could also go the route of paying people to install your program, paying for leads, etc. There's a lot of ways to market a program and to get the best coverage you really have to think outside the box. Oh, you can also submit software to the sites that support PAD - I think there's an app called AutoSubmitPro that will do this for you. That's a great way to get your software out there a bit so that people know about it.
