Interpretation of Changes introduced by ti() in Logistic GAM Modeling

I am currently working on a logistic regression model using the mgcv package. The mode contains 3 variables (x1 and x2, continuous) and x3 (categorical) and I believe there is interaction between the variables x1 and x2. This is my base model: gam_model And this is the output: Formula: Output ~ s(x1) + s(x2) + x3 Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.5464 0.4327 5.886 3.97e-09 *** x31 -0.1607 0.5105 -0.315 0.753 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Approximate significance of smooth terms: edf Ref.df Chi.sq p-value s(x1) 3.9614 9 34.72 gam.check(gam_model) Method: REML Optimizer: outer newton full convergence after 20 iterations. Gradient range [-2.632544e-05,1.312618e-05] (score 65.9424 & scale 1). Hessian positive definite, eigenvalue range [1.746351e-07,0.7026972]. Model rank = 20 / 20 Basis dimension (k) checking results. Low p-value (k-index Now, when introducing ti, the output changes drastically, but the deviance explained remains relatively constant: gam_model |z|) (Intercept) 1.9417 0.4147 4.682 2.84e-06 *** x31 -0.3893 0.5092 -0.764 0.445 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Approximate significance of smooth terms: edf Ref.df Chi.sq p-value ti(x1) 5.161e-06 4 0.00 0.475 ti(x2) 9.774e-01 4 36.07 gam.check(gam_model) Method: REML Optimizer: outer newton full convergence after 15 iterations. Gradient range [-2.806258e-05,9.209817e-06] (score 65.132 & scale 1). Hessian positive definite, eigenvalue range [3.756572e-07,1.244895]. Model rank = 26 / 26 Basis dimension (k) checking results. Low p-value (k-index Would somebody help me explain the results and the changes? Q1: X1 and X2 are closely correlated and in other applications of this model I often see s(x1) going to a value close to zero while s(x2) increases when I add using select = TRUE to the commands. Is this due to the interaction? Q2: In this specific case, I am not certain how to interpret the strong drop in ti(x1) and the high interaction term, especially in the context of a low p-value the gam.check function. My initial thought is that the effect of ti(x1) is mostly driven by interaction via ti(x2), which is now "separated", but is this true, and could I use this model? Thank you very much for your help
