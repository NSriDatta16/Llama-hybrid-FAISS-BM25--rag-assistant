Teradata and SAS with BigInt's

We have a teradata database that is filled with BIGINT datatypes. SAS is the primary analytic engine for the organization. The SAS access library chokes on BIGINT and therefore forces all code to cast variables into a integer or decimal before returning them to SAS. Example: proc sql; connect to database (blah blah); create table sas_dataset as select * from connection to database( select cast(bigint_var as integer), varchar_var, char_var, from some_table ); disconnect from database; quit; Does anyone know a way to fix this? Possibly a macro for casting variables or SAS access fix? Keep in mind that there are literally thousands of variables in this database that are bigint and making changes to the database is out of the question.
