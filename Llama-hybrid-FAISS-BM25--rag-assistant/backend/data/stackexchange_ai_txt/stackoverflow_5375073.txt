Inline style attributes ( color=#00000 ) are deprecated and kill kittens. Learn about CSS. Tables are discouraged for anything except tabular data (think spreadsheets), use CSS for layout instead. Hardcoding whitespace with &nbsp; is not desirable either if it doesn't add any meaning, learn to add spacing using CSS. echo ing either HTML or Javascript from the same function is bad. The Javascript alert will cause invalid HTML syntax at the point you're calling the function. Mixing database calls and HTML so tightly is not good. Look into MVC separation. Outputting a random, rather meaningless Javascript alert to the user in the middle of a half finished page is bad. You should display a dedicated error page instead. See MVC, which helps you accomplish this. Mixing single quotes and double quotes for the attributes is inconsistent and makes the code more difficult to read. Stick to one type of quotes instead. There is no form in your markup shown to submit the selected select options
