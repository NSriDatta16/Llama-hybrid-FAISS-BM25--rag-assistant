Machine learning and empiricism: does prediction translate to evidence?

Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be a series of idd random variables. Imagine we are training a machine learning classifier over these variables with the task of predicting a feature $F$ . A typical scenario might be trying to classify subjects into healthy control or diagnosed based on some clinical data, which we'll assume from now onwards for simplicity. A usual task for data scientists, I gather, is feature engineering. This is, constructing new features, somehow relevant to the problem at hand, from already existing ones. I have a hypothetical question on this. Say we hypothetize there is a difference in a certain trait between subjects. Say $g(X_i)$ is a sensible estimation of that trait. If adding $g(X_i)$ to the model improves classification, are we justified in interpreting this as evidence in favor of our hypothesis? It certainly seems reasonable to say so. If including a new feature improves classification considerably, it seems reasonable to say there must be some relevant differences in the trait that feature represents across subjects. If such difference did not exist, what could the model learn from the new feature? I hope this question is not too soft. Thanks in advance.
