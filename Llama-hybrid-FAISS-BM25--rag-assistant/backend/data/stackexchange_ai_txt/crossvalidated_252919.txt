You are not thinking about it wrong. It just turns out to be a Markov chain (which have infinite recursion) or a form of a random walk (also can be infinite). I would probably approach this as a Markov chain, then you only need to work out the probabilities of one step, then use the MC theory/methods to work out the long term/infinite probabilities.
