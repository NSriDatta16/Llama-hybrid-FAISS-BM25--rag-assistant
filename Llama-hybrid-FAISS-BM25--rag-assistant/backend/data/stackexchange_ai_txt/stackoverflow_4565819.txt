I second Alex Miller's comment. Everything you write make sense so far. I'd strongly recommend looking into triggers though, despite your reservations. They're fairly easy to grasp, and make for a very powerful tool in such scenarios. Using triggers you can store a copy of the row into a separate table each time a record is updated (or deleted). If you want to go all fancy you can, within the trigger, compare the incoming data to the existing data, and write only what has changed. Also consider the Archive storage engine instead of MyISAM or InnoDB for these kinds of tables - they're made for this kind of job. Also, the search phrase you're probably looking for is "audit trail".
