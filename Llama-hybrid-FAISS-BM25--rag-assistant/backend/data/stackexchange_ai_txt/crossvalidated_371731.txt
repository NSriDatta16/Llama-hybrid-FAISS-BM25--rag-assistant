Well, what you should do depends on what is your goal. Are you interested in the biodiversity of the forest itself, measured via sampling 28 plots, then you should use the complete sample and calculate one Shannon-index. But, if your interest is in how the biodiversity varies over the forest, then maybe you should calculate the 28 indices. Since you indicate taking the mean of the 28 plot indices, probably you want the former. So I will assume you want one measure of biodiversity of the complete forest. Then, use the complete sample and calculate one index. Especially if the individual plots are too small, they could miss entire species and so not represent well the biodiversity of the forest. If you then calculated 28 separate plot indices and averaged them, you could get a severally biased result, the biodiversity would be underestimated.
