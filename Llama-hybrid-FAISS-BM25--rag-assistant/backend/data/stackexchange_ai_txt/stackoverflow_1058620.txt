Are GWT wrappers on top of javascript libraries discouraged?

I'm in a process of selecting an API for building a GWT application. The answer to the following questions will help me choose among a set of libraries. Does a third-party code rewritten in GWT run faster than a code using a wrapped JavaScript library? Will code using a wrapped library have the same performance as a pure GWT code if the underlying JavaScript framework is well written and tuned?
