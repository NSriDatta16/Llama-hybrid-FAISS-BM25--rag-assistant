How does ExtraTrees (Extremely Randomized Trees) learn?

I'm trying to understand the difference between random forests and extremely randomized trees ( https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/9357/1/geurts-mlj-advance.pdf ) I understand that extratrees uses random splits and no bootstrapping, as covered here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22409855/randomforestclassifier-vs-extratreesclassifier-in-scikit-learn The question I'm struggling with is, if all the splits are randomized, how does a extremely randomized decision tree learn anything about the objective function? Where is the 'optimization' step?
