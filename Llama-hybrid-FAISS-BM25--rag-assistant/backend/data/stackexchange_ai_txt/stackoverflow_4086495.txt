What's a more detailed ui mock-up tool to use, rather than balsamiq

I currently use balsamiq for ui mock ups, but sometimes it does not give me the detail I need for more specific functionality I want to show. e.g. Error messages, validation. Is there a similar, easy to use tool that allows more customisation than balsamiq's drag and drop? (I still plan to use balsamiq for simple mock-ups, as I like it. It's quick and easy to use)
