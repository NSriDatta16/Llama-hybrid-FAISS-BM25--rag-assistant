Suggestions for Automated Code coverage for an Eclipse RCP?

I would like to include some code coverage into our nightly build process. We're using CruiseControl, Ant, and Buckminster. Buckminster drives checkout from multiple repositories, and the PDE building and packaging of the product. Has any one any experience integrating code coverage into an RCP headless build? I have been looking at Cobertura, EMMA/EclEMMA, DbUnit though am very interested to hear of any experiences with these or any other tools.
