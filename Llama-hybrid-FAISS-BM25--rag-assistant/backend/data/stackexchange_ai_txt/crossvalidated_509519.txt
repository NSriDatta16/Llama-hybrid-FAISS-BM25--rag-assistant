Why *only* denominator(marginal likelihood) is difficult in Bayesian Inference, cant we keep track of it while calculating numerator

First, this question might give impression that it is related to several question but other don't explain the confusion regarding nominator part. For 2D, Given we have two parameters $\theta$ and $\phi$ , we have double sum/integration in denominator like below $$ \iint p(x,\theta,\phi) \,d\theta\,d\phi $$ $$\sum_{\theta=1}^{\infty} \sum_{\phi=1}^{\infty} p(x,\theta,\phi) $$ But since in numerator we compute numerator = likelihood*prior for all $\theta$ and $\phi$ as well, why can we keep track of them when doing that and add them in single operation at the end? or why numerator is not difficult as well? (NOTE: It may be very stupid question because i think I am missing some thing major)
