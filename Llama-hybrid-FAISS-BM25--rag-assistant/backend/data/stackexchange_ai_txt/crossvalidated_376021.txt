chi-square goodness of fit from the logistic regression

I am trying to get the chi-square goodness of fit from my logistic regression where the results are as below. Call: glm(formula = Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 , family = binomial(link = "logit"), data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.0236 -0.7555 -0.5823 0.5303 2.7839 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 3.00E-01 1.51E-01 1.984 0.04725 * X1 -5.74E-02 2.35E-03 -24.461 Then I run the following code to get the goodness of fit and have zero as a result: > 1-pchisq(regression $null.deviance-regression$ deviance, regression $df.null-regression$ df.residual) [1] 0 I think this means my model fits well but I wonder whether I can use the regression $null.deviance-regression$ deviance as my chi-square value that I report which is quite large as 2446.95. Is this right?
