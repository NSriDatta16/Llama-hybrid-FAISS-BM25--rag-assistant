a) no, you cannot truncate a log that is part of a mirrored database. backing the logs up is your best option. I have several databases that are setup with mirroring simply based on teh HA needs but DR is not required for various reasons. That seems to be your situation? I would really still recommend keeping the log backups for a period of time. No reason to kill a perfectly good recovery plan that is added by your HA strategy. :) b) My own solutions for this are to have a secondary agent job that monitors based on the status of the mirror. If the mirror is found to change, the secondary job on teh mirror instance is enabled and if possible, the old principal is disabled. if the principal was down and it comes back up, the job is still disabled. the only way the jobs themselves would be switched back is the event of again, another forced failover.
