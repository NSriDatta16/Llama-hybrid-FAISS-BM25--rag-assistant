What's the most efficient way to locate and set element values in an XDocument?

Given the following XML 'template': {USERNAME} {PASSWORD} {CLIENT-ID} {SERVICE-ID} Using XDocument, what's the best way to set the values in curly braces. I got so far but got stuck on the best way to select each of the three nodes inside the element. This is just a small fragment of XML, others may have up to 20 elements. The the way the XML is constructed wasn't my creation, it's what we have to sent to our supplier's 'web service'...before anyone has a laugh at the format="counting" attribute :) @David - cheers for the response, appreciated. I was kinda hoping it'd be a bit more elegant, kinda along the lines of: List e = doc.Descendants("a").ToList(); e.Where(x => x.Attributes("name") == "username").Single().Value = "abc"; e.Where(x => x.Attributes("name") == "password").Single().Value = "abc"; Clearly the code above doesn't work but I thought there would be an elegant one liner for each of the tags
