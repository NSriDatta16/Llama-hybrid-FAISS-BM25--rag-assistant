Microsoft has an excellent set of guidelines on class library design , including a section on naming . In short (examples in parentheses): Classes/Structs: PascalCase ( WebRequest ) Interfaces: PascalCase with I prefix ( IDisposable ) Methods: PascalCase ( ToUpper ) Properties: PascalCase ( Length ) Events: PascalCase ( Click ) Namespaces: PascalCase ( System.Collections ; unusual to have two words in one part though) Non-constant variables including parameters: camelCased ( keySelector ) Constants: PascalCase ( Int32.MaxValue ) Enums: PascalCase, singular for non-flags and plural for flags ( HttpStatusCode , BindingFlags ) Attributes: PascalCase with "Attribute" suffix ( ThreadStaticAttribute ) Private names are up to you, but I tend to follow the same conventions as for everything else. Hungarian notation (in the style of Win32) is discouraged, although many places use "m_" or "_" as a prefix for instance variables.
