Automatic classification of outliers

I have the following plot of data: and I am trying to separate the main part of the data with the outliers that are far away from the main data (for example the data found at around x=250, around x=300, around x=150 and around x=50 which are clear by eye but I need an automatic way to do it). I cannot fit the data with a particular equation because the data do not look the same in every data set I have, but the outliers that I want to find are always visible by eye like in this plot. I tried to use k-means but the clusters it finds is the left peak and the right peak which is not what I want. Do you have any suggestions on how to separate the main data from the outliers? Maybe an unsupervised learning method? I am not very familiar with machine learning and I am using MATLAB to do this.
