Interpretation of interaction between a PC and a continuous predictor on a logical response

I'm using lme4 in R to test the effect of various continuous explanatory variables, some of which I've corrected for their collinearity using PCA, on a logical response variable. My optimal model includes a significant interaction between my first principal component and a predictor variable (external to the PCs) which has a positive regression coefficient. I'm not quite sure how to interpret this two-way interaction. Does Fs_abundance increase with an unit increase of the positive loadings and decrease of negative loadings of PC1 and that increases the likelihood of success of my response variable? a12 |z|) (Intercept) -4.6814 3.9753 -1.178 0.239 Fs_abundance 2.1215 2.8837 0.736 0.462 PC1 -0.9542 1.7018 -0.561 0.575 Fs_abundance:PC1 3.5402 2.7761 1.275 0.202 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) Fs_bnd PC1 Fs_abundanc -0.713 PC1 0.759 -0.758 Fs_bndn:PC1 -0.684 0.427 -0.123 a13 Chisq) a13 4 19.640 22.197 -5.8201 11.640 a12 5 16.721 19.916 -3.3605 6.721 4.9192 1 0.02656 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
