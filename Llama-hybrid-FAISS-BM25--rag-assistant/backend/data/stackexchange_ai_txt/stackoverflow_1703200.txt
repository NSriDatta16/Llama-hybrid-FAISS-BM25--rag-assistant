I've got to say that this is a bit esoteric; if it were possible to map your association thusly it would most likely perform rather abysmally (unless both tables involved are pretty small). But, as far as I know, it's not possible: You can't map an association over OR'ed columns directly You can't use any join type other than cross join over entities not connected by association. You can't specify custom loader for anything other than collection - does your tableB hold collection elements for tableA rows? Even if that's the case, you would only be able to use this Loader for straight-up collection retrieval; it won't work as part of more complex HQL query.
