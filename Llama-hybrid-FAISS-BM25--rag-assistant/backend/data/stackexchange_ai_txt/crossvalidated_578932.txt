Reproducing kernel hilbert space norm as smoothness functional

Let $K:X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a Mercer kernel with an associated RKHS $H$ then the norm $|f|_H^2$ can be used as a way to ensure that $f$ is smooth in $H$ . If i understand correctly, since $f = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i K_{x_i}$ then by minimizing $|f|_h^2$ , we are trying to minimize the coefficients $a_i$ . Am i understanding it correctly ? The reference paper can be found at https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v7/belkin06a.html
