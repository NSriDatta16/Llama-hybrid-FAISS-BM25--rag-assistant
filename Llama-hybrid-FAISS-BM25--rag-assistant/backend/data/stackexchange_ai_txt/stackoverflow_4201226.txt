Digital code signing is not required for an applet deployed using a Plug-In 2 (PI2 - 1.6.0_10+) architecture JRE. In a PI2 JRE, an embedded applet can access all the services normally only available to Java Web Start apps. The services of interest to this applet would be the FileOpenService (FOS), and the PersistenceService (PS). The FOS could be used to allow the user to navigate to a File (or rather - a FileContents) object and obtain streams from it. Once the user is happy with the cropped image, save in to the PS for later retrieval (using ImageIO, as already mentioned).
