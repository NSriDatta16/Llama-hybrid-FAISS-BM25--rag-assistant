Understanding a C++ codebase by generating UML - tools&methology

I think there are many tools that can generate UML and similar diagrams from C++ (source-code), but I think it is not so easy to make sense of what you get out? I am looking for good tools/procedures. For example I might want to see the GUI-layer and how it is separated (or not from the rest). Think the tools should somehow help me detect packages, and also let me manually organize it.
