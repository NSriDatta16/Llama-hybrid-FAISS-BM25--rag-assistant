If the data lives in a single database (as most data for the applications that we write in general does), then I use an IDENTITY . It's easy, intended to be used that way, doesn't fragment the clustered index and is more than enough. You'll run out of room at 2 billion some records (~ 4 billion if you use negative values), but you'd be toast anyway if you had that many records in one table, and then you have a data warehousing problem. If the data lives in multiple, independent databases or interfaces with a third-party service, then I'll use the GUID that was likely already generated. A good example would be a UserProfiles table in the database that maps users in Active Directory to their user profiles in the application via their objectGUID that Active Directory assigned to them.
