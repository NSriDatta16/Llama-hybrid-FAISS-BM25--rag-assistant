Without knowing details about your various Foobar-related controllers, it would be difficult to provide advice on how to better organize them. However, you might want to ask yourself: Why do you have multiple controllers in the first place? Is there a good reason why these controllers cannot be combined in some way? Can a shared base controller/module simplify the situation? In general, it's best to take a DRY approach. Logic that is repeated should be consolidated into one location.
