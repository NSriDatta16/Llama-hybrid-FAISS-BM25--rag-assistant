Error when wrapping the view of a 3rd-party Django app? (Facebook, django-socialregistration, django-profiles)

I'm using django-socialregistration to manage my site's connection with Facebook. When a user clicks the "Connect with Facebook" button, I am able to automatically create a new Django user and log them in. However, I also need to create a UserProfile (my AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE) record for them which contains their Facebook profile information (email, name, location). I believe I need to override socialregistration's "setup" view so I can do what I need to do with UserProfile. I've added the following to my project's urls.py file: url( r'^social/setup/$', 'myapp.views.socialreg.pre_setup', name='socialregistration_setup'), My custom view is here "/myapp/views/socialreg.py" and looks like: from socialregistration.forms import UserForm def pre_setup(request, template='socialregistration/setup.html', form_class=UserForm, extra_context=dict()): # will add UserProfile storage here... return socialregistration.views.setup(request, template, form_class, extra_context) The socialregistration view signature I'm overriding looks like this: def setup(request, template='socialregistration/setup.html', form_class=UserForm, extra_context=dict()): ... I'm getting the error "ViewDoesNotExist at /social/setup/: Could not import myapp.views.socialreg. Error was: No module named socialregistration.views" when I try the solution above. The socialregistration app is working fine when I don't try to override the view, so it is likely installed correctly in site-packages. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
