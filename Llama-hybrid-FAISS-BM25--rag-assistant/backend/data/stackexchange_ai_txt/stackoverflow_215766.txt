How can you reference code written in another language in the App_Code folder in ASP.Net?

Due to legacy issues I have two folders under App_Code directory. One for VB.Net and another for C#. Problem is, I have a service in the C# folder that needs to leverage a class in the VB.Net folder but they dont seem to know about each other. Any ideas are welcome :) Thanks in advance! Trev
