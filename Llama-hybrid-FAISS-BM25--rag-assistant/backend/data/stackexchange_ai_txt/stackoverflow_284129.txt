If you really want to use ReadOnlyCollection , the issue is that the constructor of ReadOnlyCollection takes an IList , while the KeyCollection of the Dictionary is only a ICollection . So if you want to wrap the KeyCollection in a ReadOnlyCollection, you'll have to create an adapter (or wrapper) type, implementing IList , wrapping the KeyCollection. So it would look like: var dictionary = ...; var readonly_keys = new ReadOnlyCollection (new CollectionListWrapper (dictionary.Keys) ); Not very elegant though, especially as the KeyCollection is already a readonly collection, and that you could simply pass it around as an ICollection :)
