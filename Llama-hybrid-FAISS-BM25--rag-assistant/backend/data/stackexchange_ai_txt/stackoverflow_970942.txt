Can I store sums of values in xsl?

Say I have an Xml fragment that I am walking through with XSL: Basically what I want to do is, as I am walking through each node, I need to store a sum of the previous 'width' attributes to be used for the current Column node. For example, when I reach the last Column node (with width 33), I would like to have access to the sum of the all the previous widths in a variable of some kind (100+50+75). I know that values of variables cannot be changed once set in XSL, so I'm wondering if there is some way using template params or something to do this. Thanks in advance!
