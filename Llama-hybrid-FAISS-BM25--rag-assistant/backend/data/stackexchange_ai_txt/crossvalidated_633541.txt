It's tricky to try to work with the hazard per se in a Cox model, as it isn't directly estimated. The Cox model's regression coefficient for a predictor is the log-hazard difference versus its reference value. After the model is fit you can then estimate the hazard function for a set of reference predictor values and adjust it for other predictor values, but that hazard will be exactly 0 between event times. What you seem to be doing it to calculate an average hazard over some period of time (cumulative hazard at time $t$ divided by $t$ ) as a function of the continuous predictor. I'd be reluctant to do that, as that depends on the choice of time span, with cumulative hazards unbounded over time. See Wikipedia . What's typically done in this situation is to start with reference values for all predictors in the model.* For example, choose the average value of your continuous predictor as its reference, and choose representative values of the other predictors. Then make a set of predictions (with confidence intervals) from the model, relative to that set of reference values, over a range of values of your continuous predictor of interest. You can then plot the linear predictor (log-hazard) from the model or exponentiate it to get the hazard ratio with respect to the reference condition. One warning: if you include only a single term for a continuous predictor in your model, the model assumes that the log-hazard is linearly associated with the predictor value. That's often not a good assumption. If you did that, then the plot I recommend will be a straight line on the log-hazard scale. You should consider modeling a continuous predictor flexibly, for example via a regression spline. See Chapter 2 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies , for example. *Software for fitting Cox models chooses a set of reference values, but the default choices might not necessarily make sense for your application.
