Burroughs was one of the first to use something other than assembler for OS development. They chose a dialect of Algol. In 1965 Multics(Project MAC, funded by ARPA) design began and PL/I was chosen to develop the OS. In 1969 Multics was opened for use at MIT, but there were frustrations and Bell Labs withdrew from Project MAC. Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna continued to seek the holy grail and Unics (later Unix) development began. Multics History Multics Failure? Unix v. Multics
