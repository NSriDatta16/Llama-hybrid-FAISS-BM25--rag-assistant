Yourkit is a great tool that I've used on MANY occasions to find and document performance issues. Eclipse with the TPTP framework can be used to do this as well. It also works well against remote application servers (you need to enable profiling agents and turn on remote debugging in the JVM), but it lets you run profiling against pretty much any J2EE environment.
