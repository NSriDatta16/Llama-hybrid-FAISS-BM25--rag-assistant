It is inconsistent to normalize at any particular fixed percentage like 5% for each factor. For example, for 25 factors, the average weight would be 4% such that reweighing is not possible while maintaining each factor >5%. However, what is being attempted is to introduce memory to an algorithm. One way to do that is to use a running average of some type. For that, a cumulative, exponential, or weighted memory will never drop factors entirely. A simple moving average of the last $n$ trials can drop factors when $n>N$ and $N$ is the number of trials.
