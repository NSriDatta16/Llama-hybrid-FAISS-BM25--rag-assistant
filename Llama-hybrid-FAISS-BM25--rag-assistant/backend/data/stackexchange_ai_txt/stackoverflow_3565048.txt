ASP.NET MVC 2 - Avoiding repeatedly querying the database for static data?

What can I do to avoid the repeated loading of static data every time a page is loaded in ASP.NET MVC2? This is pretty wasteful, and I would like to fix it. My master page has the typical User Name + Company Name display in the top right corner. But because of the stateless nature of MVC, this data has to be looked up every single time a page is loaded, even though it never changes. In the old webforms days I would just throw it into Session, but that seems to be discouraged in MVC. Plus the web app runs on a webfarm, so I really do not want to use session. The web app already has quite a few static data items that get queried on every page load (user currency, user tax rate, etc), so I think a performance gain can be made by loading them only once at login time. I'm just not sure what the correct MVC method is (I am still quite new to MVC).
