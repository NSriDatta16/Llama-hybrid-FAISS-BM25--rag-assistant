This sort of thing is actually common. You basically need to model a dataset produced by the self-join of your datatable. The main difficulty with this is sometimes the joined dataset is n^2 big or similar, but if your number of trials per person is much smaller than the number of people, you shouldn't have much of an issue. There is a symmetry that results in the input dataset but it is natural because you are modeling a continuous domain (i.e. time). These convolutional analysis topics are common in time series and image processing.
