It's not actually possible to "reliably" parse a user-agent string; several common User-Agent strings violate HTTP 1.1 (I forget the RFC number) WRT the characters allowed between the parentheses (. or / or ; or something?). User-Agent sniffing is pretty fragile when you want to "whitelist" certain features and leads to complaints about preferential treatment of some browsers over others (especially when it's Microsoft doing it), and means that someone has to keep giant regex updated. Is there really no better way (e.g. with JavaScript?) to detect the features that the browser supports? Nevertheless, you can do something like ; *CPU +iPhone +OS +(4_(2|[3-9]|\d\d)|[5-9]|\d\d)\[0-9a-zA-Z_]* +like +Mac +OS +X *; .
