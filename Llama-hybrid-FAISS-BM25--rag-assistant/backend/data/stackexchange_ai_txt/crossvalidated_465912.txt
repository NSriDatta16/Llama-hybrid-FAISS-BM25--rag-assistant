Dealing with Heteroskedasticity in Estimated Dependent Variable model

I work on my research in finance concerning pricing of green bonds and I am running a two stage model. Stage 1 regression is an unbalanced panel fixed effects estimation . For each of my 100 green bonds in the sample, I compare its daily ask yield to an ask yield of a similar conventional bond and estimate the difference while controlling for the difference in their liquidity: (yield.green - yield.conventional) ~ (liquidity.green - liquidity.conventional) I am particularly interested in the individual effects captured by the intercepts - for each of my 100 green bonds, I save the estimated individual fixed effect which tells me if that bond sells for a higher price than its conventional counterpart. I call this fixed effect a "green premium". Stage 2 model is on OLS regression of "green premium" on bond's characteristics , e.g.: green.premium ~ maturity + issue.amount + currency + sector Now the problematic part comes: Since my dependent variable "green premium" is an estimate coming from the Stage 1 regression, I need to deal with heteroskedasticity, although Breusch Pagan test does not reveal any signs of heteroskedasticity. Is any of these two remedies a good solution for my case: Use Weighted Least Squares - for this case, shall I use the inverse of the squared standard error of the indivudual fixed effects from Stage 1 - 1/(SE^2)- as the weightes? Use White's SE ?
