Although SharePoint technically uses SQL as a storage backing, we're not supposed to treat it like a database-based application. SP creates a faux-filesystem of sorts, which is what we interact with via the API. So from the developer perspective, Sharepoint is pretty much transaction-less. Unfortunately that's pretty much all there is to it :) Even thinking about trying to get involved with the database directly will result in Old Testament pain. Rending of garments, wailing and gnashing of teeth ;)
