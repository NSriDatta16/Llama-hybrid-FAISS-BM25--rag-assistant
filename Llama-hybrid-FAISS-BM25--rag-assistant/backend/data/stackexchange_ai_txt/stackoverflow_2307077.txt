This would happen in every language, think of it this way AreEqual(s, s.upcase()) vs. AreEqual(s, s.upcase!()) In both cases, the upcase(!) function has to be called before it can be passed to AreEqual, and in the upcase!() case, it actually changes the value of s . upcase() returns a new string with the uppercased version of s.
