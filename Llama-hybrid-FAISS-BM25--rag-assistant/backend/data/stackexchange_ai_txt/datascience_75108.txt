German Chatbot or conversational AI

I want to build a chatbot mostly BERT(Transformer) based in the German Language. But I do not find any German chatbot data set! So does it make sense to use google translator API to translate the English dataset to German and then train the model on it? Any idea where I can find German datasets or solve this issue?
