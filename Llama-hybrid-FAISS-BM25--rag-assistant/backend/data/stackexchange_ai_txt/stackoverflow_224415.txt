Usually when PDF shows blank text, it's because the font metrics are embedded in the document, but the glyphs are not. I know nothing about ColdFusion, but you might try the following: Try a font other than Tahoma as a test. All PDF readers must support 14 basic fonts, including 4 Helvetica variants, 4 Times variants, 4 Courier variants, Symbol and ZapfDingbats, so those are always safe choices See if ColdFusion offers any control over font embedding Try a list of alternatives in your font declaration, like "Tahoma,Helvetica,sans-serif"
