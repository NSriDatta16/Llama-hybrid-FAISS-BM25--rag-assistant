jquery ui drag/drop getting position from multiple draggables

I have a droppable container with >1 draggables in it. I want to simply be able to see the position of each draggable every time any one of them is dragged. Sounds easy, but I'm having a tough time figuring it out. Here's what I have: $(function() { $("#draggable").draggable({ containment: '#droppable' }); $("#draggable2").draggable({ containment: '#droppable' }); $("#droppable").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { document.getElementById('position1').value = ui.position.top + ', ' + ui.position.left; } }); }); Basically, where I have the position1 input id gathering the position, I want to have a second line do the same thing for the other draggable.
