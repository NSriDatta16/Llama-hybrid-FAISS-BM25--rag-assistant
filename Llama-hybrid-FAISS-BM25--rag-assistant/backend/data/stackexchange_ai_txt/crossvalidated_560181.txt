Broadly, there are three types of method for dealing with missing data: model-based imputation, donor imputation, and scalar imputation. Scalar imputation is the simplest method, but doesn't always make sense. It involves replacing the missing values with a single value, such as zero or the mean/median of the column. Donor imputation involves replacing missing values with values from other "donor" rows. There are different methods for selecting the donor - e.g. k nearest neighbours is often used to select donors with similar characteristics. In model-based imputation we assume a relationship between the missing variable and other variables in the data, and try to model the missing variable using prediction methods - e.g. regression or random forest. The R package simputation contains various different methods and implementations of all three broad approaches. Note that some machine learning algorithms can manage missing values without needing to impute e.g. gradient boosted trees.
