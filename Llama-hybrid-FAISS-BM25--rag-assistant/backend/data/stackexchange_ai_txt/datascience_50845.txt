Since we don't have a lot of info, this is how I would have opted to work on it. Get a huge amount of text related to movies Use a movie ontology, for example this one Train a classifier to identify the movie title and the production company in the data I already have Then on another dataset, apply POS-tagging ( for details here ) Use the POS-tagging (maybe with extra features) and the labels from (3) to train another classifier (probably a neural network) and identify if any word is a movie or a production company Whenever you feel your model underperform, do the same from start.
