How should I approach analysis of many binary predictors and one continuous outcome?

beginner here. I have a spreadsheet with data from 70 videos. Most of the data is binary (ex: is this mentioned or not) with one outcome variable (conversion rate). What would be a general process to analyze, and how do I measure significance? My approach: look at the videos for more context visualize data using box plots to find interesting relationships (I've been told I should figure which predictor variables are most important but not sure how) run two way t-tests to assess significance (I've been told to consider logistic regression or one-way ANOVA as well, but not too sure) Any help would be appreciated.
