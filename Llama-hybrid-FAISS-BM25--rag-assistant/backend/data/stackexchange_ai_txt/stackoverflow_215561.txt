I like all the answers that say you should use a tool like Doxygen to get a class diagram, and first try to understand the big picture. I totally agree with this. That said, this largely depends on how well factored the code is to begin with. If its a gigantic mess, it's going to be hard to learn. If its clean, and organized properly, it shouldn't be that bad.
