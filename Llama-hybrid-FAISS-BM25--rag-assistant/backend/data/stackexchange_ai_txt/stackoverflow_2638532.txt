Help with an AJAX request

The Problem I am tring to do an ajax request to a PHP script, however I am having a problem getting the data into the format that the PHP is expecting it, the PHP is expecting the data to come in as array within an array something like, Array ( [cv_file] => Array ( [849649717] => Y [849649810] => Y ) [save] => Save CVs ) What have I tried? I have tried in my javascript to create an empty array and use that as the array key, something like this, var cv_file = new Array(); $(".drag_check").draggable({helper:"clone", opacity:"0.5"}); $(".searchPage").droppable({ accept:".drag_check", hoverClass: "dropHover", drop: function(ev, ui) { var droppedItem = ui.draggable.children(); cv_file = ui.draggable.children().attr('name'); var link = ui.draggable.children().attr('name').substr(ui.draggable.children().attr('name').indexOf("[")+1, ui.draggable.children().attr('name').lastIndexOf("]")-8) $.ajax({ type:"POST", url:"/search", data:cv_file+"&save=Save CVs", success:function(){ alert(cv_file) $('.shortList').append(' '+link+' '); }, error:function() { alert("Somthing has gone wrong"); } }); } }); My Question How can I get the data into the format that the PHP is expecting, I would appreciate any help that anyone can give? Edit On alerting what the poster in the comments suggested I get he following, cv_file[849649717]&save=Save CVs Thank you
