The purpose of complexity measures like cyclomatic are about measuring the structure of a program as it affects the programmer's ability to understand the codebase; e.g. to maintain it. Since programmers view code at the source level, measures of source code complexity are what really matter. If the measures you are getting by analysing bytecode files are different from regular source code measures, they are worthless and you should abandon the idea. (It wouldn't surprise me for CC measures from bytecode files are different. On the one hand, a compiler can reorganize code to make it appear simpler; e.g. by unrolling loops. On the other hand, a compiler may need to generate complex looking bytecode sequences for simple language constructs, simply because of limitations in what bytecodes can express.)
