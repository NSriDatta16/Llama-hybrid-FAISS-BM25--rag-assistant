Intro to Machine Learning

I do not know if this is the right place to ask such a generic question, if not please let me know and I will remove it asap. Well, I am a Software Engineering student (BEng hons) and this September my 3rd year starts and therefore I have to start my final year project. I want to do something in Machine Learning and more specifically in Prediction Algorithms . I would like to do predictions for stock prices etc. I have been reading a book provided by my university online the last days, but it doesnt make that much sense as there are a lot of algorithms and different approaches. What algorithms would work for the project I want to do???? Do you know any specific books or online courses that you would recommend? Any guidance would be really much appreciated! Thank you!
