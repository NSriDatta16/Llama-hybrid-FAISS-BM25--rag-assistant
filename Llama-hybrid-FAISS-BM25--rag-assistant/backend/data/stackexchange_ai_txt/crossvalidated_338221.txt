Don't do a single test, you should do k-fold cross validation : Fold 1 = you train on 1-80 and test on 81-100, Fold 2 = train on 1-60 and 81-100 then test on 61-80, Fold 3 = train on 1-40 and 61-100 then test on 41-60. etc. In the end you can average the different test results, this should even out the influence of chosing a particular test set. And yes: Keeping a validation set is always a good idea. Whether you should chose your folds randomly or ordered depends on the context. Ideally, your observations should be completely independent and thus it should not matter asymptotically. In practice people usually prefer randomized folds because it kills any bias introduced by your (presumably arbitrary) ordering of observations.
