DataMapper: Putting a model into a model

In the DataMapper documentation for associations I found an example where they put a model into a model like... 1 class Person 2 3 class Link 4 5 include DataMapper::Resource 6 7 storage_names[:default] = 'people_links' 8 9 # the person who is following someone 10 belongs_to :follower, 'Person', :key => true 11 12 # the person who is followed by someone 13 belongs_to :followed, 'Person', :key => true 14 15 end 16 17 include DataMapper::Resource 18 19 property :id, Serial 20 property :name, String, :required => true 21 ... Does it have any influence on the result you get back or is it just another notation or format? Thanks in advance, rufus
