Is any specific handler required for http request of content-type : JSON on Apache?

My request header : GET /abs/ad-content/id/1277954_1 HTTP/1.1 Host: myhost.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */* Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest please note: Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 But it seems my server can not process it. $request->getHeader('Content-Type'); is returned empty by server. Do I need to add some handler/Mime Type to get it work? Edit: This header is present on my windows Apache localhost but missing on Bluehost Apache shared server.
