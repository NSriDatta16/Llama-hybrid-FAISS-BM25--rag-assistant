Using the WCF Data Services client for Azure Table Storage - storing graphs of objects

I am working with Azure Table storage using the .NET API (TableServiceContext, WCF Data Service, etc). I have a simple graph of objects that I want to save to the table store. In the service context class, I have the following code. _TableClient.CreateTableIfNotExist("AggRootTable"); this.AddObject("AggRoots", model); foreach (var related in model.RelatedObjects) { this.AddRelatedObject(model, "RelatedCollection", related); } this.SaveChanges(); I have used this style of code in WCF Data Services via EF and a SQL Server, but it doesn't work against Azure Tables. I would not expect it to, as there aren't real relationships between tables in Azure. However, the methods are there. Does anyone know how to use AddRelatedObject, AddLink, etc in the context of Azure Tables? Or can suggest approaches to storing object graphs in general? I haven't been able to find any docs, and Google hasn't been helpful. Thanks, Erick
