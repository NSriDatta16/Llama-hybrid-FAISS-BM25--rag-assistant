input of while loop to come from output of `command`

#I used to have this, but I don't want to write to the disk # pcap="somefile.pcap" tcpdump -n -r $pcap > all.txt while read line; do ARRAY[$c]="$line" c=$((c+1)) done The following fails to work. # I would prefer something like... # pcap="somefile.pcap" while read line; do ARRAY[$c]="$line" c=$((c+1)) done Too few results on Google (doesn't understand what I want to find :( ).
