Resizable, draggable object in jquery. Possible?

I want to have an object which is both resizable and draggable. I'll need: X Y Size of the object. Is this possible? There is an example on http://www.jsfiddle.net/davidThomas/DGbT3/1/ which gets the x and y of the draggable object. How can I also make it resizable? Thanks It's worth adding that this question is related to, and built on, this previous question: How to get the position of a draggable object?
