Using predictors features and results to create a new one

I work with bioinformatics and I'm completely new to machine learning, so I don't know if this idea is viable. There are several predictors that try to predict the molecular nature of a set of a given genes. They use different ML methods (SVM, logistic regression, random forests etc.) and different sets of features in order to achieve that. Recently, I had the idea of using the features used by these predictors, as well as their final scores, as features of a new predictor that I would train using a public dataset with known labels. After running using the predictors on the dataset and obtaining additional metrics that could be used as features, I had a dataset of 72124 observations with 27 features. The dataset was unbalanced, as one label totals ~75% of the samples. So, I divided the dataset semi-randomly into a testing (20%) and a training/validation (80%) subsets that had the same proportions of the labels (25:75). I've chosen to use SVM because it seamed adequate to my dataset and libSVM is quite simple to use. The parameters were chosen using the package's tool that does cross-validation with the training data in order to reduce overfitting. After training the algorithm, I've tested it in the test dataset and obtained great results (accuracy = 0.993, AUC = 0.9992). Now, I'm uneasy because this seems too good to be true. Is my approach correct? EDIT: Here are some metrics of the classifiers: | | Accuracy | Sensibility | Specificity | F1 Score | Youden's J | AUC | |---------------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------|-------| | Classifier 1 | 0,929 | 0,964 | 0,920 | 0,837 | 0,884 | 0,986 | | Classifier 2 | 0,866 | 0,962 | 0,844 | 0,732 | 0,806 | 0,962 | | Classifier 3 | 0,749 | 0,986 | 0,693 | 0,599 | 0,679 | 0,959 | | Classifier 4 | 0,898 | 0,947 | 0,886 | 0,778 | 0,833 | 0,933 | | Classifier 5 | 0,937 | 0,946 | 0,935 | 0,852 | 0,882 | 0,981 | | Classifier 6 | 0,608 | 0,867 | 0,547 | 0,457 | 0,415 | 0,889 | | Classifier 7 | 0,712 | 0,907 | 0,666 | 0,545 | 0,573 | 0,859 | | | | | | | | | | My classifier | 0,993 | 0,984 | 0,995 | 0,981 | 0,978 | 0,999 |
