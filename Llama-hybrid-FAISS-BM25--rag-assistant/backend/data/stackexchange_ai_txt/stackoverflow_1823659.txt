Further to Phillip Ngan's answer, SOAP or otherwise, you cannot XML serialize objects that implements IDictionary. Q: Why can't I serialize hashtables? A: The XmlSerializer cannot process classes implementing the IDictionary interface. This was partly due to schedule constraints and partly due to the fact that a hashtable does not have a counterpart in the XSD type system. The only solution is to implement a custom hashtable that does not implement the IDictionary interface. from here
