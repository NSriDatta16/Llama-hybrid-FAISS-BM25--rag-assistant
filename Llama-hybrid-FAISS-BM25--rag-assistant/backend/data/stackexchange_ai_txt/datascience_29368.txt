Check if change in time serie influence change in another time serie

I have two time series representing scores, lets call it score A - score B, score A is related to a company and it is observed every year from 1990 (about 27 observation) score B is related to a product and it is observed every quarter from 2016 I would like to check if changes in score A influence change in the score B, but I don't know where to start.
