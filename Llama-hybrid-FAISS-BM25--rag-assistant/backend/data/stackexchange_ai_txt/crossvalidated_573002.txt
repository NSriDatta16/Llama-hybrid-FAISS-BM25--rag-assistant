To be clear, your table suggests strategies, but the 'round' numbers would be unusual for real data. You'd need data consisting of counts of punches from boxing matches between boxer A and each of opponents 1 through 5. These might be as in the fictitious data of the table TAB below, sampled in R. Note that 1=jab, 2=hook, etc., the elements of p are scaled to add to unity, and wee assume 400 punches per match are randomly sampled. (If there is no proportion argument in sample , then equally likely punches are assumed.) set.seed(2022) x1 = sample(1:4, 400, rep=T, p = 1:4) x2 = sample(1:4, 400, rep=T) x3 = sample(1:4, 400, rep=T, p = 1:4) x4 = sample(1:4, 400, rep=T) x5 = sample(1:4, 400, rep=T) t1 = tabulate(x1); t2 = tabulate(x2) t3 = tabulate(x3); t4 = tabulate(x4) t5 = tabulate(x5) TAB = cbind(t1, t2, t3, t4, t5); TAB t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 [1,] 35 96 36 94 90 [2,] 88 103 68 104 112 [3,] 122 109 118 104 80 [4,] 155 92 178 98 118 Then a chi-squared test on TAB shows that types of punches are not homogeneously used against the five opponents. The P-value is nearly $0,$ so the differences in strategies against various opponents is significant at any reasonable significance level. The observed numbers of punches are shown in TAB . Under the null hypothesis of homogeneity, the expected counts would be as shown below: chisq.test(TAB, cor=F)$exp t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 [1,] 70.2 70.2 70.2 70.2 70.2 [2,] 95.0 95.0 95.0 95.0 95.0 [3,] 106.6 106.6 106.6 106.6 106.6 [4,] 128.2 128.2 128.2 128.2 128.2 The chi-squared statistic is the sum of the squared Pearson residuals. By looking at residuals with the largest absolute values, we can see where the major disagreements between observed and expected counts lie. chisq.test(TAB, cor=F)$res t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 [1,] -4.2012073 3.0792940 -4.081855 2.8405890 2.3631791 [2,] -0.7181848 0.8207827 -2.770142 0.9233805 1.7441632 [3,] 1.4915648 0.2324517 1.104145 -0.2518226 -2.5763392 [4,] 2.3669593 -3.1971614 4.398305 -2.6672451 -0.9008576 Not surprisingly, they draw attention strategies against opponents 1 and 3 (equally likely punches) and the other three opponents for which left and right upper punches are favored. It might be interesting to look at a "collapsed" $2 \times 2$ table with two opponent types (1,3) vs (2,4,5) and two types of punches (jabs, hooks) and the other two together.
