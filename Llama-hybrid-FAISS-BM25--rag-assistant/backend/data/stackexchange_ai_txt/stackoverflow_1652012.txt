Organize imports with Maven2, Eclipse-style?

I'm a lone Emacs user in a group that's hung up on Eclipse. Time and again, code diffs are made larger by imports that have been "organized" or "cleaned up" by Eclipse. I don't have a strong opinion on the subject of import style in Java, but I do want to minimize our diffs. What can I do? We use Maven2 for builds; is there a plugin that can help me? Can a piece of Eclipse be abstracted out & turned into a Maven plugin? I currently use ImportScrubber and have encountered a few other stand-alone pieces that do the same thing. What I'm really looking for is a Maven plugin that can integrate with the build. Barring the above, I'll put an ImportScrubber invocation into my .git/hooks/post-commit .
