Parsing Random Web Pages

I need to parse a bunch of random pages and add them to a DB. I am thinking of using regular expressions but I was wondering if there are any 'special' techniques (other than looking for content between known text/tags). The content is more(not always) like: Some Title Text related to Title I guess I don't need to extract complete Text but some way to know where the Title/Paragraph and extract the content from there. The content itself may have images/links that I would like to retain. Thanks!
