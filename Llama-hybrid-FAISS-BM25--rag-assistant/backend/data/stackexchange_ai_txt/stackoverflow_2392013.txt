You could run a query to get the users that match each of the conditions and intersect the results. Since MySQL doesn't support intersect you can do it with an n-way join: SELECT T1.user_id FROM Table1 T1 JOIN Table1 T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id WHERE T1.field_id = 1 AND T1.value = 'Gandalf' AND T2.field_id = 2 AND T2.value = 'Glamdring'
