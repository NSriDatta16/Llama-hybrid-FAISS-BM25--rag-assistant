Autoregressive vs integrated time series model

An autoregressive series is of the form $$ X_t = c + \varphi_1 X_{t-1} + \varphi_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \varepsilon_t $$ An integrated series is of the form $$ (1-B)^d X_t = \varepsilon_t $$ However, it seems to me that this is just a special case of the autoregressive series with $\phi_k = (-1)^k\binom{n}{k}$ and $c=0$. Is this really the case? If so, why is worth naming? For context: I can only find any mention of integrated models in ARIMA models, so I was wondering why they appear there but nowhere else.
