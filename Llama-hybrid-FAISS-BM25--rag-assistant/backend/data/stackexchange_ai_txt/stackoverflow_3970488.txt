Import MS Word form fields into MS Access

I have created an application form using MS Word and a whole bunch of form fields, and I have an Access db that can import all the data I need from this Word doc, thanks to this: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa155434%28office.10%29.aspx Now everything works just fine (I even managed to get it to import into multiple tables!), but the problem with the above is that I have to manually enter the name of each file one at a time... which is fine if it's just a case of importing the application form as it comes in... but I have quite a lot sitting in a folder that needs entered into the database. Then I found this: How to show "Open File" Dialog in Access 2007 VBA? I've tried to tweak and merge the two to make it work... but as you can guess, to no avail... (it doesn't help when I'm very much an Access novice!) What I am looking to do is to be able to import a bunch of Word docs / form fields into MS Access by using the Open / Select file dialogue box... what I've got works, but I'd like to make it easier to work with! Thanks everyone Jake ##### Codes I been using Option Compare Database Option Explicit Private Sub cmdFileDialog_Click() ' This requires a reference to the Microsoft Office 11.0 Object Library. Dim fDialog As Office.FileDialog Dim varFile As Variant Dim appWord As Word.Application Dim doc As Word.Document ' Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection ' Dim rst As New ADODB.Recordset Dim strDocName As String Dim blnQuitWord As Boolean ' Clear the list box contents. ' Me.FileList.RowSource = "" ' Set up the File dialog box. Set fDialog = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker) With fDialog ' Allow the user to make multiple selections in the dialog box. .AllowMultiSelect = True ' Set the title of the dialog box. .Title = "Select One or More Files" ' Clear out the current filters, and then add your own. .Filters.Clear .Filters.Add "Microsoft Word", "*.DOC" .Filters.Add "All Files", "*.*" ' Show the dialog box. If the .Show method returns True, the ' user picked at least one file. If the .Show method returns ' False, the user clicked Cancel.

Cleanup: ' Set rst = Nothing ' Set cnn = Nothing Set doc = Nothing Set appWord = Nothing Next Else MsgBox "You clicked Cancel in the file dialog box." End If End With End Sub # I've tried to mess with me.tables and me!forms and .add etc etc - obviously I'm a complete novice here!!! What I want is to be able to import data from form fields in a Word Doc into a MS Access table (which I have managed to do with the first URL in my original post above); by means of selecting the Word doc from the Open/Select dialogue box, instead of manually entering the names of each Word doc. My apologies if it sounds obvious or simple - Access is not my strong point by any means!
