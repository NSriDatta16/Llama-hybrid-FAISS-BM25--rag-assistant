I agree with the previous answer, I would just add some more info. The Eclipse Modeling Framework is, in my opinion, one of the best framework implementing the OMG architecture and languages. I suggest you to use TopCased for modeling (http://www.topcased.org) it is based on EMF and provides you a good IDE for UML/SYSML modeling. You therefore might want to automatically generate some code from your models. To this end I strongly suggest you Acceleo which is an EMF compliant implementation of the MOF Models 2 Text Transformation Language and related engine.
