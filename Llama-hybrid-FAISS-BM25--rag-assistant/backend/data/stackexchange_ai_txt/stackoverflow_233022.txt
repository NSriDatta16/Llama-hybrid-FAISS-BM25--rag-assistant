Depends on what you mean by elegant, of course. function weigh(&$vals, $key, $weights) { $sum = 0; foreach($vals as $v) $sum += $v*$weights[$key]; $vals = $sum; } $result = $values; array_walk($result, "weigh", $weights); EDIT: Sorry for not reading your example better. I make result a copy of values, since array_walk works by reference.
