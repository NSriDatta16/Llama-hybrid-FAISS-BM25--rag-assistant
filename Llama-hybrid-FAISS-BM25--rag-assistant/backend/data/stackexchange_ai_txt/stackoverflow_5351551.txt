Personally I'd encourage using a form as that will give you much greater control over how you tackle any potential spam. (Personally I don't like "front end" solutions such as CAPTCHA as they're rarely user friendly - if it causes any inconvenience/additional work for your user, I generally like to see if there's a better way) Using a form also has the additional benefit of enabling you to obtain data from the contactee with some kind of structure. (I.e. it reduces the risk of someone contacting you with a question, but not providing enough info (even their name perhaps) which might help you in providing them with the best response possible.
