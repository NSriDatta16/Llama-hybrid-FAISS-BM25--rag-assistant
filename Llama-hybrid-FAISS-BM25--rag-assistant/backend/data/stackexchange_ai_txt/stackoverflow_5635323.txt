SimpleXML is a DOM parser which means that it must load the whole document into memory to be able to build an in-memory representation of the whole XML dataset. Chunking the data does not work with this type of parser. To load XML datasets that large you must switch to so called pull parser *s such as the XMLReader for example or the very low-level XML Parser extension. Pull parsers work by traversing the XML document element by element and allow you, the developer, to react according to the currently parsed element. That reduces memory footprint because only small fragments of the data have to be loaded into memory at one time. Using pull parsers is a little bit uncommon and not as intuitive as the familiar DOM parsers ( DOM and SimpleXML ).
