GWT - Relational Database with Drag and Drop Operations

I am a student and want to make the final draft with a Dynamic Schedule Manager. It was proposed to work in Java. Restriction: Should use GWT with GXT (optional) + Relational Database (eg MySql) and will operate with a Drag and Drop library. The Drag and Drop operations are going to communicate directly with the database, eg drag a student for a class. You should make an insert in the student's respective table. It's an interesting challenge, but requires a lot of knowledge. The question I ask is if anyone has experience doing something similar and could advise me where to start, what technologies to use (eg to Relational Database), best approaches, tips and so on. Note: I've already draw Database, started learning the Google Web Toolkit docs. Thanks.
