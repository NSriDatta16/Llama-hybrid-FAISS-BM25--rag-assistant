Back when I still used Windows I used to get good results speeding my build up by having all build output written to a separate partition if maybe 3 GB in size, and periodically formatting that at night once a week via a scheduled task. It's just build output, so it doesn't matter if it gets unilaterally flattened occasionally. But honestly, since moving to Linux, disk fragmentation is something I never worry about any more. Another reason to try your build on Linux, at least once, is so that you can run strace (grepped for calls to open ) to see what files your build is touching.
