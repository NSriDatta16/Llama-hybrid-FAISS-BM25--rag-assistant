You're trying to find a "typical" deviation from the mean. The variance is "the average squared distance from the mean". The standard deviation is the square root of that. That makes it the root-mean-square deviation from the mean. Why would we use the average squared deviation? What makes variance interesting? Among other things, because of a basic fact about variances - that the variance of a sum of uncorrelated variables is the sum of the individual variances. (This is covered in a number of questions e.g. here on CrossValidated. This handy feature is not shared, for example, by the mean absolute deviation. Why take the square root of that? Because then it's in the same units as the original observations. It measures a particular kind of 'typical distance' from the mean (as mentioned, the RMS distance) - but because of the above property of variance - one that has some nice features.
