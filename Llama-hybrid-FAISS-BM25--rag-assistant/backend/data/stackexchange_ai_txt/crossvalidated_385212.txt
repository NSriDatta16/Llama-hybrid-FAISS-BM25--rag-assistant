You could use a logistic regression model with estimated marginal means to do the comparisons. Here is the example in R: library(emmeans) # Data male As you can see, the estimated probabilities and their corresponding (unadjusted) 95%-confidence intervals are calculated. To judge whether a certain proportion is compatible with a 50%-sex ratio, see if 50% is contained in the respective confidence interval. In the example, the confidence intervals for locations 1 and 3 do not include 50%. Therefore, there is some evidence that the sex ratio differs from 50/50 at these locations. Now let's compare the locations: con The comparisons are made on the log-odds scale and are presented as odds ratios. Inspecting the adjusted 95%-confidence intervals and $p$ -values, we see that there is some evidence that the locations 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 differ with respect to the sex ratio. There is little evidence, however, that the sex ratio differs between locations 1 and 2. R also has a built-in function for pairwise comparisons of proportions: male The exact $p$ -values differ from those in emmeans because the adjustment for multiple comparisons differs: pairwise.prop.test uses the Holm-method whereas eammeans uses the Tukey-method by default. The conclusions remain the same, though.
