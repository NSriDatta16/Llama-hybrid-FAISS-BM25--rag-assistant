How to compute F1 score?

Recently I read about path ranking algorithm in a paper (source: Knowledge Vault: A Web-Scale Approach to Probabilistic Knowledge Fusion ). In this paper was a table (Table 3) with facts and I tried to understand how they were calculated. F1 (harmonic mean of precision and recall) = 0.04 P (precision) = 0.03 R (recall) = 0.33 W (weight given to this feature by logistic regression) I found a formula for F1 via Google which is $F1 = 2 * \frac{precision * recall}{precision + recall}$ The problem is that I get the result of 0.055 with this formula, but not the expected result of 0.04. Can someone help me to get this part? Also, does someone know how 'W' can be calculated? Thanks.
