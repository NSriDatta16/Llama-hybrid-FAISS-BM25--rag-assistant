What is 'parameter convergence'?

I'm trying to teach myself data science, with my particular interest being decision trees. A few steps in, I've come across a term, 'parameter convergence' that I can't find a definition for (because, after all, I'm learning on my own and have no access to teachers or peers): However, even in studies with much lower numbers of predictor variables, the combination of all main and interaction effects of interest – especially in the case of categorical predictor variables – may well lead to cell counts too sparse for parameter convergence . (from Strobl et al., 2009 ) A web search isn't overly helpful because convergence is such a common term, and I'm not sure which results specifically apply in the context of decision trees. And also, the results don't provide an entry-level definition. So, while a definition or explanation of parameter convergence (in the context of recursive partitioning) would be great, it would also be handy to be directed to a resource (academic or otherwise) that might have a 'glossary' of this and similar terms...
