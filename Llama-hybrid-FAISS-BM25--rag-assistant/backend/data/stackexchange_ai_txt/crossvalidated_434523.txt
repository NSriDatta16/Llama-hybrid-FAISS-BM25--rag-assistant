How to compare/choose regression models based on predictions and prediction intervals

I have two regression models M1 and M2, each delivers a prediction (blue circle) together with a prediction interval as shown in blue in the picture below. The actual value is marked with a black cross. How can I objectively compare these two models? On one hand the real value (black cross) is within the prediction interval of M1, but on the other hand the prediction (average value, blue circle) of M2 is closer to the real value. Is there a way to choose one model over the other?? Thanks in advance!
