You could implement the wrap-around behavior directly into a new iterator-class - templated to be a wrapper for some actual iterator, that supplies a more elegant interface to the caller (so that its increment and decrement operators do the wrap-around automatically). Also - be careful of the empty container. You don't want to "wrap-around" when there are no elements in the container.
