getting/embedding user id in url/templates

i am fairly new to django and i want to update some of my contents in the django DB for this i have written a little view function. which looks like this def status_change(request,id): instance = get_object_or_404(register,id=id) if request.method == 'POST': rform = registerForm(instance=instance, data=request.POST) if rform.is_valid(): instance = rform.save() return render_to_response('home.html') else: rform = registerForm(instance=instance) return render_to_response('status_change.html',{'rform':rform}) i want to pass this "id" from template to the "view". my urls lopk like this (r'^status/(?P \d+)$', views.status_change), and when i use (r'^status/(?P \d+)$', views.status_change, name ='status_change'), it barks as syntax error on this line and in my template i have Change Status but this whole thing is not getting the id from the template/url am i making a mistake somewhere. any help will be greatly appreciated Thanks in advance
