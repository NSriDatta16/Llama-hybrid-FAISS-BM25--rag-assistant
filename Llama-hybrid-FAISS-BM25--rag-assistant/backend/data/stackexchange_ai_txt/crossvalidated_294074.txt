Basically you want to reduce 6-item likert scale to a single variable. That is usually done through some kind of factor analysis or principal component analysis (see Wikipedia as a starter or on this site for example here ). Averaging is almost always a bad idea because if you have have two statements where one person answers totally agree on the first and totally disagree on the second that person will "on average" be neutral given those two statements. Moreover, there are questions on the validity of calculating the average on an ordinal scale because it is not immediately clear whether the "distance" between for example "neutral" and "agree" is the same as the distance between "agree" and "completely agree". This problem partly applies to factor analysis as well, although people still use it (see here ). Regarding your interaction variables, that depends on the stats-program you're using. Most programs I know have the option to include interactions either through a specific code (in R) or by selecting them in one of the regression menus (in SPSS I assume).
