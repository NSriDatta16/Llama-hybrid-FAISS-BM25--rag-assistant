You need to specify the total length of memory that should be set. memset is a C function, that knows nothing about arguments. The actual meaning of the arguments is memset("pointer to memory", "what to set each byte to", "number of bytes to set") So this is actually better: A::LRM las[9]; //A and LRM are both structures with BOOLS and INTS memset(&las, 0, sizeof(A::LRM)*9); typedef Sec SecArray[16]; SecArray rad_array; memset(rad_array, 0, sizeof(Sec)*16); Both examples you provided will actually work, but they are fragile, since its is easy for an array to decay to a pointer, after which it will not work as expected (for example, if you passed the array into a function which does the memset, or switched to dynamic allocation using new).
