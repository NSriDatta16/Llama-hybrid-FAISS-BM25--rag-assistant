Just make the new opposite corners of your image the two detected multitouch points. You have to keep either the rotation or the aspect ratio fixed, of course. (In theory, you could mess with the aspect ratio rather than the rotation, but you probably want the rotation to change, not the aspect ratio). i.e. Override the touchesBegan and touchesMoved to save the initial points (in the began) and calculate rotation, translation and zoom (in the Moved), and construct a CGAffineTransform to apply to the imageView.
