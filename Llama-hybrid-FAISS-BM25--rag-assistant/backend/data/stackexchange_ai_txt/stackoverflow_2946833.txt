I don't like soundex much. I think newer iterations of the algorithm are better, but you are hashing every word in the English language down to a fairly small hash. This tends to generate a ton of false matches over time. I've read that metaphone and it's successor double metaphone are better, but I don't have direct experience with them. Mitch's coverage of like is pretty thorough, so I'm not going to repeat it.
