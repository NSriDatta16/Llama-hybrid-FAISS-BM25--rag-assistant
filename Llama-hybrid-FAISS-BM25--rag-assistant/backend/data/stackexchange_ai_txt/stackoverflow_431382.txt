If you want to encourage people to integrate with your site or it is popular enough for this to be a problem (so that you are forced to allow people to integrate with it), then by all means provide an API. If your API is adequate and easy to use, then people will prefer it to screen scraping. If your API is inadequate or harder to use than a screen scraper then you may still have the problem.
