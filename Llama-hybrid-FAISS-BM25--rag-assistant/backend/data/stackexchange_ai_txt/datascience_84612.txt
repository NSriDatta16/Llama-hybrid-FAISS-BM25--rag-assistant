How to perform Anomaly Detection on a force profile?

I have a set of force profiles of an industrial machine. I'm trying to develop an algorithm that tries to understand when a new profile is "anomalous" with respect to the ones in "normal operating conditions". In the picture below you can see the force profiles (function of time). I want the blue curve found checked as anomalous. What approaches do you suggest? I'm thinking about using some statistical distance (like mahalanobis) to check the similarity of a new curve to the "mean" of the others. Another point: it can be useful to use approaches like PCA in this case? Then I can try to use clustering techniques to separate anomalous profile from normal ones. I'm not sure since I have a great number of observations but of the same variable and PCA is a multivariate technique. ] 1
