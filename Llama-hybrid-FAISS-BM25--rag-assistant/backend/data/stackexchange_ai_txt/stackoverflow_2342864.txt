Efficient recursion in functional programming vs. inefficient recursion in different paradigms

As far as I know recursion is very elegant but unefficient in OOP and procedural programming (see the wonderful "High Order perl", Mark Jason Dominus). I had some informations that in functional programming recursion is fast - keeping its elegance and simplicity. Could someone confirm and possibly amplify this? I am thinking in terms of XSLT and Haskell (high on my next-language-to-learn list) Thanks Daniel
