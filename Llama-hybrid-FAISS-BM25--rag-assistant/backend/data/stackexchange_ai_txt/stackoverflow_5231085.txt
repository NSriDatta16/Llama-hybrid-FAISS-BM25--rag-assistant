According to manual if you are using basic authentication: echo ($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']); Basic auth method is deprecated now, I sorongly encourage to use digest authentication which is not more difficult. Instead of htpasswd you can use the htdigest binary. There is also an example for that on in the linked manual page. Digest also uses the concept of realm . This is the same thing as AuthName you are already using but as basic auth only uses it to show to the user, digest also uses it for authentication purposes and saves it in password files.
