ASP.net error message when using REST starter kit

I've written some code using the REST starter kit and it works fine on my development machine. However, when I upload it to our server the page gives me the following error message... CS1684: Warning as Error: Reference to type 'System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer' claims it is defined in 'c:\WINNT\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.ServiceModel.Web\3.5.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35\System.ServiceModel.Web.dll', but it could not be found I've removed code line by line and it appears that the following line of code is triggering the error... HttpContent newOrganizationContent = HttpContentExtensions.CreateXmlSerializable(newOrganizationXml); Really haven't got a clue how to fix it. I assumed it might be because it needs a newer version of the framework to run, but looking in IIS it says it's running version 2.0.50727 which I think is the lates version because it says that even when we're using framework 3.5 Very confused, any ideas?
