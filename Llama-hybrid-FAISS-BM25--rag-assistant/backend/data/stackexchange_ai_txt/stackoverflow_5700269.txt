sql: how to select a row with a true value from a column of boolean values after the HAVING clause

HI have 3 product tables, each with 3 columns namely customer name, and boolean optout and blacklist. After the Having clause, there will be 3 rows for each customer name (assuming he has all 3 products). How do I output a true if any of the boolean columns contains a true. I figured out by using the cast operation below, but think there should be a more elegant solution. SELECT customer_name, cast(int4(sum(cast(optout As int4))) As Boolean) As optout, cast(int4(sum(cast(blacklist As int4))) As Boolean) As blacklist FROM (SELECT * FROM product1 UNION SELECT * FROM product2 UNION SELECT * FROM product3) AS temp1 GROUP BY customer_name, optout, blacklist HAVING optout=true or blacklist=true;
