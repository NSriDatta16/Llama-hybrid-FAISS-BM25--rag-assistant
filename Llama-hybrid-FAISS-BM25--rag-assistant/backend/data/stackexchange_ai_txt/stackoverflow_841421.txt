You need to create a composite index on tableA : CREATE INDEX ix_tablea_t1id_t2id ON table_A (t1id, t2id) Indexes in MySQL are considered a part of a table: they are updated automatically, and used automatically whenever the optimizer decides it's a good move to use them. MySQL does not use the term index table . This term is used by Oracle to refer to what other databases call CLUSTERED INDEX : a kind of table where the records themselves are arranged according to the value of a column (or a set of columns). In MySQL : When you use MyISAM storage, an index is created as a separate file that has .MYI extension. The contents of this file represent a B-Tree , each leaf containing the index key and a pointer to the offset in .MYD file which contains the data. The size of the pointer is determined by the server setting called myisam_data_pointer_size , which can vary from 2 to 7 bytes, and defaults to 6 since MySQL 5.0.6 . This allows creating MyISAM tables up to 2 ^ (8 * 6) bytes = 256 TB In InnoDB , all tables are inherently ordered by the PRIMARY KEY , it does not support heap-organized tables. Each index, therefore, in fact is just a plain InnoDB table consisting of a single PRIMARY KEY of N+M records: N records being an indexed value, and M records being a PRIMARY KEY of the main table record which holds the indexed data.
