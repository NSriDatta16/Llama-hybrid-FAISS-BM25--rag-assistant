Why the random forest (ranger function) returns a r.squared null

I write this question because I use the random forest algorithm from the ranger package in R. My model is this: library(ranger) ... data manipulation ... model_rf My target variabile is a factor and is a boolean (1 bad result, 0 good result). I'd like to see the r.squared but, when I call it the results is null, why? Where I mistake? Other the r.suared I take look to the Gini index( 0.1375 I know that is low, but my db is not the best) and to the prediction.error ( 0.03076395 ). The is: why my r.squared is null? model_rf$r.squared NULL thank you
