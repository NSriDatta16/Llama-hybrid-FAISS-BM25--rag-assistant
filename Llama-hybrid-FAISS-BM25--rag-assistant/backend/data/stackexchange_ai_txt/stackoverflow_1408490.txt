JDeveloper classpath

How can I have one classpath for building and a different classpath for deploying to the embedded OC4J container (pressing the green run button) in JDeveloper 10.1.3.4 (or any similar version.) Examples in other tools include Maven's provided scope and Eclipse's Java EE Module Dependencies (items checked are deployed at runtime with the application while those not checked are not.) PS If i get any answers on this list, you will have bragging rights over the OTN discussion forums where I have been ignored for weeks on this very simple question. A simple "It can't be done." would at least give me some resolution. Thanks, Steve
