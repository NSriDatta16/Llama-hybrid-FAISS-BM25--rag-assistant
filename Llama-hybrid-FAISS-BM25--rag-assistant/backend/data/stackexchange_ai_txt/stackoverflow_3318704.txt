drupal filterable/sortable table from existing data

I have an existing database that holds information about upcoming meetings in my organization. I would like to be able to display this information in datatable type of format upon which I can then filter and sort the information (possibly jquery sort). Can anyone point me to some kind of tutorial that would give me an idea of how to do this? I assume I can do something with CCK and Views, but I'm not sure exactly what is involved. Thanks
