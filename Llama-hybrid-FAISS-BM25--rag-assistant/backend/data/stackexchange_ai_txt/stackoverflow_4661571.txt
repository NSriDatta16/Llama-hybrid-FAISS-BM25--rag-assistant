Is there an elegant way to activate a tab in which a focused widget is located?

I have a QLineEdit inside a widget inside a QTabWidget. Let's say that tab is at tab index 2. When currently active tab is at index 1, and I call setFocus() (and show(), and raise()) on the QLineEdit, the active tab doesn't switch to index 2 to show the focused widget. Is there any elegant way to show the focused widget's tab when that widget gets focus? Thanks!
