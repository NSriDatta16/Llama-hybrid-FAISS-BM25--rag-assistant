Many regression lines in a plot

How do you plot many regression lines in a plot? This concerns the textbook question from "Forecasting: Principles and Practice". A dataset concerns winning times of Olympic running events. Categories include year, length (distance), sex (gender). The question askes to make a regression line for each plot to see the average rate of change for each event. I could brute force this question but I want to find an efficient way to make multiple regression lines in a single plot. Is this possible?
