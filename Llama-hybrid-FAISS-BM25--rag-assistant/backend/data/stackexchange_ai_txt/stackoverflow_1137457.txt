As far as I can tell there is no recommended version of Linux for deploying Ruby on Rails applications. You can basically use any Linux/BSD distribution that you feel comfortable with. Have you tried Arch Linux ? I use it on 90% of the production servers and I didn't had any problems so far. It's lightweight, flexible and simple. Also updating and installing new packages is a very straightforward process. You should also take a look at Django . Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
