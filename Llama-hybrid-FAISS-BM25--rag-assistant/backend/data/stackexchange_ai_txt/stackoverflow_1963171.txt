Render and scroll through multiline paragraphs using pyglet and ScrollableTextLayout

How can one display and scroll through a multi-line strings (contain "\n") via pyglet using the features of ScrollableTextLayout? STL crops what is display, and seems to be the most efficient way to implement scrolling. However I have no idea as to how to use it. The docs do not elucidate much to me. SomeText: string = "Some multiline \n text is contained within this string \n which must be rendered \n such that it is able to be scrolled through." Snippets/Links are appreciated.
