Spring-modules caching not working... silently

I'm trying to use declarative caching from the Spring Modules project. It's not working ie. nothing appears to be getting cached. Here's my configuration: cacheName=default cacheNames=default And then, here's the logging from when Spring loads up the application context... 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,785 INFO org.springframework.cache.ehcache.EhCacheManagerFactoryBean - Initializing EHCache CacheManager 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,801 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager - Configuring ehcache from classpath. 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,801 WARN net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationFactory - No configuration found. Configuring ehcache from ehcache-failsafe.xml found in the classpath: zip:C:/bea/weblogic81/server/bin/myserver/.wlnotdelete/extract/myserver_threeoneoneonline_threeoneoneonline/jarfiles/WEB-INF/lib/ehcache-1.3.0.jar!/ehcache-failsafe.xml 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,801 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationFactory - Configuring ehcache from URL: zip:C:/bea/weblogic81/server/bin/myserver/.wlnotdelete/extract/myserver_threeoneoneonline_threeoneoneonline/jarfiles/WEB-INF/lib/ehcache-1.3.0.jar!/ehcache-failsafe.xml 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,801 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationFactory - Configuring ehcache from InputStream 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,816 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.config.DiskStoreConfiguration - Disk Store Path: C:\DOCUME~1\bpapa\LOCALS~1\Temp\ 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,832 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationHelper - No CacheManagerEventListenerFactory class specified. Skipping... 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,832 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationHelper - No CachePeerListenerFactoryConfiguration specified. Not configuring a CacheManagerPeerListener. 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,847 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationHelper - No CachePeerProviderFactoryConfiguration specified. Not configuring a CacheManagerPeerProvider. 24 Feb 2009 14:26:20,863 DEBUG net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationHelper - No BootstrapCacheLoaderFactory class specified. Skipping... After this, I hit a page that calls a method prefixed with "get" from the "myServiceBean" bean. But, nothing is logged that any caching is going on. I've turned logging all the way up to debug for springmodules, spring's cache package, and DEBUG... since Spring Modules examples are pretty few and far between on the web, I was wondering if anybody has seen this before...
