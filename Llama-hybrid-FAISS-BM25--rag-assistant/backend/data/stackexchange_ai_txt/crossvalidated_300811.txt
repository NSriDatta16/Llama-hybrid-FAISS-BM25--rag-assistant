The function xcorr() is used for calculating the time cross correlation of time series (Or any indexed signal). The corr() function is all about calculating the correlation of so supposedly 2 random variables. While the 2 coincide if used correctly and wisely pay attention that they basically normalize differently the operation (Hence you don't get what you expect). In code: vA = randn([10, 1]); vB = randn([10, 1]); xcorr(vA, vB, 0. 'coeff') ans = 0.3070 A.' * vB / sqrt((vA.' * vA) * (vB.' * vB)) ans = 0.3070 corr(vA, vB) ans = 0.3425 vAA = vA - mean(vA); vBB = vB - mean(vB); xcorr(vAA, vBB, 0, 'coeff') ans = 0.3425 corr(vA, vB) ans = 0.3425 As you can see from the code above what's you missing is that corr() removes the mean of the data while xcorr() doesn't. So corr(vA, vB) is equivalent of xcorr(vA - mean(vA), vB - mean(vB), 0, 'coeff') .
