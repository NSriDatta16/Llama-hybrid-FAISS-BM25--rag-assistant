Multiple Language IDE

I've been using Notepad++ for years and although it is comfortable I am feeling the need to move up into the IDE world for various reasons, which I'll outline below. I am looking for IDE recommendations for someone who works in multiple languages on a daily basis - I am currently looking at Eclipse and Netbeans but willing to consider any option. The reason I have not made the switch to a full-fledged IDE yet is because they feel so bloated, they are slow to load and eat up a ton of memory. Recently, I have been working on an astronomical number of projects (5-6 at work, upwards of 10 personally) in a variety of languages (Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, Javascript, xHTML, CSS, TorqueScript to name a few). These are just the languages I am using on a daily basis - although I don't expect to find an IDE that will meet all the demands of these languages (especially the more obscure TorqueScript on the list). So, what would you recommend for someone who needs a fast, configurable IDE that offers support for a variety of languages, syntax highlighting (preferably with various color schemes), project organization/browsing, Intellisense-ish code completion? I forgot to mention I am primarily targetting the Windows environment here - when I'm on my Xubuntu machine (minimally) Geany works fine for what I need to accomplish.
