Train a polynomial regression model on multiple training sets in R?

For my course in machine learning, I got an assignment to generate a number of training sets and train a polynomial model for each of these training sets with R. The hint was to use lm() . My first idea was to do something like: set.seed(128) f which gives me nrOfSets predictions from which I can compute bias and variance. I was just wondering whether this is the correct way to do this or if there are more efficient ways to achieve something like this (for instance with vectorized operations instead of a for -loop). Any suggestions are welcome (also about whether this is the right place to ask this question for instance).
