Great intuitive and visual answers above, let me add a little formulas in the case of linear regression in 2 dimensions. The predictor at a given data point $x_i$ is $\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ . Being high leverage concern only $x_i$ , $|x_i- \bar{x}|$ is unusually large compare to average. Meanwhile, being outlier concerns $y_i$ , when the residual $|\hat{y}-y_i|$ given $x_i$ is unusually large. For the same residual $|\hat{y}-y|$ , a high leverage point has a stronger influence to what $\beta_1$ best fits the data to minimize $\sum_i^N (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i-y)^2$ because the way it forms a product with $\beta_1$ in the predictor. My mental picture is that a point far away from the data mean has a "longer lever" to push the slope than a point near the mean.
