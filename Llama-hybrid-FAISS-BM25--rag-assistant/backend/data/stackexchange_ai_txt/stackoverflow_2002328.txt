Don't use an ObjectOutputStream, byte array is serialized as Object, not written as raw data. Are you sure that you have SD card write permission? android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Don't write into SD card root directory. Number of files in root dir can be limited. Instead create you app subdirectory on SD CARD. This code works for me: try { String filePath = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/myappdir/" + appName + ".apk"; File file = new File(filePath); file.getParentFile().mkdirs(); file.createNewFile(); BufferedOutputStream objectOut = new BufferedOutputStream( new FileOutputStream(file)); objectOut.write(appByteArray); objectOut.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
