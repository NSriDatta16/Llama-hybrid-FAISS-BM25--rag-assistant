(WPF) Can I save a ItemsControl to a List?

I will explain my question a little more. I have a ObservableCollection binded to a ItemsControl with it datatemplate. Nothing new :P. The thing is that I'm using a Drag & Drop library for changing the order of the items in the ItemsControl. The library works fine, you can drag some items in the ItemsControl. The problem is that the changes in the ItemsControl doesn't affect to the ObservableCollection. The question is: Can I save the ItemsControl source to a new ObservableCollection? Or... you have a better idea? Thank you and I hope that you can understand me and my english :P
