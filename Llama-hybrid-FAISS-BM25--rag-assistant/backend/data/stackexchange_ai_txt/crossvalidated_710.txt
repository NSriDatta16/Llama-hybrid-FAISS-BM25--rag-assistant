My understanding is that the distinction between PCA and Factor analysis primarily is in whether there is an error term. Thus PCA can, and will, faithfully represent the data whereas factor analysis is less faithful to the data it is trained on but attempts to represent underlying trends or communality in the data. Under a standard approach PCA is not rotated, but it is mathematically possible to do so, so people do it from time to time. I agree with the commenters in that the "meaning" of these methods is somewhat up for grabs and that it probably is wise to be sure the function you are using does what you intend - for example, as you note R has some functions that perform a different sort of PCA than users of SPSS are familiar with.
