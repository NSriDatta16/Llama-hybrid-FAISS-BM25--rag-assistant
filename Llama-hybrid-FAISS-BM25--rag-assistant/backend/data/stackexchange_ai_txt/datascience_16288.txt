Mapping xml tags by Rule Learning/Generation Algorithms

I'm trying to map tags/attributes from xml files from different sources. I've found a paper called Semantic Mapping of XML Tags using Inductive Machine Learning . Among various things, it also talks about a Rule Generation Algorithm called Data Squeezer . However, I'm wondering what other (better) algorithms can be used for deep learning xml tags. Also do we have any such algorithm implemented in TensorFlow or any other open source library ?
