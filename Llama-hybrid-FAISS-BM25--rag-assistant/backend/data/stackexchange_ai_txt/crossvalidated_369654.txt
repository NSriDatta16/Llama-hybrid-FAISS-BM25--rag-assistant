How to automatically cluster a U-Matrix?

After training a self-organising map, one can calculate the U-Matrix . There are some tools to manually visualize it and identify clusters, but I'm wondering if there is any algorithm to do this process in an automatic way (i.e. not having a human looking at the figure to identify the clusters). Is there any way to do this? I'm writing my code in R. I haven't found anything of the kind on the Internet, so maybe someone can help me out here.
