How to call a core template in magento

I am new to Magento, and I have created list1.phtml in Magento with some changes to the file list.phtml . My problem is that I want to call list1.phtml like list.phtml . I copied the code of list.phtml from catalog.xml and created a new content block for list1.phtml but it doesn't work for me. Please help. Actually, I want a page in Magento that only shows 5 product rows, and all other pages are the same with 3 products. I am overriding list.phtml to list1.phtml according to my needs but it doesn't work for me. Sorry for my English. Thanks in advance, -Jeet
