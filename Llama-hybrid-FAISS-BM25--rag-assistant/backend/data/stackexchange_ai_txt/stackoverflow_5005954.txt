I mean, modifying a static variable is a non-issue. It's a variable. It can vary. So why would varying (i.e., modifying it) be a bad practice? Yes, there are situations where you shouldn't or have to be careful if you do, but in general, it's not. The big issue here is reading application settings deep in the guts of your application. It kills maintainability and testability. It is a horrifically bad practice and I encourage you to stop immediately.
