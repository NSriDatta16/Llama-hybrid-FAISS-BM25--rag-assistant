What is the difference between support vector machines and support vector regression?

I understand what SVM is but I have come across people saying Support Vector Regressions (SVR) and I do not know what is the difference between SVM and SVR. Can someone point out the mathematical differences between the two ? When do we use one over the other ? Also, is there any resources with mathematical derivation and R Code which will allow me to read up on the mathematics and implementation of the Support Vector Regression?
