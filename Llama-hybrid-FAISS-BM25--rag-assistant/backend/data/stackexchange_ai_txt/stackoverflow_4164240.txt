You can set the BorderStyle of the form to either "Fixed Single" ( vbFixedSingle ) or "Fixed Dialog" ( vbFixedDouble ) at design-time. Either of these will prevent the user from resizing the form. Fixed Single provides a Control-menu box, title bar, Maximize button, and Minimize button. The form will still be resizable using the Maximize and Minimize buttons, but not by dragging the edges of the window. Fixed Dialog provides a Control-menu box and title bar, but eliminates the Maximize and Minimize buttons. It is therefore not resizable at all. (Also note that a form that contains a menu cannot be displayed as a Fixed Dialog and is automatically changed to the Fixed Single border style.)
