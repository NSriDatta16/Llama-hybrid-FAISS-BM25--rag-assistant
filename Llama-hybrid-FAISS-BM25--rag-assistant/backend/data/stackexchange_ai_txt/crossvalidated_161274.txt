This area of sequential clinical trials has been explored substantially in the literature. Some of the notable researchers are Scott Emerson, Tom Flemming, David DeMets, Stephen Senn, and Stuart Pocock among others. It's possible to specify an "alpha-spending-rule". The term has its origins in the nature of frequentist (non-Fisherian) testing where, each action that increases the risk of a false positive finding should necessarily reduce power to keep the test of the correct size. However, the majority of such tests require that "stopping rules" are prespecified based on the information bounds of the study. (as a reminder, more information means greater power when the null is false). It sounds like what you are interested is a continuous monitoring process in which each event-time warrants a "look" into the data. To the best of my knowledge, such a test has no power. It can be done with Bayesian analysis where the posterior is continuously updated as a function of time, and Bayes Factors are used to summarize evidence rather than $p$-values.
