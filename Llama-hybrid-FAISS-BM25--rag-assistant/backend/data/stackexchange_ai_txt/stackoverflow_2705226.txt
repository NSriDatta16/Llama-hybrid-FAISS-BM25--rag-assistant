An ancient FORTRAN application I used to work for used to store the values for certain fields as positive integers with an implied negative offset. There were 12 bits available to store numbers in, so we would add 1024 to the value before storing it, and subtract it after retrieving it. That would allow us to store numbers in the range from -1024 to 1023 using a positive number in the (external) memory, with a range of 0 to 2047. Hardly elegant, but very simple. You're essentially doing the sign bit handling in code.
