How can I get all days between two days?

I need all the weekdays between two days. Example: Wednesday - Friday = Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 3 - 5 = 3, 4, 5 Saturday - Tuesday = Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 6 - 2 = 6, 7, 1, 2 I'm pretty sure there is a clever algorithm out there to solve this. The only algorithms I can think of use either a loop or an if statement. There has to be an elegant way to solve this. I use the numbers 1-7 for the weekdays, but 0-6 is fine too. The best I could come up with: def between(d1, d2): alldays = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0,1,2,3,4,5,6] # or range(7) * 2 offset = 8 if d1 > d2 else 1 return alldays[d1:d2 + offset] between(0, 4) # [0,1,2,3,4] between(5,2) # [5,6,0,1,2]
