Google Map dragging like in maps.google.com

I just want to add the effect of map momentum by the dragging of map as in maps.google.com has. Currently on my map where I stop dragging the map stops there but in maps.google.com if you drag a mouse the map will not stop there it will continue the movement in the same direction for a second or a few coordinates (I don't know), and I want the same thing on my Google Map. I am using GMap2.
