Machine learning without explicit training

Is there any set of machine learning algorithms that do not require training and directly gives answers if a set of labeled and unlabeled data gave at once? Is skipping explicit training of model can be skipped either in supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms? [I do not talk of using pre-trained model]
