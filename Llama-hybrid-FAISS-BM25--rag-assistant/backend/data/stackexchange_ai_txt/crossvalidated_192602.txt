What do the realizations of X(t)=Usin(t)+Vcos(t) where U and V are random variables with mean 0 and and variance 1 look like from -2pi to 2pi?

I'm not sure what the realizations of a time series really mean, and how to implement any kind of drawing with random variables. Any hints or descriptions would be very helpful.
