Overload indexer to have foreach'able class

I tried to do something like this but this doesn't work: class Garage { private List cars = new List (); public Car this[int i] { get { return cars[i]; } } //... } Garage g = new Garage(); //get CS1579 - no GetEnumerator definition foreach (Car c in g) { //... } As MSDN says indexers can be overloaded, so I decided to ask experts here. How to overload indexers to cooperate with foreach loop?
