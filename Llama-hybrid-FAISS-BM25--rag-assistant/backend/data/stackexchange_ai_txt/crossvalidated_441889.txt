Introduction into interrupted time series (intervention analyses for time series)

I am looking for a good introduction into or an overview about interrupted time series or intervention analyses for time series. Perhaps also considering change point detection or event study analyses . This questions deals with literature regarding R implementations but I am looking for a more general treatment (including theoretical considerations). I furthermore could not find the topic discussed in the literature outlined in that question ( Rob Hyndman , for example, discuss interventions only very briefly in a subchapter and I couldn't find it in Shumway and Stoffer ). Here is an interesting answer outlining one specific approach how to deal with that topic. Furthermore, is there a widely understood terminology for this kind of analyses? It seems for me that each field gives these statistical approaches different names.
