I wanted to elaborate on my comment, as I've been in the same situation. However please note I'm not a statistician and this is coming from a very practical viewpoint and I'm not sure what is mathematically the best approach. I often conduct daily experience studies same as you, though I usually have an ESM protocol (i.e. several measurements per day). I usually use state items derived from the Big Five personality model, and try to have 2-3 items per domain (e.g. "productive" and "responsible" for Conscientiousness). So, prior to analyses I want to combine these items by domain. I have found these instructions for conducting a multilevel CFA in R lavaan. This approach seems reasonable to me, but it's for CFA - you need to specify the factor structure beforehand. However, you could try a couple of different structures. (In a recent article I saw, the authors used multilevel EFA, but I can't find it now - maybe they used R psych package). However, my ESM samples are usually too small for any kind of factor analysis, let alone 2-level one. Therefore, I usually just check whether the items that belong to the same trait domain on theoretical basis have high enough within-person correlation using the rmcorr function in R. If so, I average these items. If not, I use them as single items.
