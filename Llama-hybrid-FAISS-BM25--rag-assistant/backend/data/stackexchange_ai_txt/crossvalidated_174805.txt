Time Series and Moving Average

I just recently started to learn about moving average process of order 1, however, I get confused if there are other things attached to the equation. For example: $Z_t = 8 + 2t + 5X_t$ where $X_t$ is a zero-mean stationary series with autocovariance function $r_k$ a) Find the mean function and the autocovariance function of $Z_t$. I am guessing: Mean = $E[Z_t]=E[8+2t+5X_t]=E[8]+2E[t]+E[X_t]=0$ Covariance = $Cov[Z_t,Z_t]=E[Z_tZ_t]=E[8+2t+5X_t][8+2t+5X_t]=r_k^2$ Can someone please tell me if I did this correct? The questions says $X_t$ is a zero-mean, unit variance, stationary process with autocorrelation function $p_k$. Then how do I find the mean, variance, and auto covariance of $Z_t = 8 + 2t + 4tX_t$? Mean = $E[Z_t]=E[8+2t+4tX_t]=E[8]+2E[t]+4tE[X_t]=0$ ? Variance = No idea Covariance = I guess I just have to use $$corr(x,x)=cov(x,x)/\sqrt{var(x)var(x)}?$$
