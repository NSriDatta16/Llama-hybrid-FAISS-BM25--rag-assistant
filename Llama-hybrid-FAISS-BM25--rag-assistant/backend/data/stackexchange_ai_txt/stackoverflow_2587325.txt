Having a heck of a time getting object property values into textboxes

I am new to the MVVM design pattern, and I am working on a project to automate shipping processes. The particular problem that I am having is I have a UserControl (my EditShipmentView) which when it loads, assigns it's ViewModel to its DataContext. The ViewModel is passed a recordID which it uses to pull the entity that represents a shipment. It does this successfully, as I can see it in Mole (visualizer). Below is a XAML fragment showing the first couple of TextBoxes, and what I thought the bindings should look like. So, to recap... EditShipmentView (Inherits from SnazzyForm) DataContext is EditShipmentViewModel EditShipmentViewModel.ShipmentRecord is populated (successfully) with a shipment object ShipmentRecord.CompanyName is a string which obviously should return the name of a company. Keep in mind this is only my most recent attempt. Previously I have not bound the Stackpanels DataContext and had the Textboxes bound as such "{Binding Path=ShipmentRecord.CompanyName}", and what seems like a hundred different variations. What hair I have left is rapidly receding. Please, think of my hair, send help. Cory
