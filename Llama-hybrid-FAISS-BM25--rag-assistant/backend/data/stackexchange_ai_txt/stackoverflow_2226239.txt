Basic Questions about Amazon RDS, S3 Storage, and Default RDS Tables

I just created my first database instance on the Amazon RDS service. I was wondering... 1) Is there a way to have Amazon automatically back up my data in a way that it persists even if the instance is deleted? 2) Is it possible to share tables across multiple instances? 3) When I first connected to the instance, I found there were three databases: the one I specifically created, innob, and mysql. Should I continue using the one I created or one of the others? Are there cost implications? THANK YOU.
