You don't need a BGW if you use the OnPacketArrival event. Makes it easy to stop, just call StopCapture(). The other way, GetNextPacket() does need a BGW. You have to open the device with a read timeout that short enough so you can see the CancellationPending flag quick enough. You'll also have to deal with the overhead of getting it displayed on your UI, ReportProgress is not cheap. And freezes the UI when you call it more often than ~1000 times per second. I wonder if we're talking about the same library...
