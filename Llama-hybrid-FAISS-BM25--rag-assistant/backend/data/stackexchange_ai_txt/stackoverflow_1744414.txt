If you use an in-memory storage system to cache the reflected attributes of a specific type after the first use, you may not have a "virtually worthless" situation at all. In fact, without testing it, you don't really know that the reflection solution would be a problem, do you? (Much of .NET uses reflection and people don't see slowdown in those scenarios. Serialization is one of them.)
