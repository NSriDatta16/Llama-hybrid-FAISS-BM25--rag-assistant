Here's a simple rule: never used postfix operators. If you do, put the whole expression ending with the postfix operator inside parenthesis. In fact, starting with Scala 2.10.0, doing that will generate a warning by default. For good measure, you might want to move the postfix operator out, and use dot notation for it. For example: (fromFile(file)).mkString map caesar(k)_ Or, even more simply, fromFile(file).mkString map caesar(k)_ On the other hand, pay attention to the methods where you can supply an empty parenthesis to turn them into infix: fromFile(file) mkString () map caesar(k)_
