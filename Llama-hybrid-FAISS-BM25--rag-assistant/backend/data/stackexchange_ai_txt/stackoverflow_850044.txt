I think the question of "what" is VERY relevant in choosing a platform, since the platform has a major impact on who will be exposed to your game, and how it will be played. Are you developing a game intended for multiple people sitting around the screen, ex. a trivia game, fighting game, sports game, etc? Then you probably want to be looking at a console like the 360. Are you looking for something a bit deeper? Dwarf Fortress, or the next great hex-based wargame? You probably want to go PC. A shooter? Something with a mouse. PC again. A flight sim that requires a thousand different buttons? Something with a keyboard, like the PC again. Are you building a simple Popcap-style puzzle game? you might look at an SDK for some kind of handheld device. Tell us what you want to build and we can recommend a platform edit: if it was me, PC would be my default platform no matter what
