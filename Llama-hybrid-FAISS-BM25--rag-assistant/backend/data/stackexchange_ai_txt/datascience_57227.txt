Training a model for fall detection

My parents are elderly and a fall is a BIG DEAL. I'm pretty good at coding and such. So I thought I'd use some fall datasets and plug them into a machine learning system. As you can see from this statement, I am new to machine learning. How should I start getting my first model? Literature has pointed me to trying a decision tree model as better than KNN...do I pick up TensorFlow and start plying a model with datasets, or how would you start? Thank you and I apologize for my noob question.
