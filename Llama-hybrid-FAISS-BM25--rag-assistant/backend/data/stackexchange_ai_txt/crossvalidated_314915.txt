Two measurement devices vs 1 device multiple measurements

If I have two temperature probes measuring the same substance will the average of the two increase the uncertainty? Propagation of uncertainty says yes but I'm trying to justify it in my head. Treating each probe as another deminsion: $$u_{tot}=\sqrt{(u_1)^2+(u_2)^2}$$ If the uncertainty between the two devices are equal then the new uncertainty is increased by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. On the flip side if I take 2 measurements with the same device I get a decrease of uncertainty by a factor $\sqrt{2}$ This just seems counter intuitive. Is this a true assumption. Would I be better off using 1 device to take multiple measurements?
