You can't have the WSGI application run in embedded mode on UNIX systems, whether it be prefork or worker MPM, as there will indeed be multiple processes. See: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ProcessesAndThreading Creating a daemon process group consisting of single process and delegating WSGI application to that should achieve what you want. You shouldn't even need to use WSGIApplicationGroup if it is only one mounted WSGI application you are talking about. If you want to be absolutely sure though, you can also set it. Thus configuration within VirtualHost would be: WSGIDaemonProcess osvm WSGIProcessGroup osvm WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL} WSGIScriptAlias / /var/convergedsecurity/apache/osvm.wsgi Although 'processes=1' for WSGIDaemonProcess makes it explicit that one process is created, don't provide the option though and just let it default to one process. Any use of 'processes' option, even if for one process will see 'wsgi.multiprocess' set to True. Rather than use your actual WSGI application, I would suggest you test with the following simple test program. import cStringIO import os def application(environ, start_response): headers = [] headers.append(('Content-Type', 'text/plain')) write = start_response('200 OK', headers) input = environ['wsgi.input'] output = cStringIO.StringIO() print >> output, "PID: %s" % os.getpid() print >> output keys = environ.keys() keys.sort() for key in keys: print >> output, '%s: %s' % (key, repr(environ[key])) print >> output output.write(input.read(int(environ.get('CONTENT_LENGTH', '0')))) return [output.getvalue()] In the output of that, the PID value should always be the same. The wsgi.multiprocess flag should be False. The mod_wsgi.process_group value should be what ever you called the daemon process group. And the mod_wsgi.application_group should be an empty string. If this isn't what you are seeing, ensure you actually restarted Apache after making configuration changes. Also add: LogLevel debug to Apache configuration for VirtualHost. Doing that will cause mod_wsgi to log a lot more messages in Apache error log about process creation and script loading, including details of process group and application group things are happening for. For other information on debugging, see: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/DebuggingTechniques If still problems, suggest you go to the mod_wsgi mailing list on Google Groups.
