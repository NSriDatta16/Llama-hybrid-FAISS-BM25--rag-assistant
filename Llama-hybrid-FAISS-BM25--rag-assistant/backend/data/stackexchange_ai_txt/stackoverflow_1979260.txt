Mike Hilberg's article addresses much of what you are interested in: http://blogs.msdn.com/mikehillberg/archive/2009/03/26/implementing-selectedvalue-with-the-silverlight-combobox.aspx as does Manish Dalal's article: http://weblogs.asp.net/manishdalal/archive/2008/09/28/combobox-in-datagrid.aspx Even with the help of these examples I struggled to implement the same sort of thing as you (using hand-crafted MVVM rather than RIA). I ended up with an inelegant hack which did compromise the underlying objects (something you would like to avoid) and that was difficult enough. Good luck.
