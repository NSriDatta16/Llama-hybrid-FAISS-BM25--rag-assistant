Geostatistical analysis using spatial.exp in WinBugs

I have a logistic regression model in GeoBugs to estimate predictors of prevalence of a disease. Can anyone tell me if there is a simple way to determine the lower and upper bounds of phi for spatial.exp. This is part of the model: Infected[i] ~ dbin(p[i], tested[i]) logit(p[i]) This how I have specified the priors: phi ~ dunif(0.25, 20) At the moment my selection has been arbitrary. The GeoBugs manual only goes as far as saying that the bounds of the distribution are determined by the data. What I would like to know is there a dummies version of the best way to select the values.
