In the following analysis we repeatedly exploit linearity of expectation to characterize such processes. Let $\beta(r) = E[X_{t+r}-X_{t}].$ Replacing $X_t$ by $X_t - X_0$ (it is convenient to start indexing times with $t=0$ ), we may assume $X_0=0$ and because $\beta(r)$ depends only on $r,$ $$\beta(r) = E[X_r].$$ Notice that since $$\beta(r+1) = E[X_{t+r+1}-X_t] = E[X_{t+r+1} - X_{t+r}] + E[X_{t+r} - X_t] = \beta(1) + \beta(r),$$ then by induction on the natural number $r,$ $$\beta(r) = r\beta(1).$$ Consequently, we are motivated to analyze the derived time series $$Y_t = X_t - X_0 - r\beta(1),$$ which by construction is first-order stationary with constant zero mean. Conversely, let $Y_t$ be any zero-mean first-order stationary process, let $\mu$ and $\beta(1)$ be any numbers, and set $$X_t = \mu + t\beta(1) + Y_t.$$ Then $$E[X_{t+r} - X_t] = E[(\mu + (t+r)\beta(1) + Y_{t+r}) - (\mu + (t)\beta(1) + Y_{t})] = r\beta(1)$$ depends only on $r.$ All such time-series processes $X_t,$ for which the expected differences depend only on the lag $r,$ are the sum of a linear function of the natural numbers $t\to E[X_0] + t\beta(1)$ and a first-order stationary time series process $Y_t.$
