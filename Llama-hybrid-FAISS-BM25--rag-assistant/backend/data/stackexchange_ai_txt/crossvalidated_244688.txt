Does this series qualifies as a Stationary Time Series?

I have some specific concerns regarding data handling and aknowledge the right Time Series forecasting path. I've followed the ARIMA modelling in R guide from the Forecasting: principles and practice , which I think it's one of the best out there. Unfortunatelly most of the guides or tutorials where made with "prepared or adjusted data" so you allways get a nice outcome. For this post I've prepared a public pastebin with the DAILY data set from 2015-01-01 to 2016-09-31 I'm using. I've read a lot of posts but still seems confunsing to me. 1- Since I have skewed data, (ranging from 160.000 to 2.363.188.500, amount of daily sales in my country's currency) do I need to scale it somehow ? My goal is to forecast the next 30 days sales amounts, so is better to leave the data as it is ? # READ FROM URL library(data.table) salesData 2- I know that working with daily data has some issues for what I'd read. In Rob J Hyndman's blog here he says that: "Unless the time series is very long, the simplest approach is to simply set the frequency attribute to 7" I only have 612 data points, so it is safe to set the frequency to 7 ? amounts From here I've used this test to ensure that no transformation is needed, am I correct ? BoxCox.lambda(tsSales) # = 0.7440572 CLOSE TO 1 -> NO TRANSF. NEEDED tsdisplay(tsMaxi,main = "ORIGINAL DATA") 3- In this next step, do I really need to do the STL decomposition and Seas.Adjustment on my TS ? stlSales 4- Sticking with the example, here I check if a Seas.Differentiation is needed, the output is that I need to take a First Diff., but the Box.test states that the series is already stationary, how can I interpret this # p-value = 2.2e-16 0) { diffSales 5- Next, I do an auto.arima() check and this suggests that the series may have multiple seasonalities. Does this make any sense ? I'm choosing auto.arima because I'm having a hard time deciding the Arima() order by looking at the previous PACF plot. # PACF INDICATES: AR(6)? # DIFF. ORDER: d = 1 # MA ORDER: MA(1)? fit 6- And finally, after a Residual Analysis, the final forecast and plot fitResiduals 0.05 ? forecastedModel And other finally questions are: How can I get to plot these forecasted values with the original series ? How can I interpret these weird date X-axis that is plotting ? I'm getting negative results in the forecasting step, why's the reason ? Hope you can help me somehow or guide me if I'm mistaken or something. I've tried to make the best reproducible example, sadly I cann't yet upload more urls to my plots because of my low reputation. Thanks in advance. EDIT ( DATA SET UPDATED ) I was missing some date meassures in my original data set, so here is the updated series (sorry I can't post more links, I don't want to loose the former ones in the original question): http://pastebin.com/raw/QtqijXaK
