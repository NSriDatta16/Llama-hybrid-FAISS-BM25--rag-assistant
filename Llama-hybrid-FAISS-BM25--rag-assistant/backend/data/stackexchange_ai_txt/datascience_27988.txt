Applying dimensionality reduction on OneHotEncoded array

I have a really large data set with mixed variables. I have converted categorical variables to numerical using OneHotEncoding and it has resulted in more than a couple of thousand different features, combined that is. Is it possible to apply dimensionality reduction algorithms on OneHotEncoded data which looks like [[1. 0. 1. 0.]...[0. 0. 0. 0.]] or should it be done by merging with the original data set?
