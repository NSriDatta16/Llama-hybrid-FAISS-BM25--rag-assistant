Mouseover in jqtouch?

Is it possible to use mouseover or hover type functions on an iphone? I'm trying to write code for a basic regional image map and cant get the hover function to work at all using either mouseover of hover. Just wanted the images to switch as users finger drags across the map. Any suggestions gratefully received. Thanks Paul
