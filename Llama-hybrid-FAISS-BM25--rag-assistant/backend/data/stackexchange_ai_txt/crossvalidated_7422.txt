Calculating hourly volatility and peak-to-average ratio in R

I have network traffic data in the following for for each hour of a ten day period as follows in a R dataset. Day Hour Volume Category 0 00 100 P2P 0 00 50 email 0 00 200 gaming 0 00 200 video 0 00 150 web 0 00 120 P2P 0 00 180 web 0 00 80 email .... 0 01 150 P2P 0 01 200 P2P 0 01 50 Web ... ... 10 23 100 web 10 23 200 email 10 23 300 gaming 10 23 300 gaming As seen there are repetitions of Category within a single hour also. I need to calculate the volatility and the peak hour to average hour ratios of these different application categories. Volatility : Standard deviation of hourly volumes divided by hourly average. Peak hour to avg. hour ratio : Ratio of volume of the maximum hour to the volume of the average hour for that application. So how do I aggregate and calculate these two statistics for each category? I am new to R and don't have much knowledge of how to aggregate and get the averages as mentioned. So, the final result would look something like this Category Volatility Peak to Avg. Ratio Web 0.55 1.5 P2P 0.30 2.1 email 0.6 1.7 gaming 0.4 2.9
