You are using an URL that's outside your domain, which means $.getJSON will not use an XmlHttpRequest, but some JSONP -- see the documentation of $.getJSON : If the specified URL is on a remote server, the request is treated as JSONP instead. See the discussion of the jsonp data type in $.ajax() for more details. And if you take a look on the documentation of the jsonp option for $.ajax , you'll see : Override the callback function name in a jsonp request. This value will be used instead of 'callback' in the 'callback=?' part of the query string in the url for a GET or the data for a POST. So {jsonp:'onJsonPLoad'} would result in 'onJsonPLoad=?' passed to the server. And for the jsonpCallback option : Specify the callback function name for a jsonp request. This value will be used instead of the random name automatically generated by jQuery. For your first request, there is a jsoncallback parameter in the URL ; for your second request, there is no such parameter : First URL : http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=cat&tagmode=any&format=json&jsoncallback=? Second URL : http://json-time.appspot.com/time.json?tz=Europe/Brussels I suppose this has something to do with the fact the second request doesn't do what you want ?
