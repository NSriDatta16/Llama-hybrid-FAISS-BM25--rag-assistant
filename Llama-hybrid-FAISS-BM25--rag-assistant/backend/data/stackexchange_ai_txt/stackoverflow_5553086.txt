No, thers no way to drag and drop an attachment file from an outlook email @Stefan: AIR dosn't allow dragging an eMail from Outlook into an AIR application. Instead you recieve a String, containing some mail infos like subject, size, recipient... No content, no attachments. That's a pity... Please feel free to correct me, but I have searched for a solution for a while and no solution found.... Greetings steelheart
