Scaling should be "reasonable" and perhaps "logical." The issue here is that the firms being compared vary widely in size. Hence, the data is scaled. Prior year or current assets would be reasonable to scale earnings, debt leverage, and CFO. Assets are always changing, so assuming they don't change too fast, either is "reasonable." It would likely be better to use the average of prior and current year, but the gain to be had is probably not worth the complexity. However, what if assets do change quickly? If a firm made a huge acquisition, then its assets would suddenly jump much higher. How to handle that? The average mentioned above would be one way. Or, use the ending assets to scale! So if the firms being analyzed do a lot of mergers and acquisitions, then scaling by ending assets would be reasonable, as it prevents misleading jumps in the scaled data. ROA I would scale by prior year assets, as it is the growth of the assets themselves. Scale by the starting point, not the ending point. If there was an acquisition, used the combined assets from both firms for the prior year.
