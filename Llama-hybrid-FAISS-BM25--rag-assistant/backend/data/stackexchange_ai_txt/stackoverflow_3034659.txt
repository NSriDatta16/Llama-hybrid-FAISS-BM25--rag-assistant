PIL's Image.show() brings up *two* different viewers

When toying with images in the python shell, I use image.show(), where image is an instance of Image. Long ago nothing happened, but after defining a symlink to mirage named "xv", I was happy. The last few days, show() will bring up both ImageMagick's display and also Mirage. It's not clear where show() gets information on what to run. Documentation wasn't helpful. How to make it behave and bring up only what it thinks is xv?
