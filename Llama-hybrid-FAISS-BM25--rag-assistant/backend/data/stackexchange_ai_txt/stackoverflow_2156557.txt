The documented way to add controls to a JFileChooser is via the setAccessory(JComponent) method. JTextField field = new JTextField("Hello, World"); JPanel accessory = new JPanel(); accessory.setLayout(new FlowLayout()); accessory.add(field); JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser(); chooser.setAccessory(accessory); int ret = chooser.showOpenDialog(frame); However, this will layout the new control on the right of the dialog (exact positioning is probably locale-dependent). To locate the component to the position you want it, you'll probably have to walk the component graph and manipulate it. This would be a very fragile approach and you may be better off just building your own dialog. This could incorporate a file chooser: JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser(); chooser.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { // TODO - wire into something System.out.println(e); } }); JTextField field = new JTextField("Hello, World"); JPanel panel = new JPanel(); panel.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); panel.add(chooser, BorderLayout.CENTER); panel.add(field, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
