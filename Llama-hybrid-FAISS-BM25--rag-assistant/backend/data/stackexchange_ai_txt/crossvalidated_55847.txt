You're only describing a problem. There are many different algorithms that can be applied to solve it, see e.g. http://lane.compbio.cmu.edu/courses/slides_ucb.pdf . The UCB1 algorithm is so dead simple, reading Java code to understand how it works is probably a bad idea - unless you want to learn Java: Play machine $j$, that maximizes $$\bar{x}_j+\sqrt{\frac{2\ln n}{n_j}},$$ where $\bar{x}_j$ is the average reward obtained from machine $j$, $n_j$ is how often $j$ has been played and $n$ is the number of total plays. The 2 in the formula is a constant which can be changed to tune the exploration vs exploitation of the algorithm (higher number results in more exploration).
