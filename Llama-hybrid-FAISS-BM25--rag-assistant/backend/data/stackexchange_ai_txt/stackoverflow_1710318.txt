If you want to do somethin withing the ALTER/CREATE/DROP context (ie. inside the same transaction) and even prevent the ALTER/CREATE/DROP then you should look into DDL Triggers . If you want to do something after the ALTER/CREATE/DROP , in a separate transaction, and have the liberty to do some lengthy processing without slowing down the original DDL, then you should look into Event Notifications . Note that Event Notifications can actually be delivered remotely so you can capture all DDL events from an entire corporate group into one single central repository.
