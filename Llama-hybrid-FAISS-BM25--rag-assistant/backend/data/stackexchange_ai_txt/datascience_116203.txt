Since no answers have been posted yet I will do my best.... SHAP values don't reflect the output's variation when a variable is removed from the model, as R 2 does. SHAP values are the contribution of a given value of an input variable to the difference between the actual prediction and the mean prediction, though this can be further averaged out for all the input values. They are somewhat related but they are not exactly the same. It would be great to find an equation relating both things.
