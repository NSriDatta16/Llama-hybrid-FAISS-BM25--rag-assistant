There's a storm branch that you can use with twisted directly (internally it does the defer to thread stuff) on launchpad https://code.launchpad.net/~therve/storm/twisted-integration . I've used it nicely. Sadly sqlalchemy is significantly more complex in implementation to audit for async usage. If you really want to use it, i'd recommend an out of process approach with a storage rpc layer. alternatively if your feeling adventurous and using postgresql, the latest pyscopg2 supports true async usage ( https://launchpad.net/txpostgres ), and the storm source is pretty simple to hack on ;-) incidentally the storm you tried last year may not have had the C-extension on by default (it is now in the latest releases.) which might account for your speed issues.
