Scroll bar algorithm

I've been trying to create my own custom scroll bar implementation in JavaScript. It must emulate the look and behavior of MS Office 2007 I checked many solutions out there, but nothing satisfies my needs. My main problem is this: How to calculate a balance between the scroll bar height and the number of lines it will move the target page when itself dragged a pixel? In other words, a balance between the scroll bar precision and the space available to drag it up and down. Is there a ready algorithm for that to reuse? I searched the net but found nothing, quite strange for what must be a common coding problem? Thanks!
