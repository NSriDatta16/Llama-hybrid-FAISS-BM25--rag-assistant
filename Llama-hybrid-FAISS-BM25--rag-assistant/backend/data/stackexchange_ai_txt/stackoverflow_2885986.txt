1) Determine what is acceptable latency time for pages to come up in an acceptable way. 2) Determine the average and peak amount of concurrent users. 3) Get a tool like http://sourceforge.net/projects/httperf/ and run with these numbers. 4) If you are still OK then run up to the point your app is no longer acceptable. 5) Tune 6) Go to step 3. The problem with giving you a size for your needs is that all apps are different. It really depends on the size of your requests, frequency, and how large each one is, it also depends on the size as well as the queries you do (Many joins, indexing on tables, db configuration, etc...) Your best bet is to take a machine like the one you are running on now and do some benchmarking as above. That will determine a base of how much the machine can take you assuming you do not optimize anything.
