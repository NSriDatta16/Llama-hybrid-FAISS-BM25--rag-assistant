How to conduct dominance analysis with a large number of predictors?

I'm attempting to conduct a dominance analysis on a linear regression model with about 25 predictors. Specifically, I'm using the relaimpo package. https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v017i01 I believe the function estimates the average incremental variance of a predictor over all possible orders of predictor entry. That said, I might be misunderstanding something. Thus, this procedure is only computationally tractable for a small number of predictors. Perhaps up to 20 or so. Thus, I was wondering what people do when they want to apply this method to models with more predictors. Is there a standard way of sampling predictor sets/orderings? Is there an R package that implements this?
