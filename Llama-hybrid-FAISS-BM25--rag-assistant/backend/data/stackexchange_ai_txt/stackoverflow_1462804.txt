This is a guess, but based on the Javadoc for PersistenceCapable it looks like the class is woven with additional code by the JDO enhancer to implement the interface. If this is the case it is quite possible the additional code is not covered by your tests. If you remove the annotation and run the tests again do you see the expected coverage? From the Javadoc: In the Reference Implementation, the JDO Enhancer modifies the class to implement PersistenceCapable prior to loading the class into the runtime environment. The Reference Enhancer also adds code to implement the methods defined by PersistenceCapable. You could also try using a decompiler like JAD to inspect the compiled class to verify if the class is indeed woven with additional methods at compile time (or as a pre process). Again from the Javadoc: The extra methods in the PersistenceCapable interface might be generated by pre-processing a .java file, or might be generated from a tool directly. The exact technique for generating the extra methods is not specified by JDO.
