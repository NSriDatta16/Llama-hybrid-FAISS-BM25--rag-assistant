I would use a mapping such as Percent Encoding aka URL encoding because of various mismatches between the file-system -- imagine the phrase includes "../../etc/passwd" -- and poor (or absent or differeing) unicode-implementations. Wiki has some about Unicode in HTML ; make sure that the correct encoding hints are returned to the browser in Content-Type (e.g. don't rely on the default) and that your FS (and the PHP/web-server access) allow names with Unicode and/or are "talking" the same encoding (UTF-8/percent-encoded, or otherwise). Also, HTTP/URIs doesn't "understand" Unicode, only ASCII. See Unicode characters in URLs which talks about the common encoding(s) used. Modern browsers will do the encoding automatically (while still showing the unicode glyphs in the location bar, etc.). However, relying on a browser to do this encoding automatically means that unaware browsers will not act properly. Hence, back to paragraph one.
