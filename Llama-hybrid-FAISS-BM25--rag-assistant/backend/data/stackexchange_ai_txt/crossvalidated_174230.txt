Combining discrete variable and continuous variables in a linear model framework

I'm trying to assess the influence of temperature, geography and larvae connectivity on the genetic structure (Fst values) of a marine species. I used a linear regression framework, which examine the correlation between the genetic variation (FST) and temperature/geography (GEO) values. For instance giving the following command in R: lm(Fst ~ GEO + TEMP, data) On the other side, I have larvae connectivity (CO) values that I want to include in the model I build. For instance the model would be: lm(Fst ~ GEO + TEMP + CO) However, the connectivity values are either 0 (not connected) or 1 (connected). These values follow more a logistic regression than a linear one. Then, how could I include these connectivity values test in my linear model with temperature and geography? When I tested lm(Fst ~ CO) , the residuals seems correct. Could I trust the results and use a simple linear regression model for these data? Thanks for your help.
