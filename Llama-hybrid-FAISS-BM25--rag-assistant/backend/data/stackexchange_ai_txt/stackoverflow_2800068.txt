If you want the UITextField to keep it's data between launches of your app, you will need to look into data persistence . If you just want it to be the same if they navigate back to it from another view, simply leave the UITextField allocated, or better yet, store the data in an object reserved for data storage, not presentation, and then load the existing name from that every time you allocate the UITextView .
