If you are actually asking: How to attach and insert inline images in a html email? you can use this for guidance :) https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-inline-images-in-HTML In that example, pay extra attention to how the src attribute of the img tag is filled (the "cid" is actually the id given as "Content-ID:" for the image attachment header). Hope this helps, all the best...
