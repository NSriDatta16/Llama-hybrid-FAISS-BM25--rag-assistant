Fitted values above one in a logistic regression

I have a binary dependent variable ( R ) and four numeric independent variables ( Q, M, S, T ) and want to examine coefficients for them. Here is my glm code in R: fit = glm(R ~ Q + M + S + T, data=data, family=binomial()) When I run predict(fit) , I get a lot of predicted values greater than one (but none below 0 so far as I can tell). I have tried bayesglm and glmnet per suggestions to similar questions but both are a little over my head and the output I did get didn't seem to fix my problem. I want to know: A) Is this typical of logistic regression? B) If not, how do I fix it?
