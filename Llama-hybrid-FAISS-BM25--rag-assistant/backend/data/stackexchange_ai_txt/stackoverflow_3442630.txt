I read over your question and it seems to me that you want to duplicate data already stored by Twitter. Without more specifics on the competition your running, how users enter for example, estimated amount of entries; its impossible to know whether or not storing this information locally on a database is the best way to approach this problem. Might a better solution to be, skip storing duplicate data locally and drag the entrants directly from twitter, i.e. when your attempting to find a winner. You could eliminate duplicate entries on-the-fly then whilst the code is running. You would just need to call "the next page" once its finished processing the 100 entries its already fetched. Although, i'm not sure if this is possible directly through the Twitter API.
