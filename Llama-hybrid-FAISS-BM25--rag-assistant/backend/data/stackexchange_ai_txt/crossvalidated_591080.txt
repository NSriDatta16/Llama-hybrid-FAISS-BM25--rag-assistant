Your intuition works for univariate multilevel/hierarchical models, but the link you provide describes multivariate multilevel models. So rather than data on $_{}$ : outcome $$ of unit $$ at time $$ the outcomes are a vector, say $[y_{it}, z_{it}]^{'}$ (variables tarsus and back in the posted example). Thus, there are 2 random intercepts (for $y$ and $z$ ) rather than 1 (for $y$ only), say: $u_i$ : the degree to which subject $i$ 's average score on $y$ is higher/lower than the grand mean $\bar{y}$ $v_i$ : the degree to which subject $i$ 's average score on $z$ is higher/lower than the grand mean $\bar{z}$ Conditioning on these random intercepts can indeed make the errors $[e^{(y)}_{it}, e^{(z)}_{it}]^{'}$ conditionally independent across occasions (e.g., $t$ with $t-1$ ) within each subject $i$ . However, that has nothing to do with correlations across variables at the within- or between-subject levels. Correlation of $u_i$ with $v_i$ indicates whether subjects above average on $y$ tend to be above/below average on $z$ Correlation of $e^{(y)}_{it}$ with $e^{(z)}_{it}$ indicates whether subject $i$ being higher than usual on $y$ at Time $t$ also tends to be higher/lower than usual on $z$ at Time $t$ So, whereas a univariate MLM decomposes $y_{it}$ into subject-level ( $\sigma^2_i$ ) and occasion-level ( $\sigma^2_t$ ) variance components, a multivariate MLM decomposes the entire covariance matrix $\Sigma$ among multiple outcomes ( $y$ and $z$ ) into a subject-level $\Sigma_i$ and an occasion-level $\Sigma_t$ . This is the basis for multilevel SEM, if you are familiar with such models, e.g.: https://psu-psychology.github.io/psy-597-SEM/15_multilevel/multilevel_sem.html#multilevel-sem-msem-overview So to clarify: across-variable correlations of random effects (at Level 2) or errors (at Level 1) are not a violation of conditional independence. Conditional on the random effects, the error-vectors for rows of data are still (conditionally) independent, although there can still be correlation across columns of data (i.e., correlation of residuals of variable $y$ with residuals of variable $z$ ).
