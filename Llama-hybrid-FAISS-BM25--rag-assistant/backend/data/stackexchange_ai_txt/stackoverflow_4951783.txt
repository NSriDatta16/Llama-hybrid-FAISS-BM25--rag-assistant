targeting sprites from a method in the document class - null object reference

I am trying to code a flash app entirely in the document class. I am using GestureWorks with a touch screen. When a user essentially presses a button it calls a method that should hide a specific graphic but not the graphic they touched. Essentially I need a way to refer to a graphic on the screen using a method besides 'e.target'. I am receiving this error: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference. //This code works private function photo1SpriteFlickHandler(e:GestureEvent):void { var openTween:Tween = new Tween(e.target, "x", Strong.easeOut, 232, 970, 5, true); } //this code gives me a null object reference private function photo1SpriteFlickHandler(e:GestureEvent):void { var openTween:Tween = new Tween(photo1Sprite, "x", Strong.easeOut, 232, 970, 5, true); } //photo1Sprite has already been programatically added to the screen as so: var photo1Sprite = new TouchSprite(); var photo1Loader=new Loader(); photo1Loader.load(new URLRequest("media/photos1/photo1.jpg")); photo1Loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,loaderComplete); photo1Sprite.x = 232; photo1Sprite.y = 538; photo1Sprite.scaleX = .3; photo1Sprite.scaleY = .3; photo1Sprite.blobContainerEnabled = true; photo1Sprite.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_DOWN, startDrag_Press); photo1Sprite.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_UP, stopDrag_Release); photo1Sprite.addChild(photo1Loader); addChild(photo1Sprite); It can access photo1Sprite as 'e.target' when the button click happens on the photo1Sprite. The problem happens when to click one button (not photo1Sprite) and have it effect photo1Sprite. So I can make photo1Sprite react if my method is attached to it directly using 'e.target' but not if I am trying to call it from a method that was called from another element on the screen.
