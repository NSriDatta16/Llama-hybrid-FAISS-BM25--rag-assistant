Tuning ARIMA/ETS for univariate time series

I am running auto.arima /ETS models from the forecast package in R on monthly seasonal time series. I see the following fitted picture. Blue - actual data, red - the fit. I see that the fit is not capturing the series well - specifically it is not capturing well the peaks and foots. But the model is recognizing the general curvature of the series. Question: any suggestions how to tune the model to get a better fit?
