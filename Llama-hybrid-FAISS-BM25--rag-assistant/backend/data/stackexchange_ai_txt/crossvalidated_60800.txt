Showing that an apparent continuous variable is actually a 2-level categorical variable

I have some survey data and employees are divided into grades (from 1 to 7). At first glance, this appears to be a continuous variable. However, based on my knowledge of the organization, I know that levels 5 and above are managers, while those in grades 1 to 4 are lower level employees. From this variable, I would like to create a dummy varaible to use as an independent variable in a regression model. (I have done a number of t tests on various variables and shown that there are statistically significant differences between the two groups.) My question is this: what statistical test (if any) can I use to show that there are actually two different groups rather than 7?
