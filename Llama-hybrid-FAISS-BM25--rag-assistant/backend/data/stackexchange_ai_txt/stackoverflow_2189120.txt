Its worth noting that you can also use innerHTML to include other markup. Also if the DIV des not have an ID you can try using getElementsByTagName . Example, to get the first DIV in the document: document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0].innerHTML = " This is a new paragraph "; This allows you to loop through multiple DIVs in the document and check other conditions. And like they said above, if the DIV has an ID that you know will always be there, then thats better to use: document.getElementById("theID").innerHTML = " This is a new paragraph "; Check out Prototype (links below) (or jQuery) in handling this as they make life easier, especially when you get into CSS selectors: http://api.prototypejs.org/dom/dollar.html http://api.prototypejs.org/dom/dollardollar.html http://api.prototypejs.org/dom/element.html#select-class_method
