Clustering structured data

Does clustering make sense at structured data? I have a sales data set from a retail company. The data is structured into Product Lines, Product Groups and Colors and Articles. I wanted to make a cluster analysis to find similar articles or colors, on which I can make a time series analysis and build my predictive model on. Clustering the data with k-means or two-step algorithm will bring probably each product line as a cluster. Right?
