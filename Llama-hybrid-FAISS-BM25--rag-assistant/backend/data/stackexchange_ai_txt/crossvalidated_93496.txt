Matrix factorization is not so much an "algorithm", but a task, and it is IMHO very common. I've seen whole tracks on matrix factorization at major conferences. For example: http://kdd2012.sigkdd.org/tutorials.shtml http://kdd2012.sigkdd.org/program_research_track.shtml#r7 As you have noticed, it performed very well in some competitions, and since then has become a widely employed technique, with tons of research directed that way. MAybe you just did not recognize its omnipresence, because it is often shortened to "NMF" for example. People assume that everybody recognized NMF as "nonnegative matrix factorization". I cannot agree that "very few people have heard of it", on the contrary. I consider it a bit boring, though. Essentially, it's PCA/SVD revisited for recommender systems.
