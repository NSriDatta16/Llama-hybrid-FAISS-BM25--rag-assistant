You want to load the uncompressed, unpacked plugins to load for debugging purposes right? Just do this. Refer ckeditor_source.js instead of ckeditor.js . That way your created plugin inside the ckeditor/_source/plugin s will run. Read Minimum Setup for CKEditor with a microscope :) There is a line like this here _source â€” this directory contains CKEditor source code. It is needed only if you intend to use the ckeditor_source.js script and load CKEditor from source files. Too little documentation for a wonderful editor! Update: And inside the wonderful tutorial link you have provided, George Wu has mentioned that in the first paragraph also. During development, you will want to execute from source code by using ckeditor_source.js instead of ckeditor.js. Now, create ckeditor_source\plugins\footnote folder and plugin.js under that folder. BTW, I found Tutorial create external plugin for CKEDITOR helpful too.
