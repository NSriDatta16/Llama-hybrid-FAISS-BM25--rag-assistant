Which algo you should use is up to debate and sometimes comes down to the person If you're going for accuracy then random forests are a great place to start (as mentioned in the comments) but personally I like logistic regressions as my starting place for this type of problem as they have decent accuracy and are comparatively explainable. But if this is your first Machine Learning problem I'd recommend doing some wider reading first on how to formulate and approach machine learning problems. It'll give you the perspective to decide which model to use on your own. Furthermore, you'll likely need to explain your model choices further down the line and using the "some dude from stack overflow told me to use it" excuse won't cut the mustard.
