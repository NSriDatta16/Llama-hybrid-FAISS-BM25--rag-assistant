An HTTP request that includes a session ID cookie is subject to session hijacking attacks. It is important that if you do allow HTTP and redirect to HTTPS, that cookies are marked as secure. I can't see any technical reason why HTTP needs to be completely blocked either, and many sites do forward HTTP to HTTPS. When doing this it is highly advisable to implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) which is a web security mechanism which declares that browsers are to only use HTTPS connections. HSTS is implemented by specifying a response header such as Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 . Complying user agents will automatically turn insecure links into secure links, thereby reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, if there is a risk that the certificate isn't secure, e.g. the root authority isn't recognised, then an error message is displayed and the response is not shown.
