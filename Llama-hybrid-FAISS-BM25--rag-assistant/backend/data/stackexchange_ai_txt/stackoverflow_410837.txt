MVC is not to replace N-Tier, it is a way to organize the presentation layer. I would not say that the controller is more powerful than the logic layer. Instead, the controller (as a part of the presentation layer) should still call the logic layer. Controllers should only prepare data for views and handle actions from views. You should still use your BLL.
