virtual attribute problems with undefined methods

I've used Virtual attributes in the past but I can't seem to get past this, and I know the answer is probably staring me in the face. I have a model like so: model Confirmation.rb class Confirmation Your average scaffold controller for confirmations_controller.rb def new @confirmation = Confirmation.new(:confirmation_token => params[:confirmation_token]) respond_to do |format| format.html # new.html.erb format.xml { render :xml => @confirmation } end end new.html.erb New confirmation ... routes.rb map.confirmation "confirmation/:confirmation_token", :controller => "confirmations", :action => "new" map.resources :confirmations error undefined method `confirmation=' for # In the console Booking.find_by_confirmation_token(token) with a given token works perfectly fine. Any ideas? suggestions?
