Can you change what a symlink points to after it is created?

Does any operating system provide a mechanism (system call — not command line program) to change the pathname referenced by a symbolic link (symlink) — other than by unlinking the old one and creating a new one? The POSIX standard does not. Solaris 10 does not. Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) does not. (I'm tolerably certain neither AIX nor HP-UX does either. Judging from this list of Linux system calls , Linux does not have such a system call either.) Is there anything that does? (I'm expecting that the answer is "No".) Since proving a negative is hard, let's reorganize the question. If you know that some (Unix-like) operating system not already listed has no system call for rewriting the value of a symlink (the string returned by readlink() ) without removing the old symlink and creating a new one, please add it — or them — in an answer.
