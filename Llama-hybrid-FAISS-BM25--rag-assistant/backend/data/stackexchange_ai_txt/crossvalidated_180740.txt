Some aspects of your question aren't clear. While I think your first concern about the "levels" at which appr is "positive and highest" is clear and addressable, I don't know what is meant by your second question, "at which values appr converging to possitive (sic) values fastest." Perhaps more importantly, why is "convergence" either useful or helpful to know? You are lucky in that your data isn't large. I wouldn't make this analysis too complicated. There is no reason why a classic ANOVA wouldn't deliver a reasonable answer to your question, in other words, I don't see how survival analysis can help you. Flattening, pushing down the stack or "widening" your file to create a single record would be variance-destroying and not a good idea. You do have an issue with variable selection -- which of the predictors are most useful and/or predictive of appr ? I can't imagine that you would need all of them to fit a model, unless there is some theoretical reason that needs to be articulated. Wrt your first concern about the "levels" which maximize appr , assuming that you are referring to the 3 possible groups, treating group as a qualitative predictor in an ANOVA and, perhaps, dropping the intercept you could obtain coefficients that would be your best indicator of the level where appr is maximized. It would also be worth your while to explore a few of the possible interactions, e.g., price by group, to obtain more representative estimates of the effects. EDIT 2 Thoughts ************ I see what you mean by convergence now. This is a question that applies to the sequencing of the process. In examining time series line plots containing appr and price for the 3 groups, three things stand out suggesting very different processes at work for each group: first, price for group 2 is much higher than for the other 2 groups, second, price is positively related to appr for groups 2 and 3 and negatively related for group 1 and, finally, I'm left wondering why there is any nonlinear variability in price at all given how it's linearly related to appr in group 2 vs the others. In other words, as the sequence for a process unfolds, why doesn't price change as a linear function for each group instead of only for group 2? That would seem to suggest an immediate solution to the longer sequences for groups 1 and 3 as well as an answer to your question about convergence since the maximal value for appr would be reached with fewer steps. In terms of variable selection, there are many approaches to that (everybody has an opinion about which approach is best). I rely on the Lasso. You can use one of the widely available R modules for this. On the other hand, the sheer number of possible covariates and their interactions are so few that you can almost do this step by hand and in the absence of some automatic routine. In fact, a careful specification of the predictors and their combinations might lead to better results.
