It depends on what you're doing with reflection... I've used it a lot to enumerate public APIs, and in Java (through the introspection libraries) to do useful things with JavaBeans. Used thoughtfully it's very useful. I think that issues arise not necessarily when you start using reflection, but when you use it to break encapsulation - peering inside objects to observe and modify otherwise hidden internal state. Unless you're careful tight coupling and fragility can quickly spread through your classes once encapsulation is broken.
