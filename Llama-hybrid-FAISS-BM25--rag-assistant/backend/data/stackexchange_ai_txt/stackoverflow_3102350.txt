How does a good "spec" differ from an unclear "pray?"

I am sure everybody knows the 5Ws , a formula for getting the "full" story on something which is used in journalism. Is there a formula like this -I mean, like that questions should be answered for example- so that a " spec " can be considered as totally complete. Because sometimes I face some features with a spec that sounds like a "pray" more than a specification. -Well, maybe that is even the reason some prays do not come real; specs are not clear enough for the God. So, what makes a "spec" perfect? Any consensus on this exist? Thanks, burak ozdogan
