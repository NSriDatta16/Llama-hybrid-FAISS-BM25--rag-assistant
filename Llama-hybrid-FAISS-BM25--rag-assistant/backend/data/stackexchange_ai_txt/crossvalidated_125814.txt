Consider an indirect evaluation of your features. Train a (feature-selecting!) classificator like random forests on your cluster labels Validate that the classificator works well for this data set, otherwise try other classificators, parameters etc. Inspect the classificator for the most important features. DBSCAN doesn't select features, and there is no obvious way to identify the features which have the most impact. However, random forests and decision trees can be used for this. So by training a classifier on the clusters, you can identify which features are most relevant for transferring the cluster structure to new objects .
