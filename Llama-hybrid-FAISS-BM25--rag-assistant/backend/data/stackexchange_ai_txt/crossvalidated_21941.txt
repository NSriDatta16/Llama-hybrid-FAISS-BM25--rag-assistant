The best way I have understood standard deviation is to think of a hair dresser! (You need to collect data from a hair dresser and averge her hair cutting speed for this example to work.) It takes an average of 30 minutes for the hair dresser to cut a persons hair. Suppose you do the calculation (most software packages will do this for you) and you find that the standard deviation is 5 minutes. It means the following: the hair dresser cuts hair of 68% of her clients within 25 minutes and 35 minutes the hair dresser cuts hair of 96% of her clients within 20 and 40 minutes How do I know this? You need to look at the normal curve, where 68% falls within 1 standard deviation and 96% falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean (in this case 30 minutes). So you add or subtract the standard deviation from the mean. If consistency is desired, as in this case, then the smaller the standard deviation, the better. In this case, the hair dresser spends a maximum of about 40 minutes with any given client. You need to cut hair fast in order to run a successful saloon!
