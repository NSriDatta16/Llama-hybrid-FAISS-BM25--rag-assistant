Most of these are pretty easy. A classic book for such things is Computer Graphics Principles and Practice . Its not cheap though. Wikipedia has some good explanations though Gamma correction Edge Detection though its also worth looking into highpass filtering Changing brightness is a bit more subjective and very much connected with gamma correction, imo. As for grayscale convert .. it can't be easier. You could just take the average of the r, g & b channels. However this doesn't correct for the fact that we see green better than other colours. The "luminance" of an RGB image can be calculated simply by doing (0.3 * r) + (0.59 * g) + (0.11 * b). As you can see that biases the apparent luminance heavily by green with blue giving far less contribution, which is how our eyes work :)
