Measuring dependency of subsequent points from Markov chain

The question is about stimulating different type of species (coded 1-10) based on given species frequencies, and other parameters (eg. mean of normally distributed mass and ratio) using gibbs sampling. I have done all the work above and get a trace plot(shown below), and I want to know after burn in period, how dependent the subsequent points from the Markov chain are. Someone told me to use pacf and acf from time series class but I never learned that before. Could some one explain that or is there any other way to show the dependency? (I interpret dependency as how the next point is dependent on the previous one from the markov chain)
