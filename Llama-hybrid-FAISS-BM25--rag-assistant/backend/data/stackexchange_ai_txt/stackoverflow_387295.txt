My $0.02: "True" HTML debugging, in the sense you're talking about, is not technically possible, because there is no requirement of HTML user agents (web browsers) to render HTML elements in a particular order, nor is there anything like an atomic unit of execution like a "statement". For instance, when rendering a table, should a user agent reserve space for each before rendering their child s (breadth-first)? Or should it render each child and each s child and so forth (depth-first)? In practice, user agents make all kinds of guesses to try to render pages as quickly as possible. In other words, there would be no guarantee that debug-order will match actual render-order, nor should there be. HTML can be thought of as an declarative language in this sense, in that it specifies what should be done (the page rendered to spec) but not exactly how to do it (exactly which order to render elements to the screen). In general, it's best to assume that everything happens at once, although the W3C does give some tips on speeding up rendering based on how user agents should render elements. IMO, the webdev toolbar and Firebug are the best we've got, where we can edit/disable specific HTML elements and CSS rules.
