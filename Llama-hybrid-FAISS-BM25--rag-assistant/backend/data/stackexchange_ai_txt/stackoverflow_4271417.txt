See http://poe.perl.org/?POE_Cookbook - simple bot is described here: http://poe.perl.org/?POE_Cookbook/IRC_Bots Documentation for Bot::BasicBot , which is a wrapper around POE::Component::IRC. http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/184416221 Source of famous bot GumbyBrain , which of course uses POE::Component::IRC and Megahal library. Megahal library uses Markov chains to reply to messages. Don't use Net::IRC - it is not supported anymore.
