what's the fastest winforms datagrid?

I'm currently using a Infragistic UltraGrid and it struggles to handle 500 cell updates per second i.e. the GUI is jerky and slow. What's the fastest winforms grid on the market? I need a grid that can handle 1000 cell updates per second on a high-spec quad-core 32-bit xp machine with 4 gb of RAM. Thanks
