It looks like some of the variation between the communities is explained by the three additional predictors. For example, suppose that wealthc is a strong predictor of your response variable, and its average value varies a lot between communities. If you don't have wealthc in your model, you can see that the communities have different outcomes but you don't know why. Once you include it in the model, the variability between communities decreases, hence the drop in random effect SD.
