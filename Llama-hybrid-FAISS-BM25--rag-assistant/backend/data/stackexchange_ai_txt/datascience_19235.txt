The CPU is the manager of the branch, he can do a bit of everything, but he is not great at much except delegating tasks. However, the GPU is a dedicated mathematician hiding in your machine. If you are doing any math heavy processes then you should use your GPU. Always. If you are using any popular programming language for machine learning such as python or MATLAB it is a one-liner of code to tell your computer that you want the operations to run on your GPU. You should also make sure to use all the cores of your machine. This means making use of parallel computing. Especially for neural networks where operations can be done independently, this is going to increase your speed immensely.
