You have something to think about which is much more important than the normality assumption , and your last plot is helpful. Residuals vs leverage You have some data points with a very high leverage. If you are not used to leverage, Leverage and Influence . I would guess the points with high leverage corresponds to a high fitted value, which leads to ... Residuals vs fitted This plot might indicate a variance increasing with fitted vales, and that is what @Dave indicated in his comment ... but for the very highest fitted values the trend of increasing spread is not followed. That can maybe be explained with high leverage of those points (investigate!), which tends to draw the fitted model to themselves, as if high leverage points have a gravitational force. You could also investigate this by some robust fitting. Normal QQ until you have thought about the first two points, don't even bother to look at this plot.
