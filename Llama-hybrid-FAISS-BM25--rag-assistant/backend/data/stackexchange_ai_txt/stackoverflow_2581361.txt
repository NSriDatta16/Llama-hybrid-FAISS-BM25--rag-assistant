Perhaps setting contentSize to some gigantic value and then moving a limited number of underlying views around to track the view position as in the Tiling sample will do the trick. To mitigate the possibility of eventually reaching an edge and having to abruptly recenter the view (which cancels any scrolling currently in motion), the view can be recentered when it is stationary, from time to time. Anyway, that's what I'm about to try.
