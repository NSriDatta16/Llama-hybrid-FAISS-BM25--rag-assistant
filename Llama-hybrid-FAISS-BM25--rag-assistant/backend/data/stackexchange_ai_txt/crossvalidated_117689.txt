Simulating draws from a Uniform Distribution using draws from a Normal Distribution

I recently purchased a data science interview resource in which one of the probability questions was as follows: Given draws from a normal distribution with known parameters, how can you simulate draws from a uniform distribution? My original thought process was that, for a discrete random variable, we could break the normal distribution into K unique subsections where each subsection has an equal area under the normal curve. Then we could determine which of K values the variable takes by recognizing which area of the normal curve the variable ends up falling into. But this would only work for discrete random variables. I did some research into how we might do the same for continuous random variables, but unfortunately I could only find techniques like inverse transform sampling that would use as input a uniform random variable, and could output random variables from some other distribution. I was thinking that perhaps we could do this process in reverse to get uniform random variables? I also thought about possibly using the Normal random variables as inputs into a linear congruential generator, but I'm not sure if this would work. Any thoughts on how I might approach this question?
