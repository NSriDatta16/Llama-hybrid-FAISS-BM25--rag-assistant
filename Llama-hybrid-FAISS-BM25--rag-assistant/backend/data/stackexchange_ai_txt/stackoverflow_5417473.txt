I think you cannot read the database of another app. As in Android every app has it's own storage location on the file system which cannot be accessed from other processes. The only exception is if it is defined in the manifest file that other applications are allowed to access the data. As you're trying to access the data of an application that you don't own, you cannot edit its manifest file to grant yourself access to the data. The only way to read the database would be if you got a rooted phone. Then you can pull the database on you PC and push it back into the store of you app. But I think that's not what you're looking for.
