Getting C# DLL events from VB.Net

I'd like to be able to access the events in a C# DLL so I can display a Progress Bar as the file analysis is carried out - the DLL is written by a third party using VB.Net. Details C# FileAnaysis.DLL Contains a public class FileManager which contains 2 public subs public void ProgAnalysis(string fileName) public void ProgAnalysis(string fileName, ProgressChangedEventHandler progressChangedEventHandler, RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler runWorkerCompletedEventHandler) How do I access the events generated by second sub in Vb.Net?
