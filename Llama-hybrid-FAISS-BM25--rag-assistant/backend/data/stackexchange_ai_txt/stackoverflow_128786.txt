It's not a single command, but here's how I do it. The following script has been designed to run in SQL*Plus. Note, I've purposely written this to only work within the current schema. set heading off spool drop_constraints.out select 'alter table ' || owner || '.' || table_name || ' disable constraint ' || -- or 'drop' if you want to permanently remove constraint_name || ';' from user_constraints; spool off set heading on @drop_constraints.out To restrict what you drop, filter add a where clause to the select statement:- filter on constraint_type to drop only particular types of constraints filter on table_name to do it only for one or a few tables. To run on more than the current schema, modify the select statement to select from all_constraints rather than user_constraints. Note - for some reason I can't get the underscore to NOT act like an italicization in the previous paragraph. If someone knows how to fix it, please feel free to edit this answer.
