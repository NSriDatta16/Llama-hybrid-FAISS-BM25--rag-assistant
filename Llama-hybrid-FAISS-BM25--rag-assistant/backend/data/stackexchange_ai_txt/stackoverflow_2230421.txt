How do I implement a sort of a head to tail list?

Given the following inputs: (note: this is not a linked list, it's all one string output from a web app that I don't have control over) DAVSCAF1WD6-11 ==> MOTENVF1WD6-11 MOTENVF1WD6-11 ==> WNDVUTF1WD4-11 TPKAKSF1WD6-11 ==> KSCYMOF1WD6-11 WNDVUTF1WD3-11 ==> WGTNUTF1WD2-11 DNVRCOF1WD7-11 ==> BELTKSF1WD3-11 SNFCCAF1WD6-16 ==> DAVSCAF1WD5-16 WGTNUTF1WD2-11 ==> DTSRCOF1WD3-11 DTSRCOF1WD3-11 ==> DNVRCOF1WD6-11 BELTKSF1WD3-11 ==> TPKAKSF1WD6-11 I need to produce the following results: SNFCCAF1WD6-16 ==> DAVSCAF1WD5-16 DAVSCAF1WD6-11 ==> MOTENVF1WD6-11 MOTENVF1WD6-11 ==> WNDVUTF1WD4-11 WNDVUTF1WD3-11 ==> WGTNUTF1WD2-11 WGTNUTF1WD2-11 ==> DTSRCOF1WD3-11 DTSRCOF1WD3-11 ==> DNVRCOF1WD6-11 DNVRCOF1WD7-11 ==> BELTKSF1WD3-11 BELTKSF1WD3-11 ==> TPKAKSF1WD6-11 TPKAKSF1WD6-11 ==> KSCYMOF1WD6-11 This is a list where each tail points to the head of the next item in line (ex. SNFCCAF ==> DAVSCAF ==> DAVSCAF ==> MOTENVF ==> MOTENVF ==> WNDVUTF ==> etc. ) Only the leading alpha charaters are significant in this case. How can I accomplish this as elegantly as possible? The language this is being implemented in is Java.
