Problems that require "intuition" are better suited to ANNs, for example hand writing recognition. You train a neural network with a huge amount of input and rate it until you're done (this takes a long time), but afterwards you have a blackbox algorithm/system that can " guess " the hand writing, so you keep your little brain and use it as a module for many years or something. Because training a quality ANN for a complex problem can take months I'm worst case, and luck. Most other evolutionary algorithms " calculate " an adhoc solution on the spot, in a sort of hill climbing pattern. Also as pointed out in another answer, during runtime an ANN can " guess " faster than most other evolutionary algorithms can " calculate ". However one must be careful, since the ANN is just " guessing " an it might be wrong.
