There must be some better than one I wrote recently, because that one's so bad: Just Create a user control drag a couple of buttons to it, anchor bottom center, make them ok and cancel drag a Property Grid control onto it, dock fill Add a read-only property to the control of type SqlConnectionStringBuilder, back it with a field Initialize the field to a new SqlConnectionStringBuilder instance In the Load event, set the Object property of the property grid to the SqlConnectionStringBuilder That's pretty much that. The user just gets to fill in the properties. If you like, you can also create a ConnectionString property on the control and have it return the .ConnectionString property of the SqlConnectionStringBuilder.
