How does this Bookmarklet allow you to stay signed into this site?

I have come across Evernote's bookmarklet and was wondering how this worked. You can just drag it to your bookmark and go to any webpage, click that bookmarklet and it will first ask you to login in. All this I have done already and know how it works. The bit that I don't understand is that when you log in they authenticate you and allow you to submit stuff (in this case, a site url etc). When you are done the bookmarklet which placed a small overlay on the page you are viewing disappears. When you go to a new tab and use the bookmarklet again you are still logged in! How? I can see they are using an iFrame when their bookmarklet loads the overlay onto the page - but do they set cookies or something? If so, is this secure? Anyone can change the values? Or are they using some sort of private/public key system Btw, I would like to replicate this Bookmarklet using PHP/Javascript(JQuery maybe). I would appreciate if anyone can help me understand how they do this or point me to relevant tutorials. Thanks all for any help.
