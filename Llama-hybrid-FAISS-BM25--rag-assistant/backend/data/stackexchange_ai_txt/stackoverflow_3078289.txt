How do I convince programmers in my team to do TDD?

I am aware of this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/428691/how-to-encourage-implementation-of-tdd In my team, we write a lot of unit tests. But, in general the programmers tend to write unit tests after wrting the code. So, we first finish the module functionality and then write tests. Our coverage is around 70% for most modules. I have tried convincing my technical manager and my team members to do pure TDD wherein we first write tests and then the code, but invain. I think writing tests first allows us to discover design better. Am I just being finicky, especially when our coverage is quite high? If the answer to this question is no, then how do I talk to people to have a test-first approach. EDIT: I think writing tests after writing code is an easier thing to do. People in my team have got accustomed to do this and are opposing any change.
