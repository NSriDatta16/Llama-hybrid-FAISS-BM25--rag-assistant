Draggin Dropping of AVM1(ActionScript 1/2) dont work in AVM2(ActionScript 3/Flex)

I have a application developed in ActionScript 2 which has dragging/dropping activity. which works fine. I used following to test dropping dropObject.hitTest(_root._xmouse, _root._ymouse, true) //if true, drop currently dragging object Problem occurs when I put this SWF in my Flex application SWFLoader container. dragging dosen't work at all in this case. any ideas guys?
