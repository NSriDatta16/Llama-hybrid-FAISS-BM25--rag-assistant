Since you've used the word 'Automatically', I assume that you're looking for an unsupervised method. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection techniques do not need training data. They are based on two basic assumptions. First, they presume that most of the network connections are normal traffic and only a very small traffic percentage is abnormal. Second, they anticipate that malicious traffic is statistically various from normal traffic. According to these two assumptions, data groups of similar instances which appear frequently are assumed to be normal traffic, while infrequently instances which considerably various from the majority of the instances are regarded to be malicious. The most common unsupervised algorithms are: K-Means Self-organizing maps (SOM) C-means Expectation-Maximization Meta algorithm (EM) Adaptive resonance theory (ART) Unsupervised Niche Clustering (UNC) One-Class Support Vector Machine I suggest you to take a look into all of the above methods and choose the one that fits your problem. There are also more advanced and modern approaches which I don't suggest (at the beginning). If the above methods didn't solve your problem, then use the more advanced methods.
