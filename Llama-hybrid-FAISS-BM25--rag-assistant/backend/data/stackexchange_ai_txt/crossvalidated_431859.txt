You have evidently have hourly measurements, so you can devise your measure of misfit, say $$\sum_{h=0}^{23} | y_{ih} - \bar y_h|,$$ or even $$\sum_{h=0}^{23} (y_{ih} - \bar y_h)^2,$$ and choose days with values closest to 0. Here $y_{ih}$ is the value for $y$ for day $i$ and hour $h$ and $\bar y_h$ is the average over days for hour $h$ . I have little interest in advocating either measure as especially good and still less in attacking others. The point is that you need your own criterion for "close to average" that matches your concerns, and then it's just computing. This criterion does not explicitly focus on matching times of peaks or troughs. As just one more variation, it could be that misfit is better measured on some transformed scale, e.g. root or logarithm.
