How do I get camera intent to save more than one image?

I have a following question. I'm using camera intent that starts from a menu button like this case R.id.camera: final Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.fromFile(getTempFile(this))); startActivityForResult(intent, TAKE_PHOTO_CODE); return true; This is working just fine and it saves original image (original size which I want). Than I also have the following code private File getTempFile(LovneDobe lovneDobe) { final File path = new File( Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), lovneDobe.getPackageName() ); sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED, Uri.parse("file://"+ Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()))); if(!path.exists()){ path.mkdir(); } return new File(path, "image.jpg"); } and this code saves the picture on SDcard and it also puts it into my gallery. But the problem I'm facing is that it saves only one picture. When I take another one it overwrites the previous one. And now my question is how can I modify this so that it would save every picture I would take? Thank in advance to anyone who is willing to help.
