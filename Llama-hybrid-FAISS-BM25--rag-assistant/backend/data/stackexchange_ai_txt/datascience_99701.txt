1.) If your aim is to find the most relevant features the first thing you should do is feature engineering using Domain Knowledge. It is the most effective feature selection technique out there and in done properly, does not require any extra feature selection techniques. 2.) After you do the above step, if you want to get a measure of "importance" of the features w.r.t the target, mutual_info_regression can be used. It will give the importance values of all your features in on single step!. Also it can measure "any kind of relationship" with the target (not just a linear relationship like some techniques do). 3.) If you further want to do feature selection, you can try one the wrapper based techniques like RFECV, forward/backwards selection techniques etc. Personally I would go with RFECV! I would say focus most your effort on step 1 as it will definitely give you best results.
