One var per function in JavaScript?

I've been using JSLint to make me feel bad about my JavaScript. It is great, by the way. There is one check that I don't quite understand and I'd like your views, please. From jslint.com : In languages with block scope, it is usually recommended that variables be declared at the site of first use. But because JavaScript does not have block scope, it is wiser to declare all of a function's variables at the top of the function. It is recommended that a single var statement be used per function. What is the last sentance in bold really saying? I think I should be declaring multiple variables like this? var foo = 1, bar = 2; And, is the "wise" part just a programming style to discourage errors down the line or is there more to it than that? Thanks for your help.
