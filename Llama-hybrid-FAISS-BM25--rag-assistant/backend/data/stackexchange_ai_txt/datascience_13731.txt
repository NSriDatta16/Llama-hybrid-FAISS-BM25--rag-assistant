Machine Learning model to find items that are frequently bought together using Hadoop Spark

I need to do my master thesis under Big Data Analytics - Machine Learning subject. I was challenged to create a Market Basket Analysis project on retail industry. My dataset contains transactions of a supermarket over a year and I will have to predict which products are associated. The requirements for my project are: - We must visualize the evolution of the model (Learnable Evolution Model) - Must be done using Hadoop tool (+ Spark) I already look for multiple source codes/tutoriais to learn how can I do this but I can't find a machine learning implementation project for find patterns using Spark... Anyone have an idea how can I find some good tutorials to learn this skills for me to do my master thesis algorithm?
