It may be the case that the model assumptions are far from resembling your data, thus making the algorythm that calculates the model parameters unable to converge. Another possibility is that one of the parameters tends towards infinity, as would be the case if you tried logistic regression on the following data (explaining_variable, health_state): (1, healthy); (1, healthy); (-1, sick); (-1, sick) Here a logistic regression model would try to make the effect of the explanatory as big as possible, with the optimization algorithm that fits the model never converging (it can always keep making the parameter bigger and bigger)
