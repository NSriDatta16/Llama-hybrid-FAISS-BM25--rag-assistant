How would I go about implementing a schedule system for a bunch of factory stations

I have 5 stations that workers take their tasks from, tasks are of varying length. I am looking to carve up an interactive view that will allow their supervisor to drag around and resize tasks on a day view. Are there any advanced libraries that already do this? EDIT: Reworded for clarity
