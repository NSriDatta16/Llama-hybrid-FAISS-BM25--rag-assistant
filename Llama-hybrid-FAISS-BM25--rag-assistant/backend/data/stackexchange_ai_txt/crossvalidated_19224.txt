Combining machine learning models

I'm kind of new to datamining/machine learning/etc. and have been reading about a couple ways to combine multiple models and runs of the same model to improve predictions. My impression from reading a couple papers (which are often interesting and great on theory and greek letters but short on code and actual examples) is that it's supposed to go like this: I take a model ( knn , RF , etc) and get a list of classifiers between 0 and 1. My question is how to do combine each of these lists of classifiers? Do I run the same models on my training set so that the number of columns going into the final model are the same or is there some other trick? It would be great if any suggestions/examples included R code. NOTE: This is for a data set w/ 100k lines in the training set and 70k in the test set and 10 columns.
