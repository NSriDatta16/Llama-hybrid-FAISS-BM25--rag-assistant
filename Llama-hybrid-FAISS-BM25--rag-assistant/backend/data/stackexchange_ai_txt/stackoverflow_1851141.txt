converting css hover to jquery hover

I am building a website with hover effects. See http://vitaminjdesign.com/index.html and look at the services section in the bottom right. I am using :hover to change the background color. I want to use jquery to acheive the same result with an elegant fade. Here is my html: Website Design (repeated 6 times with different images and text) Basically, when .iconrow is rolled over, I want the background to change from none to background-color: #cccccc; and when it is rolled off, back to none.
