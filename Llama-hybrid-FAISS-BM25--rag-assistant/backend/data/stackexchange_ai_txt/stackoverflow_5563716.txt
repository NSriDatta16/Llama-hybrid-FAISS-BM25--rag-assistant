PostgreSQL join: delete records present in one table, but not another

I have a Drupal website embedding a Flash game. The registered website users are listed in the drupal_users table - here the list of those, registered over a week ago: # select uid, created from drupal_users where to_timestamp(created) The Flash game users are listed in another table - the pref_users and have "DE" string prepended to their id: # select id from pref_users where id like 'DE%' limit 5; id -------- DE9054 DE9055 DE9056 DE9057 DE9058 (5 rows) I would like to get rid of the (probably SPAM robots) users who registered at my website over a week ago, but still haven't played the Flash game. I.e. I'd like to delete drupal_users records, which are not present in the pref_users table . At the same time I'd prefer not to do something like: # delete from drupal_users where to_timestamp(created) because I'm not sure, how big the select statement above is allowed to be (maybe there is a limit? I'm using PostgreSQL 8.4.7 and CentOS 5.5/64 bit. Before Drupal7 I was using phpBB3 and sometimes I had seen such kind of SQL-statements fail while deleting old forum posts from phpBB3 admin console). So my question is, if the statement above can be rewritten as some kind of SQL-join ?
