Shouldn't it be the weighted average of the two sample-specific slopes (with positive weights)? First of all, you are not calculating weighted average there. Your second model calculates separate slope for each group, the first one, single slope for all the samples. You are not calculating the weighted average anywhere, at least this is not what you are showing. Second, answering your question, no they shouldn't in the case described by you. On example where this does not happen is Simpson's paradox . You can have completely different slopes for groups and for all the data. One such a case is shown below, where each group has a positive slope, but the overall slope is negative. If you indeed calculated separate models per each group and calculated weighted average of the slopes, than, as a convex combination, the result would fall somewhere between the two original slopes.
