Obscured object segmentation in binary segmentation

I am using deep learning for building outline segmentation. I have used binary segmentation method using UNet model which runs on Tensorflow 2.0 . The output is fine when there are no other object (Ex. Trees) obscures the building. But when building is under the tree, it produces incorrect segmentation results. Please refer screenshots below Raw image: Segmentation result overlaid: What I want! Details of output: Input for the segmentation is raw image and output is a raster containing building segmentation where building pixels are classified as 1 and non building pixels are classified as 0 using UNet deep learning trained model My requirement: I want the output prediction for the obscured areas (marked as green boundary in the above screenshot). Current segmentation method fails to predict that as building as it is barely visible in the input image. My attempt: So far I have not attempted to fix this problem, any suggestions are appreciated
