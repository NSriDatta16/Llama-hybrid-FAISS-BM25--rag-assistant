Empirical indications regarding demanded skills and tasks of data science jobs?

I am wondering if there are is any information about the current (and prospected) shares in skills required for advertised/existing data science jobs. This includes of course also the concrete tasks required to be done in this area. For example I am wondering how many jobs are focused on training deep learning models vs. designing data processing architectures vs. providing concrete answers to variable data-related questions. Or information retrieval vs. supervised learning vs. data mining (extraction) vs. visualization of structured information, etc. I think this is relevant because many people are not fully trained in all of these aspects. I also think with the potential of a black-swan-like AI revolution based on what we are currently seeing with ChatGPT, such information would be very relevant to make some projections into the future, because some of these tasks may soon be directed to black-box AI APIs rather than humans.
