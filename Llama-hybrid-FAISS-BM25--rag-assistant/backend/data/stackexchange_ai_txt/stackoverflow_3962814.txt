Visual Studio Crashing When I Select Text in Code Editor

I just installed VS 2010 and had no errors, but whenever I'm in the code editor and try to select text, either by CTRL-A, SHIFT-ARROW or click and drag the program crashes. Here is the debug info: EventType : clr20r3 P1 : devenv.exe P2 : 10.0.30319.1 P3 : 4ba1fab3 P4 : uiautomationprovider P5 : 4.0.0.0 P6 : 4ba1f837 P7 : 3 P8 : 0 P9 : system.dllnotfoundexception The only mention of it I an find on google is this link, to which I have just posted: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vseditor/thread/7e8983f8-48c5-4c6c-acef-c6c128a3baa6
