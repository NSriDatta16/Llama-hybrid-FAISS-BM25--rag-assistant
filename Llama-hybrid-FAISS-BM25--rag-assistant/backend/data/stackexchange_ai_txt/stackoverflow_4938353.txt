You should check out this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-62tRHLcHk . The guy goes over device support for different OpenGL ES versions and shows you how to get started with OpenGL on the Android. He also talks about the fragmentation of devices and how you can support them. Basically most "2nd generation" devices support 2.0 and have been shipping since late 2009. If you're going to target just 2.0 devices then you'll obviously have to do a system check to make sure device X has the proper hardware specs. If you want to see how to setup a basic OpenGL renderer in the SDK jump to 21:00 in that video.
