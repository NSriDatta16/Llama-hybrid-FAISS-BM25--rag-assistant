how about using federated tables on one of the servers? create the federated tables based on the remote tables you will use in the query and just run your query as if your database was all local. example below from MySQL site The procedure for using FEDERATED tables is very simple. Normally, you have two servers running, either both on the same host or on different hosts. (It is possible for a FEDERATED table to use another table that is managed by the same server, although there is little point in doing so.) First, you must have a table on the remote server that you want to access by using a FEDERATED table. Suppose that the remote table is in the federated database and is defined like this: CREATE TABLE test_table ( id INT(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', other INT(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0', PRIMARY KEY (id), INDEX name (name), INDEX other_key (other) ) ENGINE=MyISAM CHARSET=latin1; The example uses a MyISAM table, but the table could use any storage engine. Next, create a FEDERATED table on the local server for accessing the remote table: CREATE TABLE federated_table ( id INT(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', other INT(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0', PRIMARY KEY (id), INDEX name (name), INDEX other_key (other) ) ENGINE=FEDERATED DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 CONNECTION='mysql://fed_user@remote_host:9306/federated/test_table'; (Before MySQL 5.0.13, use COMMENT rather than CONNECTION.)
