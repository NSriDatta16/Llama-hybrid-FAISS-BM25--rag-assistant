A "learning curve" originally had total elapsed time [or total cumulative units manufactured/learned] on the X axis and the time required to produce/learn a single unit on the y axis. Your first unit always takes more time than the 100th or 1,000th. The "steepness" of the curve depends on how fast you get good at producing/learning a thing. Learn quickly and you have a "steep" curve; slowly and you have a flat curve. I agree that the uninformed have morphed the original meaning of the term, but to be accurate steep is easy . People get upset because those of us who paid attention to using language correctly in school rarely get to take part in this type of evolution.
