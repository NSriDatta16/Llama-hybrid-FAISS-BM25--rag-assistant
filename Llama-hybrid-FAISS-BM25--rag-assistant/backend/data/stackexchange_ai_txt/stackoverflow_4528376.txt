You seem to want an IE CSS workaround without having to specify a complete new stylesheet. You can have that using conditional comments, eg to target IE6: then you can use a CSS rule like: body.browser-ok .troublesome_thing { troublesome-style: something; } in your main stylesheet. There is almost never a good reason to look at navigator.userAgent , which is troublesome and unreliable even by browser-sniffing standards. ETA: I'm adding a text-shadow inside a button. You don't need to browser-sniff for that. Just include the rule. If it works, it works, if it doesn't you've lost nothing. If you want to provide a backup style for browsers that don't support it, you could use alternative rules: button { text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px white; } body.support-noshadow button { background: white; } with some JS to detect the case: if (!('textShadow' in document.body.style)) document.body.className+= ' support-noshadow';
