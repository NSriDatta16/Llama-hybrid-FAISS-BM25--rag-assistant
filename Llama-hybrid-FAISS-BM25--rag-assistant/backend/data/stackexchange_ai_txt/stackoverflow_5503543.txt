If you're curious about this sort of stuff you should play around with Chrome Developer Tools, the Firefox Firebug Addon or the Safari's 'Developer' menu. They're really great at giving you an insight as to what is going on in a webpage As to "how did they build this" there's many, many different technologies being used up and down the web application stack. Keep in mind the servers storing, caching and fetching all this data are just as much a part of the web application as the frontend. But I imagine your question is asking how "how did they get this webpage to do all this interactive stuff". Basically it looks like it's all traditional HTML/CSS--no "HTML5" canvas shenanigans or Flash. The interactivity comes from their custom Javascript code. I tried to figure out if they're using some popular 3rd party Javascript Framework (like jQuery or Prototype) but they are importing so many scripts it's hard to follow. Interestingly enough jQuery and $ are not defined variables on the Evernote page, so it looks like they're not using jQuery at the least. They have clearly written a lot of Javascript to get this thing up and running so it's not that big of a stretch to imagine they they would just decide to keep all their code in-house. FYI: The three columns are just absolutely positioned and sized s. ... ... ... The scrolling that you see in those columns is done in child s.
