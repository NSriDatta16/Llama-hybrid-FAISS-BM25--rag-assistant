This doesn't really answer your question, but may actually be helpful: Why jQuery? What other JavaScript frameworks did you look at? Do you think, you have a good understanding of JavaScript at all? While jQuery is not only popular, but also very good (two things that often exclude each other), I don't think it is a good way to start learning JavaScript. The point of frameworks as jQuery is to prevent JavaScript developers of doing the same, stupid, dull, quirky JS-coding over and over again. However, I think before starting to use jQuery, you should first have a shot at that very stupid, dull and quirky work, to understand JavaScript and frameworks like jQuery. Then, when you have made a project with classic JavaScript and HTML, try simplyfying and enhancing it using jQuery. jQuery has it's place, but as bobince elegantly put it, it is clearly overused, even in places where it's more complicated: http://www.doxdesk.com/updates/2009.html#u20091116-jquery Now if you really do not want to fight the intricacies of DOM manipulation, I'd rather suggest pure JavaScript frameworks such as qooxdoo , which unlike jQuery doesn't simplify DOM manipulation, but rather promotes a clear, component based, object oriented and high level approach to creating JavaScript RIAs. greetz back2dos
