It's a simple rule that the sum of ratios is not the same as the ratio of sums. This is a result of Jensen's inequality. To really compare apples and oranges, you need to "average" out the second expression which is an average incidence of 0.038, still much higher than the first expression 0.008, but both can be described as the average incidence of the sample. These are two different ways of summarizing incidence. The first approach is called a geometric mean. You would get 0.008 from $\exp(\log(1/365) + \log(3/250) + \log(1/10))$ . The geometric mean tends toward the median more than the arithmetic mean. You can also refer to the geometric mean in this case as a Poisson intensity. It's desirable that the subject with the highest incidence: 1 scan every 10 days, is heavily downweighted by the fact they're only observed for 10 days. That's because this very high incidence has very high variability.
