Typically, decreased sample sizes result in poorer power, whatever then concerns about the population distribution. For example, suppose we know the population of batteries is normal. We don't know the mean $\mu$ for a particular batch, but past experience has shown that the population standard deviation is about $\sigma = 3.$ We are testing $H_0: \mu = 7$ against alternative $H_a: \mu at the 5% level, using a one-sample t test. We would be disappointed not to be able to detect a $\mu$ value as small as $5$ with probability 80%. That is, we want power $0.8.$ The following chart from Minitab, shows that a sample of size $n = 16$ (upper curve) would be large enough to get the desired power, but a sample of size $n = 4$ (lower curve) would not. On the chart, we want the value $-2$ on the horizontal axis, because $7 - 2 = 5.$ Also, if the population is slightly skewed to the right then $n = 4$ may be too few observations for the t test used above to give truthful results. The $T$ test statistic is not distributed even roughly according to Student's t distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom, unless the sample mean is roughly normal. Just as one possible illustration, the histogram on the left shows individual samples from a right-skewed population. The one in the middle shows of averages of $n = 4$ observations; it is still noticeably skewed. By contrast, the histogram on the right shows a more nearly normal distribution of averages of $n = 40$ observations. (The Central Limit Theorem has performed as promised.) So I would say that both objections to a sample of size $n = 4$ seem correct---both poor power and skewed distribution.
