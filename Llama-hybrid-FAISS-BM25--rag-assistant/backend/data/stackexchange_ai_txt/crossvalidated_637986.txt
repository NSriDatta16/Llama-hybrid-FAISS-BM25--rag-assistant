Deriving the Distribution of Markov Chain Times

I am interested in learning how to derive the probability distributions for the Time to Absorption in Markov Chains (Discrete and Continuous). In the past, I have usually done one of the following: Use the Fundamental Matrix to directly determine the Expected Time to Absorption of a Discrete Time Markov Chain Repeatedly simulate time to absorption for a Markov Chain and plot the distribution of these times (this works for both continuous and discrete) Now, I am trying to learn how to derive the exact probability distribution for these absorption times. Loosely speaking, I am aware that Absorption Time Distributions are based on Phase Type Distributions (mixture distributions of exponential/geometric distributions, i.e. weighted sums of exponential/geometric distributions) - but I am not sure how to derive the exact formulas for the probability distributions of absorption times. Doing some research online, I came across the following references: 1) (Distribution for the Absorption Time of a) Discrete Markov Chain: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3281928/what-is-the-distribution-of-time-to-absorption-for-an-absorbing-markov-chain : $$p(k) = \tau T^{k-1} T_0 $$ Where: the last row of the $n\times n$ transition matrix corresponds to the absorbing state $T$ be the upper left $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ block. $\tau$ is the initial distribution $T_0$ is the vector formed by the first $n-1$ entries of the last column of the transition matrix 2) (Distribution for the Absorption Time of a) Continuous Markov Chain: https://www.louisaslett.com/PhaseType/ : $$\begin{array}{rcl} F_X(x) &=& 1 - \boldsymbol{\pi}^\mathrm{T} \exp\{x \mathbf{S}\} \mathbf{e}\\ f_X(x) &=& \boldsymbol{\pi}^\mathrm{T} \exp\{x \mathbf{S}\} \mathbf{s} \end{array}$$ Where: $\pi$ is the initital state distribution $\mathbf{T} = \left( \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{S} & \mathbf{s} \\ \mathbf{0}^\mathrm{T} & 0 \end{array} \right)$ $S$ is a $n$ x $n$ matrix of transition rates Can anyone show me how I can derive these probability distributions from first principles? Once I have these probability distributions, I can then work towards finding the formulas for the variances. I am in the process of trying to derive them myself and I can share my progress if needed.
