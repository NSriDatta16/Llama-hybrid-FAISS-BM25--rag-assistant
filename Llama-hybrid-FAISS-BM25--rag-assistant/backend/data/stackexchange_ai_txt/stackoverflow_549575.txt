How can Hudson delete the artifacts created by my build?

Our organization's custom build tools write out a lot of intermediate data, and I'd like it if Hudson could detect which files were created as part of a build and archive those. I'm not sure if it already does so, but if it does there's no user-visible explanation of it, and certainly deleting a build does not delete its output. In detail here's what I want. Suppose I start with a bare workspace. After build 1, I have this: ws/ src/... obj/ 1/... log/ 1/... pkg/ pkg-1.tgz Now, I run build 2: ws/ src/... obj/ 1/... 2/... log/ 1/.. 2/.. pkg/ pkg-1.tgz pkg-2.tgz The source code is checked out into ws/src each build; there's a custom checkout process, so I can't use the svn RCS method :/. When I delete a build, I'd like to delete everything that came from that build. Can I do this?
