I've used sesame extensively in my projects at work. I've found it to be speedy and reliable enough for most situations I find myself in. It has definitely outperformed Jena's storage solutions on a variety of fronts. Sesame 1.x has faster query performance than the 2.x version, but the 2.x version has some nice features such as contexts and sparql support. If you are looking to use a traditional relational database, you could look at something like D2RQ , or something like Owlgres (if you want inferencing).
