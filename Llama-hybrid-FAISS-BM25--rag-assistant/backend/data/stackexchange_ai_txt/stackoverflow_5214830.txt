I've not tried any of them, but there are a few things which say they do clustering in Python: scipy.cluster (numpy and scipy are the two mainstays of serious numerical computation in Python) Pycluster hcluster (looks like it's not been updated in a couple of years) If none of those do the trick, you could use something like ctypes to call functions from Cluto, although it won't be as elegant.
