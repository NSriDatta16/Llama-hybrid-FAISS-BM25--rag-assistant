ScrollViewer to dynamically fetch new rows when reaching the bottom

I wish to create a scrollviewer which shows its vertical scrollbar regardless of whether it has items to scroll down or not. By doing this, I seek to dynamically fetch more data from a db as the user scrolls towards the bottom. The data is stored in a datagrid (dgGrid), and is wrapped by a scrollviewer (svMain) (see below). The data from the db is retrieved using a a method that triggers on the ScrollViewer.ScrollChanged event. The problem is that even though I set the VerticalScrollBarVisibility property of the scrollviewer to visible (and the vertical scrollbar is shown at all times), the scrollbar is disabled and there is no scroll thumb visible whenever the amount of data in the datagrid fits the height of the screen. If i resize the screen to a smaller size, the vertical scrollbar is enabled and I can move the thumb around. However, I want the scrollbar and its thumb to be enabled regardless of whether the the content of the viewport can accommodate its contents or not. Can anyone provide help on this? Thanks!
