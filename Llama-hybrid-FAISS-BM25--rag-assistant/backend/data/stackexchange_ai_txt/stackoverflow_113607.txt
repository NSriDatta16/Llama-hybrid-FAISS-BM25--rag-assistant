Brandon Savage gave a presentation on his PHP package " ApplicationACL " that may or may not accomplish role-based access. PHPGACL might work as well, but I can't tell you for sure. What I can tell you, however, is the Zend_ACL component of the Zend Framework will do role-based setups (however you'll have to subclass to check multiple roles at once). Granted the pain of this is you'll have to pull out Zend_ACL, I do not believe it has any external dependencies, from the monolithic download (or SVN checkout). The nice thing about Zend_ACL is though its storage agnostic. You can either rebuild it every time or it's designed to be serialized (I use a combination of both, serialize for the cache and rebuild from the DB).
