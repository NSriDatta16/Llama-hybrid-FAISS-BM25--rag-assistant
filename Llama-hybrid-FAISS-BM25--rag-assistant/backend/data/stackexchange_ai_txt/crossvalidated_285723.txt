State of the art methods for combining deep learning with cost/abnormality detection

As the top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet classification challenge is still below 90% ( 1 ), I would like to find those that were not correctly classified. Idea that comes to mind is using a deep learning architecture and add some specific classes cost or abnormality measure (for example LOF ) to the net considerations. I'm looking for state of the art algorithms which do that (combine deep nets with cost/ abnormality detection) and any help would be appreciated.
