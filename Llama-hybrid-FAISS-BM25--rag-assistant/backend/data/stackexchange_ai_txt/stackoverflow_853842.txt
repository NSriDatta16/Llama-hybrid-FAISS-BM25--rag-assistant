How do you return a specific field from Sphinx results?

Assume I'm indexing a table of books. They have title, author, description, etc. I want to do a search across all fields and return the title of the books that contain my search term. I can do a search and return the book_id (doc_id) from Sphinx so I can look them up myself, but what would be really awesome is if Sphinx just gave me the titles so I don't have to hit the database at all. I can get Sphinx to return different attributes to me, but getting a text field is eluding me. Is this possible? If so, how do you do it?
