The code fragment you've shown, from the that plugin's documentation, is quite old by Rails standards. It's not clear whether this plugin or approach would still work given its age and lack of obvious current support and adoption. While not quite answering question, if you were willing to consider a better supported approach, you might take a look at Authlogic (the last biggest thing in Rails authentication). Aside : Devise which is currently attracting a lot of attention in the Rails community doesn't seem to be quite there in terms of OpenID although it looks superb as a framework. Take a look at the tutorial here and don't miss this episode from the incomparable Railscast series. I've found Authlogic to just work with anything I've tried.
