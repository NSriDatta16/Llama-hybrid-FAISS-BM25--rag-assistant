Just use an additional form, without showing it in the taskbar, or other Form-options. Set the region of the form that it only shows the rubber band. And make sure both windows behave as if it was one window (moving, closing,...). I know it's not an elegant way, but with a little work it can produce good results. You can make sure that the form is on top in the form-hierarchy and still doen't receive focus. By setting the region good, all events will go to the other form. That's the way I worked out an equivalent problem (I don't say it's a good solution, but it works)
