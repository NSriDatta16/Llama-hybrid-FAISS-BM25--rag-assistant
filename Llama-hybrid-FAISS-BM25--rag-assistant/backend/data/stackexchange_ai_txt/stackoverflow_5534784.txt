How do "professional" IM bots avoid being kicked off line or locked out?

I'm looking to develop a scalable IM bot (aka Automated Service Agent). It's been done before and I'm wondering what methods are used to maintain reliability. I see two immediate problems with scaling: 1) On AIM, you can be kicked off if too many users warn you. My bot does not spam or do anything malicious but the vulnerability is still there. 2) If there are network problems, and the bot signs on/off too many times in a row, AOL will lock it out for an unknown period of time.
