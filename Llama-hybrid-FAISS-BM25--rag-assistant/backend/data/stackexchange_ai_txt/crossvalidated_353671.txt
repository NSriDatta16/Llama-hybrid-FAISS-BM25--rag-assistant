How do I run a post hoc test for a mixed effects model in Rstudio

I am new to R and pretty average with SPSS so I meed a little advice. I have 34 participants and I am looking at how muscle contractile properties vary amoung 12 different test sites along the back. So each person was tested at the 12 sites. 6 different vertebral levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, MT) on the left side of the spine and 6 on the right side. I want to see 1) if contractile properties vary between vertebral levels, but i want to seperate the left and right sides so I know exactly where the difference occurs. And 2) whether there are any differences between sides but same vertebral level, for example L1 on Left vs L1 on right. 3) if there are any Gender differences between contractile properties at each of the 12 sites. I was told to do a lmer but not sure exactly how and what the best post-hoc test is. I also imported my data table from SPSS. And dont know if I have to/how to convert it to R text becasue when I try to run the test it has an error. I have SPSS too if that is easier to explain. I am worried I am selecting the wrong settings in SPSS. Also for a mixed effects model what is the most appropriate way of presnting the stats? What values would you need to provide in a journal article and what setting do you need to mention in the methods? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
