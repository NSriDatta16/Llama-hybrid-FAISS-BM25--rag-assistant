CLT relates your mean on a sample to the parameters of your observed variable. In this case that observed variable is your biassed measurement, not your underlying actual variable. Name the three possible outcomes x1, x2 and x3. Let r be your chance of correct measurement (in your case 0.4), so that both other outcomes have a chance of (1-r)/2 To estimate the distribution of your actual variable A, using your measured variable M, consider P(M = xi) = sum over j (P(M = xi | A = xj) * P(A = xj)) = r * P(A = xi) + (1-r)/2 * sum for j not i P(A = xj) = r * P(A = xi) + (1-r)/2 * (1 - P(A = xi)) = (1-r)/2 + (3r-1)/2 * P(A = xi) In your case P(M = xi) = 0.3 + 0.1 * P(A = xi) E(M) = 0.3 * mean(x1, x2, x3) + 0.1 * E(A) As the standard deviation of M is less than ´max(x1, x2, x3) - min(x1, x2, x3)´ , the average of n samples will converge to have the above average and a standard deviation of less than (max(x1, x2, x3) - min(x1, x2, x3)) / sqrt(n) From the above we also know P(A = xi) = 2/(3r-1) * (P(M = xi) + (r-1)/2) = 2/(3r-1) * P(M = xi) + (r-1) / (3r-1) in your case P(A = xi) = 10 * P(M = xi) - 3 So if 40% of your measurements give a certain outcome, the actual variable will have a probability of 100% to have that value and if 30% of your measurements give a certain outcome, the actual variable will have a probability of 0% to have that value.
