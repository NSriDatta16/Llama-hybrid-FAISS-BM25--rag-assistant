How to align asp:Menu in DIV tag?

My CSS looks like this: #menu { width: 1024px; height: 25px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: right; background-color: Red; } My asp page looks like this, (in fragment): I want to have menu aligned to the right side of my div tag. Aligment must be done automaticaly, if I add more menu items menu should realign itself. This works as expected under split view in VS 2008, however in IE and FireFox the menu is aligned to the left. How to fix this problem? Thanks for your time.
