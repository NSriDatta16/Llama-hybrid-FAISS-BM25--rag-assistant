What type of prediction model will be suitable in this case?

We have 100 subjects (A,B,C....) in total. We took 2000 tissue samples from each subject. For each subject, we evaluated the outcome(PASS or Fail), but we only evaluated the outcome on the subject level, not on the sample level. We also have other measurements (V1,V2, V3....V300) on the sample level. We have total of 300 measurements. The goal here is to predict the outcome(Categorical variable : PASS/Fail) for each subject using measurements (V1,V2,V3...) taken from sample-level data. Mixed effect random forest first came to my mind, but the prediction is made on the sample level, not on the subject level. Now, I am wondering what kind of model should I consider? Thank you for any idea in advance!
