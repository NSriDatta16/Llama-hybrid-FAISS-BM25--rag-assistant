In Subversion, there technically is no such thing as a "branch" or a "tag". To SVN, they are just copies of a directory. They are only special because of how you treat them. Tag = make a copy of a project, but don't touch it after making a copy. You generally don't want to switch to the tag, because you (normally) won't be committing any changes there. Branch = make a copy of a project, and do some work there. Generally work you do in a branch gets merged with the trunk at some point. If you are making a branch to work on immediately, you probably want to switch to the branch (check the box). NOTE #1: While SVN itself does not have any special treatment of trunk/branches/tags, TortoiseSVN does have a UI hint to discourage committing to a tag. If you check out a tag (or make a tag and switch to it), do some work, then try to commit, TSVN will display a warning message. TSVN tries to guess what you were really trying to do. NOTE #2: You don't necessarily need a tag for a point-in-time snapshot. The revision number of the repo does that for you.
