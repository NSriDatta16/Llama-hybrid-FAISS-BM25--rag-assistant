How to work with an improper uniform prior in R?

I'm coding some Bayesian bandits algorithms for exponential families and for the case when my rewards are normally distributed, I need to use an improper uniform prior. Is there any way to represent this in R? I guess I could use runif(1,0,n) and choose some arbitrarily large $n$ but this still only works for drawing from Unif[0,n] so that wouldn't be ideal. Here's my current code. Once I pull an arm at least once (think of a slot machine), I can sample from the normal posterior. I'm just trying to see how I can formulate a pull from the prior when it's not a probability distribution. select_arm = function() { sampled_theta
