sprintf and char [] vs. string

I need to pass const char * to a function. Before I pass it, I usually need to build it from some variables. I can never decide which approach is more elegant, and overall better: Allocate an array long enough to fit the text and use sprintf to build the final variable and pass it to the function. Initialize string s with a variable using the + operator (concatenation) and then pass it to the function using s.c_str() . Cons of using an array: May not fit the entire text. Pro: Fast. Cons of using a string: I don't need to worry about memory management, easy to build. Pro: Slow. My second question is: How do you usually build a complete string from other variable strings?
