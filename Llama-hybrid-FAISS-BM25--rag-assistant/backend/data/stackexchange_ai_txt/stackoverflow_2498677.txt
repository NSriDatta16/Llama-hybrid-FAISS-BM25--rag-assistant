As Pascal is saying, your question is to broad to answer. A few pointers that might help you: use 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' to generate an Eclipse project out of your pom.xml. There might even be a working eclipse project that allows to open a pom.xml as eclipse project. I can't say, i left eclipse behind for good. spring is 'just' a library that need to be in your classpath. the above command will ensure it is there (if it is defind as dependency in the pom.xml) You need to define a applicationContext.xml for Spring that resides in your classpath. See the Spring documentation for that. hiberate is similar, it is just a library that needs to be in the classpath and that needs to find a config file. in there, the connection to the database is described. See the hibarnate docu (or one of the many blogs out there) for more info. If you are stuck with a particular problem, please describe it so people can help here. Bert
