Return Modal Average in LINQ (Mode)

I am not sure if CopyMost is the correct term to use here, but it's the term my client used ("CopyMost Data Protocol"). Sounds like he wants the mode? I have a set of data: Increment Value .02 1 .04 1 .06 1 .08 2 .10 2 I need to return which Value occurs the most "CopyMost". In this case, the value is 1. Right now I had planned on writing an Extension Method for IEnumerable to do this for integer values. Is there something built into Linq that already does this easily? Or is it best for me to write an extension method that would look something like this records.CopyMost(x => x.Value); EDIT Looks like I am looking for the modal average. I've provided an updated answer that allows for a tiebreaker condition. It's meant to be used like this, and is generic. records.CopyMost(x => x.Value, x => x == 0); In this case x.Value would be an int, and if the the count of 0s was the same as the counts of 1s and 3s, it would tiebreak on 0.
