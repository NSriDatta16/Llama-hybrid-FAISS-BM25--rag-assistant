This is what I would do in SQL Server DELETE tm --select tm.* FROM teammembers tm JOIN teams t on tm.teamId = t.teamId WHERE t.eventId = 1 By embedding a select in the comment, I can run just this part manually and see what records I'm going to affect before I run the delete while I'm in development. select tm.* FROM teammembers tm JOIN teams t on tm.teamId = t.teamId WHERE t.eventId = 1 I never run a delete statment for the first time without checking to see that the records I think I'm going to delete are the records I intended to delete. This check will save you lots of worry as to whether your more complex deletes are affecting only the records you want to affect.
