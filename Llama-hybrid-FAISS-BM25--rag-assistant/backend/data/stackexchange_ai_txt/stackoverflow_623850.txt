I would try to think about the domain of the tags and figure out what is the likelihood that potential tags would contain spaces. For example, most things on this site are single word or acronyms, so it's not difficult to use spaces. On the other hand, when tagging facebook photos, for example, an average tag is something like "spring break", "frat party", "random hookup", "secretary of state" , etc. So dealing with space interpretation or with quotes is more difficult, hence commas make more sense. I'm not familiar with a specific rule. If you're thinking of tag clouds though, spaces make less sense.
