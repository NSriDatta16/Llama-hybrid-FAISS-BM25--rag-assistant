If your software development effort is just one facet of a larger project--for example, rolling out a new financial product--then sure, you will have to employ some kind of project management methodology to orchestrate all of the work involved. Fitting a Scrum-based software development effort into a project managed according to PMBOK principles can be challenging, however, since PMBOK prescribes a linear, phased approach to project execution whereas Scrum, like other Agile methodologies, promotes incremental improvement through iteration. That's not to say that the two can't coexist. Like everything else, it comes down to implementation. Just remember to be pragmatic and adapt the methodologies to your needs, not the other way around.
