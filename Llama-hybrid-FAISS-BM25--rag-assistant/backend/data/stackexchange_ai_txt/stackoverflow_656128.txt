NLP: Morphological manipulations

I am trying to build an NLP system for an assignment, for which I am allowed to use external libraries. I am using parse trees to break down sentences into their constituent parts down to nouns, verbs, etc. I am looking for a library or software that would let me identify which lexical form a word is in, and possibly translate it to some other form for me. Basically, I need something with functions like isPlural, singularize, getInfinitive, etc. I have considered the Ruby Linguistics package and a simple Porter Stemmer (for infinitives) but neither is very good. This does not seem like a very hard problem, just very tedious. Does anyone know of a good package/library/software that could do things like that?
