ASP.Net server-side navigation menu based on html contents

I need to do some styling to a bunch of webforms, containing articles formatted in a rather uniform way. I can change any source code I want. What I need is a quick way to dynamically create a navigation menu (on the server side) for an ASP.NET webform, based on contents of a specified div . For example, given the following HTML: Chapter 1 Some text... Chapter 2 Some other text I would like to insert something like this at the end (and render it at the server side, not in a script): Chapter 1 Chapter 2 NOTE: I know I could iterate through parent div's child controls in codebehind (although I would need to make them all "run at server", or even parse the InnerHtml property of the parent div), but if feels pretty weird. Also, I am aware that if the article was being created from a data source, I would have the content already organized, but I would like to make as little changes needed in the existing pages.
