I don't believe you can do that. You will have to set up skinning yourself. The default graphics used in the components are built into the flex framework and generated at runtime using the drawing api instead of embedding graphics. Your best bet is going to be to use css and a graphics framework that supports skinning like degrafa ( http://www.degrafa.org/ ). If you want to check out the code that generates the base skin for flex 3.x you can have a look in the svn repo here - http://opensource.adobe.com/svn/opensource/flex/sdk/trunk/frameworks/projects/halo/
