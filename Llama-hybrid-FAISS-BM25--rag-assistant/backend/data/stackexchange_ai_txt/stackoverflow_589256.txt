Send only, but cheap and easy The simplest way is definitely using the email hack that @ Paolo Bergantino mentioned above. It's easy to ask your users to type in their phone number and select their carrier from a list. It's also easy, on absolutely any development platform, to send email once you have the user's info. There are two very important limitations that I've discovered with that approach, however: The first is that the cellular carriers all prioritize SMS messages sent through their email gateways below other SMS traffic. Probably because they aren't getting paid by the sender for these. Don't use this method if minimizing latency is important to you. The second is that especially in this modern era of portable phone numbers, users will switch carriers from time to time, and will almost certainly forget to tell you. If you need to be able to reliably deliver SMS messages to the same people a year or two from now, this method will begin to fail. Send and receive for cheap If you're trying to set your site up to send and receive SMS messages on a budget, you can use a service such as TextMarks . TextMarks lets you pick a keyword for your service that allows users to route messages to you through TextMarks' shared short code, 41411. The catch here is that they reserve 20 characters in each message for short advertisements to pay for their services. Professional quality If you require low latency, high reliability, and no advertising, you'll pretty much have to go through an SMS aggregator unless you're big enough to negotiate with each carrier individually. The biggest thing I've found to watch out for with SMS aggregators is that many of them are really set up to be marketing companies, not application hosts--they don't really understand using SMS as a channel through which users can interact with service providers. I've found that the aggregators that use the phrase "your campaign" rather than "your application" are the worst offenders. Stay away from them, and find an aggregator that understands your needs as an application developer.
