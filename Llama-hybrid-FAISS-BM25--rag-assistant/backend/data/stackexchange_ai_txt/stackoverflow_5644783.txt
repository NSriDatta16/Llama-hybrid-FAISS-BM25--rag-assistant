WebSphere MQ is a very mature, stable platform which - as far as I know - fully complies with the JMS standard. Numerous organisations use JMS over MQ as their transport. I have worked in several that use both JMS and native MQ mechanisms to talk to the MQ layer, and I have not come across any complaints about the IBM JMS implementation. I have not worked with anyone that has changed JMS providers, though... IBM provides a bunch of Java libraries that only reference the javax.jms package, so as long as you haven't let any vendor-specific enhancements into your code, you should be able to slot in the MQ libraries to have MQ become your JMS provider. (You may need to do some administration with the MQ tooling to do things like set up JMS subscriptions, however... I haven't used the JMS aspects of MQ, only the core libraries.) Check out this IBM page for some more details on the MQ JMS libraries. If you only used WebSphere MQ as an example then yes, you may still need to check the candidate vendors' compliance with the spec, but JMS has been around a while and I think all of the big players' offerings would be a suitable JMS provider.
