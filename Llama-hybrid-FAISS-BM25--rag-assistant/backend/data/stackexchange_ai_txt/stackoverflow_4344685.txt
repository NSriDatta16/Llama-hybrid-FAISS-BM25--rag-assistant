As Mick N says there are some 3rd party databases available for the phone. Have a look at Perst (Commercial, but I believe free for non-commercial use) Sterling Windows Phone 7 Database However my advice would be to think carefully about whether you really need a full relational database in your app on the phone. If you are just using it to store and retrieve data, binary serialized files are extremely efficient and lightweight. Remember the phone is a very resource constrained environment. Whereas on the desktop we would immediately turn to a database for most data storage requirements because it makes our life easier. On the phone we need to be more careful and optimize for the environment - even if that makes our lives as programmers a little harder. A full database shouldn't necessarily be the first option when thinking about storing data. That said if you have a data requirement that you feel warrants a full relational database then you should absolutely use one of the aforementioned DBs.
