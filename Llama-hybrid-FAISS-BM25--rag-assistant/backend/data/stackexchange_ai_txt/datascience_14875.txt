Data set size versus data dimension, is there a rule of thumb?

I am trying to collect some data for ML , specifically for training a neural network model , and I don't know how big the data set is enough. So is there a rule of thumb on how many data of dimension DIM should one collect for training a NN-Model ? For example, it depends on the number of features or the kind of NN-Model or something else ? Any help will be appreciated.
