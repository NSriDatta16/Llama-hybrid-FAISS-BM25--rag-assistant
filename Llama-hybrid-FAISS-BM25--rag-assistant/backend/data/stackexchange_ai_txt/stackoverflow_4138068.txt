How do I catch taps but not scrolling in Javascript in Android?

I'm making an Javascript web app and I can't for the life of me get the touchstart event to fire. I get the touchmove and touchend events no problem. This is a problem because as I see it the best way to distinguish between a tap and a scrolling motion is to zero a counter on the touchstart event, update it at touchmove and then compare it at touchend . I'm doing this so I can do some action at the end of tap but not a scroll. For instance, it would be very confusing if a page opened for an item in a listed after you finished scrolling down that list, but it would be nice to be able to tap on an item to open its page. This is what I have: // FIXME: this doesn't seem to ever fire el.addEventListener('touchstart', function(e) { // make sure that at the start of every touch we're not considered to be moving alert("Touch starting"); app.__touchMoving = 0; }, false); el.addEventListener('touchmove', function(e) { app.__touchMoving++; }, false); el.addEventListener('touchend', function(e) { alert("Touch ended. We moved beforehand this many times: " + app.__touchMoving); // if we are moving if (app.__touchMoving > 0) { // stop, since we're dragging, not tapping return false; } // else we're no longer moving, so it was a tap } I never see the touchstart alert. If I scroll the touchend will fire and app__touchMoving will have some sort of decent value. On a side note, I've noticed that sometimes the touchend will seem to fire multiple times. Am I missing something basic here? Plenty of people say that this should work just fine on Android (and iPhone) yet the first listener never seems to fire. Update: I should mention that I've been testing on a Samsung Galaxy S running Android 2.1.
