Do you know how to use loops. My guess is yes, since you are on a programming site. I remember seeing most of the Excel VBA tutorials using Range(a:b) when I was doing some VBA work and this wasn't elegant to use with loops. You can instead access individuals cells using cells(x,y) which allows you to specify an x and y coordinate, so A1 becomes 1:1 and A10 is 10:1 etc. This should help you get started. From there you need to think logically and google what you don't know I.e. do a google search for "Excel VBA range duplicates" which will give you ideas for finding duplicates in a range. Most of what you are asking for requires simple logic or some googling. Try doing it yourself if you get stuck at specific points, then you can post those specific problems.
