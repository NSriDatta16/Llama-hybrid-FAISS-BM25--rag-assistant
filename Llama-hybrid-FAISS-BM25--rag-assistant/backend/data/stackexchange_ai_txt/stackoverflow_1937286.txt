Word game server in Python, design pros and cons?

I'd like to get busy with a winter programming project and am contemplating writing an online word game (with a server load of up to, say, 500 users simultaneously). I would prefer it to be platform independent. I intend to use Python, which I have some experience with. For user data storage, after previous experience with MySQL, a flat database design would be preferable but not essential. Okay, now the questions: Is it worth starting with Python 3, or is it still too poorly supported with ports of modules from previous versions? Are there any great advantages in using Python 3 for my particular project? Would I be better off looking at using other languages instead, such as Erlang? Is there any great advantage in using a relational database within a game server? Are there any open source game servers' source code out there that are worthy of study before starting?
