Check in admin back-end, System > Configuration > General/Design if your theme is right specified. Also check if after you installed the new theme, the files have the proper rights (normally, they must be accessible by the web server with Write permissions) For more info please also take a look at Magento Designers Guide for understanding of how Magento read and split template information. Maybe you have put the CSS and images in a wrong directory :)
