Strictly speaking, Dice and F1 score are equivalent. However, the Average Dice Coefficient, aka mean Dice (mDice) or in whatever other form you may encounter it, is not. In segmentation tasks, the F1 score is calculated by computing the confusion matrix over all samples, and then simply calculating: $$F1 = \frac{2TP}{2TP+FP+FN} = 2\frac{\text{recall} \times \text{precision}}{\text{recall}+\text{precision}}$$ However, the mDice is computed on each sample individually, and then averaged over all samples . In this case, the $TP$ , $FP$ , $FN$ refer only to each individual sample, and not to the whole dataset.
