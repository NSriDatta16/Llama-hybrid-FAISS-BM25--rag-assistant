Resolve a filename from another file

I can currently to the following: class SubClass extends SuperClass { function __construct() { parent::__construct(); } } class SuperClass { function __construct() { // this echoes "I'm SubClass and I'm extending SuperClass" echo 'I\'m '.get_class($this).' and I\'m extending '.__CLASS__; } } I would like to do something similar with the filenames ( __FILE__ , but dynamically evaluated); I would like to know what file the subclass resides in, from the superclass. Is it possible in any elegant way? I know you could do something with get_included_files() , but that's not very efficient, especially if I have numerous instances.
