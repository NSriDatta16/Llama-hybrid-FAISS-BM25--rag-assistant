What is the geometric margin? Geometric margin is the shortest distance between points in the positive examples and points in the negative examples. Now, the points that have the shortest distance as required above can have functional margin greater than equal to 1. However, let us consider the extreme case when they are closest to the hyperplane that is, the functional margin for the shortest points are exactly equal to 1. Let $x_+$ be the point on the positive example be a point such that $w^Tx_+ + w_0 = 1$ and $x_-$ be the point on the negative example be a point such that $w^Tx_- + w_0 = -1$ . Now, the distance between $x_+$ and $x_-$ will be the shortest when $x_+ - x_-$ is perpendicular to the hyperplane. Now, with all the above information we will try to find $\|x_+ - x_-\|_2$ which is the geometric margin. $$w^Tx_+ + w_0 = 1$$ $$w^Tx_- + w_0 = -1$$ $$w^T(x_+ - x_-) = 2$$ $$|w^T(x_+ - x_-)| = 2$$ $$\|w\|_2\|x_+ - x_-\|_2 = 2$$ $$\|x_+ - x_-\|_2 = \frac{2}{\|w\|_2}$$ Referred from: Given a set of points in two dimensional space, how can one design decision function for SVM?
