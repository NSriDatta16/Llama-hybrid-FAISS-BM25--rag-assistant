Vector2D class in android

Does android have a built-in class that represents 2D vector? I need to do some basic operations on 2D vectors, such as: Addition/Substraction Dot product Scalar multiplication Normalization I know I could write my own class, but it would be more elegant and faster if there was a built-in class.
