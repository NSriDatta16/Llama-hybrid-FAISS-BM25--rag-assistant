Bayesian Test in hypothesis testing with Bernoulli random variables

Let $X_1,\ldots , X_n$ be iid Bernoulli $(p)$ $(0 . Our sample is $x_1=\ldots x_n=1$ . Suppose that the prior distribution of $p$ is Uniform $(0,1)$ . Consider a Bayesian test for $H_0: p\geq 0.9$ vs $H_1: p . Find a necessary and sufficient condition on $n$ that $H_0$ is rejected. I figured out that the posterior distribution of $p|(x_1=\ldots=x_n=1)$ is Beta $(n+1,1)$ , and I know that $H_0$ will be rejected when $$P(p\geq 0.9|x_1=\ldots=x_n=1) but then I am not sure how to express $P(p\geq 0.9|x_1=\ldots=x_n=1)$ in terms of $n$ to get the desired condition. Could you please help me with this? I would really appreciate any help!
