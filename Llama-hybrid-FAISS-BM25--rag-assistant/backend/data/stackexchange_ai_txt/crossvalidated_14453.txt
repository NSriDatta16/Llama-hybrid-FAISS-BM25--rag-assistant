[ Note: The following reply pertains to older drafting of the question, "How to test for significant differences in proportions across four within subject conditions?" Later the question was cleared up in that the proportions are actually averaged across various variables.] You might use McNemar's test which is a repeated-measures comparison of proportions. Classic form of the test is for binary response and is therefore suits you. The test is pairwise comparison: only two conditions at a time. The 2x2 frequency table (Yes, No one condition vs Yes, No another condition) is formed and the Ho that the table is symmetric about the diagonal is tested. When variables are dichotomous (like yours) McNemar test is equivalent to Sign test so you could apply that either. Check also Cochran Q test as an extension of McNemar's test from pairwise to omnibus comparison
