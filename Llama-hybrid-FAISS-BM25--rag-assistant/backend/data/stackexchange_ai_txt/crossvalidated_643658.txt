As a start, $M_0,M_1$ specified in p. 229 are not any particular distributions but rather symbolize the different distributions under $H_0:\mu=0$ and $H_1:\mu\ne0$ . In the section relevant for equation 1, the discussion is whether the data comes from a centralized $t$ distribution (AKA Student's) or the noncentralized $t$ distribution. for the sake of this discussion, we formulate the hypotheses in a bit different manner: $H_0:\text{t is central},\quad H_1:\text{t is noncentral}$ . The noncentrality here can be described using the location-scale transformation . Consider a noncentral $t$ variable with location $\mu$ , scale $\sigma$ and df $\nu$ . It is quite common to simplify the location-scale two variables setting into a single variable, $\delta=\mu/\sigma$ . As Rouder et al. explain in p.231, they consider the case of unknown variance $\sigma^2$ : The intuition from the preceding discussion is that priors on parameters cannot be too variable, because they then include a number of unreasonable values that, when included in the average, lower the marginal likelihood. This intuition is critical for comparisons of models when a parameter enters into only one of the models, as is the case for parameter $\delta$ . It is much less critical when the parameter in question enters into both models, as is the case for parameter $\sigma^2$ . Gönen et al. 2005 simplify the noncentral case to be $T_\nu(t|\mu,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma}T_\nu\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\middle| \frac{\mu}{\sigma},1\right)$ . In addition, they give the Bayes Factor under assuming prior mean $\lambda=0$ (which is equivalent to assuming $\mu=0$ in our case): $$BF=\left(\frac{1+t^2/\nu}{1+t^2/\nu(1+n_\delta\sigma^2_\delta)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}\sqrt{1+n_\delta\sigma^2_\delta}$$ As they deal with the two-sample case and the factor $B_{01}$ in discussion refers to the one-sample case, we can write the above as $$BF=\left(\frac{1+t^2/\nu}{1+t^2/\nu(1+N\sigma^2)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}\sqrt{1+N\sigma^2}$$ This derivation is quite simple and is actually the ratio of centralized t pdf over location-scale transformed pdf. Next, as Zellner & Siow 1980 recommend, the prior for $\sigma^2$ is $Inv-\chi^2(1)$ , or equivalently $Inv-\Gamma(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ . Finally, we mimic Liang et al. 2008 who use a $g$ -prior (which is positive scalar) for the variance and use an $Inv-\Gamma(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ prior on $g$ . So all that's left is to plug everything into the proper places. For a specific value of $g$ , the BF would be $$BF(g)=\left(\frac{1+t^2/\nu}{1+t^2/\nu(1+Ng)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}\sqrt{1+Ng}=\frac{\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}}{(1+Ng)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu(1+Ng)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}}$$ For our needs, we can write the conditional distribution $$p(t|g)\propto (1+Ng)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu(1+Ng)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}$$ and so the joint distribution would be $p(t,g)\propto p(t|g)\pi(g)$ . Our prior choice was $Inv-\Gamma(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ and so $$\pi(g)=\frac{0.5^{0.5}}{\Gamma(0.5)}g^{-0.5-1}\exp\left(-\frac{0.5}{g}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{0.5}}{\sqrt{\pi}}g^{-1.5}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2g}\right)=(2\pi)^{-\frac{1}{2}}g^{-\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2g}}$$ The joint distribution is then $$p(t,g)=(1+Ng)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu(1+Ng)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}\cdot (2\pi)^{-\frac{1}{2}}g^{-\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2g}}$$ In order to reflect $H_1$ we have to integrate out $g$ (which is positive) and so $$\begin{aligned}M_1=p(t|H_1\text{ is true})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p(t,g)dg\\=\int_0^{\infty}\left[ (1+Ng)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu(1+Ng)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}\cdot (2\pi)^{-\frac{1}{2}}g^{-\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2g}}\right] dg\end{aligned}$$ So finally the Bayes factor is exactly as in Equation (1) of Rouder et al.: $$B_{01}=\frac{M_0}{M_1}=\frac{\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}}{\int_0^{\infty}{\left[ (1+Ng)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu(1+Ng)}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}\cdot (2\pi)^{-\frac{1}{2}}g^{-\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2g}}\right] dg}}.\blacksquare$$ Note: Considering the location-scale $t$ distribution with location $\mu$ , scale $\sigma^2$ and df $\nu$ , the pdf is $$ p(x\ \mid\ \nu,\ \mu,\ \sigma^2) = \frac{\ \Gamma( \frac{\nu + 1}{2})\ }{\ \Gamma\left(\frac{\ \nu\ }{ 2 }\right)\ \sqrt{\pi\ \nu\ \sigma^2}\ }\ \left(\ 1 + \frac{\ 1\ }{ \nu }\ \frac{\ (x - \mu)^2\ }{\ \sigma^2\ }\ \right)^{-(\nu+1)/2}\ $$ so although it is a bit tedious, you can definitely construct all the equations taken from Gönen et al. 2005 by hand and obviously take $M_0=p(x\ \mid\ \nu,\ 0,\ 1)$ to represent the centralized $t$ distribution.
