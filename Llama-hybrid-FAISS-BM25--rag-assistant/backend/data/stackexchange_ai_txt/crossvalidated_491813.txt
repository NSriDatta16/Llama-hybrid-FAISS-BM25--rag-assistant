I don't have enough reputation to comment. But let me give you my view. Ordinal data is related to information organized in a particular order without indicating a specific relationship between each item. Items may be greater than or less than other items. The order of items is often defined by assigning numbers to them to show their relative position. Nominal and ordinal data are qualitative data. But, let me provide you an example with rankings and ratings. A ranking establishes an order relationship for a set of items known as a weak order of elements (a sequence of ordinal numbers); the first is better than the second, the second is better than the fourth, and so on. A list of items ranked by its numerical score (real numbers), that list is called a rating. Therefore, every rating list generates a ranking list, but no vice-versa. So, from quantitative data (rating), you can obtain qualitative data, a ranking (ordinal data).
