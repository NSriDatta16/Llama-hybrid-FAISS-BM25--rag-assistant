Counterpart to regression equivariance in logistic regression?

Let $T(y_i,\pmb x_i)$ be a regression estimator (of the scalar $y_i$ unto the $p$-vector $\pmb x_i$). When $T$ is the usual LS estimator and $\nu\in\mathbb{R}^p$, we have that: $$T(y_i+\pmb x_i'\pmb\nu,\pmb x_i)=T(y_i,\pmb x_i)+\pmb\nu$$ This property is called regression equivariance and plays much the same role, in the linear regression context, as translation equivariance does in the context of multivariate estimators. I was wondering whether there is a similar property (equivariance to a form of translation) for logistic regression.
