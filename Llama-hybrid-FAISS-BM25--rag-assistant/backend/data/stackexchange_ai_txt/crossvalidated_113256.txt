Binomial data and PCA and cluster analysis

I have obtained responses on around 48 items measuring employer attractiveness. The goal of my analysis is to cluster respondents according to these employer attractiveness dimensions. I plan to reduce the dimensionality with PCA and also confirm the structure with CFA before getting to cluster analysis. 48 items were measured in forced 4-point Likert scale, but the data I obtained for analysis was transformed by another research to binomial level - important or not important (0 or 1 values). I was wondering what effect that can have on PCA and cluster analysis that these data are binomial. Can these analysis techniques be executed on binomial data?
