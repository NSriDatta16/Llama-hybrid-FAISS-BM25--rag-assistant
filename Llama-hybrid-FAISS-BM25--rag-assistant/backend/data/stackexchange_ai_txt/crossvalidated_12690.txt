You could specify your binding algorithm in a function, define utility function and optimize input parameters... The ideas for utility function can be: Predictive power (weight of evidence and information value) Monotonnicly decreasing average default rate from one bin to another (as you increase the age of history...) You can also constrain your optimization to look only for three to 5 bins for example...
