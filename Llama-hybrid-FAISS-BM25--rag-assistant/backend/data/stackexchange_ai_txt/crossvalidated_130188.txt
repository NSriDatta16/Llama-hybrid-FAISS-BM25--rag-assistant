Is testing for endogeneity necessary?

I was wondering if testing for endogeneity is necessary when doing an OLS multiple regression. Similarly, is testing for autocorrelation necessary if there is no time series data? Is testing for heteroscedasticity necessary, or is it something you can estimate by looking at graphs? Thanks if you have any pointers. I am clearly not very adept at econometrics, and just trying to finish a project. I already have very low confidence in my model, so does it matter if I do these other tests? I am using SAS and it's giving me a ton of problems already.
