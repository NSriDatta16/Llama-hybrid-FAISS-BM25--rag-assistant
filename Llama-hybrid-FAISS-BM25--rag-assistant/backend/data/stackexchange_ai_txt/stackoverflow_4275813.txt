I don't think your explanation is making sense. A timeout for a read call should only come in to play if no data is ever present to be read . In your case, if a packet is never received, then the timeout should control how long the call sits around waiting, before returning. If data is received, the timeout doesn't matter, since then the call must return as soon as it detects (and reads) the data, that's what's your asking it do do. From reading the code , it seems a negative timeout in pcap means "non-blocking mode", which will make it not wait at all , but instead return directly if no data is available.
