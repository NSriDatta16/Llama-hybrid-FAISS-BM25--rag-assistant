As a reviewer there would be several things here that would concern me. Assuming we were looking at the set of possible two-way interactions in your post-hocs (the next rational step in a decomposition from a three-way interaction), then a significant effect for one two-way interaction (but not for the others) would not necessitate a three way interaction per se. For example, one two-way interaction may have a statistically significant effect size greater than 0 and the others may have effects in the same direction, but not large enough to be greater than 0. Nevertheless, because all are going in the same direction, then there might not be sufficient evidence to suggest that they are sufficiently different from each other to reject the null hypothesis that they are the same (i.e., not a statistically significant three-way interaction). That being said, I don't see your post-hocs here as testing the differences between two-way interactions (i.e. differences in the differences). You seem to be testing a subset of possible main effects (differences manipulating only a single variable while holding the levels of other variables fixed). For example, none of your comparisons involve both the Experimental and Control groups. What does your result actually indicate? I think it indicates a statistically significant difference between those two particular conditions (Control, 1, 1 and Control, 2, 1). Regardless, you should know that your lack of a three-way interaction here is probably not a power issue. If it were simply a power issue, then the F ratio for your three way interaction would exceed 1. As it is, there is less variance in the three-way interaction that would be expected on average if the null hypothesis were true. Finally, assuming the comparisons you did perform were of interest, then I would expect to see the comparisons done as a priori ... a planned post-hoc makes no sense to me. That being said, I also know some reviewers are very post-hoc correction happy. The most important part here is that I would want to see those results interpreted appropriately (and not alluded to as a three way interaction). Edit : Oh, and I should acknowledge that I've seen plenty of people interpret significant results consistent with a desired interaction as being evidence in strong favor of the interaction. I've even seen this in top tier journals. That being said, I strongly recommend against it (then again, I have a particular problem with this misbehavior, c.f. https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/4572/196 ).
