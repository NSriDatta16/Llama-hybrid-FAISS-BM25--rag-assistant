I would like to study the impact of Col_A (a continual feature) on the output result. If you want to study the impact of a feature, in the sense to obtain an interpretable observation of the relationship between the variables, neural networks are probably not a good idea. I would go with (supervised) regression trees, as the model they produce is self-explanatory (and can be used for prediction too).
