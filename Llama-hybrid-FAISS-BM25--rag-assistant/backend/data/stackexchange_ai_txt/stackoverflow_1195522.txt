In Thunder Below , the story of the USS Barb in WWII, a new officer comes aboard. The Captain asks him his name. "Mike", he responds. "Nope, we already have a Mike", says the Captain. "We'll call you Robert. In combat, when I call out orders, there can be no confusion about who I'm talking to." What I'm getting at is that there's precedent for making your new Mike choose another name.
