my thoughts: -Only show advanced criteria when it is desired. Search is a great thing when it is made as simple as possible to the people trying to search. -If there is some very large set of search criteria for advanced searches: do not clutter the results with it. Make it very easy and obvious for a user to go back and modify the criteria, but don't try to waste space on the results by giving them their criteria again right off the bat. -Organization of criteria is hard to say without knowing it all. but as others have/will say: make it simple! You might not need to show it all at once: let me expand areas if i want more, hide stuff i don't want to use. and then put a search button at the bottom of it. But again, I won't want to scroll through a page of random criteria just to find this button.
