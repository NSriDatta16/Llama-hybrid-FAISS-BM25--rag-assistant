The transition rates are $\lambda^{-1}=100$ and $\mu^{-1}=7$ (recall that the rate is the reciprocal of the mean). Since this Markov chain only has two states, there is but one balance equation: $$ \lambda\pi_S = \mu\pi_I, $$ from which $\pi_I = \frac\lambda\mu \pi_S$ . Now, $\pi_S+\pi_I=1$ , and so $$ 1 = \pi_S\left(1 + \frac\lambda\mu\right)\implies \pi_s = \frac{1}{1+\frac\lambda\mu} = \frac{\mu}{\lambda+\mu}. $$ It follows readily that $\pi_I = 1 - \pi_S = \frac\lambda{\lambda+\mu}$ . The long-run mean fraction of time per year that an individual has a cold is simply $\pi_S$ . Substituting $\lambda = \frac1{100}$ and $\mu=\frac17$ , this is $$ \pi_S = \frac{\frac17}{\frac1{100}+\frac17} = \frac{100}{107}. $$
