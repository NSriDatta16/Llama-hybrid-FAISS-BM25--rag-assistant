High p-values for logistic regression variable that perfectly separates?

I'm using R to run some logistic regression. My variables were continuous, but I used cut to bucket the data. Some particular buckets for these variables always result in dependent variable being equal to 1. As expcted, the coefficient estimate for this bucket is very high, but the p-value is also high. There are about ~90 observations in either these buckets, and around 800 total observations, so I don't think it's a problem of sample size. Also, this variable should not be related to other variables, which would naturally reduce their p-values. Are there any other plausible explanations for the high p-value? Example: myData Results are something like this: Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.53831 -0.77944 -0.62487 0.00027 2.09771 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
