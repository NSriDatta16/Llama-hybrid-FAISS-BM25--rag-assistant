Has anybody integrated NCover with TFS?

Over the past year my group (some 50 engineers) moved onto Team Foundation Server and are now using it for source control, bug tracking and building. We have tens of thousands of lines of existing NUnit code that we continue to rely on and which we will never convert to MSTest. We have our builds set up such that NUnit posts results with each build and we get metrics on build quality from the TFS data warehouse including NUnit status. What I can't seem to figure out is code coverage metrics. TFS will warehouse coverage data from MSTest but I haven't found the API to post that data (from NCover for instance). Has anyone done this successfully?
