I have 4 suggestions: How are you choosing the variables to include in your model? Maybe you are missing some the key indicators from the larger dataset. Almost all of the indicators you are using (such as sex, smoker, etc.) should be treated as factors. Treating these variables as numeric is wrong, and is probably contributing to the error in your model. Why are you using an SVM? Did you try any simpler methods, such as linear discriminant analysis or even linear regression? Maybe a simple approach on a larger dataset will yield a better result. Try the caret package. It will help you cross-validate model accuracy, it is parallelized which will let you work faster, and it makes it easy to explore different types of models. Here is some example code for caret: library(caret) #Parallize library(doSMP) w This LDA model beats your SVM, and I didn't even fix your factors. I'm sure if you recode Sex, Smoker, etc. as factors, you will get better results.
