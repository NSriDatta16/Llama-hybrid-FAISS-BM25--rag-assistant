If the parameters are unreferenced, you can leave them unnamed: int main(int, char**) { } instead of int main(int argc, char** argv) { } If you really want just to suppress the warning, you can do so using the /wd4100 command line option to the compiler or using #pragma warning(disable: 4100) in your code. This is a level 4 warning; if you compile at a lower warning level, you won't get this warning. The warning level is set in the project properties (right-click project, select Properties; on the Configuration Properties -> C++ -> General, set "Warning Level").
