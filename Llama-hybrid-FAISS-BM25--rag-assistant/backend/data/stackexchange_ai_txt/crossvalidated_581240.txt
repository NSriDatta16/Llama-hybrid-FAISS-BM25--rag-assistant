How to deal with small degrees of freedom in an independent variable when testing for effects on continuous dependent variables?

I have a dataset of roughly 1000 measurements of body size in an invertebrate species collected from 15 different sites, with substantially variying sample size per site. Now I want to test how the concentration of three amino acids in the substrate collected at each site affects body size, so the concentration of each amino acid can only take 15 different values. Thinking of the types of analysis I want to do using these continuous data (regression and bayesian type): Does it matter that my independent variable is not as continuous as my dependent variable? i.e., one can take 1000 values, the other only 15 The distributions just look so different:
