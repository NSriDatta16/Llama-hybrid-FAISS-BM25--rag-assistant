Why should a valid diversity measure be independent of the target variable?

Consider an ensemble of weak learners (i.e. regressors or classifiers) whose predictions are aggregated (e.g. via averaging or majority vote) into an ensemble estimate. This gives rise to the question when exactly building an ensemble is better than simply using a single member. Quantifying this effect leads to the notion of "diversity" for which several approaches/definitions have been proposed. Now, It is arguable that [such a measure] can only be referred to as "diversity" when the measure is independent of the target variable y. [ source } Why is that? Diversity, as understood e.g. in [1] is a function of member estimates anyways, i.e. dependent on $X$ . Where's the harm in a formulation also dependent on $Y$ ? [1] Wood et al, 2023.
