An elegant solution would be to override __get() : public function __get($name) { return $this->mvc->$name; } __get() gets called whenever you to try access a non-existent property of your class. This way, you don't have to copy every property of mvc inside your class (which might override properties in your class). If necessary you can also check whether $name exists in mvc with property_exists .
