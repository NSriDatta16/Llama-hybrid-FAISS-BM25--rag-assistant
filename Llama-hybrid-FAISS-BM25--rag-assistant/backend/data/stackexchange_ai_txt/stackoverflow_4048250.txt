+1 to Ignacio because he answered correctly first. The relevant documentation, from https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396#section-4.1 When a URI reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from the URI by a crosshatch ("#") character, consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed. As such, it is not part of a URI , but is often used in conjunction with a URI. In the case of the link above, the browser uses the information after the crosshatch as a bookmark for a particular spot in the HTML.
