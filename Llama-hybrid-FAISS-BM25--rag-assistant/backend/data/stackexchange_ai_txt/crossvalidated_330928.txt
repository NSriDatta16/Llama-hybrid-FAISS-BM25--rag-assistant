Time series prediction shifted in time

I am using an AR(p) model and an ARIMA model to produce a time series of temperatures (with StatsModels for Python). I use a rolling forecast (I mean: I train the model on a training set, make a prediction, then the training set is increased with the new (exact) observation taken from the test set, the model is retrained on the updated training set, then I make a new prediction and so on). With an AR model and an ARIMA model I obtain predictions that are clearly shifted with respect to the observations. First with the AR model I obtain: then with the ARIMA model: where the blue color is for the observations and the red color for the predictions. Is it normal behavior ? Is there a way to correct the shift ?
