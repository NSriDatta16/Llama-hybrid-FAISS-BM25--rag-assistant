Silverlight 3 namespace missing in Silverlight 4

I am putting a silverlight 3 video to practice in silverlight 4 as my pc doesnt have SL 3. This however doesnt seem to work the same way for Silverlight4. 1.) I couldnt find the dataform control in the same namespace System.Windows.Controls as mentioned in the video, had to get it by drag-dropping from exp. blend 4. 2.) The dataform control that loads when I run the application doesnt have the save button or the edit link. 3.) Also, the bindable property set to oneway doesnt make the field read-only. Is this by design or do I need to reinstall something. My win7 pc does not have VS2008 IDE or Silverlight 3 tools/sdk/toolkit installed, only VS2010 with Silverlight 4 and Expression blend 4.
