How to organise source code in a modular manner

I'm currently working on a project that has scope to become quite large, however being relatively new to C++ and coming from a Java background I'm not sure about the best way to proceed. I would like to have a directory structure similar to: + Root - main.cpp + Engine + Core - foo.cpp - foo.h + Utilities - bar.cpp - bar.h + Sound + Input + Collision Detection + Particle System At the moment I have a load of .ccp/.h files sitting in the Engine directory. When I move them to their appropriate folders and try to tie them together I just get pages of compile errors relating to classes being undefined. Can some kind soul help point a novice in the right direction?!
