Got it figured out, thanks to the help of a collegaue. While logged in as Administrator, create a new private queue and give it a unique name. Go to this directory: C:\Windows\System32\msmq\storage\lqs Edit the files with NOTEPAD. Look for the line in the file that has the name of the queue queue you just created. Copy the entire SECURITY line from that file to the clipboard Edit the file that you want to delete (match on QUEUENAME), and replace its SECURITY line with the line you copied in an earlier step. Save the changed file. Administrator now has full rights to that queue. Delete the queue
