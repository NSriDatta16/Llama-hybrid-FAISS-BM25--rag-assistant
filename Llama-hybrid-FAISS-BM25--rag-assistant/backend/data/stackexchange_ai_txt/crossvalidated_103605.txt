By default, the estimated standard deviation of the residuals ($\sigma$) is returned as $\ln(\sigma)$ since that is how the Tobit log likelihood maximization is performed . If you use coef(estResult,logSigma = FALSE) , you will get $\sigma$ instead, which is analogous to the square root of the residual variance in OLS regression. That value can be compared to the standard deviation of affairs. If it is much smaller, you may have a reasonably good model. Or you can do the exponentiation yourself with a calculator and use delta method for the variance. You will also need $\sigma$ to construct some of the marginal effects. I don't think the hypothesis test about $\ln \sigma$ and the corresponding p-value have a clear interpretation, whereas the other coefficients can be interpreted as the marginal effects on the uncensored outcome, so the p-value on the null that the ME is zero makes sense for them. I believe R is just treating $\ln \sigma$ as another parameter. Here's my replication of your analysis in Stata (where I am also treating the categorical variables as continuous) confirming what I wrote above. First we load the affairs data: . ssc install bcuse checking bcuse consistency and verifying not already installed... all files already exist and are up to date. . bcuse affairs Contains data from http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/wooldridge/affairs.dta obs: 601 vars: 19 22 May 2002 11:49 size: 15,626 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- storage display value variable name type format label variable label ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- id int %9.0g identifier male byte %9.0g =1 if male age float %9.0g in years yrsmarr float %9.0g years married kids byte %9.0g =1 if have kids relig byte %9.0g 5 = very relig., 4 = somewhat, 3 = slightly, 2 = not at all, 1 = anti educ byte %9.0g years schooling occup byte %9.0g occupation, reverse Hollingshead scale ratemarr byte %9.0g 5 = vry hap marr, 4 = hap than avg, 3 = avg, 2 = smewht unhap, 1 = vry unhap naffairs byte %9.0g number of affairs within last year affair byte %9.0g =1 if had at least one affair vryhap byte %9.0g ratemarr == 5 hapavg byte %9.0g ratemarr == 4 avgmarr byte %9.0g ratemarr == 3 unhap byte %9.0g ratemarr == 2 vryrel byte %9.0g relig == 5 smerel byte %9.0g relig == 4 slghtrel byte %9.0g relig == 3 notrel byte %9.0g relig == 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorted by: id Here's the Stata equivalent of your censReg : . tobit naffair age yrsmarr relig occup ratemarr , ll(0) Tobit regression Number of obs = 601 LR chi2(5) = 78.32 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -705.57622 Pseudo R2 = 0.0526 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ naffairs | Coef.
