I Ended up using a 3rd party control (Elegant.ui.NavigationBar from prof-uis.com) for the final form. Screenie below. My 'New Document' form using Elegant.ui.NavigationBar http://www.ruleclarity.com/images/stories/screenshots/new_document_dialog.jpg The Headers and items are actually buttons (Elegant.Ui.ToggleButton) with the header buttons disabled so they don't react to the mouse. This looks ok I think. Note on this form I have also used a ListView with group headers (in the rightmost pane)
