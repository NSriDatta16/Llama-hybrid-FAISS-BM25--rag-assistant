Where are graphically pleasing examples of Lists

Anyone know of good code examples of how to make lists look different than your everyday average black list or more graphically pleasing than you usually see in android apps. I've looked through google code but haven't found too many. I'm looking for different and eye catching lists. I hope this question isn't too generic. Also i'm open to anything, code, examples, blog posts, etc, you name it. I've really struggled with lists and making them look more snazzy. I'm talking more the code level not the graphics or icons used.
