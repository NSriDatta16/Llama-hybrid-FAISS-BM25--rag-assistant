I presume by parameters you mean the features, which is quite unusual as @whuber commented. The next paragraph follows on this assumption. Not necessarily. Highly correlated features can cause multi-collinearity but this doesn't mean that a model with correlated features is worse than uncorrelated features. A model can have a set of correlated features that describe the target variable very well, or a set of uncorrelated features and that is not related to the target variable in any way. For parameter estimate uncorrelatedness, using a similar idea, assume you have uncorrelated random features that are also not related to the target variable. Since features are totally random, the parameter estimates will also be and show no correlation. So, still hard to say the model is better if you have no correlation.
