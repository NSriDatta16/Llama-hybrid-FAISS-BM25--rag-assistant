What is a stationary function?

Snoek et al, have a recent paper "Input Warping for Bayesian Optimization of Non-Stationary Functions" ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0929 ) which mentions "stationary functions". I understand what a stationary kernel or process is, but I can't find a definition of a stationary function . I kind of suspect there is no such thing, and they are using the term informally to mean something along the lines of "a function such that any epsilon-ball of the function has non-zero probability according to some stationary process". But the top example in figure 1 (sine wave) doesn't seem to fit this description to me, since the distance between the image of two points themselves a fixed distance apart changes dramatically as you move the points. I guess you can maybe define a process whose value is fixed at the peaks and troughs of the sine wave, and then this might be a stationary function under that process? Or am I totally wrong about the definition? Thanks!
