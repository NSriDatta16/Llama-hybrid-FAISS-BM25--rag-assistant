XSLT Similar functionality to SQL "WHERE LIKE"

I have the following XML FCVCMileage 3258 0 NUMBER And need to get the Value underneath the Mileage label. However the 4 letter prefix to Mileage could be any 1 of 8 different prefixes. I know I could find the value by testing for every combination using xsl:if or xsl:choose but is there a more elegant way that would work similar to the following SQL and also wouldn't need changes to code being made if other prefixes were added. WHERE label LIKE '%Mileage' NB. There will only ever be 1 label element containing the word Mileage Cheers!
