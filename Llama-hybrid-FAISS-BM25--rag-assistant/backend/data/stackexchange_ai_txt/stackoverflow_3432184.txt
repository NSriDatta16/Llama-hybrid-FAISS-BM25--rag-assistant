Elegant way to count frequency and correlation of many-to-many relationships with Django ORM?

I have a Pizza model and a Topping model, with a many-to-many relationship between the two. Can you recommend an elegant way to extract: the popularity (frequency) of each topping the correlation between toppings (i.e. which sets of toppings are most frequent) Thanks
