TeamCity SVN Checkout Failing Due to File Locks

This is my first TeamCity project, and I am having an issue with SVN checkout. Here are my settings for the SVN checkout from within TeamCity: VCS Checkout Mode - Automatically on Agent Checkout Directory - C:\BuildCheckouts[Project Name] VCS Labelling mode - Do Not Label Externals Support - Full Support Default Config Directory - Use Default Directory Working Copy Format - 1.5 On my first run of the build, everything runs fine, checkout occurs, and the build continues. On my second checkout, however, the build fails and I get the following error message: [03:31:28]: Updating sources: Agent side checkout... (1s) [03:31:30]: [Updating sources: Agent side checkout...] Failed to perform checkout on agent: org.tmatesoft.svn.core.SVNException: svn: Error during update from http://[Server Name]/svn/[Project Name] to C:\BuildCheckouts\[Project Name] svn: Cannot create new file 'C:\BuildCheckouts\[Project Name]\Tools\.svn\lock': Access is denied I have tried searching for this specific error, and came up with this old article (2003), but it does not seem to apply since I am using NTFS as my file system. Since my build script runs tests after compiling, I need the externals downloaded to the checkout directory along with the actual code. Are my configuration settings incorrect?
