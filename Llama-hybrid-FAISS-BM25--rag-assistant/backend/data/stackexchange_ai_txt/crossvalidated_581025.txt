What i understand is you are doing is Bootstrap classification In general, What is Bootstrap Classification? Suppose you are doing Logistic Regression, (meaning a binary classification problem.) You want 100 bootstraps. So for every bootstrap you train the model and predict the target/response. Then you can use method of majority vote to find the final response - 0 or 1. example - you get votes that 75 out of 100 bootstraps gives response = 1. Then you can use default threshold (which is 0.5 ratio) to classify (final prediction) it as 1 or choose different threshold to classify as 1 (maybe 0.8 ratio) Check this link to bagging classifier Default base_estimator is DecisionTree but you can give it Logistic Regression or other. bag_clf.fit(x_train, y_train) # this gives the average probabilities over bootstraps prob_x_test = bag_clf.predict_proba(x_test) # get the binary labels based on your threshold preds = np.where(prob_x_test>0.7,1,0)
