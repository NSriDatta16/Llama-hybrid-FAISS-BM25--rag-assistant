It may not be very nice to have the window become a size the user didn't want... what would happen if they maximize the window, and it's not a multiple of 10? Would you be able to keep the other window borders in the same place if they dragged the top edge of the window? I'd instead focus on the TreeView: Make a container that implements MeasureOverride, and have the implementation call the base.MeasureOverride, and when it gets that result, rounds the values down (always down) to a multiple of 10. The rest of your window contents will get a varying amount of space, depending on the size of the window, but just make sure you've got something in your layout that will stretch to take up the extra 0-9 pixels.
