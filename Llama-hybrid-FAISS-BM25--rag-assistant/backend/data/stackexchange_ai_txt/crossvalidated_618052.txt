What is the N on a product mean?

I want to sum the means of various measures within a treatment group, and found previous posts helpfully describing how to calculate the Standard error of estimated sum or product mean . My question is, can I estimate a number of observations (N) for these derived statistics? As an example, let's say I measured 5 amino acid concentrations, but the number of valid observations for each amino acid varies. Here are the summary stats: ala gly val leu pro mean conc 3.5 3.0 2.8 1.1 0.4 std dev 0.3 0.7 0.5 0.6 0.1 N 10 5 6 2 9 I want to estimate a mean total amino acid concentration, and its SE. The first part is easy; I can easily add the means to find the average total amino acid concentration. $$ 3.5 + 3.0 + 2.8 + 1.1 + 0.4 = 10.8 $$ Then I estimate the SE of the summed means as the square root of the sum of the N-adjusted squares of the standard deviations, expressed in general as: $$ \sqrt{\frac{stdev_a^2}{N_a}+\frac{stdev_b^2}{N_b}+\frac{stdev_c^2}{N_c}+...} $$ or here as: $$ \sqrt{\frac{0.3^2}{10}+\frac{0.7^2}{5}+\frac{0.5^2}{6}+\frac{0.6^2}{2}+\frac{0.1^2}{9}} = 0.574 $$ or sqrt(((0.3^2)/10)+((0.7^2)/5)+((0.5^2)/6)+((0.6^2)/2)+((0.1^2)/9)) if you want to paste it into your program of choice Now: can I estimate an effective N for this statistic? If there is a valid way to estimate such a thing, what is the approach? Surely it is not the sum of Ns, as that would be very high (32 observations). I have a random hunch that it could be the square root of the sum of Ns, which would be 5.65. This makes intuitive sense to me, and is also not too far from the mean (6.4) or median (6). However, my statistics training is woefully inadequate and I have no idea even how to search for the answer to this question. Any help is greatly appreciated. P.S. This is my first post, I would be glad for suggested edits to improve its clarity and usefulness. Thanks!!
