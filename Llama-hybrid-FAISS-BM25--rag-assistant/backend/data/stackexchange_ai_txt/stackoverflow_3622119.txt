Felixs' answer probably works, but it sounds like you are thinking of it from view-manipulation angle, and not a model-manipulation angle. It sounds like you really have two parallel models: the list of animals and the set of images. Why not just reloadData when either thing changes and rebuild the cells appropriately from inside your controller? Reaching into existing cells based on their index feels fragile to me.
