Your model is failing to generalize to new data. One possible reason is the new data is not like the training data. There could be many reasons: Different speakers Different audio recording process Different audio preprocessing Different file format conversions Different audio post processing The deep learning model over-learned the specific training dataset. One approach is systematically go through every step and make sure the the new data is as close as possible to the training data. If that is not help, then increase regularization in the model.
