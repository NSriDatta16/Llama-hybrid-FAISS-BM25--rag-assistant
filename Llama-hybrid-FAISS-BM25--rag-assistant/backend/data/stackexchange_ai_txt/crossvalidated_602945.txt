How to run a PCA or Factor Analysis when you know one column of the factor loadings

I have this application where I have a direction that I want to keep fixed when I'm running a PCA or factor analysis. Is this possible? I just want to keep a column of the loadings matrix fixed. How can I do that? If this is not possible. Can I do any other type of analysis with this direction?
