Nice question.. when I want to do something like that (like loggin actions) I just use AJAX. And I know it's not probably what you wanted but hear me out.. I have had this problem as well 4 times so far and I've used AJAX and because of that I was able to put a preloader (which is really cool and helpful :)) By "use ajax" I mean if you have 4 actions to show up do 4 ajax requests. I know it's not the most elegant solution (as you do a lot of extra stuff) but it is a good design-wise solution.
