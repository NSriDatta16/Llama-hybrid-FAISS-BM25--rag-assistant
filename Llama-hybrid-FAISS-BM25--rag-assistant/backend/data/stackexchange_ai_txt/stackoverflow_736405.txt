You had 4 problems: You weren't including the strict and warnings pragmas It is better to include exporter through the base pragma (since it sets @ISA for you) Only package variables (i.e. our variables) can be exported Modules must end with a true value Here is the corrected module. package Example::Constants; use strict; use warnings; use base 'Exporter'; use Readonly; Readonly our $EMPTY_STRING => q{}; our @EXPORT = qw( $EMPTY_STRING ); 1; Hmm, I missed the bit about attempting to assign to a readonly, it sounds like the module is getting loaded more than once. I believe mod_perl has a mechanism for loading modules separate from the scripts themselves. This loading happens only once, so you should be using it.
