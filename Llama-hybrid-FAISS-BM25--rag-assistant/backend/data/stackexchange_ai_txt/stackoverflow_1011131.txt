From looking at the tools you've tried I guess that you want to test the UI rather than the inner details of the code. I haven't done development for Notes 8, but if it is anything like R7 I definately think you should look for a non-Notes tool for testing Notes application UIs. The Notes UI classes is filled with strange gotchas, and I think you will run into problems expressing things like switching tabs, moving around in the document, triggering hotspots, verifying visibility of messages and dialogs, agent runs et.c. My initial idea was to implement tests in AutoIt , but I assume the tools you have tried are more friendly for testing and equally competent at recognizing and interacting with window elements. If you find something that works out, I'd love to hear about it!
