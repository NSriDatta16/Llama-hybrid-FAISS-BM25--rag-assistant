How to conduct a power analysis for a linear regression with clustered standard errors?

I would like to conduct a posthoc power analysis for a linear regression model to see the power of my analysis given the effect size I am finding. However, due to the clustering of standard errors, I do have many variables (mostly dummies) in my model. Is there a way around it? Do I have to include cluster dummies in my power analysis? I am using the R code below to define my models. The model consists of a continuous criterion (market returns), and IV (sentiment in press statements), two financial indicators as moderators and a set of controls. It is all part of an event study on firm market returns upon acquisition announcement. reg_2_formula I am using the sandwich package to calculate robust standard errors and cluster them by firm ID (here: a six-digit CUSIP code). Since I have many firms in my data, I end up with a total variable count of 277 on a sample of roughly 1500 observations. Again my questions. Do I have to include cluster variables (dummies) in my power analysis? Is there a more elegant way of handling these dummies in my power analysis?
