The picture below will probably answer your question. A logistic regression model with 2 features creates a wave based on the logit link function. Applying the decision rule (for example above 50%) transforms the wave to a separating hyperplane like that, but not similar to, one found in SVM. This is illustrated in the picture below. Note that this separating hyperplane is in feature space. These pictures come from http://blog.data-miners.com/2014/03/lines-and-circles-and-logistic.html You can find an expose on om the subject.
