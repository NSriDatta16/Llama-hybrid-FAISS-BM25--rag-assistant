Obviously, for complex search/match/replace operations, regexes are the way to go. For simple stuff like replacing a single word by another word, normal string methods are preferred. But in many cases, it's not that simple. Sometimes you come across a situation where you could use standard string operations, while the regex solution is more elegant. Even if the vanilla string algorithm is 10 times faster, it's always a good idea to ask yourself if it matters in that particular piece of code (for example if the code isn't executed in a loop). I would prefer the readability of a simple regex operation over a more complex, but faster algorithm using pure string operations. Just my 2 cents...
