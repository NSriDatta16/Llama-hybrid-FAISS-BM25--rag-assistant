Every SQL Server installation (including Express editions) comes with little tool called bcp.exe (Bulk Copy utility). It supports two formats, native and character. You are probably interested in the character format, see Using Character Format to Import or Export Data . Adding a comma , field terminator will produce a CSV file: bcp database.dbo.table out datafile.csv -c -t, -T If you want a fixed length output, then probably the best solution is to specify a format file. See Specifying Data Formats for Compatibility by Using bcp . Once you have the file, you can copy it to your SFTP server. The equivalent of cron on Windows platforms is the Scheduler, see The Task Scheduler . There are more fancier solutions, like using SSIS as Eugene suggested, which would give you more power and control. SSIS comes with SQL Server (but not with Express Edition) and on non-Express Editions you have the SQL Server Agent to help you schedule tasks.
