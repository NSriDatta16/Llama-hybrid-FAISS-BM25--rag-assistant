Uninstall Easy_Install

So I installed Python 2.7.1 from source on a server using stow . I have been careless in the past, and I am trying to keep organized when dealing with source installs. So, enter stow. Now I installed easy_install with wget and running the ez_setup.py script. Lo and behold, in my infinite wisdom/carelessness, I forgot to stow it properly. How do I uninstall ez_setup and start from scratch? I have seen a couple of people ask on SO and other places on the web, but there is no clear answer. Do I just uninstall the .egg, the .pth file, and be done with it? Does this matter? I had adjusted my PATH variable anyway, plus I do not even have su access on this box. I installed into my own Python install, already configured with stow.
