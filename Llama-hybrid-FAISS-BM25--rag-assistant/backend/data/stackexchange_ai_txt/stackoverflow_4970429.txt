This event does expose the payment object, so you should be able to chain off of that to get the object you want: public function yourObserverFunction($event) { $payment = $event['payment']; $customer = $payment->getOrder()->getCustomer(); // ... do something useful } Generally objects in Magento can be chained like this, and now your code doesn't rely on the event being triggered from a customer session (which is not a good assumption anyway). Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
