Using R to organize/rearrange CSV - group by multiple columns?

I have a CSV that I need to clean up / organize in a usable way using R. I need to group by the property ID and then want to take all the unique years for the defor year column and make each year into a sperate column with the amount of deforestation for that year. My data frame / CSV looks like this: Prop_ID deforYear deforHA 1 2010 15 1 2011 0 1 2012 10 2 2010 35 2 2011 45 2 2012 0 and I want the output to look like this: Prop_ID defor_2010 defor_2011 defor_2012 1 15 0 10 2 35 45 0 I'm assuming I use the group_by function in dplyr but I can't seem to figure it out.
