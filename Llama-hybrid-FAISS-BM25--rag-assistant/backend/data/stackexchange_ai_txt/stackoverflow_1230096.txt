It really depends on the quality of your Matlab code and what it is you are doing. Idiomatic Matlab code written by a Matlab expert is going to be hard to beat, particularly if you're not an optimization guru and purely expecting a speed up due to the switch of language. For instance, I found even some of the more well regarded C-based FFT libraries were no match for Matlab's FFT. That said, comparing a poorly written Matlab program to an averagely written c++ one, I'd say you're looking at an order of magnitude in my experience.
