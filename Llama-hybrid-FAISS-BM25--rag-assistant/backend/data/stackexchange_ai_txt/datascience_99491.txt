In Bias-Variance tradeoff theorem, aleatoric uncertainty is represented by the irreducible error (inherently and irreducibly random). The rest represents model mismatch due to imprecise knowledge of the generation of the problem. One way to quantify aleatoric uncertainty is as average uncertainty over various models for the same problem, as then uncertainty due to model mismatch will tend to average out leaving only the irreducible uncertainty.
