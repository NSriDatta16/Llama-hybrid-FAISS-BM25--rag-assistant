The lines give the values beyond which the autocorrelations are (statistically) significantly different from zero. Your ACF seems to indicate seasonality. I recommend Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Hyndman & Athanasopoulos , which is freely available online. (You can also buy a paper version.) This section , in particular, gives details on the blue lines: For white noise series, we expect each autocorrelation to be close to zero. Of course, they will not be exactly equal to zero as there is some random variation. For a white noise series, we expect 95% of the spikes in the ACF to lie within ±2/√T where T is the length of the time series. It is common to plot these bounds on a graph of the ACF (the blue dashed lines above). If one or more large spikes are outside these bounds, or if substantially more than 5% of spikes are outside these bounds, then the series is probably not white noise.
