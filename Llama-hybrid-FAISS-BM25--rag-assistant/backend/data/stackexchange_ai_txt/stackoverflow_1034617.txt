One of the ways to implement this is to build Artificial Neural Network and use associated algorithms to train it. The essence of the method is to build a 2D matrix of 1's and 0's (input matrix). Each element is the input node for the neural network. When we draw a character we set elements we draw over to 1, then you feed the input to your ANN and get actual character as an output. Once you've built a sufficient number of input variations and run the training algorithm over the input sets, you should be able to achieve a much better accuracy then by applying the "linear strokes" method you outlined above. I think you should be able to find appropriate libraries, which can help you build your ANN and choose appropriate training algorithm. I don't remember any from the top of my head. But you can google around to see what comes up. Cheers!
