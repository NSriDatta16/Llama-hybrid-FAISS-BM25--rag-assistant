Making a Java Web Application build in one step

Step two of " The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code " states "Can you make a build in one step?". My answer to this is currently no. My application is structured as follows: + +-MyApp // this is just a vanilla Java Application +-MyWebApp // this Dynamic Java Web Application (deployed Tomcat and launches // a thread contained in MyApp) +-MyCommonStuff // these are common classes shared between MyApp and MyWebApp // Ex. Database access code & business classes In order to build and deploy my software I perform the following steps: 1. Checkout MyApp, MyWebApp, MyCommonStuff from svn 2. build MyCommonStuff.jar and copy to a "libs" directory 3. build MyApp and copy to a "libs" directory 4. build MyWebApp.war (Ant build.xml file specifies where MyApp.jar and MyCommonStuff.jar are located) 5. The deploy portion of build.xml used Tomcat deployment tasks to deploy to a tomcat server. My question is does the Joel rule above apply to this scenario. i.e. should there be a "master" build script which executes steps 1. to 5.? Should the script just be a normal #/bin/sh script or are there tools I can leverage. My preference would be stick to using Ant and linux console commands. Thanks
