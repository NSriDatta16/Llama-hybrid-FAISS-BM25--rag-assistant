Emacs fill-paragraph not breaking lines where expected

I have the following HTML code (a list item). The content isn't important--the problem is the end of line 2. Yes, you can learn how to play piano without becoming a great notation reader, however, you will have to acquire a very basic amount of notation reading skill . But the extremely difficult task of honing your note reading skills that classical students are required to endure for years and years is totally non-existant as a requirement for playing non-classical piano. The command fill-paragraph (M-q) has been applied. I can't for the life of me figure out why a line break is being placed on the second line after "reader," since there's more space available on that line to put "however,". Another weird thing I've noticed is that when I delete and then reapply the tab characters on lines 4 and 5 (starting with "have" and "of" respectively), two space characters are automatically inserted as well, like so: Yes, you can learn how to play piano without becoming a great notation reader, however, you will have to acquire a very basic amount of notation reading skill . But the extremely difficult task of honing your note reading skills that classical students are required to endure for years and years is totally non-existant as a requirement for playing non-classical piano. I don't know if this is some kind of clue or not. This doesn't happen with any of the other lines. Is this just a bug, or does any experienced Emacs person know what might be going on here? Thank you
