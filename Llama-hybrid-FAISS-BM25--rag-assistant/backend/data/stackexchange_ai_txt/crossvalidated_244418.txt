Projecting model training time using R

I'd like to use R's random forest package on a rather large dataset. I'm anticipating to this to take a while (perhaps more time than I want to deal with). Is there a way to display the estimated training time in R? If it helps, I'm using RStudio if there might be any extra bells and whistles that might help there.
