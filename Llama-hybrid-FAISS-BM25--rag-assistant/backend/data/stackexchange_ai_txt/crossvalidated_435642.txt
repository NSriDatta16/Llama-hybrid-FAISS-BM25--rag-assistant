Why the Y in logistic regression must be truly binary, not be contrived from an underlying ordinal or continuous response variable?

I wonder what would happen when the assumption as mentioned in Frank Harrell's answer for "When is logistic regression suitable?" is violated? The primary assumption of logistic regression is that Y is truly binary, e.g. it was not contrived from an underlying ordinal or continuous response variable. It, like classification methods, is for truly all-or-nothing phenomena. for instance, what would happen if I turn the dependent variable of blood pressure (continuous) into binary (hypertension or not)?
