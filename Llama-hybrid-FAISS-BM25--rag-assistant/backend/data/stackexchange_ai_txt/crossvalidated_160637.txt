ADF: Reject or keep null hypothesis (difference p-value & test statistic)

I'm working at my thesis and wanted to test my time series for Stationarity by using the Augmented Dickey Fuller Test with the program R. When I received the output, the p-value was close to zero, so that I had to reject the null-hypothesis of non-stationarity. But with a look at the test statistic, which was higher than the critical value of tau, I couldn't reject it. Now I am very confused, which result gives me the correct one (or if I made a mistake). I would assume that the p-value is the crucial one, because it is not least derived from the test statistic. That is the extract of my output: Residual standard error: 1.607 on 1585 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.06058, Adjusted R-squared: 0.05347 F-statistic: 8.518 on 12 and 1585 DF, p-value: 7.398e-16 Value of test-statistic is: 0.0957 Critical values for test statistics: 1pct 5pct 10pct tau1 -2.58 -1.95 -1.62 I would be really glad, if someone could explain this difference to me. Thanks in advance!
