$8.3.2/3 - It is unspecified whether or not a reference requires storage. sizeof applied to references is basically the size of the referrand. So if 'r' is a integer reference to 'i', it is unspecified if there is an actual storage for 'r'. However sizeof(r) internally stands for sizeof(i) . If 'r' is a reference to a 'char', the sizeof(r) will be always sizeof(char) == 1 by definition.
