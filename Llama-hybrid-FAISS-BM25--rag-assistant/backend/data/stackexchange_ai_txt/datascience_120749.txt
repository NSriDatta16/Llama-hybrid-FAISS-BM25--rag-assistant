I am using Detectron2 library to run Faster/Mask R-CNN. One can set a maximum for the number of detected objects by setting the parameter NMS_THRESH_TEST . However, there is no way to put a lower bound for the number of detected objects. One can only fine tune this parameter SCORE_THRESH_TEST to get more objects detected though.
