Instance of Linq class without connecting it to database

Is there a way to create an instance of a linq class without it being included in the next Submit? like this: Customer customer = new Customer(); Context.SubmitChanges(); // customer is not added. I get an error back saying that some values can not be null because constraints in the database, even if i dont have Context.Contacts.InsertOnSubmit(contact); between the lines. I thought that as long as i did not call the InsertOnSubmit I could use the Customer class generated by the dbml as a storage or anything else... Any ideas on what I might be doing wrong, or am I trying to break the rules here?
