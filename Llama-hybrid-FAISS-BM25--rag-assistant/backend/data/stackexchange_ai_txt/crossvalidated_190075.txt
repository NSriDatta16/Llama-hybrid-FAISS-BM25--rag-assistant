Does multicollinearity affect performance of a classifier?

I know that wikipedia references are sometimes frowned upon here, but this one has me puzzled: Wikipedia - Multicollinearity I know what multicollinearity is, and today I tried figuring out how/if it would affect performance of machine learning models. At the beginning of the article, it says Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole ...but, as I read on it says that A principal danger of such data redundancy is that of overfitting in regression analysis models and I know that overfitting increases variance greatly, and can degrade performance severely. Are either of these or both of these statements wrong?
