Just for future documentation: Netbeans 6.8 is available with a very nice Grails/Groovy Plugin that works like a charme. Additionally you can use a new Code Coverage Plugin. Really nice build. Link: Netbeans Homepage But you have to keep in mind that Grails now belongs to Spring Source. Spring Source is known for developing their own Tool Suite based on Eclipse. Maybe we will see a better grails plugin implementation for Eclipse.
