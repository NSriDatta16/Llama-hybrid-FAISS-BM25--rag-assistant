It's very possible in either Drupal or Joomla. I personally like Drupal more than Joomla, and would encourage you to look in that direction. There is an actual tool called JoomlaLMS, which would probably give you a better out of the box solution, but you will have to shell out quite a bit of cash. If you're willing to spend quite a bit of time building your own system in Drupal, you could have a very good free solution. You could also end up with a huge mess if you don't know your way around Drupal.
