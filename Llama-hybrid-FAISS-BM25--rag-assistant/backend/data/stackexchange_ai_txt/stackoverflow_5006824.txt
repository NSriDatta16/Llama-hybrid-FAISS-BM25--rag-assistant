Figured it out. The following code block will add a method get_exif to a Carrierwave uploader def get_exif( name ) manipulate! do |img| return img["EXIF:" + name] end end Just pass the EXIF name such as "DateTimeOriginal" to it, and it will return the data. One thing to keep in mind however is that if you are using Mongoid with GridFS, or anything else that doesn't provide current_path, manipulate! depends upon it. For Mongoid you can either make a temp file and give it that path, or switch to file storage instead of GridFS.
