The aim of reinforcement learning (RL) is to make an agent learn the policy: when it is in a particle state, it must know what action to choose. At the same time, an alternative statement would be to say that in RL, the aim of the agent is to maximize cumulative rewards. These are two parts of one statement: an RL agent learns the policy that maximizes (discounted) cumulative reward. A Q value table is a representation of a policy that lends itself to TD learning.
