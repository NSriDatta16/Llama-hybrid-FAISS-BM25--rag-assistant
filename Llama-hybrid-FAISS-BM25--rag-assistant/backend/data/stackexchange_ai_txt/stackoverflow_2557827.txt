eMail messages don't come in XML format. They are either MIME or RichText. So when you want them as XML you need something to convert it for you first. The ?ReadViewEntries XML would give you already some essential data (from, time, subject) and you could use https://your.server.domain/mail_db/mailbox.nsf/($Inbox)/0A1DA5EEB7B65277C12576F50055D811/Body?OpenField to get the HTML representation of the Mail body. Other than that I would deploy a small agent to the Domino server that renders the messages in the format you need. For mime messages you probably want the original MIME format and for RichText the MIME conversion of it.
