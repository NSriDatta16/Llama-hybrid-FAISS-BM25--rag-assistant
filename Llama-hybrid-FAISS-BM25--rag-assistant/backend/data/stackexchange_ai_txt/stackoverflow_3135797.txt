In Eclipse, How to sort methods by class during auto-complete?

In Eclipse, you can press period after an object to see its methods and the methods it inherited from its super-classes. Is there a way, (keyboard shortcut during auto-complete or otherwise) that allows you to organize the methods by class, (this, super, super's super)? This would help find methods specific to this subclass much faster.
