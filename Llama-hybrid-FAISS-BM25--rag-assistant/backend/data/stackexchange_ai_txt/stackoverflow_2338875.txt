Boost::function error ambiguous overload for ‘operator[]’

The full error I'm getting is this: error: ambiguous overload for ‘operator[]’ in ‘a[boost::_bi::storage4 >::a4_ [with A1 = boost::_bi::value , A2 = boost::arg , A3 = boost::arg , int I = 3]]’ It references line 116 of a class I have, which is the boost::bind call in this function: // Dispatch a message onto all connected clients void MsgProxy::dispatch_msg(t_ic_msg_shptr message) { deque ::const_iterator iter = clientList_.begin(); for(; iter != clientList_.end(); ++iter) { message->async_send(*iter, boost::bind(&MsgProxy::handle_dispatch, this, _1, _2, _3)); } } For reference, the handle dispatch function looks like this: // Called to handle result of saync_send command in dispatch_msg void MsgProxy::handle_dispatch(t_ic_msg_shptr messsage, t_socket_shptr socket_ptr, const boost::system::error_code &error) { if (error) { RDEBUG("Error forwarding message onto clients -- %s", error.message().c_str()); } } And finally the async_send function that's being called: void async_send (t_socket_shptr, t_icsend_callback); Where t_icsend_callback is: typedef boost::function t_icsend_callback; Basically I've got a function (async_send) that takes a socket to send out a message on, as well as a callback (defined using boost::function) to report status to asynchronously. I'm trying to bind a member to that boost::function argument, but boost doesn't seem to like what I'm doing here. I've been up and down the boost::function and boost:bind documentation and it seems to me this should work... I even have a call that's almost identical a little further up that's not throwing an error... color me stumped.
