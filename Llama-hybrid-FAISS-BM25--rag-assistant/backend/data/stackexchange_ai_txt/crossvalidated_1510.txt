I can q-q plot them, but I'm more interested in an automatic unit test I can run. If a visual inspection of a q-q plot would suffice, then you could calculate an entropy measure such as the Gini coefficient and accept the test after allowing for some tolerance for deviation from the 45 degree line. For more on comparing distributions in general, you could look to the reldist package in R for ideas. Though not directly applicable, I think you'll also find the method presented by Cook, Gelman & Rubin interesting: Validation of Software for Bayesian Models Using Posterior Quantiles
