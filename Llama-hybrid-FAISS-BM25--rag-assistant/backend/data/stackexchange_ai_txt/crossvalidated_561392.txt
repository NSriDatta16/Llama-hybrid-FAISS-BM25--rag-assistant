Can a subset of the indexing set of a RV, given rise to a non-stationary time series, be considered weakly stationary or vice versa?

Given a non-stationary time series $X_t$ , is it possible that a subset $[t_1, t_2]$ of the indexing set is considered weakly stationary? And also, given a weakly stationary time-series, can a subset of its indexing set be considered non-stationary? Thanks :) EDIT: As pointed out by @Chris Haug, @Richard Hardy I was originally thinking about subsets of the support of the RV that generated the series, rather than about subsets of the indexing set. However, as the answer by @Dilip Sarwate made clear, that type of definition would not be directly related to weakly stationary processes anymore, but would need to refer to a different sort of classification. Since I haven't seen any duplicate questions, I leave the question up as an answer to the indexing-set question though. Thanks everyone!
