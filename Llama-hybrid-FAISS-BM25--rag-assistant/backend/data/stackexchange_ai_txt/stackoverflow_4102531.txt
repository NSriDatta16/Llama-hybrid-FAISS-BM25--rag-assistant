Escaping square character in XML

I've created an XML file that contains the "²" character. When viewing the document in Internet Explorer, I get an "Invalid Character" error. Does ² need to be escaped somehow? or is this just an issue with IE8. The actual bit of XML is shown below: ATTENTION INVESTORS &amp; DEVELOPERS 920m² freehold site on 2 titles consisting of vacant land and adjoining buildings. Located within the CBD this is one of the last sites available with frontages on both Marine Parade and Hastings Street, Napier. Zoned inner city commercial. Contact agents for details.
