At a guess, I would say that Internet Explorer tries to recover from what is quite clearly an error. The following would also work: display: inline !pudding; The specification says that if an invalid value is specified or an error occurs in a rule it should be ignored. It looks like most browsers stick to this but IE recovers for this specific situation. In some cases, user agents must ignore part of an illegal style sheet. This specification defines ignore to mean that the user agent parses the illegal part (in order to find its beginning and end), but otherwise acts as if it had not been there. http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#parsing-errors
