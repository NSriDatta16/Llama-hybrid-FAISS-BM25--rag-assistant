Check out the AS3Crypto package at http://code.google.com/p/as3crypto/ . I haven't tried it, but this package claims to (partially) support the TLS 1.0 protocol. TLS will provide a secure tunnel between your Flash application and the server. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer @jcnnghm You normally don't want to use public key encryption (RSA, DSA) for the bulk data encryption due to its' large computational time. Public key encryption should be used in the handshaking and key agreement phases in a security protocol, but the bulk data encryption should be handled by a symmetric cipher such as AES and TDES. The TLS and SSL protocols work this way.
