Dynamic array in C# (vb.net snippet)

Private Function getFoo(ByVal _FileInfo As FileInfo) As foo() Dim provider As New ExcelStorage(GetType(foo)) provider.StartRow = 2 provider.StartColumn = 1 provider.FileName = _FileInfo.FullName Dim res() As foo = provider.ExtractRecords() Return res End Function I have the above code in vb.net that i'm trying to convert to C#. I'm using FileHelper library to extract data from Excel. This is my conversion to C#. public static foo GetFoo(FileInfo fInfo) { var provider = new ExcelStorage(typeof(foo)); provider.StartRow = 2; provider.StartColumn = 1; provider.FileName = fInfo.FullName; foo res[] = provider.ExtractRecords(); return res; } What am I doing wrong here. I'm getting Bad array declator. Do I have to declare the size the array first? Thanks edit: I change the code as suggested. However, I'm getting this error. "Cannot implicitly convert type 'object[]' to 'foo[]'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)" I though I already set the type to foo in the ExcelStorage as typeof(foo). Nevermind, I did it with casting.
