RBM - What are visible and hidden biases?

Can someone explain to me what is a visible bias and what is a hidden bias in case of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine ? I know what is meant by biases but what is hidden and visible bias ? Does visible and hidden biases only deal with RBMs or are they applicable for all neural networks ?
