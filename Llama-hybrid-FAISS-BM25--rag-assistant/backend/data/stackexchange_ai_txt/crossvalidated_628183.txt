A Bayesian can still use long running frequencies where they are sensibly defined, if the probability of a coin flip returning a head is really $0.5$ , a Bayesian will tend to support this hypothesis as the number of coin flips grows. Let the probability of a coin flip returning a head be $p$ . The frequentist will obtain a point estimate $p$ , having observed a sequence of coin flips. This might be done by maximum likelihood, using a Binomial model for the result of the coin flip. If their $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval does not contain $0.5$ , the frequentist will reject that the coin is fair. How the Bayesian decides on whether or not a coin is fair, is different to a frequentist. The Bayesian will start with a prior distribution for the probability of a heads, observe coin flips and then obtain their posterior distribution for the probability of heads (likely a Beta prior and Binomial likelihood). If the posterior has high posterior density at $p = 0.5$ , then the Bayesian will believe that that the coin is likely to be fair. If $p=0.5$ has low posterior density, then the Bayesian will believe that the coin is likely to be unfair. A Mathematical theorem which formalises (and generalises) this result, is the Benstein-von Mises theorem . This loosely says, under a suitable prior and for large samples sizes, Bayesian and frequentist results agree numerically (but not in intepretation!).
