I think that your problem doesn't apply to profiles at all. It's about how transitive dependencies work for war packaging. By design they doesn't work :) War archive contain its dependencies in WEB-INF/lib folder or if it is packaged in ear it can share libraries with ear libs. More of the problem you can read on this wiki article . It's about Skinny Wars but topic relates also your problem. For you interesting is also this JIRA issue . Quick but not elegant solution is to change packaging form war to pom (or create duplicate pom with pom packaging).
