Here is one possible approach. Suppose the counts are $(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4)$ and let $j$ denote the index where the count is largest. You can think of this as a hypothesis testing problem of $$ H_0 : \max(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) \neq p_j $$ against $$ H_1 : \max(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) = p_j $$ where $p_i$ is the probability of individual $i$ walking the dog. An idea then would be to determine the maximum likelihood of the sample under the two hypotheses and reject $H_0$ when the data are much more likely under $H_1$. In either case the likelihood is $$ L = p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} p_3^{n_3} p_4^{n_4} $$ which is maximized under $H_1$ when each probability equals the sample proportion for that category. Under $H_0$ it's not quite as obvious since we want to maximize the likelihood under the somewhat unusual constraint that the largest estimated probability not be the category with the largest count, but my guess is that we can do this by averaging the sample proportions of the most common and second most common categories. Even though $H_0$ would not strictly be true in this circumstance, we can view the resulting likelihood as a supremum over $H_0$. Having obtained these two likelihoods we can then calculate a ratio and reject $H_0$ when this ratio is unduly favorable to $H_1$. As far as computing a $p$-value goes it's possible that minus two times the likelihood ratio would be approximately $\chi^2$ but I'm not sure about the degrees of freedom. An alternative might be to devise a Monte Carlo simulation to come up with an approximate $p$-value.
