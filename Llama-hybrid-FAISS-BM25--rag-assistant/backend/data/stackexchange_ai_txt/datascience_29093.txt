Continuous variable to categorical by quartiles?

Let's stay I have a field with a continuous variable, like a count of people waiting in line. I want to take those values and create a categorical value based on quartiles. Let's say my range of values is 1 to 80 and the quartiles tell me that a "very short" line is less than 5 people, a "short" line in 6 to 30, a "long" line is 31 to 50 and a "very long" line is >=51 I can think of different ways to write this in python/pandas/numpy but something tell me that one of you can come up with a method/snippet that is short and elegant. Note that I want the method to also generate the quartile values, something that I haven't really done in Python before.
