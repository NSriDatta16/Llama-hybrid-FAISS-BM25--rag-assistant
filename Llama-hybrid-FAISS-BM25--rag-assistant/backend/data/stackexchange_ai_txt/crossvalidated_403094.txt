The reason why fuzzy logic ideas have dropped out of fashion (in ML) are unclear to me. It may well be a bit of many reasons, be they technical, sociological, etc... One thing for sure is that the mathematics of ML for the past years have been dominated by probability/statistics and optimisation, two fields in which fuzzy logic (or ideas issued from the fuzzy literature) can fill in, but in which they usually bring more answers than questions. One another advantage of probabilities and optimisation is that while there may different trends/interpretation within them (e.g., Bayesian vs frequentists), the basic formal/mathematical framework is rather stable for those (it is less clear, in my opinion, for fuzzy logic understood in a broad sense). I think a nice piece of work to figure out the (recent) relation between fuzzy logic and machine learning is the following one: Hüllermeier, E. (2015). Does machine learning need fuzzy logic?. Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 281, 292-299. I think one of the basic idea of fuzzy logic, that is to model concepts that are gradual and provide reasoning tools (mainly extending logic, but not only) associated with it, is still present in some ML ideas, including very recent ones. You just have to look carefully for it as it is rather rare. Two examples include: Farnadi, G., Bach, S. H., Moens, M. F., Getoor, L., & De Cock, M. (2017). Soft quantification in statistical relational learning. Machine Learning, 106(12), 1971-1991. (where references include fuzzy logic ones, including Zadeh seminal paper) Cheng, W., Rademaker, M., De Baets, B., & Hüllermeier, E. (2010, September). Predicting partial orders: ranking with abstention. In Joint European conference on machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases (pp. 215-230). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. Overall, to answer your question on a more personal ground, my feeling is that there is not a clear perception of what fuzzy logic could accomplish (in recent views of ML) that probabilities could not, and since the latter is much older and clearly fits better with the ML framework of seeing data issued from a probabilistic population, it was more natural to go with probability and statistics than with fuzzy logic. This also means that if you want to use fuzzy logic in ML, you have to present a convincing, good reason to do so (e.g., using the fact that they extend logic by providing differentiable functions so that you can include logical rules in deep learning techniques).
