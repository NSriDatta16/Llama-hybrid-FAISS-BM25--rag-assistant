Though I am sure that @cardinal will also put together an excellent program, let me mention a couple of books that might cover some of the things the OP is asking for. I recently came across Probability for Statistics and Machine Learning by Anirban DasGupta, which appears to me to cover many of the probabilistic topics asked for. It is fairly mathematical in its style, though it does not seem to be "hard core" measure theoretic. The best "hard core" books are, in my opinion, Real Analysis and Probability by Dudley and Foundations of Modern Probability by Kallenberg. These two very mathematical books should be accessible given the OPs background in functional analysis and operator algebra $-$ they may even be enjoyable. Neither of them has much to say about applications though. On the more applied side I will definitely mention Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie et al., which provides a treatment of many modern topics and applications from statistics and machine learning. Another book that I will recommend is In All Likelihood by Pawitan. It deals with more standard statistical material and applications and is fairly mathematical too.
