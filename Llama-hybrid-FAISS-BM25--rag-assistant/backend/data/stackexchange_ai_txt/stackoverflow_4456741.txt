where/how to store an image private to my app? (Android)

I've got a image selector/cropper with code taken from this site They create the image in the phone's external storage but I want to store this in my app's internal storage, a process documented here This is what my function to retrieve the temp file looks like, however when I try to use the file returned from this function, the image does not change. In fact, looking at logcat, it seems resolveUri failed on bad bitmap uri on that file I generated. The error occurs when I try to set the Image URI, leading me to believe it was not saved properly. This is odd to me considering the original code from the site just creates a file in the SD card, and the code works fine for reading/writing to that. So I wonder where the problem arises. @Override public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) { switch (requestCode) { case PHOTO_PICKED: if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) { if (data != null) { Bundle extras = data.getExtras(); if (extras != null) { ImageView callerImage = (ImageView)findViewById(R.id.contact_image); callerImage.setImageURI(Uri.fromFile(getTempFile())); } } } break; } } private File getTempFile() { try { FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(TEMP_PHOTO_FILE, Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE); fos.close(); File f = getFileStreamPath(TEMP_PHOTO_FILE); return f; } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // To be logged later return null; } catch (IOException e) { // To be logged later return null; } }
