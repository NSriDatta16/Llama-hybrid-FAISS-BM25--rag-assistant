Autoencoders normally aren't linear models. If you make them linear (i.e. you create a shallow Autoencoder with linear activations) then you get exactly a PCA result. The power of Neural Networks is their non-linearity, if you want to stick with linearity go for PCA imho. Keep a Train-Validation-Test set split, and try different configurations of hyperparams checking their performance on Validation data. Alternatively there are many libraries, such as hyperopt , that let you implement more sophisticated Bayesian hyperparameter searches, but unless you want to be published at a conference or win some competition it's a bit overkill. If you're still interested, the internet is plenty of tutorials like this one .
