Composite variable from Likert items

I have six 5-point Likert items (1-Strongly Disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-Neither agree or disagree, 4-Agree, 5-Strongly Agree) which are related to my dependent variable. I sum the six variables which gives the frequency as follows: Frequency 6.00 1 9.00 1 12.00 6 13.00 3 14.00 3 15.00 18 16.00 11 17.00 4 18.00 17 19.00 11 20.00 14 21.00 22 22.00 15 23.00 9 24.00 11 25.00 2 26.00 3 30.00 2 Total 153 Now I want to recode the sum variable again into a 5-point scale (1-5) to get a composite score of my dependent variable. I will use this composite dependent variable in further analysis of ordinal logistic regression. My question is this: What is the best way to recode the sum again into 5-point scale? Or, please let me know if there exists any better way to create a composite scale from Likert items? just to clarify my quesion: I have six variables that are related to my DV, all are on 5 point likert scale. and I could not find the best way to reduce these six variables into one. The composite score may be considered as one of the option.
