All your Threads are logging things. They all need to write on the disk from time to time. Everytime one of your 240 threads hits a logging line there will be disk access issues. It baffles me that the Thread having the lock is in the RUNNABLE state. I think it might be waiting for some external ressource to be released (like disk access for example) Are you running low on disk space? Have you recently changed something in your storage system?
