If your question is really "how does it look": See Figure 4 on this page ; it shows high resolution measurements of a hard drive. Although googletorp's answer does not look very helpful, it's not totally untrue. To store binary data, the only thing you need is the possibility to have two different states for each storage unit (be it an on/off switch, hole or no hole in a punchcard, or, as in the case of hard drives, the direction of ferromagnetic particles).
