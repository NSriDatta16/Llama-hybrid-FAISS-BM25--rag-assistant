Vb.Net Document Storage

I am attempting to add a document storage module to our AR software. I will be prompting the user to attach a doc/image to thier account. I will then put a copy of this file into our folder so that we can reference it without having to rely on them keeping the file in its original place. This system is not using a database but instead its using multiple flat files. I am looking for guidance on how to handle these files once they have attached them to our system. How should I store these attached files? I was thinking I could copy the file over to a sub directory then renaming it to a auto-generated number so that we do not have duplicates. The bad thing about this, is the contents of the folder can get rather large. Anyone have a better way? Should I create directories and store them...?
