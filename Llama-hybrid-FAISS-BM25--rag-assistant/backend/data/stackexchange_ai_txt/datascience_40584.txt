Meaning of stratify parameter

I'm training a Neural Network and I'm trying to divide my data into training and testing sets. I have a lot of output classes and for some of them I have as little as 2 examples, so I would like to have, in that case, 1 example in training and 1 example in testing. From what I've read, this is using the stratify parameter, but what does stratify mean? I'm divifing my data into training and testing: x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.1, random_state=42, stratify=y) So, from my understanding, this divides into two sets: training (90% of data) and testing (10% of data) but making sure that there are at least 1 of each class in each set?
