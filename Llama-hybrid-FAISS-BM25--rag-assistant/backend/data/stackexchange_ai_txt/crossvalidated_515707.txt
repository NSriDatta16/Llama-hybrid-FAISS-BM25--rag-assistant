The inherent issue with your model is that your variables are not fully differentiated. Therefore, they all have unit roots, are not stationary, and lead to overall mispecified models with residuals that probably breach all the assumptions of typical models including residuals not being stationary, being heteroskedastic, autocorrelated, not normally distributed, etc. The solution is to transform your variables. First, instead of Log, take the first difference in such logs from one period to another. This should solve most of the mentioned problems. If you want to further stabilize the data, you could make additional variable transformations such as: Standardize the data, so each variable is on a comparable scale or # of standard deviations away from the average of that same variable; Normalize the data, so each observed value ranges between 0 (minimum value) and 1 (maximum value) or use another normalization where - 1 (minimum value); Remove the seasonality effect from the data. Remove the heteroskedasticity from the data if the standard deviation (or technically the variance) changes a lot over time. For an excellent short video that shows how to do a lot of those transformations in Python, check the URL below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Js8h709Dw Here is an equivalent video for variable transformation using R. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWDYqnh376o It is very likely that once you improve the structure of your variables and explore the optimal variable transformation, all your problems related to model biases will go away.
