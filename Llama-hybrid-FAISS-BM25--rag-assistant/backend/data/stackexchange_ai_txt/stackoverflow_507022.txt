Specific JRE name (which might not be the same on other computers) stored in meta-data for Eclipse Ganymede WTP project

Problem overview: When using Eclipse Ganymede with the Web Tools Platform the project gets dependent on the exact JRE name I use. The name might be different on other developers machines, how is this problem best solved so that many developers may work together on the project? Detailed problem description: I'm using Eclipse Ganymede and Web Tools Platform (as it's part of Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers) and I have created a Dynamic Web Project . I have a single JRE installed, the Sun JRE for Java SE 6. In Eclipse I can choose: Window / Preferences / Java / Installed JREs . And I can see a list of JRE's, each row has Name , Location and Type columns. I only have one entry in the list, it has: Name =java-6-sun-1.6.0.07 Location =/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.07 *Type=*Standard VM. The problem is that the name of my JRE is specified in two Eclipse project meta-data files, they are .classpath and .settings/org.eclipse.jst.common.project.facet.core.prefs . I want to check my project into version control for other developers to check out and work on, but I don't think that I can be sure that they have a JRE with the same exact name as I do. Contents of the offending files: .classpath : (The second to last classpathentry is the offending tag.) .settings/org.eclipse.jst.common.project.facet.core.prefs : #Mon Feb 02 13:29:53 CET 2009 classpath.helper/org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER\:\:org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.StandardVMType\:\:java-6-sun-1.6.0.07/owners=jst.java\:6.0 eclipse.preferences.version=1 What's the best way to check in this project and let other developers check it out and run/change it?
