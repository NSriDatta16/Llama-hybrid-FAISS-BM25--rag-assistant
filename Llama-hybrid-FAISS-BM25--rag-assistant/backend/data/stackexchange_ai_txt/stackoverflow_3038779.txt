MacBook for django development?

I'm about to buy a new laptop (Asus G62) to replace my old ubuntu desktop. I will use it mostly for django development (and some legacy win32 stuff in a virtualbox). However, since I will need to do some iPhone development in the near future, I'm starting to think that it might be a wiser to buy a MacBook Pro, instead of the Asus and later a cheap (so to speak...) MacBook. How well suited is a MacBook Pro for Django development? I currently use WingIDE on Linux and love it, how does the Mac version compare to the linux one? Is the Ubuntu -> Mac OS transition complicated? Will I be able to leverage my Linux knowledge? OTOH, I'm your average nerd, so I'm not sure if I'm cool enough for a Mac. Besides, having a double chin, a black turtle neck is completely out of question. Thanks in advance!
