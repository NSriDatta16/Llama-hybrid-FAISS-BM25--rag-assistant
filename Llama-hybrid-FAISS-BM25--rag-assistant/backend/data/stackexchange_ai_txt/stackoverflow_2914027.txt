Multi-process builds in Visual Studio 2010: Worth it?

I've started testing our C++ software with VS2010 and the build times are really bad (30-45 minutes, about double the VS2005 times). I've been reading about the /MP switch for multi-process compilation. Unfortunately, it is incompatible with some features that we use quite a bit like #import, incremental compilation, and precompiled headers. Have you had a similar project where you tried the /MP switch after turning off things like precompiled headers? Did you get faster builds? My machine is running 64-bit Windows 7 on a 4 core machine with 4 GB of RAM and a fast SSD storage. Virus scanner disabled and a pretty minimal software environment. Edit: Martin and jdehaan pointed out that MP is not incompatible with precompiled headers. Details are here .
