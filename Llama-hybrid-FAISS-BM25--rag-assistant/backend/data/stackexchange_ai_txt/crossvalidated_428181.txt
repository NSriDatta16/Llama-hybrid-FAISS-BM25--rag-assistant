I was wondering the same thing and I tend to think that this should depend on the intended use. If the reason of standardization is to use the standardized version for further work concerning new samples (such as standardization before a machine learning process), I can understand that the values at hand would be considered as a sample and the standard deviation would be calculated as that of a sample. However, if you are going to use the sample values at hand for a comparison within themselves without further application of new samples, as in the link you shared: In this context, as elsewhere, the standard deviation is used to make scores comparable, and no statistical inference to a population is implied. then I would consider the samples at hand as the population being compared and tend to use a population standard deviation. This might not be a good example but let us assume that we took a sample of 10 observations out of a population. If, for some reason, I only need to produce a standardized distance comparison among those 10 observations (without any statistical inference to another new sample other than that 10), then those 10 observations become my population for the comparison within temselves.
