1: You're using a dependency property to "tell" the framework when that property is changed. This will have the following consequences for your binding: MyCustomObjects.Add(new MyCustomObject()); //Wont update the view through databinding MyCustomObjects = new List (); //Will update the view through databinding You could gain the same databinding functionality by implementing INotifyPropertyChanged on which ever class exposes the property, but dependency properties a capable of much more than just notifying about changes. These are rather advanced features though, which you aren't likely to come across in your average joe app :) 2: You're using an observable collection, which implements INotifyCollectionChanged for you, to tell the databinding whenever the content of the collection has changed. This will have the opposite consequences than #1: MyCustomObjects.Add(new MyCustomObject()); //Will update the view through databinding MyCustomObjects = new ObservableCollection (); //Won't update the view through databinding
