By decreasing the size of the convolutional kernel, you're changing the number of parameters in the model (as well as what scales it looks at the data in). The optimization process for models like DCGAN is somewhat unstable, not super well-understood, and needs a very careful balance between the generator and discriminator; especially if you change one and not the other, it could throw all kinds of things off in the ability to actually optimize the model.
