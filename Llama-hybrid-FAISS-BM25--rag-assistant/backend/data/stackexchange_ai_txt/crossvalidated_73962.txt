Is "model selection" the same as traning?

A terminology problem. In machine learning we have the following problem: Choosing the optimal model (or training): $$ f^* = \arg\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \sum_i l(x_i,y_i) $$ Is the term "model selection" always "exactly" referring to this? Or something else?
