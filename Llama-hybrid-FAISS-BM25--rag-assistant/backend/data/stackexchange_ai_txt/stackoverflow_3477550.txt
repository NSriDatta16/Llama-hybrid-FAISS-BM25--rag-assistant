Where in jBoss when using SSL and JAAS are the Cache-Control and Pragma HTTP headers set?

Implemented JAAS and SSL on jBoss 4.2.2 and found the issue with being unable to download .pdf's. after some poking around I found references to the Pragma: No-cache and Cache-Control: no-cache headers, and why that prevents IE from downloading .pdf's and related items. Fine, I stuffed Cache-control, private and Pragma, "" in the header and situation handled. But I'm looking for where in the expanse of jBoss source I would discover the offending code and the conditions that the original headers are created. Yes, I have searched, just not well.. Thanks Jim
