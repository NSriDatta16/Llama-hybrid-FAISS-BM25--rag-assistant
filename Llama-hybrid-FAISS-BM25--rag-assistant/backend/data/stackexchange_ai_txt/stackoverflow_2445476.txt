Ruby on Rails, PHP or C++ for web social network

I have chosen diploma work in university. It's a mini social network. But now I am really stuck with which technology I should stick. I am average at C++ ISAPI web services development, below average PHP(had few projects with it) and new to Ruby and its framework RAILS. I have a deadline 1.5 month to develop it(about 5 hours every day after my full time job). Also I heard that its very easy to learn and develop with Ruby on Rails. Considering C++ I know that I have to do lots of coding and work by myself and PHP looks almost the same to me. So I am looking for you skilled developers advise what would you do in my position? Learn RoR, stick with C++ or PHP or maybe use something else?
