If getResource() throws an exception then resource will be null, getResource() does not return anything in the case of an exception. So, as long as getResource() can throw an exception, always check for null before calling resource.close() . I feel the best way to organize this code is to put everything inside the try block; make it clear clear that getResource() throws exceptions.
