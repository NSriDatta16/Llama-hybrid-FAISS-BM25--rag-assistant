Time Series Forecast: Model Evaluation in R: Model with lowest MAE also has the lowest R Sqrd?

I'm trying to compare time series forecast models. Among my 4 ts models, Facebook Prophet is showing the lowest MAE metric at 38.3 units (website visits). However, when I check R Sqrd for the same model, it has only 0.151 or 15.1% of the variance explained while other models such as ARIMA or ETS have a > 70% R Sqrd metric. If MAE is the lowest, should R2 be the highest for Prophet model? Can anyone pls help with this? Thanks.
