I wouldn't use Python in this case, even if there is Boost.Python to help embedd it. Even Python people say it makes more sense to embedd C in Python than the other way around, simply because Python is not designed to be embedded. I like to use languages that are specifically made to be embedded in C++ or C, like Lua , Falcon or ChaiScript . However I also like to have a full language available. If I want to write an application under heavy constraints (like games on consoles) I prefer to use Lua that is designed for this. Otherwise, I prefer to use Falcon or ChaiScript . Falcon is a good alternative to Python in this case (embedding a high level language in C++) : http://falconpl.org It's designed to work with C++ and even the standard libraries are implemented in C++. I also like to use ChaiScript when I want to just include the headers and go with a scripring language : http://chaiscript.org It's designed to be header only and easily integrated in C++ code. In fact it's made to work with C++ only. Both are high-level language. Falcon looks more like Python and Ruby but have the advantage to propose far more programming paradigms than those two. Chaiscript looks like a simplified C++ so it might not be the best choice for people not used to such syntax but otherwise it's easily bound to your real C++ code. Falcon too, but not in the same way and the syntaxe is easier on non-programmers.
