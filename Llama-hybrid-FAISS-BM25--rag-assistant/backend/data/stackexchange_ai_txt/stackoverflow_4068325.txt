It depends on what you are trying to do. If you want to take 100% of your CPU time, don't insert any Sleep() s. In other case, insert some value that you find appropriate - for example, do 10ms of work and then Sleep() for 10ms. That way you won't kill your CPU and OS will have some leverage to determine how to schedule jobs around. AFAIK, 10ms is the smallest schedule interval on Windows. In addition, you have option of Sleep(0) just to inform the kernel (in this case managed thread manager) that you want others to take turn in processing.
