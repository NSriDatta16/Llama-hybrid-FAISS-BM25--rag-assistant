to explain WHY 32 bit mode can only access 4GB of RAM: Maximum accessible memory space = 2 n bytes where n is the word length of the architecture. So in a 32 bit architecture, maximum accessible memory space is 2 32 = 4294967296 = 4GB of RAM. 64 bit architecture would be able to access 2 64 = LOTS of memory. Just noticed Tchens comments going over this. Anyways, without a CS background, yes computer organization and architecture books are going to be difficult to understand at best.
