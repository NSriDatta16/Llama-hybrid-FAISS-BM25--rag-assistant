Searching two tables

I currently have following two tables: CREATE TABLE files_list ( 'listid' INT, 'name' VARCHAR(25), 'synonym' VARCHAR(25), 'description' VARCHAR(25) ); CREATE TABLE files_tags ( 'tag_name' VARCHAR(25), 'listid' INT ); If someone uses the keyword "dragon ball", at the moment, I use following query to search my_list for possible matches: SELECT * FROM files_list WHERE name LIKE '%dragon%' OR synonym LIKE '%dragon%' OR description LIKE '%dragon%' OR name LIKE '%ball%' OR synonym LIKE '%ball%' OR description LIKE '%ball%' I am not sure how to search both tables using one query. I want to show the user following data in the search result: name, synonym, description and all tags. My Questions 1. Is there any way to make the current mysql query shorter? 2. How can I combine it with files_tags table, - to show rows from files_list which has a match in files_tags , but not in files_list ? - to show rows from files_list which has a match in files_list, but may not in files_tags`? You can see the current displayed result at http://hsbsitez.com/
