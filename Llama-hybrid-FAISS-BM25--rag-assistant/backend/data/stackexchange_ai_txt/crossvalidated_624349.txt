You're using a lot of related terms in this question (odds, log odds, odds ratio) that would all require slightly different answers, I'll try and answer the ones I can think of a decent answer for. Since you didn't specify a link function in the glm statement, you're using the standard logit link, or equivalently the expit response function. This means that the probability of experiencing domestic violence is modeled with this function (using 2 predictors for simplicity). $$\pi(x) = \frac{1}{e^{-( \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2)}} $$ Say $x_1$ is age, then all you have to do is plug in your estimated betas and plot this as a function of $x_1$ to get a partial plot of age vs. probability of domestic violence. For example with the curve() command in R you can directly plot functions. Or with geom_function() in ggplot2. You may notice that there is another unkown, namely $x_2$ . You will have to choose at which level to keep the other predictors constant. Typically the mean is a good choice. As long as your model doesn't contain interactions with $x_1$ it won't change the effect. Then to plot the log-odds, we can take the logit of both sides of the equation to get (because the logit is the inverse of the expit) $$\ln\left(\frac{\pi(x)}{1 - \pi(x)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2$$ Now the left-hand side is the log odds, so you can just plot the expression on the right in terms of $x_1$ to get a partial plot of the log odds vs. age, again setting the other variables at their mean. As is customary in logistic regression, the log odds are actually a linear function. Lastly, for the odds we can take the exponential of both sides to get $$\frac{\pi(x)}{1 - \pi(x)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2} $$ Now the left side are the odds, so you can plot the right-hand side as a function of $x_1$ to get a partial plot of the odds vs. age. The odds ratio and log odds ratio are actually constant, they are $\beta_1$ and $e^{\beta_1}$ respectively, they're just obtained by dividing the odds/log odds at x+1 by those evaluated at x. In terms of confidence intervals I think you can just calculate it on the logit of $\pi(x)$ since there it is essentially like a linear model, and then backtransform the lower and upper bound with an expit to get a confidence interval on $\pi(x)$ itself.
