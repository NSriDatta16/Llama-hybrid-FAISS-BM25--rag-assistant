I'd recommend taking a relevant course at Coursera . There you can explore a myriad of topics with a good dose of flexibility. Just do a search there for relevant terms: machine learning, statistics, data science, data mining, etc. You have an instructor and peers you can interact with, you get assigned homework (that will likely be graded) and of course, you get relevant reading material and recommendations. These are well prepared courses that are available for free so take advantage of them.
