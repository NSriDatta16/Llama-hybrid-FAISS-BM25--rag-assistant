What can be deduced from the following hypothesis test given the $p$ value?

You want to find out whether a new medicine for flu is effective or not. You know that the general assumption is that an average flu last for about one week. So, letting $t$ be the average disease duration, you formulate your null hypothesis as $H_0: t \geq 7$ vs. $H_1: t . Your test result returned a $p$ value of $0.05$ . Which of the following statements are correct? After treatment with the new drug there is a 95% chance that a flu will last less than 7 days. In 95% of the cases, the flu will last less than 7 days. The duration of the flu can be reduced by a factor of 0.05%. Even if the new medicine was completely ineffective, the chances that the experiment would have produced the same result are 0.05%. We have proven that the null-hypothesis H0 is wrong and your medicine is effective. Since the $p$ value is small we will reject the null hypothesis which is on an avg flu lasts more than or equal to 7 days. By that answer 1 is CORRECT and answer 5 as well. What about the rest? How do I decide that? P.S this is the first time I touching stats. Please help!
