SVG coordinates with transform matrix

I want to implement the functionality like svg-edit on rectangle element Rotate rectangle Resizing Drag Rotating the SVG rectangle it works fine, but when I want to resize the rectangle it has a problem. The coordinates are not working right; I use the transform matrix to rotate targetelement.setAttribute(transform,rotate(45,cx,cy)) but when the element has been rotated the coordinates are moved. I'm also using inverse function to inverse the transform matrix it resolves the problem but its not working with drag function.
