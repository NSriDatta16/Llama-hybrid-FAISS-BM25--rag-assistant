Answering my own question just as a place to put some details: It turns out (as correctly suggested above) that the index creation is the slow step, and every time I do another transaction of inserts, the index is updated which takes some time. My solution is to: (A) create the data table (B) insert all my historical data (several years worth) (C) create the indexes Now all lookups etc are really fast and sqlite does a great job. Subsequent daily updates now take a few seconds to insert only 800 records, but that is no problem since it only runs every 10 minutes or so. Thanks to Robert Harvey and maxwellb for the help/suggestions/answers above.
