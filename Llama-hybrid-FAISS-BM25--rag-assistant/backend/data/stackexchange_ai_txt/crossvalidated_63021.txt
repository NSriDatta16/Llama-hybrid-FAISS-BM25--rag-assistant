You could just use other scale/dispersion measures such as the interquantile range, which are not affected by tail asymptotics and thus square integrability. With the added benefit that often they are in general more robust anyway. Obviously one shall apply them to a resampling/bootstrap followed by the mean estimator, not directly just to the raw output from MC sampling of the function before averaging. You can also check in general L-estimators and adapt one of them to merge these two steps into one for performance, but mentally the two distributions shall not be confused, even though the estimator PDF will naturally inherit some characteristics (included maybe lack of square integrability).
