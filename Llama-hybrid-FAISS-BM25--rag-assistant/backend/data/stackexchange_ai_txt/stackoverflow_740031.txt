"Regexes are efficient" is too wide a characterization to be accurate. If you ignore the differences in relative peformance offered by different Regex engines, how efficient your Regex is still depends upon the complexity of the pattern. A Regex is efficient when it fails faster, rather than succeeds to match a portion of text faster. IOW, it needs to be specific enough so that text that isn't going to match completely should be rejected early on in the matching process rather than reaching the end. This also means that backtracking needs to be minimized. Note that backtracking can reach catastrophic levels which would result even the best Regex engine freezing up. In the example provided by Jan Goyvaerts, the size of the file isn't even mentioned and is not relevant. It is the size of the string which matters, however. Here's a discussion thread I started on RegexAdvice.com a few years ago that attempted to get people discussing about performance of Regular expressions. It does have a few pointers to learn from, I guess.
