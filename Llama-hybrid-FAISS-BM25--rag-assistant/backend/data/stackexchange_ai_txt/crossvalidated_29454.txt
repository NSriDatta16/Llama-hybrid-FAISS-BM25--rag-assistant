New developments in ML are almost always presented in conferences first, and sometimes later refined into journal papers. If you only follow two conferences, they should be: NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems); December. Conference site , proceedings . (Despite the name, most papers are unrelated to neuroscience or neural networks.) ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning); July. Site (including proceedings links). These conferences also include workshops that publish less-polished work, which can often be a good way to find about ongoing and not-yet-published research. The following ML conferences also contain many excellent papers, though they are not as "first-tier" as NIPS and ICML and may be more focused in scope: AISTATS (Artificial Intelligence and Statistics); May. Conference site ; proceedings published in JMLR and available here . Sometimes more theoretical, especially from a statistics viewpoint. COLT (Conference on Learning Theory); July. 2015 site , proceedings also published in JMLR . Very theoretical. UAI (Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence); July. Conference site , proceedings . Typically more focused on graphical models and/or Bayesian techniques. ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations); May. Conference site . (Focused on deep learning, relatively new; all submissions appear on arXiv.) ECML PKDD (European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases); September. Conference site . ACML (Asian Conference on Machine Learning); November. Conference site . Some AI conferences also include good machine learning papers or specific tracks on machine learning, especially: IJCAI (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence); July. Conference site , somewhat out-of-date proceedings . AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence); February. Conference site , proceedings . Conferences in related fields are also often relevant, especially: KDD (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining); August. Conference site , links to individual conferences here . CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition); June. 2016 site , overview .
