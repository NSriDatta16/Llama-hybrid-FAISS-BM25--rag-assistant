xcode4 documentation for iOS 4.3 Library

I installed xcode4 and in Organizer - Documentation I can see iOS 4.3 Library , Mac OS X 10.6 Library and Xcode 4.0 Developer Library . However, when I'm offline, I cannot access the iOS library documentation, I'm getting Error Loading URL You are not connected to internet. For the other 2 libraries it works. Anyone knows why it happens like that? There's no "get" button anymore in XCode > Preferences > Documentation.
