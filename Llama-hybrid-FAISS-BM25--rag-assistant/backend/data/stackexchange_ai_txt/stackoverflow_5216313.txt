Calling a asmx Web Service from a WCF Service

I have an interesting problem with an application (silverlight) that needs to obtain some data from a wcf service. No brainer all good on that front and easy to do. The wcf service needs to call another asmx web service to get more bit data to complete the retrieval. Clearly this causes problems in normal async event, as once the wcf method is run it needs to create another async call to the asmx service to retrieve the data. If this is possible could someone point me in the right direction of how to handle this please. Thanks for your time
