Regarding the number of iterations functionality

I have a query regarding the number of iterations functionality in Orange, which is available with several widgets. For instance, in the neural networks widget, the maximum number of iterations is currently 10000. However, I often come across problems where it takes more than 10000 iterations for a problem to converge. Is there a way to increase the number of iterations to for instance 1000000?
