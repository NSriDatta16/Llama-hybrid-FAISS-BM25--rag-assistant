A simple linear regression would not be appropriate as each observation (i.e. a quarter in a given year) is not independent of the other observations and they are also ordered. A regression discontinuity design would also struggle due to the time series nature of your data... What you are probably after would be a time-series model as this accounts for the autocorrelation between observations and would allow you to account for cyclic variation in the data (See this link ). There is approaches which are an amalgamation of both time series and RDD ( RDiT / ES ) which you could also explore, although I am not sure how easy they are to implement.
