Make text avoid a div, layout question

Here is a pic So this is a picture of a website I host for a non-profit organization. The picture is in a div that has the following attributes: position:absolute; right:50px; top:50px; What I want to do is make the text more visible because on different resolutions the picture will be in different locations, so I can either: -make the text visible over the picture -or make the text avoid the div (if possible) So, do you guys have any ideas? Thanks :)
