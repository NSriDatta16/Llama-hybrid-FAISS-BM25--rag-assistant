do document-oriented databases have integrity?

I'm coming from a MySQL background, and I'm interested in document-oriented databases, specifically CouchDB. One of the things I'm interested in is data integrity. How do document-oriented databases handle this? For instance, in RDBMSes, there are ways to prevent duplication of records, or guaranteeing that if you have one bit of information, you will have another, or else none at all. I guess more broadly, my question is, what types of problems are RDBMSes cut out for, compared to problems that DODBes are used for? I looked on some of the other stackoverflow questions for an explanation, but didn't find any good ones. Also, with my databases at work, I do a lot of reporting, with summing and averaging values, and historical trending. Is this something appropriate for document-oriented databases?
