What are reasons why one would want to use nested classes?

In this stackoverflow answer a commenter mentioned that " private nested classes" can be quite useful so I was reading about them in articles such as this one which tend to explain how nested classes function technically , but not why you would use them. I suppose I would use private nested classes for little helper classes that belong to a larger class, but often I will need a helper class from another class and so I would just have to take the extra effort to (1) make the nested class non-nested or (2) make it public and then access it with the outer-class prefix on it, which both seems to be extra work without any added-value for having the nested class in the first place. Hence in general I really don't see a use case for nested classes , other than perhaps to keep classes a bit more organized into groups, but I that also goes against the one-class-per-file clarity that I have come to enjoy. In what ways do you use nested classes to make your code more manageable, readable, efficient?
