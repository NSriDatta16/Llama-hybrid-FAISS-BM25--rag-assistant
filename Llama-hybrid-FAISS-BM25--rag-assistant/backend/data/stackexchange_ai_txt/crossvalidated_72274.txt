The question about the `true' nature of a scale is indeed a tricky one. But a quick pragmatic answer is that, depending on the analysis that you are interested in running, it might be fairly straight forward to deal with the scale as ordinal. I would suggest doing so because that would be the more conservative position, as the interval nature of the scale would be a stronger assumption. Now, regarding how to deal with the data... in general you could review the literature in item response models and the myriad of models offered there. However, if you are in a literature that relies mostly in factor analysis, you can easily deal with ordinal data by using polychoric correlations ( See the polycor in R for instance ) instead of the traditional Pearson product moment, and then running the factor analysis on that correlation matrix. Even easier is to use a software like Mplus , which will allow you to declare your variables as ordinal, and it will run the a generalized version of traditional factor analysis automatically. Again, this is a very interesting and contentious issue, but if your interest is mainly practical, you could simply treat the data as ordinal, and if you are in the mood of exploring, you could also run it under traditional FA and see if/how the results vary.
