ANOVA Interpretation: F and F crit are nearly equal

I am wondering how I should best interpret the results below. This is comparing weekdays with a count of 59 data values each (new shoes produced). According to documentation, I should reject the null hypothesis (H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4 = μ5) because F is higher than F crit. Also: the p value (0.04) is slightly lower than the alpha level (0.05) which means I should reject the null hypothesis? Again the difference is only 0.1. My question about this is, in this case F is only 0.1 higher, so should I still reject the null hypothesis or what conclusion should I draw here? Also, any advice on the next step is appreciated.
