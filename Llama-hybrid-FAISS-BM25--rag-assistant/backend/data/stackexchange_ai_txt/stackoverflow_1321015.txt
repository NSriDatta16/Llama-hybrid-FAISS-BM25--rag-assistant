If I have a choice, I put the JS functions in external files, but not all in one file. Cache or no cache, I group files by their functionality and organize them similar to Java packages. If I have an utility function, say something generic like trim() , that goes to the top most JS file and all pages can use it. If I have something specific to a part of the site (unused in other parts) that goes in something like a sub-package, just for that specific part… and so on. Of course you must use common sense so you don’t overdo it, and have let’s say a function per JS file. If you have fine grained JS files, that will affect you when your site evolves and you find yourself moving functions from sub-packages to an upper package or the other way around. I think one parent utility JS and one JS per site functionality should, most of the times, suffice.
