Check if this helps http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPF_MultiSelect_DragDrop.aspx EDIT The GongSolutions.Wpf.DragDrop library is a drag'n'drop framework for WPF. It has the following features: * Works with MVVM : the logic for the drag and drop can be placed in a ViewModel. No code needs to be placed in codebehind, instead attached properties are used to bind to a drag handler/drop handler in a ViewModel. * Works with multiple selections. * Can drag data within the same control to re-order, or between controls. * Works with TreeViews. * Can insert an item into a collection, or drop one item onto another. * Can display Adorners to give the user visual feedback of the operation in progress. * Has sensible defaults so that you have to write less code for common operations. Give it a try
