I'm with S.Lott -- the Verb *should not* be in there, as you want to use the same URL for reading the record as for updating it for it to qualify as REST. The content-type is something else to leave out, as it's the same record, but with multiple encoding formats. (Read up on FRBR for way more than you ever wanted to know about the issues of the distinction). The decision of which version to send in response can be handled with HTTP Accept headers. The only one that I'm torn on is the version number, as I can't personally think of an appropriate HTTP header to handle that aspect of it. (Expect? Accept-Encoding? Pragma? Maybe even Upgrade, but you'd more frequently want to downgrade to an older version for compatibility reasons, I'd think) I'd probably have a version-less accessor which gave the most recent production version, but might consider have a version'd one for significant changes that weren't backwards-compatible. update: the version issue probably depends on how much control you have over the clients connecting to your services ... if you have access from a wide public (which I don't), you might be more interested in backwards compatibility. Depending on the changes made, it's possible that you might also consider 'version 2' to be a completely new resource, rather than just a new 'version' of the original.
