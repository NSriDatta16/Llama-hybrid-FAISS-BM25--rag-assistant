Although I'm not sure about this statement "Every 14 rows in my CSV is relevant to one time slot." , as it's not cleared to me. But if I go with your comment "How should I load this data to LSTM?So the number of column is 12 " , what I believe that you are asking how to load multiple features(in your case 12) for a time series model. If my understanding is correct its a problem of type "Multiple Parallel Timeseries". I have created a similar model in Tensorflow and pushed in github. Github Source Code for Multiple Parallel TimeSeries Note: Here instead of 12 features, I have used 3 features.
