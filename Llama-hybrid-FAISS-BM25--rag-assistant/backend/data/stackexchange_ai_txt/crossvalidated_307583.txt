I personally think the question is too broad to be answered well, But I still want to give some suggestions. I feel Murphy's introduction to graphical models is very useful and it covers Bayesian Network with discrete time very well. If you have not checked this, I would recommend to read this first. A Brief Introduction to Graphical Models and Bayesian Networks To build a Bayesian network (with discrete time or dynamic bayesian network), there are two parts, specify or learn the structure and specify or learn parameter. To my experience, it is not common to learn both structure and parameter from data. People often use the domain knowledge plus assumptions to make the structure And learn the parameters from data. A useful R library can be found in BNLearn , it supports both structure and parameter learning. Finally I may suggest you to check some Recurrent Neural Network literatures. The deep learning book chapter 10 gives very nice explanation on the relationship between dynamic bayesian network and recurrent neural network. Deep learning is a really hot area recently, and there are more resources there.
