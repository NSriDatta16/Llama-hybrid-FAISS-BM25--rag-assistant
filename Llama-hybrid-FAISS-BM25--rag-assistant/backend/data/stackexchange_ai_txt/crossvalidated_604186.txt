How do you interpret the value of RMSE/MSE in English to stakeholders?

For example, if you have a R^2 of 0.95, you can explain this number to stakeholders in a presentation as: Our model explains 95% of the total variance within the data. However, if we have a RMSE of 11, how do you interpret this? I'm imagining something like "On average, our model's prediction will be incorrect by +/-11 units." Yes I know that lower error = better but that isn't the full explanation of what the number actually means. And an equivalent interpretation for MSE would be incredibly helpful as well.
