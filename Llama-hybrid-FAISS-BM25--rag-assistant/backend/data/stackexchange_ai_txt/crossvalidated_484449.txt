finding a simple tutorial / explanation about the "choose a color" method to ask sensitive questions

I have a 'hard science' background and I remember in high school a lecture about how to ask sensitive questions to a group of people by using bayesian statistics and the "choose a color" trick. For example, "choose a color, either red or blue; answer yes if you either have thought blue, or if you are hiv positive". I was shocked to hear that someone close to me, who has a sociology / psychology background, has not heard about this method. Do you know 1) if it has a dedicated name in the literature / handbooks in sociology / psychology, 2) if there are some simple tutorials / explanations of the method for people with little to no probability / statistics / maths background that I may refer this person to? I googled for this but could not find it. (I can build such an explanation myself but it would be a bit of work, as there is a true vulgarization work to do to explain this to somebody with a weak proba background :) ).
