Time series econometrics deals with a similar question: If $y_t$ and $x_t$ are time series variables, should you trust a linear regression with the two variables? The answer is "it depends". It depends on whether the observed relationship between the two variables would continue to be true in the future. If $y_t$ and $x_t$ are both non-stationary, then the observed relationship may break apart in the future. If $y_t$ and $x_t$ are both stationary, then the observed relationship should hold in the future. Here's a simulated example. The variables, $x_t$ and $y_t$, are both non-stationary by design. Although the regression model says that the observed relationship is strong (based on p-value and $R^2$), the out-of-time $R^2$ is horrible (the model is far worse than using the average as a prediction). ### create two non-stationary variables set.seed(12345) x TLDR; Predicting the future is hard. Linear regression using time series data may be extremely misleading. Hold-out some of your data based on sequential time (e.g., hold out the last 9 quarters of your time series). Validate your model using the hold-out data.
