Is there a problem to initialize numRow, numCol in the initialization list [...]? In general , there's two problems with doing so: While initializing objects in the initialization list, the object is not yet fully constructed. Therefore, when you're invoking non-static member functions, you are invoking them on a not yet fully constructed object . If those functions attempt to use any sub-object of the object that has not been constructed, you are invoking Undefined Behavior . The order of initialization is the order of declaration of the members in the class definition , it is not the order in which they are listed in the initialization list . Therefore you need to pay attention to initialization of members requiring data from other members. (This can be seen as a sub-problem of the previous: using not yet constructed sub-objects.) It is best to avoid such situations, but if they cannot be avoided, add a big, scary comment to where the members are declared in the class' definition, emphasizing the importance of their order. In your concrete example this doesn't matter, so you are safe to do this.
