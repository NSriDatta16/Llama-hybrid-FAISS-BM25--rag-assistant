Flex: Update data-base after drag-move?

OK I have an AdvancedDataGrid. The data I feed it is XML that looks like this: But I am grouping by associate so it ends up looking like a tree like this: Sam Smith 07/08/09 James Frank John Doe 09-07-08 Amanda Jones 09-07-09 Henry Scott I am trying to make it so you can re-assign customers to different associates by dragging them from one to another. I set dragMoveEnabled so I can actually click on and move it to another associate and it visually works perfect. But I need to detect who received what so I can update the data-base with the change. Does anyone know how to do that? Thanks!! UPDATE: I tried looking at the flat data afterwards like so: public function onDragComplete(event:Event):void { var adg:AdvancedDataGrid = AdvancedDataGrid(event.currentTarget); var hcv:HierarchicalCollectionView = HierarchicalCollectionView(adg.dataProvider); var gc:GroupingCollection = GroupingCollection(hcv.source); trace(gc.source); } And it has not changed, maybe the non-flat data changes tho, but I am not sure how to view the non-flat data?
