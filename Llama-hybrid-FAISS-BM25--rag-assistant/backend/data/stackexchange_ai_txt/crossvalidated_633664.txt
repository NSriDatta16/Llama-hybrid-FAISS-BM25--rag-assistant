Should I use Pearson, Kendall, or Spearman correlation?

I collected disease severity data, expressed as proportions between 0 and 1 on plants in field trials conducted across different year. Additionally, I gathered weather data, representing average values over the duration of the field trials in each year. For relative humidity (and temperature, rainfall, wind speed), I aim to determine whether the minimum, maximum, or mean relative humidity exhibits the highest correlation with disease_severity . Could you advise on the recommended correlation method to use, considering that my response variable, 'disease_severity,' is not normally distributed? Moreover, the relationship between weather variables and disease_severity is non-linear. Here is the scatter plot for relative humidity
