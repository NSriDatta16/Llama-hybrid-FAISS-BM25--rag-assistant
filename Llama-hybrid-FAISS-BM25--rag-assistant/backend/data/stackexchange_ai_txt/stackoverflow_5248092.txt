I would say that you could get a fairly decent comparison by ensuring you stop and start the DBMS before each query. It may even be worthwhile shutting down the whole PC between runs. Another possibility is to alternate a larger number of samples. Run the two queries A and B in the sequence A,B,A,B,A,B,A,B,A,B and average the results. Also (although I don't know this about MySQL) most DBMS' have a query explainer which you should be using to check this sort of thing. Those two queries aren't the same if id can go negative, by the way. Based on your update, the EXPLAIN output, you get the same result for both queries. That means there should be no difference between them, all other things being equal. However, since there's no mention of a key or index being used (or usable), you almost certainly don't have an index on x . If you add that, you should find that the query will be faster (this still depends on the cardinality of x but, as a general rule, it should improve).
