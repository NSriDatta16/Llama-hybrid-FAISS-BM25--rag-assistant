L2 is between two feature vectors. These two would be natural ways of doing it: You could find the minimum L2 distance between all the feature vectors of entity 1 and all the feature vectors of entity 2. If we have 2 vector for entity 1 like A=[1,3,2,1] and B=[3,2,4,1] AND 1 vector for entity 2 like C=[1,2,4,2]. Then dist = min(d([1,3,2,1],[1,2,4,2]),d([3,2,4,1],[1,2,4,2]) You could find the average vectors between all the vectors of entity 1 and the average vector of entity 2. Then compute the L2 distance. If we have 2 vector for entity 1 like A=[1,3,2,1] and B=[3,2,4,1] AND 1 vector for entity 2 like C=[1,2,4,2]. Then dist = d([(1+3)/2,(3+2)/2,(2+4)/2,(1+1)/2],[1,2,4,2])
