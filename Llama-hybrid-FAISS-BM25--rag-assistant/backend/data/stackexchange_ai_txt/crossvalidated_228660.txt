Assessing a distribution from multiple estimates of its mean

I face a random variable whose distribution I don't know. Someone draws a sample of k observations from a population and tells me their average. He repeats the process m times. I assume m is in order of magnitude of hundreds. If 1 What about other lower moments? If k=1, I can trivially draw the emplirical distribution. What is the closest analoug for 1
