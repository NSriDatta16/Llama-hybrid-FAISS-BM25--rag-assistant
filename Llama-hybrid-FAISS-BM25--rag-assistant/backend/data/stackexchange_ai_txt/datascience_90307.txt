The statement in principle seems very vague, how can one state that there are better classification than regression algorithms? With that said I would rephrase the statement to: Sometime it is feasible to turn a regression into a classification problem due to for the problem itself, it makes sense to predict a range/bin instead of a continuous value. When doing this we have to be careful since we are not facing a "common" classification problem but we have an ordinal classification problem in which we have a natural order from the new target (bins) For reference check: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/493254/why-ordinal-target-in-classification-problems-needs-special-attention
