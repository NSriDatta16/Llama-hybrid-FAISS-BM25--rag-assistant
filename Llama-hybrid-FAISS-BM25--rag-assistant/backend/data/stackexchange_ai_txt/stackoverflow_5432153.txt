Double tables select show?

I have a problem...I have 2 tables, Table1 and Table2. Table1: id,int(11) text,varchar(11) Table2: id,int(11) agentid,int(11) unique(id,agentid) Table2 has many id and agent ids in it. The data for the id in table 2 came from table 1. I have an agentid say $aid. This has many id's associated with it in table 2. I am trying to get the set of text values out from table 1 associated with all ids which are related to agentid $aid from table 2. Does that make sense?! Any ideas?
