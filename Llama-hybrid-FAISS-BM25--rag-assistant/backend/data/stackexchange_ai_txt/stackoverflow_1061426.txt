jQuery return false weird behavior

I have a piece of jQuery code that toggles a description paragraph for a given td when users click on an anchor tag, see code below. My problem is that if I put the return false statement as shown, the code works fine in IE but in FF it would not show the description at all, which is expected. When I put the return false after the toggling it works fine in FF but in IE it would show the description and then hides it right away. Is there any way to get it to work properly in both?? Thanks in advance. $(".name").click(function(){ return false; $(this).parent() .parent() .find(".description") .animate({ opacity: "toggle", "slow"); });
