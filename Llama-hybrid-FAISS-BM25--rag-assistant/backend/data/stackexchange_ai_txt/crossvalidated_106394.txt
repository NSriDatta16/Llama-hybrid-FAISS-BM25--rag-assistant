Odds ratios from logistic regression on subsets of data using R

I have 15 subjects each with 200 trials & I'd like to run separate regressions for each subject. If I just run the regression on the whole dataset I am able to generate odds ratios / confidence intervals from it: acc.log = glm(response ~ phdot + sdot, data=fullerr, family="binomial") summary(acc.log) exp(acc.log$coefficients) exp(confint(acc.log)) But then when I fit each subject separately (I've tried using by ), I am an unsure how to then extract information like odds ratios (standard errors & p values are also no longer shown in the output). split.acc
