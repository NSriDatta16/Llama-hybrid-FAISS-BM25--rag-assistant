Unlike iOS, Mac applications leverage Garbage Collection. Did you turn on the garbage collection in the compiler setting? Note that it is an opt-in technology. If you don't, you have to do retain/release. If you do turn on the garbage collection, memory management is automatically done for you, as long as you only use Cocoa objects. Core Foundation objects are not automatically taken care of, so you need some care if you use CF... methods. For more on garbage collection, read the official documentation .
