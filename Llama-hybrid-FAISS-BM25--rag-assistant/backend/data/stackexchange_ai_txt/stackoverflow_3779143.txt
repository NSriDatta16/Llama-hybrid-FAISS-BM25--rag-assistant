C# FileSystemWatcher Serious Problem?

I have implemented a FileSystemWatcher for a folder which resides on a NetworkStorage Device (having no O.S.). The scenario is, we have two machine says machine A and machine B. my application is having two buttons on my form Button1 and Button2. I have written code for renaming the Test.txt file. Button1: renaming the file Test.txt to Test007.txt and Button2: renaming the file Test007.txt to Test.txt And suppose I have run tis exe file from A and B simultaneously. Then I am able to rename file by pressing Button1 from Machine A and now If I am trying to rename the file from the another Machine B then it is giving an error "System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The specified server can not perform the requested operation" Anybody is having any Idea about it...please help us to find the solution. We are having proper rights for the folder. Note : Code is also working for LAN Folder, So the code is perfect.it is just not working for NetworkStoreDevice.
