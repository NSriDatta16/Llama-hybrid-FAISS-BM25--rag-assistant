A Social Network with Artificial Intelligence

I'm planning a Social Network with an Artificial Intelligence . that means that the SN will take the conversations (in english) .. and analyse them in order to extract the general opinion about a subject. This helps to collect information and build statistics, which will be sent then to the appropriate user. My question is : how to organize words and grammatical rules in a database, in order to help the social network extracting a general opinion from a conversation (agree, disagree..etc)! thank you.
