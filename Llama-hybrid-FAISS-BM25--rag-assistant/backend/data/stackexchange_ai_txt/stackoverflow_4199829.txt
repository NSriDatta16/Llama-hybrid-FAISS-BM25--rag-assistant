How would I see if two Java queues are equal on the basis of the value of the contents of each?

I want to implement an override of equals that compares two Java Queue objects on the basis of them each having contents that are equal (by value). I can probably hack together some code, but surely someone has solved this elegantly already. A google search didn't turn up any results, so I came here next. I appreciate any suggestions. I'm going to need to do the same thing with ArrayList and HashMap collections too. BTW, for equals(), I using this as my guide: http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=17 It gives some hints, but apparently I need more help when it comes to the collections. The types contained in the collections are overriding equals() based on the recommendations from that link.
