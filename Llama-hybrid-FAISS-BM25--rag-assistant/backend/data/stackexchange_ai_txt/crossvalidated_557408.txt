As @MichaelLew said,none of the answers is 100% true. The question and answers are poorly worded. Answer 1 is about the distribution of flu duration among people. The study is only about average length and you have no information about the distribution among different people. Answer 2 is also about the distribution of flu duration among people, just asking it differently. Nothing in the problem gives a clue about the distribution. Answer 3 is about relative duration of flu. Nothing in the problem gives you information about the durations or the relative duration. Answer 4 is wrong because of "same result". P value is about same result or even more extreme result (or same or more extreme difference in the other direction, if two-sided p-value). Moreover, answer 4 incorrectly equates a probability of 0.05 with 0.05% (rather than 5%). Answer 5 says "proven". Statistics can never absolutely prove in one study. Statistics is about probabilities. As written therefore, all answers are wrong. But #4 the closest to being correct.
