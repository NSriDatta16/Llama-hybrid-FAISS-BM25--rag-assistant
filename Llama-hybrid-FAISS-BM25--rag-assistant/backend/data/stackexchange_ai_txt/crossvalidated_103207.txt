Statistical description of how two distributions are different

I am have a collection of events recorded in two separate conditions, and I have measured the duration of each one of them. I would like to know two things: 1) are the distributions of durations different between the two conditions, and 2) if so, how are they different? For example, maybe the biggest difference between the two conditions is that there are far more 10 ms long events in condition #1 than in condition #2. I feel confident in using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine whether the distributions are significantly different, but am stuck on how to describe what the differences actually are using a statistical test or collection of test statistics. I could histogram the data and run some sort of ANOVA, but that seems a little course and inelegant. Or maybe it is fair to plot the distributions on top of each other and simply read off the difference at areas of interest. Any advice on how to tackle this problem? Below is some example data. Here a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing these two distributions returns a very small p-value (p think the KS test works, this also tells me that where the two distributions are widest apart in the horizontal plane (around 0.9 on the y-axis) the two distributions are significantly different (there are more events with durations around 60 ms in group 1 than in group 2). But what about everywhere else in the distribution? Is there a way for me to know whether the difference in the amount of events that are 10 ms long is also statistically significant?
