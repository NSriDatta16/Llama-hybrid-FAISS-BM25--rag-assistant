Installed D2009 Enterprise on VMWare instance running Vista Business with an existing D2007 Enterprise installation. Perhaps I did something incorrectly, but I began to experience errors in the D2007 IDE, as well as a very strange error, unknown fieldtype, in exe files compiled with D2007. I uninstalled D2009, and the errors have gone away.
