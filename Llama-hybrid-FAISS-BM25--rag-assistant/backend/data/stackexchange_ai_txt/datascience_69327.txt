Embedding layer, is used in auto-encoders to construct word2vec. Embedding layer, are a type of layer, used in Deep Learning. You can find others here . Auto-encoders, are a type of architecture, where embedding layers are used. Using these architectures, one can calculate word2vec. word2vec values are calculated when words are fed into the auto-encoders.
