Actually nothing guarantees that different convolutional filters would learn different features. The filters have same structure and are trained in the same way, so they are redundant before they learn something. We initialize the parameters randomly and we hope they will learn different features. You should probably try different initialization for the weights. If this doesn't help, try debugging the network as described in What should I do when my neural network doesn't learn? .
