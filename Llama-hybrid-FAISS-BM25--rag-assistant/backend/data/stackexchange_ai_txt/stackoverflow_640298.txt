In your layer that contains your sprite, you need to say: self.isTouchEnabled = YES; then you can use the same events that you would use in a UIView, but they're named a little differently: - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; //in your touchesEnded event, you would want to see if you touched //down and then up inside the same place, and do your logic there. }
