JavaScript notation: (function() { ... } )();

Possible Duplicate: What is the purpose of wrapping whole Javascript files in anonymous functions like “ (function(){ … })() ”? Hello all, I have seen several JavaScript files using this notation: Start of JavaScript file: (function() { // All functions go here. // Can someone say what the wrapping nameless function is used for? })(); Also with the prototype library, this seems possible: function $() { // Prototype $-wrapping function. } Can someone please explain the above two code fragments, their uses and their differences? Some keywords which would help me find more about this notation/technique (how it is named) would be helpful too so I can run a Google search on it... :) Thanks!
