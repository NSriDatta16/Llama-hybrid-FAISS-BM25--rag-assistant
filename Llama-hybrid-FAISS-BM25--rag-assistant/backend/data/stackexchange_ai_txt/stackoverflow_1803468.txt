Mark is normally meant to be used at normal breakpoints. You may find it useful to place them at paragraph breaks or maybe at sentence breaks. As long as your application keeps track of where the mark ids are in your source text, you should be able to restart audio in that area. Be aware that to implement mark, most platforms break the text and submit the pieces between mark entries to a rendering layer, then play the clip, one at a time. Therefore, you might see pauses as the platform crosses a mark. It is also worth noting that only a subset of VoiceXML platforms implement mark so the availability of mark or differences in behavior could become an issue if you need to run on additional platforms.
