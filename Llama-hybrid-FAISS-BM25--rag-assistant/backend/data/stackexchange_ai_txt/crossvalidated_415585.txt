Yes, the shape of your residual plot is good - nicely balanced around zero. However, look at the scales on the axes. Most of your fitted values range from 0 to 250. The residuals are mostly in the range from -1100 to +1100, i.e. the errors are about four times as big as the values that you are predicting. R-squared = 3% seems reasonable with such big errors. Also, to address your other question from the comments, the red line is a loess curve fitted to the residuals. In your case, the curve is close to y=0 which says that on average, your results are good. But again, having one error of +500 and another of -500 may average to zero error, but does not indicate a good result.
