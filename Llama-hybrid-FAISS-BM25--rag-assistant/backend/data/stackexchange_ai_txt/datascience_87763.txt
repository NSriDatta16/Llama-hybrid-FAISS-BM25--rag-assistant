In a Dense NN, Input to a Layer depends on the output of the previous layer and its Neuron count Previous Layer for the first layer is the Input Data Features Output of a Layer is equal to the Layer's neuron count. A copy of each goes to all the Neuron of the Next Layer It means for your case, - First Layer will have *M(Input features) 3 inputs going in i.e. M to each Neuron and 3 coming out. - The Second layer will have *3(Previous Layer) 5 inputs going in and 5 coming out - The Last layer will have 5(Previous Layer)*2 inputs going in and 2 coming out A Neural Network is a complex Tensor operation. Arrow and Circle are logical representations. Each arrow got a weight and each Circle got the Activation function and the Bias term. So, you may count this way too. $\hspace{3cm}$ Validate this with Keras Model.summary result which shows the parameter count.
