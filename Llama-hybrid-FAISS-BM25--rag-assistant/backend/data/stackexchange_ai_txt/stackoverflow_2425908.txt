I would go for database. have people vote for pages and remember the votes, so people can change their vote. Calcualte totals and / or average (depending on voting cmechanism) and take it from there. If you talk of a single user system (not correlating user A votes with user B votes) you CAN use the profile mechainsm as you will store a small list anyway. What you do loose is the mecahnism to query for those efficiently (as administrator). Pretty largely a design decision based on personal preferences. Arguments ca nbe made in both directions. I would possibly go with the database - in the light of easier maintenance and later expansion.
