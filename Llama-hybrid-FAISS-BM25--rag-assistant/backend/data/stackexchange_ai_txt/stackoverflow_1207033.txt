I've heard of this happening before with fso, but I haven't heard of a solution (or a cause, for that matter). If you're using vb.net, you can use the my.computer.filesystem.filecopy function instead of fso. If you're using vb6, you can also copy a file this way, although it's not very elegant. Dim s As String Open sourcename For Binary As 1 s = String(LOF(1), " ") Get 1, , s Close 1 Open destname For Binary As 1 put 1, , s close 1
