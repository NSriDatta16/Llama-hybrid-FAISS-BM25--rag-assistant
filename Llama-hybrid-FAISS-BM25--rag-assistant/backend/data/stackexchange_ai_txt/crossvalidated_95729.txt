If we ignore dependencies between time intervals, then the number of photons received during a specific time frame $[t_i, t_{i+1})$ can be modeled as a poisson distribution $\text{Pois}(\lambda_i)$. Hence, the maximum likelihood estimate of $\lambda_i$ is simply the average count during the time interval $[t_i, t_{i+1})$. Let us denote the number of time intervals by $n$. A single profile with counts $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ is unlikely if the probability of generating it using the Poisson model with our estimated parameters is low. Since we are modeling the counts using independent Poisson variables, this probability is just the product of the point-mass-function of the different Poisson distributions. $\Pr[x_1, \ldots, x_n | \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n] = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\lambda_i^{x_i}}{x_i!}e^{-x_i}$. To avoid numerical issues, it is probably better to compute the log of this expression. $\log \Pr[x_1, \ldots, x_n | \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \log \lambda_i - \log (x_i !) - x_i $. If this probability is very low then the single profile may be anomalous. So, how can one choose a bound? The easiest way is by simulation: Simulate many draws from the poisson model. i.e. take $X_i \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda_i)$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. For each draw $(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ compute the log-likelihood as described above. The above procedure yields scores $s_1, \ldots, s_r$, where $r$ is the number of simulations. These scores are samples from the distribution of log-likelihood scores under the null hypothesis. Thus an $\alpha=5\%$ level bound can be estimated by taking the 5-th percentile (from the bottom) of the set of scores $\{s_1, \ldots, s_r\}$. As Glen_b notes, estimating the $\lambda$ values and then scoring using all the single profiles creates some nasty dependencies. It is better to estimate $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ using all the other profiles except the one currently being tested. However, if the total number of profiles is large, this doesn't really matter.
