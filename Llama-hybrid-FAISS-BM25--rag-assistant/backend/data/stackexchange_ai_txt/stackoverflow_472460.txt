SQL 2005: Agent job step output file naming

Does anyone know, please, if there's a way to specify "this machine" in a file path that SQL Server will like? I have an Agent job I want to script onto all my servers. It outputs to a file on the local machine so I want to script the file name as \\localhost\ \ Another reason is I'm planning to use log shipping for disaster recovery and I want the jobs to work the same whichever server they're running on. The script sets the job up fine but when I run the job I get an error "Unable to open Step output file". I think I've eliminated share and folder permissions: it works fine with C:\ \ .
