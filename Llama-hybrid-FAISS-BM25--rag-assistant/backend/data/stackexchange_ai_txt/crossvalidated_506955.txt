What did you do before you went into using bsts neural-net method, can you tell us? Especially if you have little experience with forecasting (you did not tell), you should probably not jump directly into such modern advanced methods, but try first some simpler methods. The plot you show is rather typical ... Forecasting tomorrow as being like today is called persistence forecasting see for instance this and search. It can be surprisingly good, many phenomena shows surprisingly much persistence, as for instance weather in the Atacama desert ... So before jumping into complex modeling, maybe make some simple baseline models, evaluate their quality (like calculate their mean square forecasting error), and later compare more complicated models to that. For some advice along this lines see for instance Best method for short time-series Timeseries analysis procedure and methods using R Step-by-step process for forecasting time series in R and search this site!
