Product Analytical data in TXT files (using YAML)

I am currently developing an ecommerce software using PHP/MySQL for a big company. There are two options for me to get some specificed data: DB (for getting huge data, such as PRODUCTS, CATEGORIES, ORDERS, etc.) TXT (using YAML -for getting analytical data and some options) For instance, when a user go to product details page I need to get those TXT files: Product summary file (product_hit, quantity_sold, etc.) -approximately max. 90KB Langauge and Settings file (such as company_name, translations for template) -approximately max. 300KB May be one more file (I don't know right know) -assume that 100KB. I want to use this way, because data is easily readable by human and portable between programming languages. In addition, if I use DB, I need to connect a couple of tables. But these files GET THEM TOGETHER. My txt file looks like (YAML): product_id: 1281 quantity_sold: 12 #item(s) hit: 1105 hit_avarage: 92 #quantity_sold/hit vote: 2 ... But, still I am not sure about speed and performance. Using TXT files are good idea? Should I really use this way instead of DB?
