Where to get regression treatment effect instead of average treatment effect after using propensity scoring match

In Dehejia and Wahba (2002), after the average treatment effect column, there is also a new column "regression treatment effect". I know the average treatment effect is just the average difference of the treated and the matched controlled outcome. I am not sure what the regression treatment is supposed to be and how can I obtain it from Stata.
