It is so much better to use a parser, even with a tiny fragment, unless you are sure the string will never change format and you own the process from end-to-end. That said, to meet your requirement of a regex, I'd use String.scan: str = "lorem text1 ipsum text2 dolor si amet" str.scan(%r{ ([^ }).flatten # => ["text1", "text2"] Just to show how simple using a parser is: require 'nokogiri' doc = Nokogiri::HTML(str) doc.css('tt').map(&:text) # => ["text1", "text2"] The benefit is flexibility and robustness.
