There is no "initial" value of the diagonal entries in the infinitesimal generator matrix, a.k.a. transition rate matrix, I'll call it Q, of a continuous time Markov Chain. The author shows how to estimate the off-diagonal transition entries of the infinitesimal generator matrix. As is always the case with an infinitesimal generator matrix, each row must sum to zero, as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_rate_matrix . Therefore, the diagonal entries of the infinitesimal generator matrix are set equal to the negative of the sum of the entries in the corresponding row. As described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-time_Markov_chain#Transient_behaviour , the transition probability matrix is calculated as $e^{t Q}$, where t is the length of time, in units corresponding to the intensity parameter entries in Q. The author in your link performed such calculation with annual intensity rates and t = 1, and therefore the transition probability matrix in his example corresponds to a one year period. The mathematics works out that if the row sums of Q equal zero (as they must), then the row sums of the transition probability matrix equal one, as is the case in the example in the link.
