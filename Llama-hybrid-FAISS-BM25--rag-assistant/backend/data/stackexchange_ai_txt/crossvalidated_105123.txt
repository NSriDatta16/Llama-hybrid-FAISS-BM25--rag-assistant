My choice would be to use regression models for both questions: Ordinal logistic regression for the ordinal variable and "regular" regression for the continuous variable. Group would be an independent variable. This allows you to include control variables (often helpful, even with randomization) and even interactions (should theory dictate any). It also explicitly treats one variable as the dependent variable and the other as independent; this seems appropriate in your case.
