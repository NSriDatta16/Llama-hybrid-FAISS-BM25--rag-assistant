I would rather not spoil your fun by coding the whole thing. But I would advise starting out by breaking this into functions, and deciding what you want each function to do. For instance, it would be nice to have a function like this: Map calculatePropertyAmounts(List lines) and it would be nice to have a function that would get the property amount from a line, like this: java.math.BigDecimal readAmountFromLine(String line) and likewise String readAgentIdFromLine(String line) and maybe something like List readLinesFromFile(String filename) I've missed some bits obviously but that's the general idea. Once you have broken it up in pieces you can conquer the pieces individually, then assemble a solution out of them.
