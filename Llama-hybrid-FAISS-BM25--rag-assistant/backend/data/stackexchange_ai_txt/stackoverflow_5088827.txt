How to move files to ExternalStorage after APK installation?

I'm developing an application about a local guide, this app has audios/videos. After the installation i want to move these media resources to the external storage. How can i do that? I want to avoid the "Android Move To SD Card Feature" if its possible. If I use the /resource/ folder (with /res/raw/ I think it's impossible) can I move the files to SD Card and after delete them from the internal memory? How? Other way? Thanks. I see a similar question in stackoverflow ( link ) but it's not exactly the same, and the there's no solution.
