We are currently developing an LCMS, once of the areas is a fully WYSIWYG authoring tool for the development of SCORM and AICC compliant training materials that contain animation, video, audio, multiple types of assessments with interaction. The tool looks close to how a power point looks, allowing the user to easily drag and drop learning objects to the slide with pictures, resize images, move them, overlap text, add the tests etc. This workspace is done currently in Flex and has great performance, not even Google Docs/Presentations comes close to the flexibility and performance of this application. I wonder if an application of that scale can be developed with HTML5 without a huge amount of resources. We are a small company with small group of developers.
