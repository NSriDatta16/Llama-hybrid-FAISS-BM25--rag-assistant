The biggest problem with std::string is that the current standard doesn't guarantee that its underlying storage is contiguous. However, there are no known STL implementations where string is not contiguous, so in practice it probably won't fail. In fact, the new C++0x standard is going to fix this problem, by mandating that std::string uses a contiguous buffer, such as std::vector. Another argument against string is that its name suggests that it contains a character string, not a binary buffer, which may cause confusion to those who read the code. That said, I recommend vector as well.
