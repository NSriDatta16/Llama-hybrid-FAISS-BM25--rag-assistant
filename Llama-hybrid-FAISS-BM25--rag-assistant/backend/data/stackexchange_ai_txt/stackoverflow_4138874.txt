I think, best way for you - extend combobox functionality not via behavior but using inheritance. So, you can create own control MyComboBox:ComboBox. Create style for it - get default ComboBox Style here And write instead (look for ScrollViewer by name): this This StackPanel you can get in code: public class MyComboBox: ComboBox{ public CM() { DefaultStyleKey = typeof (MyComboBox); } public override void OnApplyTemplate() { base.OnApplyTemplate(); StackPanel stackPanel = (StackPanel)GetTemplateChild("StackPanel"); stackPanel.KeyUp += (s, e) => { /*do something*/ }; } } Inheritance is more powerful. It's allow work with template elements. If you decided to inject ItemsPanel, you must understand that: 1)it's impossible from code with keeping reference on injected panel. 2)to get reference to injected panel, this panel must registered itself in some storage, e.g. Good luck!
