There are so many good possibilities and your vague description makes it difficult to narrow it down to just a couple. But here is a short list. 1. Humourous but also clear and accurate by Gonick "The Cartoon Guide to Statistics 1993" http://www.amazon.com/Cartoon-Guide-Statistics-Larry-Gonick/dp/0062731025/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341601837&sr=1-1&keywords=the+cartoon+guide+to+statistics Clearly written in the style of David Moore "The Basic Practice of Statistics 5th Edition 2010." http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Practice-Statistics-David-Moore/dp/1429201215/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341601954&sr=1-2&keywords=the+basic+practice+of+statistics Good college level book by Hogg and Tanis "Probability and Statistical Inference 8th Edition 2009." Now Published by Prentice-Hall. Was published by Macmillian when I studied out of it in the 1970s The authors were Hogg and Craig then and the title was different too. I had it as "Introduction to Mathematical Statistics 3rd Edition 1970." http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistical-Inference-Robert-Hogg/dp/0321584759/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341601657&sr=1-1&keywords=hogg+tanis The classic by Mood, Graybill and Boes 1974 "Introduction to the Theory of Statistics". http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Statistics-3rd-Edition/dp/0070854653/ref=la_B002880BCE_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1341601600&sr=1-1 Very modern first year undergraduate introductory text. One of my favorites because it includes resampling methods. Chihara and Hesterberg "Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R, 2011" http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Resampling-Laura-Chihara/dp/1118029852/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341602206&sr=1-1&keywords=Chihara+and+Hesterberg This is the only good one that is concise "pocketbook" size. Silvey's "Statistical Inference 1975" http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-Monographs-Statistics-Probability/dp/0412138204/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341602312&sr=1-1&keywords=silvey+s+d
