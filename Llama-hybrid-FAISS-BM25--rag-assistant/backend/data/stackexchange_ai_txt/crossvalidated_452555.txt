When do we need Hessian Vector products vs Hessians (in meta-learning or Deep Learning)?

I was reading the paper MAML and they say: This approximation removes the need for computing Hessian-vector products in an additional backward pass So when doing the derivative of the derivative to update parameters of the meta-learning, do we use these hessian-vector products or Hessians? I am confused which one are used.
