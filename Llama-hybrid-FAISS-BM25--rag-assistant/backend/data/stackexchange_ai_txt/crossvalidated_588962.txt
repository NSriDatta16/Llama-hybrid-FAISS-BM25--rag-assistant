Does Discriminator in GAN Train only on Real Data or it also Trains on Fake Generated Data

I have been studying GANs and I got confused in the training phase from the discriminator. Which I think only trains on Real data, not on the generated data which then helps in distinguishing or classifying whether the input is real or fake. I need to confirm that is true what I am thinking or if it does train on fake data generated by the generator as well.
