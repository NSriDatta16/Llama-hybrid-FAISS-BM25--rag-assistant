Multi-step ahead forecasting with Weighted Moving Average?

The Weighted Moving Average method is usually used for smoothing purposes. However, it can be used to forecast $Y(t+1)$ based on the last n observed data. In real-world problems, forecasting in very short horizon $(h = 1)$ is not very interesting. I would like to know if it is possible to use larger forecasting horizons in WMA method like in HoltWinter and ARIMA techniques ?
