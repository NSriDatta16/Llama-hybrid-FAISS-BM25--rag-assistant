How to prevent form from being resized in Delphi?

How do I prevent my form from being resized? I don't want it to be maximized (which can be toggled via the property editor), but I don't want anyone to be able to drag-resize it. Am I missing something simple, or does this require a little bit of coding? I'm using Delphi 2007.
