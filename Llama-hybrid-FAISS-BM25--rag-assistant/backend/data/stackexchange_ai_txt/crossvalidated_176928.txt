Not sure if this is too late. What you need to do is substitute (17.44) for the last term of equation (17.46) i.e. $p(z_t=j\mid x_{1:t-1})$ . Then $\alpha_t(j) = \frac{1}{Z_t}p(x_t\mid z_t=j)\left(\sum\limits_ip(z_t=j\mid z_{t-1}=i)p(z_{t-1}=i\mid x_{1:t-1})\right)$ . Now if you take $\bf{\alpha}_t$ as the vector with K components and each element being $\alpha_t(j)$ , the summation of the above equation can be written as a matrix multiplication $\bf{\Psi}^T\bf{\alpha}_{t-1}$ which yields a vector. $\mathbf{\Psi}$ is defined as in the last paragraph of the text. To get $\mathbf{\alpha}_t$ we need elementwise multiplication between $\bf{\Psi}^T\bf{\alpha}_{t-1}$ and $\psi_t$ . Note that $\psi_t$ is again a vector with $j^{th}$ element being $p(x_t\mid z_t=j)$ . This elementwise multiplication is denoted as Hadamard product in the text. Then we can arrive at the equation (17.48).
