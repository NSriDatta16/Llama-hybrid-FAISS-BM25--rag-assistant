How to distinguish suspicious leverages?

Given a linear model and the following hatvalues and influence.measures , how can I say which measurements are suspicious? I mean which ones should be revisited/normalized/filtered out? > hatvalues(...) 0.53 0.34 0.27 0.31 0.31 0.70 0.53 0.34 0.27 0.31 0.31 0.70 and > influence.measures(...) dfb.1_ dfb.x dfb.I..2 dfb.Sd.L dfb.a.S. dffit cov.r cook.d hat inf 0.2636 -0.3194 0.4629 0.3333 -0.6360 1.2330 3.4266 0.321323 0.609 * -0.2368 0.3619 -0.3439 0.0838 0.0613 0.4313 1.8680 0.061618 0.311 -0.3098 0.1384 -0.0849 0.3061 -0.2986 -0.4969 1.9330 0.064004 0.336 -0.0646 0.0814 -0.0491 0.0303 -0.1101 0.2312 2.8601 0.013303 0.318 0.2636 -0.3028 0.3940 0.0932 0.0693 -0.6024 1.6638 0.063608 0.311 -0.1263 0.3613 -0.3031 0.3368 -0.1429 0.6283 1.0418 0.100366 0.266 -0.4291 0.8386 -1.1344 0.6684 -1.2916 -2.3642 1.3039 1.001394 0.609 * -0.0433 0.0662 -0.0380 -0.0236 0.0893 0.1949 2.9614 0.008832 0.318 -0.6140 0.2936 -0.1603 -0.8081 0.4926 -1.1868 0.4303 0.226898 0.336 0.0686 -0.2240 0.2414 0.2103 -0.0942 -0.3433 1.9311 0.033001 0.266 0.0336 -0.0321 0.0262 0.0380 -0.0301 0.0602 3.6663 0.000834 0.439 * 2.1140 -1.4469 1.2603 -1.8339 1.3619 2.9196 0.0869 0.896901 0.439 * As far as I'm concern, Cook's distance greater than 1 is exactly what I'm looking for. However, I've read somewhere that 3p/n is often employed. In addition, R provides some * besides the output lines, hence I assume those measurements are influent even though the distance is lower than 1. How can I interpret the output? Are other numbers such as DIFFT important? Note: I used tag R since I can't figure out any suitable one and because of my low reputation I can't create new ones. If you know some better, please let me know.
