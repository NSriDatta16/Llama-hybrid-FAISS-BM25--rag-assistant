Disallow automatic download of pdf files

Is it possible to disable that pdf files aren't downloaded automatically to the temporary (or download) folders of a browser. I want to do this on the server side. My problem is that there are a couple sensitive pdf files on the webserver. Many of the users aren't aware that, when viewing pdf files, they are saved locally to the computer. Is there a (or different) solution? Like embedding the pdf in HTML with some specific tags? Or creating the pdf with some specific (security) parameters? Thanks regards Patrik
