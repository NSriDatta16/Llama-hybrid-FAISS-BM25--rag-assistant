Hyperparameter Tuning in Random Forest Model

I'm new to the machine learning field, and I'm learning ML models by practice, and I'm facing an issue while using the machine learning model. While I'm implementing the RandomForestClassifier model with hyper tunning it's taking too much time to predict output. And I'm also using GridSearchCV on it. so it's take much time. Is there any way how can I solve this problem. OR, Is Google Colab or Kaggle Notebook editor can perform better than Jupiter Notebook ?
