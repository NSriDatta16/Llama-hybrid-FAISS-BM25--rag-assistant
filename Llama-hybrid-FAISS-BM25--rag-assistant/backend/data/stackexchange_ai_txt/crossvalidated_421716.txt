Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for a possibly negative probability distribution

Let $I$ be a finite nonempty set $\zeta$ denote the counting measure on $(I,2^I)$ $(E,\mathcal E,\lambda)$ be measure space $p_i:E\to[0,\infty)$ be $\mathcal E$ -measurable with $$\int p_i\:{\rm d}\lambda=1\tag1$$ for $i\in I$ $w_i:E\to\mathbb R$ be $\mathcal E$ -measurable for $i\in I$ with $$\sum_{i\in I}w_i=1\tag2$$ In my application, I'd like to run the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to sample from the measure $\mu$ on $(I\times E,2^I\otimes\mathcal E)$ defined by $$\mu(\{i\}\times B):=\int_Bw_ip_i\:{\rm d}\lambda\;\;\;\text{for }i\in I\text{ and }B\in\mathcal E.\tag3$$ If we're assuming that each $w_i$ maps into $[0,1]$ , then it's easy to see from $(2)$ that $\mu$ is an ordinary probability measure. However, I'd like to allow negative "weights" $w_i$ and hence don't want to impose this assumption. Does the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm still work in this setting, i.e. is $\mu$ still invariant with respect to the transition kernel of the generated Markov chain and does this chain still converge to equilibrium?
