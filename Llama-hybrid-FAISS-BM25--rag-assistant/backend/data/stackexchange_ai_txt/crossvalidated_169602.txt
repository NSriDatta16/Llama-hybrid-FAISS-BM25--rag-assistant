Suggest suitable time series like ML model

We have data (1901 to 2002) in this schema: Fotrnight, Temp, Precipitation, WetDayFreq, (and other env variables), Cholera_cases we have o ne such table for each village of three states . And we want to predict Cholera cases, given fortnight, village name (lat/long), env variables etc. Where, Fortnight: 2 weeks time period. One year data is divided into 26 fortnights. Cholera_cases: are the no of cholera cases in that fortnight. As per i think, time series model is not applicable here as we have one time series per village, and we can't have one model for each village. Or is it possible? Please, is there any way that we can combine time series or any other alternative approach to fit this kind of data???
