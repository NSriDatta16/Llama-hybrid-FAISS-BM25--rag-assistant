Should Blank XML Elements be Removed?

In the world of XML, is it better to leave blank elements in the file: 5 Bob 5.33 Bob is a ball. 9-5-2010 3 Mary 4.67 10-1-2010 Or remove them: 5 Bob 5.33 Bob is a ball. 9-5-2010 3 Mary 4.67 10-1-2010 For parsing, it'd be easier if they were there, since there wouldn't be a need to check if the element existed before trying to fetch it. On the other hand, the XML file would not be littered with blank elements. Does best practices dictate one form of storage vs. the other, or does it depend on what data is being stored?
