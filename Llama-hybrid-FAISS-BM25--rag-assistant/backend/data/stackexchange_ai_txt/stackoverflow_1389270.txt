help a n00b understand rails, specifically inheritance, acts_as_nested_set, awesome_nested_set, sortable_element_for_nested_set

hey there, i'm trying to implement a drag and drop interface for a nested set in my first rails project. i'm new to rails so bear with me. my code is basically identical to this project: http://gist.github.com/128779 . my problem is in the partial at this line: I'm getting a NoMethodError for direct_children which is an instance method of acts_as_nested_set , I believe. At the console if I try to create a new instance of my model, it is likewise unable to access the acts_as_nested_set instance methods, so I don't think the problem is in the partial but in the model. Again, sorry if my terminology is wrong, I'm new to rails. Anyway, what am I doing wrong? I've got " acts_as_nested_set " in my model, just like the gist example above but my model does not appear to act as a nested set. How do I go about fixing this? Thanks! Here's the code for the model I am using (todo.rb): class Todo And here's the partial: dom_id(root) do %> "tree", :locals => {:root => child}%> root is passed to the partial from the view like: "tree", :locals => {:root => @root} %> and @root is defined in the controller like: @root = Todo.find_by_parent_id(nil) Again, the code is mostly copied wholesale with very few modifications from the gist link above.
