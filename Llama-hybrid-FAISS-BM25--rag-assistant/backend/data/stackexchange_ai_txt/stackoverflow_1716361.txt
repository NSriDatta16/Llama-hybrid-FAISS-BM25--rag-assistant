You should pay close attention to the code in the demo of the Row Editor . Notice that they added event listeners to the "add", "update", and "remove" events that (in this case) called a function of the store. Not sure where your POST is coming from (since you haven't posted any code). Basically you would set a listener on the "update" event of your store. All of your edits happen locally, only affecting your local "Store" object, until you say otherwise. By attaching an event listener to the "update" event of the store, you can then have it handle POSTing the data back to the server, if the record actually changed if(record.dirty) . The "Store" receives the "update" event, and the RowEditor receives an "afteredit" event. As far as change markers, look carefully at the commitChanges() method of the "Store" object.
