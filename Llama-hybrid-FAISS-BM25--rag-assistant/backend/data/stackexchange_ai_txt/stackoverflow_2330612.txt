Are there any data modeling exercises for Cassandra like Retwis for Redis?

I'm trying to learn how to map the entities/actors/objects/things in my application for storage in Cassandra. There was a great tutorial for Redis on modeling Twitter data and typical access patterns called Retwis [1]. I've found a couple of examples for Cassandra. How did you start to gain an intuition for Cassandra's data model? [1] http://retwis.antirez.com/
