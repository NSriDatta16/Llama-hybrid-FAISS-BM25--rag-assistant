Internal state of RNN is reset every time it sees a new batch. The layer will only maintain the state while processing the samples in a batch. If you think logically if a model resets its internal state everytime it sees a new sample it would not be able to learn properly and will not give good results If you want to maintain state for all the batch please use stateful=True in the contructor this has been demonstrated with example in the link below: References : Cross Batch Statefullness
