Can a 2/3 training 1/3 test split be unrepresentative?

We often fit a predictive model using 2/3 of the data and assess fit on the remaining 1/3. Can such a split be unusual? Is it best to average over many such splits? I realize that this would produce potentially many models. But, in the related approach of cross validation, such repeated splits are advised. In that case, we fit a final model and use the results of CV as a measure of predictive ability.
