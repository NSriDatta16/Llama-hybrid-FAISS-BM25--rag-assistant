Setting the Dates properly in Orange Times series module

I am successfully using an Orange Time Series model to make ARIMA model predictions. I am struggling to get the forecasts to show at the end of series in a line chart. A 4 period forecast shows a series of 1-4 instead of the future dates. I've set the column type as Datetime in the CSV load. The Time series loads properly in the line chart but the forecast doesn't. Any help getting the date series to work properly would be greatly appreciated.
