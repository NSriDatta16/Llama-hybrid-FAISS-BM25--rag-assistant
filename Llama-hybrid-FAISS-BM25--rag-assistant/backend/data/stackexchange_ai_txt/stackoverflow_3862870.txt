You just need to include the UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction option when invoking the animation like so: [UIView animateWithDuration:animationDuration delay:0 options:(UIViewAnimationOptionCurveLinear | UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction) ]; That's a sneaky one, I know! ;) Re: The "Discouraged" tag - In general, when Apple tells you not to do something in regards to designing applications that run on their platforms, it's usually for your own good. So you are right in wanting to adopt animation blocks instead of the clunky old way.
