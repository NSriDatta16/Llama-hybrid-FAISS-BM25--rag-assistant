SEO: It's recommended to upload and put live a beta / non-finished version of web site?

I'm working on this big website and I want to put it online before its fully finished... I'm working locally and the database is getting really big so I wanted to upload the website and continue to work on it in the server, but allowing people to enter, so I can test. The question is if this is good for SEO, I mean, there are a lot of things SEO related that are incomplete.. For example: there are no friendly URLs, no sitemap, no .htacces file, lot of 'in-construction' sections... Will Google penalize me forever? How does it work? Google indexes and gets the structure of the site just once or is it constantly updating and checking for changes? Will using User-agent: * Disallow: in robots.txt fully stop Google from indexing it? Can I change the robots.txt file later and have Google index it again? What dp you recommend?
