Recaptcha with magento

I have installed recaptcha in my client's site which is not live yet But in development. The recaptcha was working fine till last week but when I'm checking it now it gives a "Input error: Invalid referer " instead of the recaptcha block. I am just wondering what might be the cause of this. Is it something to do with the public and private key. ?? Any help would be appreciated Cheers
