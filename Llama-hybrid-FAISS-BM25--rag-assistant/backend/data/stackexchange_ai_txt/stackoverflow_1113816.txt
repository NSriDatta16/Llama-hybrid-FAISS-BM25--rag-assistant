Swing UIs are hierarchical and you can only add a component to the hierarchy once. If you add a component to more than one container you'll get unpredictable results. You are correct to not want to duplicate the components, but you'll need a listener on the JTabbedPane to add and remove each component from the tab or the JSplitView as the selection of the tabs changes. tabs.addChangeListener( new ChangeListener() { public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) { // Reorganise the display based on the current tab selection. } }
