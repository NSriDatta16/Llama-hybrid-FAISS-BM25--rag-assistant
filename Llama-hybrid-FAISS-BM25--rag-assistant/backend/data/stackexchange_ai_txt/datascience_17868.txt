Usage of Precision Recall on an unbalanced dataset

I am new to data science and am working on a dataset having roughly 213,000 rows and 31 columns. The 31st column being my Response variable having values 0's and 1's. Its a classification problem and the data set is unbalanced as after I applied logistic regression to it, I got a model accuracy of 99.79%, however, by just counting the total number of 0's and 1's it would still show an accuracy of 99+% as it correctly classifies max no of 0's. Also the confusion matrix is of no help too. I did some digging up and learned to use precision recall in such scenarios. My question is should I even use logistic regression on this dataset? and then use precision recall? If anyone can shed any light on what approach should I take, that would really help me move forward.
