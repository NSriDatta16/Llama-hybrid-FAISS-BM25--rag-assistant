How do I properly add the Kal framework to my iPhone project?

I'm new to iPhone development and I'm having trouble using the 3rd part Kal framework in my project. I can't find any documentation on how to add the Kal framework to my code, so I assumed it was just a matter of adding the source files to my project's "Groups and Files" and set the Header file search path to include the new code. Is that all I need to do to properly add the Kal framework to my iPhone project? I'm getting this error (shown below), what is it indicating? Undefined symbols: ".objc_class_name_KalViewController", referenced from: literal-pointer@__OBJC@__cls_refs@KalViewController in RootViewController.o ld: symbol(s) not found I get this error when I add the statement... kalViewController = [[[KalViewController alloc] init] autorelease]; to my RootViewController.m viewDidLoad method and #import "Kal.h" Thanks so much for your help! UPDATE: I found this response (shown below) in a similar SO question ... There is also another thing to do: check in the file list when you select the "Classes" group. The checkbox next to the .m files must be enabled (which tells XCode to compile and link the file) especially if u add them with "Add existing files..." command. I checked and my KalViewController.m files doesn't have a checkbox checked (which I think means it's not added to my target), but how do I check the checkboxes next to the files I need? I'm so confused... UPDATE: Thanks to Alex's comments below, I created a new project from scratch and dragged the Kal code into Xcode, then after adding the problematic lines of code mentioned above, everything built fine.
