You need to specify a "receive" event handler for when the dragged item is received, such as $("#selectedUsers").sortable({ connectWith: ["#userList"], receive: function(event, ui) { objectMoved(ui.sortable, this); } }); function objectMoved(obj, newContainer) { /* here you would either perform some sort of AJAX request, * or dynamically add/update a form-field for POSTing if you * are doing standard form submission */ } You'll also need to attach the same receive event to "userList" Note that I haven't used the "sortable" ui helper before, but it should be a similar principle to "draggable" and "droppable", and I've based my example on what I know from these other two helpers - if it's not entirely correct, it should be close.
