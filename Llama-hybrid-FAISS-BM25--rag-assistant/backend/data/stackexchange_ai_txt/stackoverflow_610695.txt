I cross posted this question to the official bugzilla support news group (mozilla.support.bugzilla) and got only one response: if I were you, I'd name it template/en/custom/bug/create/create.html.tmpl so that it overrides the default. I didn't want to have my custom format used for every classification, so instead, I just modified choose-classification.html.tmpl to manually force the "format=xxx" into the URL for the classification to which the format applies. Not the most elegant solution, but it works.
