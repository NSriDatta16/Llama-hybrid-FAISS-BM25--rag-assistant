JQuery:Inserting big amounts of html through DOM manipulation - maintainability?

I've found good posts on good practices inserting dom elements using jquery like this , this and this It's ok when you just need to insert a few elements, but it seems to me that these option are very bad from the point of view of maintainability (Code is repeated twice, thus if any change is needed it needs to happen twice then it becomes very prone to error ), This is (just a small part) what I've got var phnFragment = " Telephone: -- Choose -- Home Mobile Work "; $(document).ready(function() { $('#addmorephones').click(function() { $("#phones").append(phnFragment); }); }); .... .... Telephone: -- Choose -- Home Mobile Work [+] Is there a better way to accomplish this? Is there a way to tell jquery to copy part of the dom tree and use it as fragment to insert? Would love to learn alternatives
