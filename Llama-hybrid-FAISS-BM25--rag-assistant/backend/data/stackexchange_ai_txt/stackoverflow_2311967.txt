Checking for the existence of FileReader is the correct way to go about this. FileReader is an official part of the File Api . I would combine this with Modernizr . Drag and Drop support is slated for release 1.2 . You should be able to grab the source on GitHub and start working with this now. http://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/modernizr.js if (!!FileReader && Modernizr.draganddrop) { // sexy drag and drop action } else { // no drag and drop support available :( } If you haven't seen Dive into HTML5 , you should definitely check out Mark Pilgrim's suggestions on detecting HTML5 .
