I would say that the easier to use and more complete (free) distros are Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu. I have been a RedHat user since... forever. I switched to Fedora when that project started (it's simply the free, open version of RedHat). Some releases are flaky, some are just fine, but on average I have had much less critical problems than with other distros I have tried. Right now I am using Fedora 10, and since my mother has been able to use it, I guess they have made real progress in user interfaces and usability! ;)
