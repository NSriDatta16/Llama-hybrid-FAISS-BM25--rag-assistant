What is the intuition behind neural networks?

Everywhere in the theory of neural networks, authors saying that idea came about by observing the work of the human brain. But I can not believe in that. I guess, everything is much simpler and neural networks is specific functions of math's series. Proof of this is the existence of the Weierstrass theorem and Taylor series, which says that every function can be approximated by certain polynomials. Am I right?
