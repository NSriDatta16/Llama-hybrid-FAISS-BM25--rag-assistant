How do I get the mean values that are greater than .5 for my model?

I am trying to build a classification model. One of the variables called specialty has 200 values. Based on a previous post I saw , I decided I wanted to include the values that have the highest mean. I am thinking greater than 0.5. How would I filter the specialty to have only values greater than 0.5 for the mean? I am trying to get my final dataset ready for machine learning. Any advice is appreciated.
