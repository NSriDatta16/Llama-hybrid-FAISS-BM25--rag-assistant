Clearly, such an assumption will realistically never hold (I'm sure there's some rare situations where it does - e.g. decay of atoms perhaps?). However, it may approximately hold (i.e. there's a couple of plausible models that might approximate the real data generating process pretty closely). Another justification for model averaging is surely to give the most weight to the model that most closely approximates the data generating process? Burnham and Anderson argue that perspective in their "Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach" book.
