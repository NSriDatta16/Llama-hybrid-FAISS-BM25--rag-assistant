Flex: change the application windows size

I am embedding the swf into a c# winform, now what I want to do is when I click a button inside the swf, the swf's size is changed. I have tried to use the stage class but failed, the system said the width/height property is not implemented: protected function button1_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { stage.width = 100; stage.height = 100; stage.invalidate(); } Is there any official way to change the application's size using code inside that application? Thanks.
