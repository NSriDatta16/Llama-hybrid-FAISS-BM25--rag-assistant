You've added a lot of layers of complication to understanding what the bool() build-in function does. Why don't you test it out directly on the command-line, before embedding it deep in your google app engine code. What you'd discover is that the bool() function uses python's truth values: http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing The following values are considered false: * None * False * zero of any numeric type, for example, 0, 0L, 0.0, 0j. * any empty sequence, for example, '', (), []. * any empty mapping, for example, {}. * instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a `__nonzero__()` or `__len__()` method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False. [1] All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true. In particular - any non-empty string is True .
