Saving dates in SQLite?

I've found this from this link: http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html 1.2 Date and Time Datatype SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values: TEXT as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"). REAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar. INTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date and time functions.date and time functions. I'm a bit confused as to which I should use. I'm creating a Windows Forms C# application and will be using the built DateTime control. Which option would best suit me? I think TEXT would, but maybe I'm mistaken. I'm new to SQLite. Thank you.
