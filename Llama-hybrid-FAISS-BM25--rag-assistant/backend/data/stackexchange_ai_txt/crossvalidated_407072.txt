I don't think you wrote your price process correctly, or else it is a bad model of prices. $p(t) = kt + b + \xi(t)$ where $\xi(t)\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ does not have a stochastic trend you need to difference out to make the series stationary. Presumably $\xi(t)$ is supposed to be something like a Weiner process integrated from 0 to t. It is also strange to let $\mu$ be anything other than 0 while also including a deterministic drift term $b$ . The important point about your transformation is not so much the logarithm, but that $\log(p_{t}/\log(p_{t-1}) = \log(p_t) - \log(p_{t-1})$ . Prices are integrated of order 1, so you first difference to remove that non-stationarity. The $kt$ term is called a deterministic trend. The simplest way to remove a deterministic trend of this sort is to run a regression of the time series on $t$ to estimate $k$ and then subtract out $\hat{k}t$ . Of course, if you also have a stochastic trend you need to deal with that first.
