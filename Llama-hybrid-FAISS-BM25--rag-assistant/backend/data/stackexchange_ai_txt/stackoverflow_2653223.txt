Website Reviewing Application/Interface

I am the technology director at a small nonprofit, and we are in the process of making a new website. We have several proposed mock-ups of different homepage designs, and need to receive input from our board members. Is there an online application/program/framework that will receive and organize user comments? I'm looking for something that will allow commenting while viewing the page, rather than just a message board or wiki.
