StackOverflow Tags Predictor...Suggest an Machine Learning Approach please?

I am trying to predict tags for stackoverflow questions and I am not able to decide which Machine Learning algorithm will be a correct approach for this. Input: As a dataset I have mined stackoverflow questions, I have tokenized the data set and removed stopwords and punctuation from this data. Things i have tried: TF-IDF Trained Naive Bayes on the dataset and then gave user defined input to predict tags, but its not working correctly Linear SVM Which ML algorithm I should use Supervised or Unsupervised? If possible please, suggest a correct ML approach from the scratch. PS: I have the list of all tags present on StackOverflow so, will this help in anyway? Thanks
