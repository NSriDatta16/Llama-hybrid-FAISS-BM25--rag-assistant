My assumption - without having a live example of the page - is that your padding and width % are calculating differently in Mozilla, additionally, sometimes Mozilla requires 'display: inline-block' in order to display DIV and A tags the same way the IE does. I would highly recommend researching the differences in the way these two browsers interpret CSS in particular their padding / margin calculations. Last note - you are embedding a table within a table which will not meet W3C specifications.
