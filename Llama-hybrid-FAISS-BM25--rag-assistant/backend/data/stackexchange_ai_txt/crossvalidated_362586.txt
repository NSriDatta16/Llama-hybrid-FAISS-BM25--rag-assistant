How to interpret Bayesian (posterior predictive) p-value of 0.5?

In the following paper found here (apparently identical to the reference below), the author suggests that "if the model is true or close to true, the posterior predictive p-value will almost certainly be very close to 0.5" . This is found in the very beginning of Section 6 in the paper. I am trying to interpret what is meant when he says 'model is true'. My questions are: i) Statistically what is a "true model" as said in the quote above? ii) What does a value of 0.5 mean in simple words? Gelman, A. (2013). Two simple examples for understanding posterior p-values whose distributions are far from uniform. Electronic Journal of Statistics, 7, 2595-2602. DOI:10.1214/13-EJS854 also available here .
