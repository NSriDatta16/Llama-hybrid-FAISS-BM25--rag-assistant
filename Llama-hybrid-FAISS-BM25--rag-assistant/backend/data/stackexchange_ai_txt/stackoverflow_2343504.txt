find id of the element where the control is dropped using jquery

I have got a table with several rows and columns. I have a span in one of the td which I want to drag. I can drag that span and can get the ID of the td where the span lies but I can anyone tell me how can I get the ID of the td where I drop that span. Now I can get the ID in firefox using event.originalTarget.id of the drop event, but unable to get it in IE. Thanks,
