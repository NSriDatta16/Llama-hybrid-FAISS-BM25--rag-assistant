getting text from facebook wall

i'm looking for an elegant way to get the whole text on facebook wall - including the text diplayed when clicking "Older Posts" recursively - without adds and irrelavant data, including friend's posts, activities like "new friend", "in relationship" etc. i prefer a way that doesn't involve dealing with facebook api, but if there is a covnvenient way to do this with the api i'll like to hear about it as well.
