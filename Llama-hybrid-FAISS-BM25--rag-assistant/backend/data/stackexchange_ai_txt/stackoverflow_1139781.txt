It's the Adjacent sibling selector. From Splash of Style blog. To define a CSS adjacent selector, the plus sign is used. h1+p {color:blue;} The above CSS code will format the first paragraph after (not inside) any h1 headings as blue. h1>p selects any p element that is a direct (first generation) child (inside) of an h1 element. h1>p matches ( inside ) h1+p will select the first p element that is a sibling (at the same level of the dom) as an h1 element. h1+p matches ( next to/after )
