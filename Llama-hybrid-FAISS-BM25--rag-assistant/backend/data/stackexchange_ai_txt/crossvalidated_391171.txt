How to calculate the Standard error on a meta-analysis

I have randomly broken down a very large dataset into 20 equal-sized blocks. I have fit a logistic model with random effects on each block with R (lme4). Say my model is simply: lmer(y ~ X + Y + (1|city/ID), family = binomial, REML=FALSE)) y = a + b·X + c·Y + random term This gives me the intercept and each coefficient, and their standard errors and p-values on each block. I have the output as a data.frame (or data.table) with one row per block and one column per coefficient and std.errors and p-values, but I can change it. Now I would like to combine all the results to get a "global" or "averaged" model. For example, for the coefficients "b": I calculate the global b as the weighted average of all b i . I calculate the standard error or p-value of the global b. How can I get that standard error of the coefficients? Any solution with a formula or an R package function would be great. How do I combine the standard errors to get a global standard error and then compute a p-value? I think it's a kind of meta-analysis.
