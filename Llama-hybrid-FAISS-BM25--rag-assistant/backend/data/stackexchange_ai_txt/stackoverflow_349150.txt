How long before ASP.NET MVC becomes widely used in industry?

I am trying to decide whether to learn ASP.NET MVC (or to spend the time learning another technology that interests me). I know that it is an elegant framework, but I am trying to assess my future job opportunities if I invest in this skill. In your estimation, how long is it going to be before demand for ASP.NET MVC developers rivals that for developers in the other top web dev frameworks? Is it a matter of a year? 2 years? 3+? On a related note, do you see use of ASP.NET MVC surpassing classic ASP.NET in the foreseeable future? Scott Guthrie says the two will exist side by side, but I'm curious just how much of the mind share ASP.NET MVC is expected to grab. I know this is a speculative question; I'm just interested in your subjective hunches.
