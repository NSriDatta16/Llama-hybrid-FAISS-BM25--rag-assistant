this paper is a small gem about fitting mixtures of gaussians to the data using Bayesian methods. Big plus: no maximising algorithms required, so should be quick compared to EM algorithm. Also paper has testing data, so you can test each method against this one if you want. And it outlines a procedure for choosing the number of mixing components The drawback is that it is based on a non-informative prior (so you must throw away info which isn't data), and a common variance (or kernel width).
