Scanning in .NET using MODI (Microsoft Office Document Imaging)

I'm looking to leverage MS Office scanning functionality in my .NET application. Although I know that MODI COM objects can be accessed in .NET, I'm not sure how to make that. All I need is scanning to file and getting path of that file. I don't need any OCR.
