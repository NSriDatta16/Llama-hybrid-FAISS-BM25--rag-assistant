Using the Cox axioms to derive unknown probabilities from known probabilities

To strengthen my understanding of fundamental probability theory, I am working my way through Professor Aaron Hertzmann's Introduction to Bayesian Learning course notes . Section 3.8 of these course notes includes the following exercise. Original Problem Derive a formula for $P(\mathbf{A})$, assuming you know $P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C})$ and $P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})$ and $P(\mathbf{B}_1|\mathbf{C})+P(\mathbf{B}_2|\mathbf{C})=1$. My Attempt So, my goal is to express $P(\mathbf{A})$ in terms of known quantities. $$ \begin{align} P(\mathbf{B}_1|\mathbf{C}) &+ P(\mathbf{B}_2|\mathbf{C}) &=& 1 && \text{}\ P(\mathbf{B}_1|\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{C}) &+ P(\mathbf{B}_2|\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{C}) &=& P(\mathbf{C}) && \text{Algebra}\ P(\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C}) &+ P(\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C}) &=& P(\mathbf{C}) && \text{Product Rule}\ P(\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C}|\mathbf{A}) &+ P(\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C}|\mathbf{A}) &=& P(\mathbf{C}|\mathbf{A}) && \text{Condition on } \mathbf{A}\ \frac{P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C})}{P(\mathbf{A})} &+ \frac{P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})}{P(\mathbf{A})} &=& P(\mathbf{C}|\mathbf{A}) && \text{Bayes Theorem} \ \end{align} $$ $$ \begin{align} &\frac{P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C}) + P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})}{P(\mathbf{A})} &=& P(\mathbf{C}|\mathbf{A}) && \text{Algebra}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ &\frac{P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C}) + P(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})P(\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})}{P(\mathbf{C}|\mathbf{A})} &=& P(\mathbf{A}) && \text{Algebra}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ \end{align} $$ Here is where I get stuck, because I don't know $P(\mathbf{C}|\mathbf{A})$, $P(\mathbf{B}_1,\mathbf{C})$, or $P(\mathbf{B}_2,\mathbf{C})$. It is not clear to me how I can express these probabilities in terms of the quantities I know. These course notes are very much a work in progress. The author frequently writes TO-DO notes to himself about things to add and remove. Is it possible that this exercise is actually under-determined? Or am I simply going about this derivation the wrong way? Similar Questions When searching StackExchange, I found this similar question . However, it was still not directly applicable to my problem. Tagging as Homework Although this question is not homework for me, I am tagging it as homework anyway because: (1) it is very introductory in nature; (2) a similar question could conceivably be homework for someone else; and (3) I would be happy with hints.
