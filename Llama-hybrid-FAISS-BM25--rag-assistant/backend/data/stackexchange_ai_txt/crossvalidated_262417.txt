Can this panel data problem be equivalent to a formulation of basic linear regression?

I have (daily) panel data for about 20 countries, about 200 days for each country. Therefore the estimation is based on around 4000 data points. The number of samples in different countries varies. Some have 180 data points, some have 220. For each country and day, I have data for y, x1, x2, where x1 and x2 are binary variables which take the value 1 if there is an event, and 0 otherwise. Events are rare, so x1 and x2 are very sparse. I ask whether the events x1 and x2 have any impact on y. I need to run a panel regression (y=c+b1*x1+b2*x2+e) if I understand it correctly. Could I, instead, pile up all the data to make it a simple linear regression of 4000 data points, without recourse to any knowledge of panel data or time series? Do I obtain the same results? Any easy-to-read references accompanying the answer would help. Thank you very much! I know regression/mathematical statistics, time series at graduate level, but do not know panel data. I know how to deal with non-stationarity, so thatâ€™s not an issue we need to worry about.
