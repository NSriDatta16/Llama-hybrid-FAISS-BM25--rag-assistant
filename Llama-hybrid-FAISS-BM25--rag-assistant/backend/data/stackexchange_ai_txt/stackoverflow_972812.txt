Syntax Highlighting in Cocoa TextView? Experiences? Suggestions? Ideas?

Possible Duplicate: Syntax coloring for Cocoa app I'm interested in syntax highlighting in a Cocoa TextView. I found several resources: approach with flex , via a flex pattern matched against textStorageDidProcessEditing in a TextView delegate. In this approach the whole string get parsed on each input event, hence performance degrades. CocoaDev has an own page on the topic of syntax highlighting : Use NSTextStorageDidProcessEditingNotification , then get the edited range, and just apply the coloring there. The range might be wordboundaries or anything; this definitely improves performance. Mentioned there: Xcode, for example, only colorizes text that's currently on-screen, and defers colorizing the rest of the document until you scroll through it. How would one implement this? Use NSLayoutManager – via Temporary attributes [which] are used only for on-screen drawing and are not persistent in any way... as the docs say, but that doesn't color the last edited range, until a whitespace character is entered. Custom Helper like UKSyntaxColoredDocument – nice, but language definition is done via property list; how to use additional/existing language definitions? None of the approaches seem really extensible or robust to me (except the 4. maybe ..). I am aware of robust existing libraries for SH like pygments ; and of PyObjC . Question : How would it be possible to use some existing library e.g. like pygments to have an extensible and performant syntax highlighting in a Cocoa TextView ? Note : I know this question is very broad (and much too long). Experiences and suggestions as well as solutions are welcome. Thanks. Found another similar thread on that matter: Syntax coloring for Cocoa app
