One solution: you could add a new label that represents "None of the above" and then you can train your CNN on this labeled dataset. Another possible benefit here is that you could use a lot more data, since lots of different images fit the description "None of the above." Maybe you could leverage all these new images to learn more descriptive features, and perhaps it can help regularize your network. A recent paper actually explores these ideas: Universum Prescription: Regularization using Unlabeled Data .
