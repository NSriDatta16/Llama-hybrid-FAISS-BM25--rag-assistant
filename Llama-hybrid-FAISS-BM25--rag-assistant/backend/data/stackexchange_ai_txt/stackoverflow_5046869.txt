I had a similar problem and found usefull the answer to "How can I create more complex appointments in my org-files?" in the FAQ at http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#Appointments/Diary You can even add exceptions for holidays. I was not able to make work the time though: when you add it the formula stops working :( 1) My example: Courses on Tuesdays and Thursdays falling in [2011-03-07 Mon]--[2011-06-25 Sat] minus [2011-05-15 Sun]--[2011-05-20 Fri] (a week of holiday): ** TEST Tuesday and Thursday in [2011-03-07 Mon]-[2011-06-20 Mon] minus holidays [2011-05-15 Sun]-[2011-05-22 Sun] If you decompose the boolean function, you get the following, which is self explanatory: 2) My suggestion for your case: a class every Tuesday every week from March to June (I took the liberty to fix the year to 2011): You might want to have a look to the newly added section "How can I schedule a weekly class that lasts for a limited period of time?", about the function "org-diary-class", but it still seems to have problem with scheduling hours :( Hope it helps,
