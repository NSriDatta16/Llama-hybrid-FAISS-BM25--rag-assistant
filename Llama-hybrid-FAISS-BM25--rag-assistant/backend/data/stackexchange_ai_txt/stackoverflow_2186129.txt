I tested a build using this test code and my own sound files, and am unable to encounter the sound lagging issue. It could be your sound files, though there are no issues that I am aware of that would cause calls to Sound.play() to begin lagging. The sound files I used to test were short (Mario fireball and jump sounds), and was unable to get more than 4 concurrent SoundChannels in use. No latency issues. Using longer length sound files, I was able to push the number of SoundChannels to 32, at which point the channel tracer code began throwing null reference errors (as would be expected since Sound.play() cannot return more SoundChannels), and it sounded pretty awful, but once the sounds completed the count decremented to zero. After two straight minutes of punishing my headphones and soundcard, I still encountered no latency. I'd suggest inserting calls to getTimer() throughout your code to see if it's a performance bottleneck (i.e. Flash Player not actually responding to events quickly) or a sound latency issue. Also, you may want try different sound files to see if the issue still occurs.
