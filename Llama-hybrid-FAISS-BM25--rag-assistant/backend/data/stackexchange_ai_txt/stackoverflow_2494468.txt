How to create an application which embeds and runs Python code without local Python installation?

Hello fellow software developers. I want to distribute a C program which is scriptable by embedding the Python interpreter. The C program uses Py_Initialize, PyImport_Import and so on to accomplish Python embedding. I'm looking for a solution where I distribute only the following components: my program executable and its libraries the Python library (dll/so) a ZIP-file containing all necessary Python modules and libraries. How can I accomplish this? Is there a step-by-step recipe for that? The solution should be suitable for both Windows and Linux. Thanks in advance.
