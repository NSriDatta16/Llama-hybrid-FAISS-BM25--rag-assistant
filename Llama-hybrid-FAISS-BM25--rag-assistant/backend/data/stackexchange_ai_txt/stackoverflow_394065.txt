First, exact is of course not a possible or meaningful concept when talking about time or space, since no empyrical measurement of a physical magnitude can ever pretend to be exact. Second, David Bolton 's blog article may be useful. I'm quoting: If this was timed with the high resolution counter then it will be accurate to microseconds. It is actually accurate to nanoseconds (10-9 seconds, ie a billionth of a second) but there is so much other stuff going on that nanosecond accuracy is really a bit pointless. When doing timing or benchmarking of code, you should do a number of runs and take the average time- because of other processes running under Windows, how much swapping to disk is occurring etc, the values between two runs may vary.
