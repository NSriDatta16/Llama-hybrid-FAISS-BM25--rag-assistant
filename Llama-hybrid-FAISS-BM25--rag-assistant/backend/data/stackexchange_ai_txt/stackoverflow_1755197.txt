Is there a way to fake a real touch into iPhone OS?

I need to fake a real touch event programmatically, so that any subsequent touch (from the users finger, for example) will immediately result into a -touchesMoved.... message rather than -touchesBegan.... Any solution how to do that? I know Three20, but I need something legal .
