One way to get part way there is to also use the "assemblies to include in coverage" option. This allowed me to ignore System.ComponentModel.Composition. However, exlcuding most of the other classes and namespaces still doesn't work. It's a little odd how when I exclude an entire class, it only excludes the methods, but not any of the contained classes.
