Advantages to rolling your own: a non-standard custom-built system means you'll be less prone to "standard" attacks (e.g.: a vulnerability in PunBB) since bad guys tend to bother with exploit-hunting only on widely-deployed systems (more return on their investment) absolute control over how your system works and looks you'll learn a lot Disadvantages: you'll repeat mistakes other people have already solved it'll take you longer to get up and running long-term it'll be more maintenance (since you have to fix bugs & add features yourself). you can't "leverage the community" -- if you choose an off-the-shelf forum that has a plugin system then there's a whole bunch of community add-ons that won't be available for your custom forum software. There's a GIANT list of forum software on wikipedia -- there's most likely something in there that will suit your needs that you can get up and running quickly.
