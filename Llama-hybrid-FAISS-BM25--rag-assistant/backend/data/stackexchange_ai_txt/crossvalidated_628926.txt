There are two remarks with the comparison using the boxplot Medians vs Means Your boxplots are plotting the medians and it looks like the case of D cover has an opposite effect. But this is not the case when you compare the means. Then you have effect sizes in the same direction. So the plot with the medians make the differences in effect sizes appear a bit stronger. Contrast Estimate Pr(>|z|) mean(gigantea) - mean(canadensis) C -12.6 0.00367 mean(gigantea) - mean(canadensis) D -1.8 0.67816 mean(gigantea) - mean(canadensis) T -14.1 0.00115 Multiple comparisons Still you have one effect size that is a lot different, why wouldn't this result into a significant interaction? The reason is that you have three levels which increases the odds that one of them happens to be different. Your case is a bit borderline. The result is not very significant, but neither is it insignificant. Remember that absence of statistical significance is not proof that there is no effect. If you would compute a t-statistic out of the pairwise differences between those three effects. For example, with one of those comparisons you get an effect size difference of $$(-12.6) - (-1.8) = -10.8$$ then you get the comparisons in the lines from the final table Term Estimate z Pr(>|z|) (mean(D) - mean(C), canadensis) - (mean(D) - mean(C), gigantea) -10.8 -1.761 0.0783 (mean(D) - mean(C), canadensis) - (mean(T) - mean(C), gigantea) -13.3 -2.168 0.0301 (mean(T) - mean(C), canadensis) - (mean(T) - mean(C), gigantea) 1.5 0.245 0.8068 The z/t-scores of 0.245, -2.168 and -1.761 are not very large, or at the border of typically applied confidence levels. Compare with this figure from The theory behind Tukey's HSD test. The individual comparisons can be significant at a 5% level. Like the individual z/t-score of -2.168 is described with a p-value of 0.0301, and this is what you intuitively see in the boxplots. However, when you look at multiple comparisons and wish to compensate for that, then you need to be stricter and use the blue or the red borders from the image above.
