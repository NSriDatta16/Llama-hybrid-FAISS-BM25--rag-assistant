If you are wondering how many records to impute per imputation sample, then the answer would be as many as there would have been without missing data. If the question is on the number of imputed datasets then the answer is more is better. Just a few (3-5 is often quouted) may be enough to achieve coverage probabilities at or usually above the nominal level etc., but with more you get higher efficiency (narrower CIs, more power) and less dependence of the results of the random number seed. Unless it's computationally a problem, I normally like 1000 or more imputed datasets for the types off problems I work on (for which simulation studies suggest 250 are often good and 1000 a tiny not better and the computational cost of going to 1000 is pretty negligible). With a lot of missingness (50% is certainly a lot), you may want to go even higher, if feasible.
