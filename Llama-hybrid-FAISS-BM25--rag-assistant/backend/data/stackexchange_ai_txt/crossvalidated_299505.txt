Best way to come up with predictive model for events in multivariate time series data

I have a dataset for events occurred in past year and other measurement around event for past one day, so if I have 10 events in past year I would have 10 days data just before the event for all the measurements. Measurements are more than 100. What kind of model I can use to predict the events? or what kind of algorithms I should try which are recommended by experts. Data is at seconds interval or I can aggregate it to any other frequency.
