I am surprised nobody said anything like "Form a Bayesian model and put your prior information into a prior distribution" -- that's what I hear pretty much as a knee-jerk reaction a lot of times. I will leave this up to others, though, and point to other areas of statistics where prior knowledge is explicitly incorporated, although in ways simpler than you have suggested here. In survey statistics, such procedures are known as calibrated estimation (and, in a special case, as generalized regression estimation, GREG). Suppose you know that you have a population in which 30% of people are have blue eyes, 50% of people have brown eyes, and 20% of people have green eyes (I am making this up, of course, but I hope you'd bear with me for this). You took a random sample, and you found that you have 27% blue-eyed, 55% brown-eyed, and what, 18% green eyed. If you are absolutely sure that the deviations from the population figures are solely due to the random nature of the sample (sampling deviations), then you can get better estimates of the characteristics correlated with eye color by reweighting your data: give the blue-eyed guys the sampling weight of 30/27 to make up for a slight deficiency, the brown-eyed, the weight of 50/55, and the green-eyed, 20/18. Such procedure would also call for adjustments of the standard errors, and you will see that they will be lower than the standard $s=\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i-\bar x)^2/(n-1)}$, rightfully so. As an alternative procedure that produces essentially the same result, you can form the residual differnces 0.27-0.30, 0.55-0.50, 0.18-0.20; form the covariance of your statistic of interest (say average height) with the sample proportions of the eye color (i.e., run a regression of height on eye color); and form the prediction from this regression at the population values of the eye color. It will have (asymptotically) the same properties as the reweighted estimator, and will boast a similar reduction in sampling variance. An ultimate Bible on this is Sarndal, Swensson and Wretman (1992, 2003) .
