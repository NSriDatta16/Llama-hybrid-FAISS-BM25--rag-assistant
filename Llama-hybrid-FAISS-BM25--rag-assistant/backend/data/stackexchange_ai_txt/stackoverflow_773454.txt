Easy way to measure LAN network speed of a partcular computer?

I want to measure the network speed between two PCs on Local Area Network. (I'm thinking of getting a Network Area Storage (NAS) device and I want to see how fast the current setup is to get an idea of how fast the NAS needs to be. I'm thinking I'll just copy some files and look at how long that takes, but I thought there might be a more precise way to measure that.
