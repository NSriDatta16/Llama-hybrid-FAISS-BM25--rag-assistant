You can write summation in detailed fashion $ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i $, less precisely $\sum_i x_i$, or even as $\sum x$. The more complicated is your formula, the more precise you need to be in your notation. For example, $\sum_i x_i$ is pretty clear way of saying "sum all the $x_i$ there are". There are also other ways of writing summation, e.g. $\sum_{i \in C} x_i$ (sum for all $i$ indexes in set $C$), or $\sum_{4 As about (3), this follows from your question since you defined $H_t$ as "average number of hours worked per year". Question (4) cannot be answered from the information you've provided in the question -- if it's unclear, e-mail the authors of the paper.
