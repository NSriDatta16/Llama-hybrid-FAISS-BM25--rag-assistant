Use XSLT to modify elements embedded in text of other elements

Since I would probably botch up the terminology, I'll explain by example. My XML source document contains elements like this: This paragraph has things like this and things like this and this . Need to use XSLT to transform that to: This paragraph has things like this and things like this and this . Thanks!!
