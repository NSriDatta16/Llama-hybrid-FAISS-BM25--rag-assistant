Personally, I'm a fan of using multiple apps as plug-ins. That way, the user doesn't have to have the same code on the phone multiple times (storage is limited, after all), and - more importantly - if ZXing improves the barcode scanner (which they do often), the user will automatically have the latest and greatest version without you having to integrate and modify it again to fit your needs. You can simply detect for the presence of the app, and prompt the user to install it if it doesn't exist. You can simply link to the pname: Uri to the zxing app, which will automatically fire up the market and allow the user to install the app. That said, if you really want to embed the code, one way would be to download the relevant source files, rename the package names and intent names so they don't clash with ZXing's code, and then simply call the intent to scan the barcode (like you would normally do when you use the barcode scanner as a plug-in). If you do that, be sure to credit ZXing for their work in your documentation, and make sure their terms of service allow for using and modifying their source code.
