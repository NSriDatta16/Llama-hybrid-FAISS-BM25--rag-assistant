For the multi group SEM, the SRMR is calculated by using a weighted average under the square root where each sample covariance matrix is compared to the model predicted covariance matrix. I did not locate a reference, but I did run a quick multi-group SEM, and then calculated the single group SEMs and confirmed this formula to be correct. Requested Addition Demonstration for calculating SRMR for two groups: $$SRMR = \sqrt{\frac{n_1·SRMR_1^2 + n_2·SRMR_2^2}{n_1+n_2}}$$ where $n_i$ and $SRMR_i$ are the sample size and $SRMR$ of group $i$, respectively. (Worked example in comments below.)
