The null bitmap is only present if the HEAP_HASNULL bit is set in t_infomask. If it is present it begins just after the fixed header and occupies enough bytes to have one bit per data column (that is, t_natts bits altogether). In this list of bits, a 1 bit indicates not-null, a 0 bit is a null. When the bitmap is not present, all columns are assumed not-null. http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/storage-page-layout.html#HEAPTUPLEHEADERDATA-TABLE so for every 8 columns you use one byte of extra storage. Then for every about million rows that would take up one megabyte of storage. Does not really seem that important. I would define the tables how they needed to be defined and not worry about null headers.
