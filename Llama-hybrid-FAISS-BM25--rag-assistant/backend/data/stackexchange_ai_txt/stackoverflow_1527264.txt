I'm in the process of building one right now. Mine supports Round-Robin , Single-Elimination , and Boil-Off tournaments! I am working on Double Elimination as we speak. [I actually need to get it done for an event we have this weekend. ;)] It also supports the folowing scoring modes: Highest Score (Team Sports), Lowest Score (Golf, etc.), Highest Time (King-of-the-Hill), and Lowest Time (Racing, etc.). http://tournaments.codeplex.com Here it is in action: http://lanlordz.net/Events/ViewTournament/4 As you can tell, it was optimized for LAN parties. It is not in PHP; but, I would encourage a port to PHP.
