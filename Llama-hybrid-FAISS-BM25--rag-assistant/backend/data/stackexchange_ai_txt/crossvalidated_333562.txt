Interpretation of a PCA plot

I have a PC1-PC2 plot generated by applying PCA to the combination of 2 sets of samples where red means one set and blue means the other set. I can see that the two sets of samples are very different since each makes a clear cluster, but is it possible that this PCA plot, having crossing clouds, tells (roughly) anything about the structure of the difference between the two sets?
