Exogenous regressors in panel unit root test

From visual inspection I suspect some of the series in my panel dataset to be non-stationary. If I do the panel unit root test on them in EViews 7, I can choose exogenous regressors under Include in test equation : specifically, I can choose either individual intercept , individual intercept and trend , or none . Holding all else equal, they can change the outcome of the test as seen here: How do I know which exogenous regressor to select? I have data on a variety of variables for 165 different countries, in both yearly data and multi-year averages. I suspect that most countries share a common downward trend in most of their variables, yet experience individual shocks.
