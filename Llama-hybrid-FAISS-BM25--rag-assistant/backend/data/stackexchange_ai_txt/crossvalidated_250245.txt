Statistical significance for analysis/inference with PCA

I've got the following comment from a peer reviewer: the interpretations of PCA were described in not objective manner. The PC values can be statistically accessed and everything should be discussed with statistically significance or not. I wonder how my PCA outputs can be endowed with statistical significance... I performed a varimax rotated PCA with SPSS and I got the loads for every PC (2) and the scores for the samples (157). Then I plotted them and saw 3 clear sample "clusters". I discussed which were the main variables loading every PC and then explained the characteristics of every "cluster" according to their relation with every PC. Whether the reviewer asks for "statistics".... what can I do ? Can I perform any statistics to guarantee which variables are loading "significantly" my PCs? Can I do any test to check whether the samples groups are really different (discriminate samples by using statistics)?
