I agree with what has been said by others. To me, the two fields don't deal with the same object: A.I. is somehow the field of making intelligent machines & tools while data science's core objective consists in retrieving information and taking the most of available data. You could therefore do data science all by yourself without any other tool than your brain, a sheet of paper and a pen, and this would not involve A.I. at all (but would certainly be painful). Besides, creating intelligent machines & tools imply at some point those machines & tools to be able to deal with data and that's where the two fields find common ground.
