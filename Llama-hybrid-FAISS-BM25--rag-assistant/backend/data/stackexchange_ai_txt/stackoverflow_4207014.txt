Manual iPhone rotation incorrectly positioned

I've managed to manually detect rotation and set my own rotation effects between two UIViewControllers. When in the first, rotating to landscape prompts the second to be pushed on with a manual animation. The status bar moves to the correct orientation. However, the view loaded by the second UIViewController is not in the position I expected it. Instead there is margin on the left where the status bar previously was and margin/space at the bottom that I was expecting to be filled by the view. (Click to enlarge. The orange box is simply to reference where 0,0 is in the rotated UIView, CustomView) The code I'm using in my view controller to do the rotation is: -(void)loadView { CustomView *customView = [[CustomView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 20, 480, 300)]; self.view = customView; CGAffineTransform rotate = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(degreesToRadian(90)); [self.view setTransform:rotate]; [customView release]; } Any help would be much appreciated! EDIT Managed to solve after a variety of trial and error approaches - answer provided below. Perhaps there's a more elegant/obvious solution though - if so feel free to provide!
