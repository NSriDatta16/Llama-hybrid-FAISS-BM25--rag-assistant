My impression (perhaps mistaken?) is that your goal is to put a prior on sigma instead of on tau (which equals 1/sigma^2), because it is more intuitive to deal with sigam. As Erik replied earlier, this is straight forward in JAGS/BUGS: tau There are various examples of this in Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, such as Figure 18.1, p. 494. For an example of putting a gamma prior on sigma, see this blog post: http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2012/04/improved-programs-for-hierarchical.html
