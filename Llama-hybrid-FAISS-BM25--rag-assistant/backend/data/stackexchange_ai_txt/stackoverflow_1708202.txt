Not sure if this solves your problem or not, but if you only need the timer to fire once, you could use setTimeout() instead. The only difference between that and setInterval() is that setInterval() repeats and setTimeout() does not. Here's some examples . [EDIT] After rereading the question, you can probably disregard that first paragraph, though the examples may still help. [/EDIT] Addressing your specific question though, it doesn't look like you're doing anything wrong. Might be a silly question, but does intervalID contain the correct value in the debugger when clearInterval is called?
