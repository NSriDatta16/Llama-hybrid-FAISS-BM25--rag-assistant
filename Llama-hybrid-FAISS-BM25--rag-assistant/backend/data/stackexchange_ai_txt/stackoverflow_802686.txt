There are (at least) two data retrieval modes for mysql. With the c api you either call mysql_store_result() or mysql_use_result() . mysql_store_result() returns when all result data is transferred from the MySQL server to your process' memory, i.e. no data has to be transferred for further calls to mysql_fetch_row(). However, by using mysql_use_result() each record has to be fetched individually if and when mysql_fetch_row() is called. If your application does some computing that takes longer than the time period specified in net_write_timeout between two calls to mysql_fetch_row() the MySQL server considers your connection to be timed out.
