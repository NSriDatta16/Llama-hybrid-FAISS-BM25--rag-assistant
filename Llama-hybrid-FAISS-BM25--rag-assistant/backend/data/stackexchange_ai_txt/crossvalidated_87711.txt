Recommendations for a short, yet theoretically rigorous, seminar or course on principal components analysis

I am looking for a short course (1 week or less) that teaches the theoretical and applied aspects of principal components analysis in a mathematically rigorous way. I've seen university courses on multivariate statistics in general or the linear model, but not just PCA. Travel is not an issue, so good international courses are welcome, as long as they are in English. Also, I do not want to just learn how to run a PCA using some software package and interpret the results; I want to learn the detailed underlying theory as well. I cannot attend a semester-long course, nor do I want to do a web-only class.
