rotating image in perspective view

I am writing an album viewing program, which is able to view photos just like in 3d space. The underlying graphic toolkit is AntiGrain. It implements a trans_perspective transformer to do 2d perspective transformation. Generally, trans_perspective transforms 2D planar onto a square "in space". I've also added methods to rotate around x/y/z axis. Basically, I want to rotate a image in perspective view. For example, in Qt's "svg viewer"(doc.qt.nokia.com/4.1/painting-svgviewer.html), the rotating Qt logo on the bottom. It rotates in a perspective view. I tried rotating around x-axes to have a perspective view, but I cannot simply use the rotation around other axes to rotate the image in perspective view, since the coordinate system has already been changed.
