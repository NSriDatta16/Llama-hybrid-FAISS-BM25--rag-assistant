Mouse to drag-and-scroll element with iPhone/Android effect

Hard to explain in a subject, I know... so I will help with a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcPIvGRwrxA Skip to 00:12 and you get the idea. I would like to be able to click with the mouse, drag (left/right or up/down) and "pull" the element (can be text, an image, any kind of div, ...) with that kind of physical "slowing down" effect. I tried with some "major" Javascript frameworks (Scriptaculous, JQuery, etc...) but I did not find any good way to achieve a similar effect. Do you have any good tip so I can get a similar example to work with?
