Asking for the distribution of the mean after repeated experiments in a Bayesian framework is actually not reasonable, as the Bayesian paradigm will result in a posterior distribution for the mean given the first data which is the most reasonable prior distribution to use when performing inference for the second dataset and so on and so forth. Basically, the resulting distribution of the mean will be the posterior distribution which would have resulted, if you had collected the data as a single large dataset with the original prior. The structure of this posterior distribution is dependent on the structure of the likelihood and to a decreasing amount on the prior function. The "Bayesian Central Limit Theorem" basically states that under specific circumstances the posterior distribution is approximately a normal distribution. You can read this up here .
