Keeping realtime views of cached content

I'm working on a busy web site. Sometimes it gets much more traffic then avarage days. The content is cached but as site's owner want to see realtime post views it has to do at least one query to MySQL per post view which is become performance problem under heavy load. All I can think of is create a different table for views and update original table regularly with a cron job. I'm sure this will reduce update time but I'm not sure if this is the best way.
