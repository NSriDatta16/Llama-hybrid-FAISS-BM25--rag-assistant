How do you write a Drupal module to access a .net web service

I'm a .net developer who needs to write a drupal module in php to access a .net web service. The php will have to do some local storage, I assume in the drupal data store. Can anyone recommend some good pointers on how to go about getting into drupal development? or suggest some good links on how to tackle the problem above? Thanks muchly. Edit: The drupal datastore will be used to store a key which is associated with a 3rd party website. This key is unqiue per drupal user. This key will be retrieved from the webservice for each drupal user. The key will be passed to some javascript, which will then do something else.
