What you have is a sequence of events according to time so do not hesitate to call it Time Series! Clustering in time series has 2 different meanings: Segmentation of time series i.e. you want to segment an individual time series into different time intervals according to internal similarities. Time series clustering i.e. you have several time series and you want to find different clusters according to similarities between them. I assume you mean the second one and here is my suggestion: You have many vehicles and many observations per vehicle i.e you have many vehicles. So you have several matrices (each vehicle is a matrix) and each matrix contains N rows (Nr of observations) and T columns (time points). One suggestion could be applying PCA to each matrix to reduce the dimenssionality and observing data in PC space and see if there is meaningful relations between different observations within a matrix (vehicle) . Then you can put each observation for all vehicles on each other and make a matrix and apply PCA to that to see relations of a single observation between different vehicles. If you do not have negative values Matrix Factorization is strongly recommended for dimension reduction of matrix form data. Another suggestion could be putin all matrices on top of each other and build a N x M x T tensor where N is the number of vehicles, M is the number of observations and T is the time sequence and apply Tensor Decomposition to see relations globally. A very nice approach to Time Series Clustering is shown in this paper where the implementation is quiet straight forward. I hope it helped! Good Luck :) EDIT As you mentioned you mean Time Series Segmentation I add this to the answer. Time series segmentation is the only clustering problem that has a ground truth for evaluation. Indeed you consider the generating distribution behind the time series and analyze it I strongly recommend this , this , this , this , this and this where your problem is comprehensively studied. Specially the last one and the PhD thesis. Good Luck!
