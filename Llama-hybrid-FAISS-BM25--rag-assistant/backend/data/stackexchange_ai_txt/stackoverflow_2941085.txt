Not at all. If most users of your code directly access the Java files and use an IDE, then they are already probably reading their JavaDocs via the hovers in the code editor. That may be more up-to-date than the version that is checked-in or that is getting built (unless you have continuous builds). If you expose interim versions to clients (E.g., you're an open source project), then providing JavaDocs rather than just class files further binds you to specific semantics. It makes sense to provide stricter control about your API and your JavaDocs essentially describe your API. If you don't want anyone external using your public interfaces (e.g., you keep them open to future plug-ins), you can't prevent it, but you can certainly avoid encouraging it by providing JavaDocs.
