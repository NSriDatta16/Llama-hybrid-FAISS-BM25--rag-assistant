adonis vs. adonis2

I am trying to conduct permanova tests on a dataset. There are multiple options for doing this in R and I am not sure how to decide what to use. What is the difference between adonis() and adonis2() in the R vegan package? Also, what are the "by" and "strata" arguments for? It seems to me like these are the most important differences between adonis and adonis2.
