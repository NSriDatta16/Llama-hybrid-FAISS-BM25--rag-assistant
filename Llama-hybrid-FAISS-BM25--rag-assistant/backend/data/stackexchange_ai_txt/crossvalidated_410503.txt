The simplest approach is PCA. Apply it to your three dimensional data, and if you're right, then first principal component PC1 should explain almost all variance. The coefficients of PC1 will give you what you're looking for. PCA looks for linear combinations $w_1 x+w_2y+w_3B$ that explain as much variance in the data set as possible. If all your points are laying on one line, then there'd be only one eigen value (or principal component) that captures all the variance of your data. So, get the PC1 and its coefficients $w_i$ will tell you the line.
