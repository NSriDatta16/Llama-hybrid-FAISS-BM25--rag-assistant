How do I feed a FFT data as input to a CNN/DNN?

As shown in the picture, I have some samples of FFT data, out of which some are from the system which are working good, and some from systems which has faults. I tried calculating PeakValue, RMS and tried to train the network using DNN as well as Linear methods, but in vain. My question is, Do we have any mechanishm so that we can feed the raw data (without pre processing) and train the system, if not, what pre-processing steps should be taken care and what model of neural network should I deploy ?
