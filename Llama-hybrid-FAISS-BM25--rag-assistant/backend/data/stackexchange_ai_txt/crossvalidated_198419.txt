A game consists of a finite number of paired envelopes. In every game, some envelope will contain an amount that doesn’t ever, in that game, have a paired envelope with twice its amount. Therefore, the idea that “twice the amount will exist half the time” with any amount chosen is false, and the paradox is resolved. For instance, if I open an envelope and see 20D, I cannot correctly assume that the other envelope will contain 40D half the time. If 20D is the highest amount in that game, then a 40D envelope will never exist in that game. This logic applies to any amount seen. An envelope such as I just described will be present in every game. The player will never know when she will pick it. In every game, the amount lost when choosing the largest amounts (that have no paired envelope with twice their amounts) exactly equals the amount won on average when trading the lower amount envelopes that do have paired envelopes with twice their amounts. Therefore, in any game, the player who trades every amount seen will win, on average, exactly as much as she loses. That, I think, is the heart of the faulty logic that leads to the paradox.
