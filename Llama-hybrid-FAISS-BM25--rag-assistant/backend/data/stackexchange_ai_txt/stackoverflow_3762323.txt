So far the only possible solution I see is to use SetWindowsHookEx . Pywin32 doesn't interface this, so I think I'll have to do something like this: Write a C extension module. It has a function like setCallback which takes a python function to be called when the drag event happens. Write a C DLL that contains the actual hook into windows. This DLL will somehow have to call the python function that is currently set. I'm not sure how to do these, or if it's correct, though..
