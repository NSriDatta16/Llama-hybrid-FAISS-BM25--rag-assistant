I would be careful about doing aggregation without paying particular attention to what the questions mean. Are some questions more relevant than others, for instance, and are therefore better measures of participation? You might muddy this information by summarizing in this way. Why not leave them as they are and let the model decide how they should be combined? Also, are you using a linear model? If so, then the summation is only forcing each variable to have the same coefficient, and this is probably not a good idea.
