I personally like paths much better. Also, I'm quite sure that normal people have become used to the "www.something.tld" pattern - it is the usual way of communicating a web address in everyday life. I would bet that the majority of people would not know what a subdomain is, or how to type it into a browser. The organizing argument doesn't count in my opinion, as any kind of file structure can be achieved with directories and subdomains alike (at least in Apache).
