Bayesian importance sampling as an answer to a "paradox" by Wasserman

Both in his book and on his blog , Larry Wasserman has discussed an example in which naive application of the Bayesian methods gives nonsensical answers. Intro The problem is to estimate the normalization $c$ of an un-normalized probability distribution: $g(x)$. The target value of $c$ is given by: $$ c = \int g(x) $$ Pr. Wasserman shows that naive Bayesian estimation of $c$ gives stupid results. I'll let you check his blog. He offers as an open question the construction of a Bayesian estimator of c This was discussed before on SE , and the answer was mostly that this is a silly example and that there is no reason to be doing Bayesian inference on this problem. But let me try anyway: The sampling solution To build a Bayesian estimator, let's first check out what conventional methods are available. One those method to estimate $c$ is rejection sampling: we generate samples from a second simple probability distribution $q(x)$. Noting those samples $x_k$, we then compute the empirical mean of the ratio: $\frac{g(x)}{q(x)}$ and obtain an unbiased estimator of $c$: $$ \hat{c} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{g(x_k)}{q(x_k)} $$ Bayesian importance sampling ? Now, it might be stupid, but why couldn't we, at least in theory, construct a Bayesian estimator that takes as data the sequence $ \frac{g(x_k)}{q(x_k)} $ and tries to build a posterior of $c$ given those ? For example, if we happen to be in a case where we known that the ratio $ \frac{g(x)}{q(x)} $ is bounded, we could model the observations as resulting from a beta distribution and do the conjugate inference. If we do not have an upper bound, we might model the observations as Gamma instead. We might even use likelihoods with no-conjugate priors and/or complicated priors. My questions are: Is this idea of doing Bayesian importance sampling something that has already been analyzed? Does this, for some reason or another, fail to solve this problem of inferring the normalizing constant?
