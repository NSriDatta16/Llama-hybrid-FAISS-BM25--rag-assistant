Build you project with TextBoxExt, make sure it compiles ok. With the form that you want TextBoxExt on, open the toolbox, right click and select "choose items" Browse to you .exe or dll that you compiled in 1) make sure that TextBoxExt has a tick next to it, press ok TextBoxExt should appear in the toolbox, drag it onto your form (There is another way of doing this, opening the designer file and renaming the instances of TextBox to TextBoxExt but manual editing of designer files can be considered hazardous by some)
