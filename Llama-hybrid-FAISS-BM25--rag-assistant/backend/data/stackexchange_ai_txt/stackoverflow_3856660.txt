Yes you should always specify the columns you want in production code (it's ok in ad hoc queries run once). To fail to do so is a SQL antipattern. In your case you have joins, which means at a minumum the join fields are repeated which is a waste of server and database resources. It isn't hard to specify the fields, you can drag all the columns over from the object browser, so there is no excuse to not do so. You can break alot of things and make maintenance much worse using select *. Do not ever use it in production code. Incidentally you should not use implicit joins. They are subject to accidental cross joins, they are harder to maintain (espcially when you need to add a left join later), they DO NOT work correctly if you use the syntax for left or right joins (which is deprecated too) and they were replaced 18 years aog with a better syntax. I would expect SQL Server to be able to send 100 fields with one larger than 1000 characters without breaking a sweat. Not sure what is causing the transport error but the error message usually happens when the connection is cut to the database.
