I have used both a 17" MBP 2.4ghz, 4gb ram, and the new 13" MBA (1.86ghz, 4gb ram, 128gb SSD). Both are quite fast for average projects, but the main thing I've found is that Parallels and/or VMWare are both very memory intensive. I opt for the dual-boot method, and both OSes are very quick and responsive. If I were avoiding the laptop requirement, a 27" iMac has an amazing display and the specs are quite nice, for win7 or OSX. But mostly, go with at least 4gb ram on Mac hardware and you will be set.
