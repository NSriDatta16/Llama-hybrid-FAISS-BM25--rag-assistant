My suggestion is Python with wxPython for the GUI aspect. I find its syntax to be much cleaner than Java's, like the way it enforces good coding style (indentation is syntax, after all), and have become enamored with features like list comprehensions. There are a number of GUI Building Toolkits available for it as well (wxGlade, XRCed) that allow you to create the skeleton of your UI via drag & drop mechanisms.
