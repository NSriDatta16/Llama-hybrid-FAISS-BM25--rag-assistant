In the business world, "normalization" typically means that the range of values are "normalized to be from 0.0 to 1.0". "Standardization" typically means that the range of values are "standardized" to measure how many standard deviations the value is from its mean. However, not everyone would agree with that. It's best to explain your definitions before you use them. In any case, your transformation needs to provide something useful. In your train/car example, do you gain anything out of knowing how many standard deviations from their mean, each value lies? If you plot those "standardized" measures against each other as an x-y plot, you might see a correlation (see the first graph on the right): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence If so, does that mean anything to you? As far as your second example goes, if you want to "equate" a GPA from one scale to another scale, what do these scales have in common? In other words, how could you transform those minimums to be equivalent, and the maximums to be equivalent? Here's an example of "normalization": Normalization Link Once you get your GPA and ACT scores in an interchangeable form, does it make sense to weigh the ACT and GPA scores differently? If so, what weighting means something to you? Edit 1 (05/03/2011) ========================================== First, I would check out the links suggested by whuber above. The bottom line is, in both of your two-variable problems, you are going to have to come up with an "equivalence" of one variable versus the other. And, a way to differentiate one variable from the other. In other words, even if you can simplify this to a simple linear relationship, you'll need "weights" to differentiate one variable from the other. Here's an example of a two variable problem: Multi-Attribute Utilities From the last page, if you can say that standardized train traffic U1(x) versus standardized car traffic U2(y) is "additively independent", then you might be able to get away with a simple equation such as: U(x, y) = k1*U1(x) + (1 - k1)*U2(y) Where k1=0.5 means you're indifferent to standardized car/train traffic. A higher k1 would mean train traffic U1(x) is more important. However, if these two variables are not "additively independent", then you'll have to use a more complicated equation. One possibility is shown on page 1: U(x, y) = k1*U1(x) + k2*U2(y) + (1-k1-k2)*U1(x)*U2(y) In either case, you'll have to come up with a utility U(x, y) that makes sense. The same general weighting/comparison concepts hold for your GPA/ACT problem. Even if they are "normalized" rather than "standardized". One last issue. I know you're not going to like this, but the definition of the term "additively independent" is on page 4 of the following link. I looked for a less geeky definition, but I couldn't find one. You might look around to find something better. Additively Independent Quoting the link: Intuitively, the agent prefers being both healthy and wealthy more than might be suggested by considering the two attributes separately. It thus displays a preference for probability distributions in which health and wealth are positively correlated. As suggested at the top of this response, if you plot standardized train traffic versus standardized car traffic on an x-y plot, you might see a correlation. If so, then you're stuck with the above non-linear utility equation or something similar.
