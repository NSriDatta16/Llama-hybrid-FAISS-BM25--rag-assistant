download a file using windows IStream

I'm implementing dragging a virtual file out of a website and onto the desktop with an activex control. How do I create an IStream on my http url, so Windows can execute the drop? The example I'm looking at uses SHCreateStreamOnFile to copy a local file; there must be an analogous function for other types of streams like http file download.
