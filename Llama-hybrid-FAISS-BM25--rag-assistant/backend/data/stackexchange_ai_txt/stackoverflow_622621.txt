The second would be my preferred approach, because timers are often not as accurate as you're probably thinking and have all the latency and overhead of the event handling system. Accounting for the time interval will give your animations a much more consistent look and be robust if/when your frame rate dips. Having said that, if your animation is based on a physics simulation (eg rigid body or ragdoll animation), then having a fixed update interval for your physics can greatly simplify the implementation.
