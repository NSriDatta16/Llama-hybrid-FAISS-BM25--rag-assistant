How to remove breakpoint from eclipse?

I am facing strange problem with eclipse [Ganymede]. Once I added some breakpoints in my code and now even after I delete all those breakpoints, it appears again when I start the eclipse. So, regularly first thing what I have to do after starting the eclipse is manually delete all breakpoints to start working. Probably eclipse stores the information about these breakpoints in some file and, I think, if I will delete that file my problem might be resolved. Please let me know if you have some solution for this.
