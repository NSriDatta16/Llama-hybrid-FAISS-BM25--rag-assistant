SyncML is a standard for data synchronization of things normally associated with someone's personal organizer. Nokia and Motorola were both using it heavily a few years ago, but I don't know its current state. iCalendar is a calendar synchronization format specification, and CalDAV is an implementation of iCalendar atop the WebDAV protocol. Google searches for iCal or iCalendar will likely turn up the iCal application supplied by Apple as part of Mac OS X. Keep looking down the list of results until you see something which looks like a protocol.
