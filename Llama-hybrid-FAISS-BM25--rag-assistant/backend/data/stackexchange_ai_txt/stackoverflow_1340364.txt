I think you're talking about writing a multi-agent system . What language are you using? Jade is an example of a mature agent communication framework for Java. The basic idea is that you give your agents 'behaviours', and these are triggered when particularly events are notified. Jade provides a publish/subscribe framework for sending and receiving such messages. Note that your agents don't have to implement advanced AI algorithms or anything like that. They can be simple producers and consumers of data if that suits your problem.
