Running a mixed effect logistic regression with longitudinal data in R

I have access to data from primary care with a diagnosis of chronic renal disease (and no stroke) and blood pressure readings taken at irregular times (some patients may have a single reading, while some may have 3-4 readings a year) and dates of first stroke. I want to examine the association with systolic blood pressure (I will include other risk factors as well). I have reworked the data to look like this (time is days from renal disease to blood pressure). patient id systolic blood pressure stroke date renal disease date time stroke gender 23244334 140 23-12-2007 20-12-2005 100 1 1 23244334 160 23-12-2007 20-12-2005 300 1 1 124334 135 NA 10-08-2007 200 0 0 447 170 NA 03-03-2011 10 0 0 My first through was to follow a mixed model with stroke as the outcome, gender as a fixed effect and blood pressure as the random slope. Within R I would write the following after centering the data: Model_Multi_Full However, I realised that it did not consider the time element of the readings (thus gradient of blood pressure ascent or descent). Is there a way to incorporate this?
