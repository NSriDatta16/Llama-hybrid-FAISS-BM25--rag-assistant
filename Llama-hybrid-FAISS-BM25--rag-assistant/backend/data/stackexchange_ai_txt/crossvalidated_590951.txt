What should the dimension of the mean and variances vectors in the VAE decoder be?

According to "Autoencoding Variational Bayes" article by Kingma and Welling the decoder part of the VAE should roughly look like this: log q(z|x) = log N(z; µ; σ^2I) where µ = W4h + b4 log σ^2 = W5h + b5 h = tanh(W3x + b3) From this description, I don't understand what the dimension of the mean and variance vector should be? Initially, I thought that it should correspond to the dimension of the input but then people told me that it's not the way the VAE decoder works.
