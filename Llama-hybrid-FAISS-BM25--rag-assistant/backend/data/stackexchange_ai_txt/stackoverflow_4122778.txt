There is no specific "correct" way. If you don't want a title on an element, don't put one there. If they must exist, you can use JavaScript to remove the title from any element you need to. The issue here is that how the attribute is displayed is browser dependent - the spec says so: Values of the title attribute may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways. For instance, visual browsers frequently display the title as a "tool tip" (a short message that appears when the pointing device pauses over an object). The fact that they display as a tooltip in most visual browsers does not mean they have to be. And there is no specific standard mechanism to "disable" this behavior.
