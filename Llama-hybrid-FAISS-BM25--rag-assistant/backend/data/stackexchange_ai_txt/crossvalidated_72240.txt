In your case, the intercept is the grand mean of attacked_excluding_app , calculated for all data regardless of treatment . The significance test in the table of coefficients is testing whether it is significantly different from zero. Whether this is relevant depends on whether you have some a priori reason to expect it be zero or not. For instance, imagine you had tested a drug and a placebo for their effect on blood pressure. For each subject, you record the change in their blood pressure by calculating (pressure after treatment - pressure before treatment) and treat this as the dependent variable in your analysis. You then find that the effect of treatment (drug vs. placebo) is non-significant but that the intercept is significantly > 0 - this would tell you that on average, your subjects' blood pressure increased between the two measurement times. This might be interesting and need further investigation.
