The problem with Java is that, while the class files are often tiny, there's a honking big runtime required to run them. Java SE is several megabytes. Java ME is made for embedded devices (think phones) and is smaller but not by much. To get Java running on a piece of hardware, someone must port the Java runtime to run there. This really is a job for a systems engineer, as I think there's some low-level hacking involved. Certainly parts of the system will need to be re- and custom compiled. As a rule of thumb: If whoever provides your hardware provides a Java runtime or mentions that one is available, all is well. If not, you need to go looking for a different solution. At one point about 10 years ago, Sun was actually planning to create "Java chips," custom CPUs for running Java bytecode, and these would have been great for embedding Java in your toaster. However, they apparently did the numbers and concluded that it wasn't a viable business proposition. So Java today still does not run every where.
