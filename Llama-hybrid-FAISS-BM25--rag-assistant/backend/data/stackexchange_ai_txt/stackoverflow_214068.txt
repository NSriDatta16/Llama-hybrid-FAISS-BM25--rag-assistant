You can get some of the information from the UserInfo table by joining AllUserData.tp_Author to UserInfo.tp_ID, but messing around in these tables is not recommended and can be very fragile, and also your queries are not guaranteed to work after applying any patches or service packs to SharePoint. I would use either webservices or the SharePoint object model to access the data.
