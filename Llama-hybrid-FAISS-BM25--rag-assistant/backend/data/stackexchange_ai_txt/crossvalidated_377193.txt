It sounds like you want the average per-day cost of a trip, which is likely more useful than the average cost of a trip, since a trip could be 1 day, 1 month, or 1 year long. To find this, sum the total cost of all trips, and divide by the total number of days for all trips. That give you the mean per-day cost, averaged over all trips. This is the first approach you outline. The second approach where you divide the cost of one trip by the duration of that trip also give you a mean per-day cost, but only averaged over that one trip.
