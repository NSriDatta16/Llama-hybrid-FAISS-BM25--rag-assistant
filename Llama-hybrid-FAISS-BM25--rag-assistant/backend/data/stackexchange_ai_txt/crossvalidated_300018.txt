Since the question is very broad and it is not clear what is your problem about, I'll try to provide just a couple of starting points for methods involving regression and time series. If you are using univariate time series - that is, you are trying to predict future consumption of energy from data on previous consumption -, auto-regresive moving-average models (ARMA) perform regression analysis with future value as response and previous values as predictors. If you are doing regression analysis to predict consumption with other variables as predictors and you want to combine this method with time series analysis, you can look for multivariate time series analysis . The equivalent of ARMA for multivariate series is ARMAV, where we try to predict future values of a set of variables using their previous values.
