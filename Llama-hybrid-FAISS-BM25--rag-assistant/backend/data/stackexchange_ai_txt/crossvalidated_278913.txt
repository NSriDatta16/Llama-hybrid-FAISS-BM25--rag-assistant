As far as the mean/centroid is concerned, getting the average of $x$ and the average of $y$ is right. Regarding the median, if what you are interested is the geometric median (i.e the point which minimizes the sum of absolute distances to all other points), then calculating the median of $x$ and the median of $y$ is not correct. The Wikipedia page on the Geometric Median offers more information whereas depending on the software you'll use, there are packages/libraries that calculate it (for R there's the Gmedian package, for example).
