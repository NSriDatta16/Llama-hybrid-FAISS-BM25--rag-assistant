Improper retrieval of Spanish text from SQlite in Blackberry

I have stored Spanish text into the SQlite database and I am retrieving the same through the java code using row.getString() method of BlackBerry API, But I am unable to fetch the exact text from the database, only the accent characters are displaying differently in to the device(BlackBerry bold 9700). Where I am doing wrong please point me to the right direction. Best Regards, Vinayak
