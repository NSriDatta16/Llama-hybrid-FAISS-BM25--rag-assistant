PNG files dragged from the Finder are not PNG data. They're files , which have their own pasteboard type. (Being files, you don't necessarily want them to be entirely loaded in memory in case of a drop, would you? :D) 10.4 gave you a NSArray of NSStrings as a NSFilenamesPboardType . 10.5 and later also provide you with an array of file: URLs as NSURLPboardType . Since you're using the older API, this document on 10.5- APIs applies (10.6 completely overhauls the pasteboard API to make it behave more like the iOS one).
