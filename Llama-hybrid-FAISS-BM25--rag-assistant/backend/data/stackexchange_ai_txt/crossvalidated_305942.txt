The answer is $1/2$ This paper has the probability density $f_n(x_i)$ of $x_i$ for the vector inside an n-dimensional hypersphere. You're interested in the vector from origin to the random point on a surface of a hypersphere. To get the surface of a unit hypersphere you simply take a derivative along the radius then fix the radius at 1. Therefore, you can use $2f_{n-2}(x_i)$ from the paper as a density for your problem and take an integral from 0 to 1: $$\int_0^1 2f_{n-2}x dx=\int_0^1 f_{n-2} dx^2$$ The equations for $f_n$ from the paper: $$\frac{\Gamma(n/2+1)}{\Gamma((n+1)/2)}\frac{(\sqrt{1-x^2})^{n-1}}{\sqrt\pi}$$ Hence, the density of the $|x_i|$ is given by: $$\tilde f_n(|x|)=2\frac{\Gamma((n-2)/2+1)}{\Gamma((n-1)/2)}\frac{(\sqrt{1-x^2})^{n-3}}{\sqrt\pi}$$ For three dimensional case you get: $$\tilde f_3(|x|)=\frac{2\Gamma(3/2)}{\sqrt\pi}=1$$ You get the mean absolute value by integrating: $$\int_0^1\tilde f_3(|x|)xdx=\int_0^1xdx=1/2$$ Two points worth noting. First, it's easy to calculate the integral for any $n$ by substitution $z=x^2$ : $$\frac{2 \Gamma(\frac n 2)}{(n-1)\Gamma(\frac{n-1}{2})\sqrt\pi}$$ You can see now that the average absolute value of the coordinate converges to zero as dimensionality increases as shown on the plot of the average vs. $n$ number of dimensions: Second, the sequence of functions on these densities converges to the normal distribution: $$\frac{f_n(v/\sqrt{n+2})}{\sqrt{n+2}}\to_{n\to\infty}\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$
