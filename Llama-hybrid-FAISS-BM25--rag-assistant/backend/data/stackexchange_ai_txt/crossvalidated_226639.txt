If you are talking about a constant bias, I think that what you intend to do is impossible. Zero correlation means that the slope of the regression line between the two datasets is zero; changing the offset (+-constant bias correction) cannot correct the slope. If you are talking about a slow-varying bias (i.e. trend, drift, smooth signal, etc.), you may want to investigate detrending techniques. First, you should guess what kind of trend you have, it can be a linear drift, a seasonal component (common in Earth science datasets), etc.. You can try moving average with different window sizes to reveal hidden trends; if you are familiar with signal processing you can take a look to wavelet decomposition. Hope that helps.
