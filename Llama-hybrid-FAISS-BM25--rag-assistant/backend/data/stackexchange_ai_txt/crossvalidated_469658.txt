First, your mean estimates and your standard errors will be badly biased if you are using any of the inferential tools which assume i.i.d, meaning your results risk being spurious . This can even be true if your data are weakly stationary, but your study period is shorter than the time it takes your series to reach equilibrium after a disturbance. Second, assuming that time series are stationary is more or less embodying the worldview that the past does not matter (e.g., the prevalence of COVID-19 today is completely independent of COVID-19 prevalence yesterday; the \$ per capita spent on addictive goods such as cigarettes this year is completely independent of the \$ per capita spent on them last year)â€¦ kinda unrealistic.
