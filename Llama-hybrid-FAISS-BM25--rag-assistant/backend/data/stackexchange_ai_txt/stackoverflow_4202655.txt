Resources$NotFoundException when running 1.6 application on Android 2.0

I've created very simple project to show the issue I'm facing. There is one activity created by default. With one additional line of code in onCreate method: Drawable drawable = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.sample); Sample referes to "sample.png" file, which I've put in drawable-hdpi, -mdpi, -ldpi. Project is defined with minSdkVersion="4" (Android 1.6). When I run this application on Android 2.0 Emulator, I get Resources$NotFoundException. On Android 1.6 Emulator everything works fine. Please help. EDIT: It looks like projects created with SDK v.1.6. won't run on 2.0 system. Does anyone has similar problem? Or maybe you simply don't use SDK from version 1.6?
