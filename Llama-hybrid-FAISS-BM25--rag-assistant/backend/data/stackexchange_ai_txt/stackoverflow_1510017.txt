Switch statements are often a candidate for replacement with polymorphism (e.g., see here ), which can result in more "elegant" (terse) code: if (!myObject.IsValid()) { DoSomeLogging(); } else { myObject.ExecuteSomeMethod(); } If you are worried about your code becomming too verbose, perhaps you should consider refactoring it into a class hierarchy?
