Beginning I think with Windows XP Microsoft began including MDAC. However, in MDAC version 2.6 and later they no longer included the Jet 4.0 components. ( Jet 4.0 SP8 can be found here ) If you are using Visual Fox Pro you need to install either the ODBC or OLEDB drivers depending on you code for that. ODBC OLEDB All of these downloads depend on having at least MDAC 2.6 installed.
