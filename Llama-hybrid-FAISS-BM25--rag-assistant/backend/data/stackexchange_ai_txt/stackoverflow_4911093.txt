Vim: change mouse click behavior

I am playing with my vimrc settings, and enabled the mouse support. set mouse=a Now, I miss the copy and paste option with mouse. Normally, if the mouse is not enabled, I could copy text with left click + drag, and paste by right click (in Insert mode). So, How to get the copy, paste with mouse enabled (with mouse click, not Ctrl + v etc). The only option I need with mouse enabled is to click anywhere in the file and the cursor points to that location. This helps faster navigation. I use putty (x-term) to connect to my debian server.
