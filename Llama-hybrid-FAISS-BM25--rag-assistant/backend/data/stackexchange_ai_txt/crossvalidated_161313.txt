Your classes are very unbalanced as 99% of your data are in class 0. By just always classifying to class 0, your algorithm is right 99% of the time and it doing an excellent job in terms of classification accuracy! However, this isn't practically useful. There are two ways to handle this in Random Forests. Bootstrap your data while over-sampling the rare class and under-sampling the common class. Use a "weighted" random forest where miss-classification of the minority class is assigned a higher cost. You can do this with the classwt option in the randomForest function.
