Is Inferential and Descriptive Statistics for Machine Learning?

I am starting with Machine Learning and many people suggested that I should first start with Descriptive and Inferential Statistics on Udacity. I started with it. But I have a doubt that is it absolutely necessary to do the courses to learn ML or I can directly start ML?
