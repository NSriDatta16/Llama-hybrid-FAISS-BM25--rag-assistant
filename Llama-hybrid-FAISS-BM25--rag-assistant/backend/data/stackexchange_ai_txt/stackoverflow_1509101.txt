Dealing with evolving (meta-) models is not easy after all. It's basically comes down to migrating data from one format (conforming to one Ecore model) into another (conforming to another Ecore model). You can apply model transformation techniques like ATL and AMW . This allows you to connect (weave) two Ecore (meta-) models (m1 and m2) and automatically generate code that transforms data from format m1 to format m2 and vice versa. (See here for some very interesting research papers on this subject.) A pragmatic approach might be to manually implement the model transformation using EMF. Since the changes between your models are simple, this shouldn't be too hard to implement.
