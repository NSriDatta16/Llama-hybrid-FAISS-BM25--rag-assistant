Using text in one file to search for match in second file

I'm using python 2.6 on linux. I have two text files first.txt has a single string of text on each line. So it looks like lorem ipus asfd The second file doesn't quite have the same format. it would look more like this 1231 lorem 1311 assss 31 1 etc I want to take each line of text from first.txt and determine if there's a match in the second text. If there isn't a match then I would like to save the missing text to a third file. I would like to ignore case but not completely necessary. This is why I was looking at regex but didn't have much luck. So I'm opening the files, using readlines() to create a list. Iterating through the lists and printing out the matches. Here's my code first_file=open('first.txt', "r") first=first_file.readlines() first_file.close() second_file=open('second.txt',"r") second=second_file.readlines() second_file.close() while i It's definitely not elegant. Anyone have suggestions how to fix this or a better solution?
