Granger causality is not causality. Granger causality is actually prediction of a time series based on distributed lags from that time series as well as other time series. Causality is the ability to infer a counterfactual difference in outcomes given you experimentally manipulate ("do") an exposure in a hypothetical research setting. Instead, if you wish to measure how "instantaneously related" two time series are, calculate the cross-correlation of the two time series. This test can be non-specific, since it's possible that two ARMA processes simply follow the same seasonal trends. You can expand on the idea of cross correlation by fitting the following model: $$E(Y_{(t)}, | Y_{(s Here the series are either discrete or pseudo-discrete and the linear combinations may be generalized to some form of GAM. The goal is performing semi-parametric inference on the term $\gamma_t$ which estimates a mean difference in the outcome, $Y_{t}$ controlling for all Granger predictive values (Granger causal is misleading in light of modern causal inference). If the $\gamma_t$ is statistically significant, we can infer that the apparent cross correlation of time series owes to an instantaneous value, rather than spurious synchronization, or a shared historical autocorrelation.
