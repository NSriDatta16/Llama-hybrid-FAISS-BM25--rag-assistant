I think it would be best to avoid embedding the PDF at all. If this purpose is to preview the data on the report, would it be possible to display an image of the first page of the PDF? Alternatively, if the purpose is to preview the data in the PDF, it might be easier to display the data as HTML. Either way, I think it would be better to use HTML or images (which load faster and more consistently across browsers) to preview the PDF and then offer a download link.
