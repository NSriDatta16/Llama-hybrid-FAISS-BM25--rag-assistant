In the paper, the state space represents the space of molecules, but the only movement directions allowed are additive edits . This creates a Directed Acyclic Graph, since after doing an edit the "agent" is not allowed to go backward. Thus to construct a molecule, we can use the notion of an "episode" as in Reinforcement Learning. In this state space, there is a unique state (e.g. in the paper "the empty molecule") from which all other states can be reached. This state ( $s_0$ ) is used as the starting point of an episode, after which actions are taken (additive edits) until the agent says "stop" or reaches a point where no other actions are possible (e.g. the molecule reached some maximum allowed size). This sequence of events is referred to as an episode, and the mathematical object that holds the sequence of states and actions traversed $\tau = (s_0, a_0, s_1, ..., a_{T-1}, s_T)$ is called a trajectory . Disclaimer, I am the first author of this paper.
