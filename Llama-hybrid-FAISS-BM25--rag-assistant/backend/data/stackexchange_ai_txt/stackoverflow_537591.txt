Send them certified mail (trackable, indicates the issue is important and demands immediate attention, and the paper trail can be useful if they decide to bring problems via their lawyers): Dear Sir, Recently we became aware of a vulnerability in your website which may result in interruptions to our service, and possibly data loss or worse. As we depend on (insert product name here) for part of our services, we are interested in this issue being resolved quickly. As such, we recommend the following security services which we have successfully used on our own projects to verify immunity to the most common issues: (list 2-3 good security auditing firms here) We periodically request that all vendors submit to third party security testing as a normal course of business, however the urgency of this particular issue is such that we felt it important to alert you immediately. We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Sincerely, (IT manager, xyz corp) Don't specify the vulnerability. This will give them a reason to do a full security audit, rather than just sending your concern to the dev guy, fix that one thing, and then claim a clean bill of health. If they ask, I'm sorry, for our own and your legal protection we aren't allowed to divulge particular details of any security issue to anyone except under NDA and mutual liability waiver. It is of a sufficiently simple nature that a competent security firm will resolve it. If the product you're using is of a financial nature, then you can simply demand that they submit to a "seal of approval" type program from a major auditing firm (verisign, for instance) and discontinue service without that security audit seal. -Adam
