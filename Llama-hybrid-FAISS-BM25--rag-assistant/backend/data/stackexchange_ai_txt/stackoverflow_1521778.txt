Is there an post Drag and Drop event?

I'm trying to implement drag and drop capability into a custom data grid control. In the end, I'd like to be able to drag rows between 2 of these custom data grids. I believe I have everything working as expected. However, I need to do some cleanup in the drag and drop source control. Specifically, I need to refresh the grids after items are moved. How do I do this? If it make any difference, these grids are not bound to a data source (for other reasons I won't explain).
