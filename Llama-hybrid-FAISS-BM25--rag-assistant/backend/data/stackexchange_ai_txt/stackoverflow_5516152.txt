flashvars problem with cache buster

I am playing with a flash media player in rails app. The problem is that flashvars parameter is very dumb. Rails makes cache busters for url and it prevents flash from working. flashvars="file=/my/media.flv?123456&autostart=false&repeat=none" I had to change it to flashvars="file=/my/media.flv&autostart=false&repeat=none" Now I know how to work around but it feels very ad hoc. How do I fix it more elegantly? Sam
