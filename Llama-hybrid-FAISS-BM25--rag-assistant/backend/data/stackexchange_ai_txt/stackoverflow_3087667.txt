Necessity of having license information present in all code revisions

I'm considering posting some code on github . Older revisions of the code don't have a COPYING file or other licensing information in them. What's the effect of posting this publicly? Would people be able to copy and use that code freely without adhering to any license constraints? Although there doesn't appear to be a "default license" applied to projects posted on github, their Terms and Conditions document has this to say: ...by setting your pages to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your Content. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories. Which is a bit ambiguous, to say the least: does forking a repository, in itself, enable the forker to do as she wishes with the therein-contained code, or is this concept orthogonal to the actual modification of the code? edit: added this paragraph: And on a related note: can people attempt to use versions of the code which don't have a warranty disclaimer (eg This program is distributed . . . WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY ), and then sue me when it fails? And my main question : Should I run git filter-branch to add a COPYING file to all revisions before pushing to github? This is a bit of a hassle, as it will invalidate commit id references and require that I re-clone any backup repos.
