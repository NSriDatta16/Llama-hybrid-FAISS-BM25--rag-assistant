Would something along the following lines be of use... SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1 AS prio, * FROM my_table M1 JOIN my_table M2 WHERE M1.userID = supplied_user_id AND M1.userGender <> M2.userGender AND M1.userAge - 5 >= M2.userAge AND M1.userAge + 15 M2.userGender LIMIT TO 2 ROWS) ORDER BY prio LIMIT TO 2 ROWS; I haven't tried it as I have no SQL Server and there may be dialect issues.
