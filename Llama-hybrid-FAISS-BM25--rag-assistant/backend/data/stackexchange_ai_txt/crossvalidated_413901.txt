Fit and Predict Arima in R

I am trying to fit a Arima model in R with an independent variable (ARIMAX). The model fit data contains both positive and negative numbers. The issue is that after fitting the model, the predict function throws out numbers which are not even close to data that was used to fit the model. # Sample Data y fore $`pred` Time Series: Start = 11 End = 20 Frequency = 1 [1] -0.03206240 -0.03614031 -0.03341961 -0.03128313 -0.03206240 -0.02722754 [7] -0.03369281 -0.03468892 -0.03361601 -0.03167025 Not sure why all the values from predict are only negative (while the original y has both positive and negative) and so off from the original y values. Please advise. Thanks!
