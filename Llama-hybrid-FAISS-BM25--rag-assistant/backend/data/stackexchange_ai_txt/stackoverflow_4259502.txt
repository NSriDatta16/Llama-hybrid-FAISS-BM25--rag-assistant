Your causes all seem plausible, but I think they're going to be difficult to troubleshoot by adding more code, especially the first two causes. I think you're going to need to do some more old-fashioned troubleshooting so that you can replicate the issues your users are experiencing. Perhaps in the web-app have a "Trouble launching?" link that a user who experienced one of the first two issues could use to report the issue, because they should be able to readily detect that the app didn't launch. To eliminate the third cause, don't have the apps themselves connect directly to the database, but instead only have them communicate back over HTTP to the web app that launched the JNLP - you can be reasonably assured that they have connectivity to that server. Then have that web-app insert the appropriate database records.
