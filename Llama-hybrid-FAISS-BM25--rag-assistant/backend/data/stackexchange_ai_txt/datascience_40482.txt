Prediction: plugin a corelation table (neuron) into a Time-Series Neuron in Keras/ TF

i am adding more details I have a time series of Babies (1,2,3) showing how many problem they have each week (Born week 1 to week 80) and in which organ (14 organ). There is a separate numeric time-free correlation tables for babies/organs. showing Xtype blood cells per organ per baby -> Causes problems My aim is to predict how many problem will NewBaby (Baby4) have, in which organ, per week Predict this: Week1: 1 problem | Stomach Week1: 1 problem | Liver Week2: 1 problem | Stomach .. TIME_SERIES_INPUT ------> LSTM (RNN?) -------\ -------------------------------------------------------------------> MERGE ---> AUXILIARY_INPUTS --> [do something] ----------/* How can I model this problem with Keras/TF? To be specific firstly should I modify the dataset to include correlation tables. Or can I plug a model into LSTM? I have seen some examples on this board but they are mostly CNN that does not apply to my data set Ps I can insert whole dataset if needed Thanks DataSet Looks like Week Baby Age Organ Date IssueFound Problem Type 2 Baby2 A0 Organ2 06/24/16 1 F 2 Baby3 A0 Organ11 05/01/17 1 F 2 Baby3 A0 Organ11 05/02/17 1 F 2 Baby3 A0 Organ13 05/03/17 1 F 2 Baby3 A0 Organ13 05/05/17 1 F 3 Baby2 A0 Organ12 06/29/16 1 F 3 Baby2 A0 Organ2 07/01/16 1 F 4 Baby3 A0 Organ13 05/18/17 1 F 4 Baby3 A0 Organ2 05/19/17 1 F time-free Co relation Table looks like New X-Type Blood Cell per Organ per baby Organ Baby1 Baby2 Baby3 NewBaby Bladder Organ1 288 247 97 253 Brain Organ2 2548 1972 992 251 Ears Organ3 32 254 162 155 Eyes Organ4 111 0 459 -89 Heart Organ5 42 1214 0 142 Kidney Organ6 4 188 186 -87 Kidneys Organ7 806 1764 796 153 Liver Organ8 658 657 -20 0 Lung Organ9 0 484 0 0 Nose Organ10 3328 9940 4435 3223 Pancreas Organ11 11 389 207 194 Skin Organ12 664 766 164 -145 Stomach Organ13 246 -71 0 -70 Tongue Organ14 1403 0 33 0
