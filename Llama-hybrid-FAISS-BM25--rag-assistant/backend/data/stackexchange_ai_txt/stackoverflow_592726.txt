Where I work we do exactly this, and put the hostname of the RMI registry in the JNLP as per Jonik's answer. In Java 6u10 or u11 Sun closed several security holes with Webstart, including an issue with dynamic JNLP. In order to satisfy all the security warnings you must place an identical copy of your JNLP in the main jar of your program. This is to prevent third parties injecting extra jars or parameters into your code. Programs will run without it, but users will be shown a trust notice. We do know the address at build time, but had other dynamic JNLP issues and so had to resort to providing a JNLP and a JAR for each possible runtime set-up. This was more of a deployment headache for us, rather than an issue for customers, but if you're signing your distribution then it's worth knowing.
