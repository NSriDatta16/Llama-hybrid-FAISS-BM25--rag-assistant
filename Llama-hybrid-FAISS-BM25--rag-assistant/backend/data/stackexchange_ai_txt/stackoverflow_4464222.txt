What are some ways I can draw attention to a UIBarButtonItem when the text changes?

I'm building an iPhone game and I have a UIBarButtonItem that will provide the user with a hint to solve the puzzle when pressed. When the user earns a hint, the text on the UIBarButtonItem is updated to show the current number of hints available. The problem is, the hint count starts at zero and when I update the text and play a little notification sound, it's still not easily recognizable to the user that they've earned a hint as they're learning to play the game. As such, I'd like to draw some attention to the UIBarButtonItem when I play the notification sound and update the text. How can I draw attention to a UIBarButtonItem in the nav bar? Is there a way to make it flash? Can I use Core Animation to animate the UIBarButtonItem? Do I have to create a custom UIButton view to accomplish this? I'd prefer not to since that route involves making more art. Thanks so much in advance for your wisdom!
