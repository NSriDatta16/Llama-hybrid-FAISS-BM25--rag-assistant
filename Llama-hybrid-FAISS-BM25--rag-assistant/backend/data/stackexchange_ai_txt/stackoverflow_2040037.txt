On iPhone OS 3.0 and later, you can get the rounded corners easily by setting the borderRadius property of the view's layer. view.layer.cornerRadius = 5; You will need to #import to get the headers for the CALayer class. You are right about the transparency, just use a color with an alpha component, and make sure that the view is not marked as opaque. As for a highlight, you could either do it programmatically or using an image. If doing it programmatically, you will have to use Core Graphics and do some drawing with CGGradient . If using an image, take a look at UIImage's stretchableImageWithTopCapHeight:leftCapWidth: ; you can resize an image without distorting the corners.
