Why not just assign the long calculation as a property, and calculate it on initialization? If you need to calculate it again (e.g. you change the engine) then and only then would you need to call it again. class Car: def __init__(self, engine, chassis): self.engine = engine self.chassis = chassis self.avg_accel = self.average_acceleration() def average_acceleration(self): # !!! this calculations are actually very time consuming return self.engine.capacity / self.chassis.weight def velocity(self, time): # here calculations are very simple return time * self.avg_accel def distance(self, time): 2 + 2 # some calcs integrate(velocity, 2000) 2 + 2 # some calcs def change_engine(self, engine): self.engine = engine self.avg_accel = self.average_acceleration()
