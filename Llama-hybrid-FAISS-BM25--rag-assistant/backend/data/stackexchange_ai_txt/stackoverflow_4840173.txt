Mapcar and assoc

I would like to do: (mapcar #'assoc '(a s) '((a . b) (c . d) (s . f))) and have it return ((A . B) (S . F)) Which seems pretty reasonable, considering (assoc 'a '((a . b) (c . d) (s . f))) returns (A . B) and (assoc 's '((a . b) (c . d) (s . f))) returns (S . F) . But alas it does not work: *** - ASSOC: A is not a list The following restarts are available: ABORT :R1 Abort main loop Any thoughts?
