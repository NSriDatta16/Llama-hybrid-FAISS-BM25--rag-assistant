Rails 3 - select with Include?

Here is a nested select with include: @items = Item.where("complete = ?", true).includes( :manufacturer, {:order=>[:supplier, :agent] }) This is a taxing query as it pulls 1000s of rows of data from all the above included tables. How can I get the query to only select specific fields? user.name, user.created_at order.created_at supplier.name agent.name manufacturer.name
