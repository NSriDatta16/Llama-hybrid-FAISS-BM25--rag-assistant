Nice article. I too am looking for an equivalent of ondrop/ondragdrop in Safari. However, there is a possible workaround for "internal" drag-drop case, i.e. the drag source and drop target are in the same document. IE supports the events ondragstart, ondrag and ondragend on the drag source element. Safari 3 fires these as well. Firefox3 fires ondrag and ondragend, but not ondragstart (though the documentation suggests that it should). Anyway, depending on your scenario, you may be able to use ondragend to detect when the drag-drop operation is completed.
