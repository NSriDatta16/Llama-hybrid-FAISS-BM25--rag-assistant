How to statistically categorize a list of reasons?

I am working with call center data, one of the variables available is "Reason" which is a description of the reason the customer called. There is 40 different reasons that the agent can choose from. There is also a customer satisfaction field that is binary of yes/no. I want to use statistics to categorize these reasons (40) into around 5 categories based on their effect on customer satisfaction. How can I do this?
