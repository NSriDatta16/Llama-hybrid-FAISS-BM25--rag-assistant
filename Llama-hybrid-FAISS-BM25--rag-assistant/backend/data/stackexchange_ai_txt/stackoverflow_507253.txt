Excel formula to reference 'CELL TO THE LEFT'

I'm trying to do conditional formatting so that the cell color will change if the value is different from the value in the cell left of it (each column is a month, in each row are the expenses on certain object. I want to monitor easily changes in prices over months.) I can do it per cell and format-drag it, but I would like a general formula to apply to the whole worksheet.
