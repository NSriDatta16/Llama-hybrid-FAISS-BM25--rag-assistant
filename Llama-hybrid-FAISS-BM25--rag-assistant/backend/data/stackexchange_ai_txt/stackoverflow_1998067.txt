I do sortable formsets in one of my apps. I use this jQuery drag and drop plugin: http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/ I bind the plugin's onDrop event to a function that resets the value of all "order" fields. Additionally, I pass initial data to the formset so the formset's extra "order" fields always have a value in cases where there is no javascript available - the user won't be able to re-order rows, but they can edit and post changes without the null error you described.
