Jon's answer seems to be pretty complete to me (plus delegates) but I think what fundamentally seperates a good programmer from an average one is answering the why questions rather than the how. It's great to know how garbage collections works and how value types and reference types work, but it's a whole other level to understand when to use a value type vs. reference type. It's the difference between speaking in a language vs. giving a speech in a language (it's all about how we apply the knowledge we have and how we arrive at those decisions).
