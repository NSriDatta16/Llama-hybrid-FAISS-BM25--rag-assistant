Has anyone been to the Pragmatic Studio iPhone course, and if so, is it worth it?

I am thinking of going to the pragmatic studio iphone course, but am a little wary due to the price. I currently do contract work and therefore don't have a company that will pay the course costs for me, other than mine of course. After travel, food, hotel and currency conversion the course runs up to over 3500. Is it worth it?
