You've already figured out you can use ADD to shift left (adding a value to itself). So you can repeatedly shift and then AND with a constant with 1 high bit set to extract the bits from highest to lowest. You can build OR out of AND and NOT (via DeMorgan's law), so you can recombine those bits from lowest to highest by or-ing together single bits starting with a constant 1 and shifting that left as you go, which will give you the reversed bit sequence. Turning that into a recursive process is fairly straight-forward
