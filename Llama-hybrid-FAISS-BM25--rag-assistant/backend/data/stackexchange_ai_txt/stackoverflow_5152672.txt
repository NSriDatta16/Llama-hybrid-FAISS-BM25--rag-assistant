There are multiple ways I can think of solving this, depending on your situation you could select the best suited to you. 1. Databinding is one elegant solution when managing the state (visibilit or other properties) of multiple control's depend on a different object. Additional details in this question 2. You could write different functions if the combination of the states is only limited to couple of cases to at most 4-5 cases. That ways you can still reason about the methods which set the state depending on the object you are depending on. Ex: Basic_Editing, Advaced_Editing, Custom_Editiong etc. 3. If the number of cases are limited you could create multiple forms (User controls) and load them on demand based on the state of the dependent property (or object you are talking about). Just having a bunch of if else's makes your code harder to maintain, or comprehend, logically group the states so that 1. You could reason about it later, 2.Someone else understands the reason/logic 3.When there is a change required it can be localized to one of these modular methods (techniques) reducing the time to fix, and test.
