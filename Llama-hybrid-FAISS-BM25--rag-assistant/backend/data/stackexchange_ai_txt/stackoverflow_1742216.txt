WPF Make Interactive Charts

I'm using System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit for charts in my WPF application. The code for chart is: I want the user be able to click line series at any point and drag it to up or down and so the Value will be changed ? This is like a two way data binding but I don't know how can I do it.
