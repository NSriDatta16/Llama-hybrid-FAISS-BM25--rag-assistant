Error handling with PHP classes

I'm working on my first "public" class, meaning that i will release it under the GPL for everyone. I'm giving extra-attention to documentation, however, i gave zero attention to error handling. How do you guys suggest that i do that? Throw exceptions? I never worked with error handling before, just the basic try catch with PDO and others.
