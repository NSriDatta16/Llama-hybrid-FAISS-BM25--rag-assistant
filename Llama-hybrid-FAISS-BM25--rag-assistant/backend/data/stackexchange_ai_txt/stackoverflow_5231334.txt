What does this quote about char pointers mean?

I've read a paragraph but I can't understand what does it mean....can anyone please explain? the paragraph is : processing a single character as a char*string can lead to a fatal runtime error. a char* string is a pointer probably a large integer. however a character is a small integer(ascii 0-255). on many systems, dereferencing a char vaalue causes an error, because low memory addresses are reserved for special purposes such as operating system interrupt handlers- so "memory violations" occur.
