You can leverage metadata extractors. The main purpose is to extract metadata from binary files during upload. There are lots of built-in metadata extractors, just look for implementers of interface org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata.MetadataExtracter . There are different extractors that can extract creation date and set it as cm:created on Alfresco node. You can enable metadata extraction by applying it as a rule on a space, look for action named Extract Common Metadata in the actions drop-down-box while creating the rule.
