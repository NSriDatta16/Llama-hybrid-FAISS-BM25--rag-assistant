If you're using jquery, you could store the basket as a json array inside the $('body').data() element (or actually as i do, under a div called '#storage'). this works as a fantastic local storage mechanism, tho' would only be relevant to the current page that the user was on and would be cleared on moving to subsequent 'new pages' unless of course, your design was such that the shopping page was ALWAYS the same page and only refreshed by ajax methods. this way, you could continually append/modify the json structure on the 'worksurface' page. i use this technique for a different application of the logic, but virtually for the same reason. here's a snippet of the kind of thing i do: /* example of data params key*/ var keyParams = "Data-Search-type-" + $('#searchtype').val(); /* add json to body with key*/ $('#storage').data(keyParams, jsonData); /* get same data back later */ var jsonData = $('#storage').data(keyParams); When i 'save' the data to the server, i then clear the data() element back to null. There is of course the other option of localstorage itself which can be used well, especially in disconnected environments (such as mobile apps). another way to skin the many skinned cat!!
