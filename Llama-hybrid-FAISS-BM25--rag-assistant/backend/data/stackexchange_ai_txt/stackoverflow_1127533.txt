First, a bit of definition (not clinical defs, just my own separation-of-ideas nomenclature): ========== Initial table: The day-to-day table that you add to and retrieve from. Audit table: The table holding multiple versions of any record in its related Initial table. ========== If the business use of an audit table is to be able to tell what a record looked like at any point in time, I'd say it should be constructed identically to the initial table (plus the addition of a unique audit-ID). If it is more important to know what a field value was at any point in time (as opposed to the record as a whole) is, then try the more abbreviated table-field-value-date approach. Please note that it takes a lot more work to reconstruct the entire record with this approach, so forget it if whole-record retrieval might ever become necessary. Overall, I think that in most cases, fast performance using the most recent version of a record are more important than performance using audit data. Consequently, I'd suggest creating the audit table identically to the initial table (plus autonumbered surrogate key), and trigger an insert of the same data into the audit table when added to the initial table. This keeps the number of records relatively static in the initial table, and performance doesn't degrade over time.
