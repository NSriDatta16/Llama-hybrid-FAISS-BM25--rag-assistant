Just because you can do it in the spec, doesn't mean that you should. For example, Gmail will not accept that comment format for address. Second, (to your last point), paren-comments being allowed in email addresses doesn't mean that they work for URLs. Finally, my advice: I'd tailor the completeness of your validator to your requirements. If you're writing a new MTA (mail transfer agent), you'll probably have to do it all. If you're writing a validator for a user input, keep it simple: look for one @, make sure you have stuff before (username) and after (domain name), make sure you have a "dot" in the hostname string, [extra credit] do a DNS lookup of the hostname to make sure it resolves.
