not sure if it is 'best practice' but I also put mine in the environment.rb as a constant and I am using SVN source control with a propset to update the revision number in the file upon checkin # environment.rb APPLICATION_VERSION = '1.3.0.$Revision: 203 $' the only downside to this is that you must modify this file to get the revision to update, regular commits to other files will not cause the update for display in the view # application_helper.rb def application_version return APPLICATION_VERSION.gsub('$Revision: ', '').gsub(' $', '') end kinda funky but it works info on svn propset svn:keywords "Revision" - if interested? http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/how-to-add-revision-number-id-automatically-to-subversion-files-in-two-simple-steps/
