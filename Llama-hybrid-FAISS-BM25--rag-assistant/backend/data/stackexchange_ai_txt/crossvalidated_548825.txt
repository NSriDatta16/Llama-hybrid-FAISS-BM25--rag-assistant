Lasso regression non-zero interaction terms with zero main terms

I have performed lasso regression for variable selection on a glm. The result is that there is an interaction term (weight*carage) that is significant, however the main values are not (using 1 sd lambda as the optimal penalty parameter). I believe you are meant to include the main effects if the interactions are significant, despite what the lasso regression says. My question is, what is a valid way of doing this? Could I re-fit a glm using just the parameters the lasso regression selected, plus the main effects? Unfortunately my code is not reproducible as we were given a data set for an assignment. But I have attached an image just for context. eg. model1
