Ok, guyes I am putting the fragment of the code. The problem is that when I use XPath: //@* I get all the list correctly. Also I tried //@class and it returned the all the class values - OK. But when I put //span[@class='value'] i got blank list. Also I've tried several variations and it seems that when I put attribute equal to something //title[@type='html'] I am getting blank list. 2011-01-20T08:33:23Z grgrgr Blog post : Estiatoria Due: 20 Jan 11
