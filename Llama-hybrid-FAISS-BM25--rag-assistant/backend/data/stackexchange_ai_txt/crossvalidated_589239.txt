Modelling probabilities of a sum of binomials with different probabilities and trials

I have the following example data, where each row is an independent observation: A B C Y 10 22 6 2 4 60 2 0 12 8 10 3 ... $A$ , $B$ , $C$ and $Y$ are all positive integers. The variables $A$ , $B$ and $C$ represent the number of samples from a corresponding Bernoulli distribution: $\textrm{Bernoulli}(p_A)$ , $\textrm{Bernoulli}(p_B)$ , and $\textrm{Bernoulli}(p_C)$ respectively. Here, $p_i \ne p_j, \forall i,j \in \{A, B, C\}, i \ne j$ and $p_i$ is the same for each observation. The variable $Y$ represents the number of successes across all $A + B + C$ trials, that is: $$Y = Y_A + Y_B + Y_C$$ where $Y_A$ , $Y_B$ and $Y_C$ represent the number of successes for the $A$ , $B$ and $C$ trials respectively (i.e. they are Binomially distributed). However, $Y_A$ , $Y_B$ and $Y_C$ are unknown. I am trying to model the $p_i$ parameter values in a Bayesian manner. The problem I see is that the $Y_i$ random variables have a different number of trials depending on the data observation. I take this to mean that rather than modelling $Y_i \sim \textrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i)$ I would actually have to model $Y_{ij} \sim \textrm{Binomial}(n_{ij}, p_i)$ , where $j$ corresponds to the index of the observation. Therefore, I would have a different random variable for each row in the data, which is not feasible given there would (in general) only be a single observation per distribution. Am I correct about this assumption? Regardless, how should I go about generating distributions for $p_i$ (perhaps by fitting a Beta distribution to each $p_i$ )? Is it even possible, given the data? I am very new to probabilistic modeling so I apologize if this problem is trivial or my understanding of key concepts is incorrect.
