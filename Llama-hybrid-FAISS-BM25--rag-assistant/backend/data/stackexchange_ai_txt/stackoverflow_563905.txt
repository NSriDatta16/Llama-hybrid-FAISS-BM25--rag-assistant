JavaScript is single-threaded, which means when you call a function, it blocks until it returns. When you call alert(), that passes control to the browser which decides how to handle it. It is not Javascript which is popping the UI dialog, it is the browser. alert() does not return until the browser receives the "OK" event and returns control. The javascript thread is halted until that happens. So for at least two different reasons stated in the above paragraph, the answer is no :)
