If the question is how to use pickle, than that's the answer import pickle class Model(object): #some crazy array of data def getClass(sentiment) #return class of sentiment def loadModel(filename): f = open(filename, 'rb') res = pickle.load(f) f.close() return res def saveModel(model, filename): f = open(filename, 'wb') pickle.dump(model, f) f.close() m = loadModel('bayesian.pickle') if it's a problem to load large object in such a way, than I don't know whether pickle could help
