Paragraph with normal opacity within greyed-out div

I am greying out a web page when a user doesn't have permission to access it. In order to do that, I am placing a div with background-color white and a lowered opacity on top of the web page. I want to write some words in that div with the words having a normal opacity. As of now, the greyed out background is showing correctly. However, I can't seem to get the words to be a regular opacity. The derived styles on Firebug show the opacity on the words as normal, but it clearly isn't. What am I doing wrong? The HTML: I'm sorry. You do not have permission to access this page. The CSS: div.noPermission { background-color: white; filter:alpha(opacity=50); /* IE */ opacity: 0.5; /* Safari, Opera */ -moz-opacity:0.50; /* FireFox */ z-index: 20; height: 100%; width: 100%; background-repeat:no-repeat; background-position:center; position:absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; } div.noPermission p{ color: black; margin: 300px auto auto 50px; text-align: left; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; display: block; width: 250px; }
