For time series stationarity means that the joint distribution of variables in the sequence depends only on their separation in time and not on the actual time. This implies that the mean and variance are constant and the covariance between the variables at two time points depends only on the difference in time between the points. With spatial data it would mean that the distribution of a set of points on a grid only depend on how they are separated. So if you shift a set of points k units in the x direction and m units in the y direction their joint distribution will not change.
