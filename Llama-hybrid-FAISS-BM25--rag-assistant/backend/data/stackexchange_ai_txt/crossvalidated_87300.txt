Autoregressive moving average or feed-forward neural network

When we have to make a forecast, the books tell us that the main method is the autoregressive moving average model. In my opinion there is another big tool, the feed forward neural network (FFNN). So I think that we could use two main tools: Autoregressive moving average Feed forward neural network Of course there must be differences, but I am not an expert. Who, having sufficient experience in these two methods, can explain to me the differences between these two methods on making predictions?
