overwritten git repo with old version of git repo, game over?

Have I totally lost all my commits? I know it was dumb, and for that I am sorry, but it was an innocent mistake, not thinking a workflow through properly. EDIT the overwrite was a manual drag and drop, no terminal commands entered. I am on a mac. I have time machine, and can retrieve my old new repo (if you know what I mean, my head is melting), but can I merge them (have have since made changes, deadline looking) or should I just reinstate the backup in it's entirety?
