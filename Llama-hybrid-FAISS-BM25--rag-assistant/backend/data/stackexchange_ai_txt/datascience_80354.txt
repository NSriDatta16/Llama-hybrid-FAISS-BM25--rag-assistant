What is major difference between different dimensionality reduction algorithms?

I find many algorithms are used for dimensionality reduction. The more commonly used ones (e.g. on this page ) are: Principal component analysis (PCA). Factor Analysis Independent component analysis (ICA). Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF or NNMF) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) How does one choose between these algorithms?
