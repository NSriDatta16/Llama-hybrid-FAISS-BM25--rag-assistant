How do Bayesians deal with the fact that the treatment of fixed parameters as random variables can lead to inappropriate subjective probabilities?

Let's assume the tossing of an unfair coin is modeled by a random variable X taking the values head and tail. You know that the objective probability of the coin showing up head is either $p=0.4$ or $p=0.6$ and that no other value is possible. Further, you have reason to believe that $p=0.6$ is very likely to be true. Following the Bayesian methodology, you could express your belief by the (subjective) prior distribution $$\begin{align} P(p=0.6)&=0.9 \\ P(p=0.4)&=0.1\text{,} \end{align}$$ hence treating $p$ as a random variable. Once you do this, marginalization in combination with Lewis's principle implies that your subjective probability for the coin showing up head should be $$P(X=\text{head})=0.6 \times 0.9+0.4 \times 0.1=0.58\text{,}$$ which is rather inappropriate even as subjective probability, because after all you know that $p$ can either take the value $0.4$ or $0.6$ and hence your subjective probability should either be $0.4$ or $0.6$ . I would like to know how Bayesians respond to that issue. Has this issue been discussed theoretically, and what is the Baysian position towards it? @Arya McCarthy: Thank you for your answer. I think you are right that Baysians interpret P(X=head)=0.58 as degree of belief, that heads will show up. My question is why does this makes sense, and according to which criterion? I feel this boils down to the justification of the prior. Imagine a Bayesian also has the same prior distribution for other coins as well and that the objective probability of getting a coin with p=0.6 is actually 0.9 and the objective probability of getting a coin with p=0.4 is actually 0.1. If in an experiment, the Baysian selects a series of coins at random and tosses them, $P(X=\text{heads})=0.58$ would be justified, because in this two stage random experiment (first select a coin and then toss it) the overall relative frequency of head will roughly speaking converge to the expected value, which is $0.58$ . Hence, roughly speaking, a long run strategy based on $P(X=\text{head})=0.58$ would actually be successful in the real world and this seems to me as a good criterion for P(X=head)=0.58 to make sense, - actual long run success considering similar situations. So how do you arrive at a prior, that roughly reflects these two objective probabilities? You could collect a sample and calculate frequentist estimates. If this is not possible, you should somehow try to guess what these two objective probabilities in a two stage experiment really are. Only then can you interpret $P(X=\text{head})=0.58$ as your subjective believe about the long run frequency in a two stage experiment and can argue that you believe this leads to the best long run strategy. That being said, in my initial example, if I had to make a single bet, I personally would base my action on $p=0.6$ , because I am not interested in the long run here. This does not mean $P(X=\text{head})=0.58$ , which reflects the long run relative frequency if my prior also does.
