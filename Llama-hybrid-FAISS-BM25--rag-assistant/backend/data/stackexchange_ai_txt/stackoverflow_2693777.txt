Well, it depends on what you are trying to do with your vector. If you don't use pointers, then it is a copy of the object you pass in that gets put on the vector. If it is a simple object, and/or you don't want to bother with keeping track of the storage for them, this may be exactly what you want. If it is something complex, or very time-consuming to construct and destruct, you might prefer to do that work only once each and pass pointers into the vector.
