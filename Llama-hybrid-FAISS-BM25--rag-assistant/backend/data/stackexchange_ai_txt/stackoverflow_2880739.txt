ActionScript 3.0 Color Output Error?

I'm employing color in a current AS3 project, and have come across what appears to be an error in the Flash Player (version 10). it might also be an error with Apple's DigitalColor Meter (version 3.7.2), which is what i'm using to sample the displayed colors on Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6.3). //Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors of the RGB color wheel var red:Number = 0xFF0000; var orange:Number = 0xFF7D00; var yellow:Number = 0xFFFF00; var chartreuse:Number = 0x7DFF00; var green:Number = 0x00FF00; var spring:Number = 0x00FF7D; var cyan:Number = 0x00FFFF; var azure:Number = 0x007DFF; //reads 0x0077FF var blue:Number = 0x0000FF; var violet:Number = 0x7D00FF; var magenta:Number = 0xFF00FF; //reads 0xFF00F8 var rose:Number = 0xFF007D; //reads 0xFF0077 all of these colors display normally except for 3: Azure, Magenta and Rose. they are coded with the appropriate number, but when i use the color meter to sample the displayed colors, those 3 return inaccurate results. anyone have any insight about this issue? what is causing the error, the Flash runtime or the color sampler? if it's the Flash player, could this problem be much deeper? alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/1a446801a2.jpg **sampling this image will return inaccurate results due to .jpg compression. it's simply for illustration*
