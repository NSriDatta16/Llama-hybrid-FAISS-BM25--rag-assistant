Getting website source with C++ - content is repeated

So, I have this source: #include #include #include #pragma comment(lib,"ws2_32.lib") using namespace std; int main (){ WSADATA wsaData; if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2,2), &wsaData) != 0) { cout h_addr); cout 0){ int i = 0; while (buffer[i] || buffer[i] == '\n' || buffer[i] == '\r') { cout Now, it works getting the source, however, it keeps repeating afterwards. For example: Notice how it says , then continues? I was wondering how I can avoid that. I know I can limit the buffer, however is there a better solution? Thanks
