How to know if classification and regression tree prediction model is significant?

I have a binary dependent variable and a continuous independent variable. When I apply logistic regression to build the prediction model, I use p-value to know whether the independent variable is a significant predictor for the independent variable. I would like to repeat the same study using two other ML techniques: classification and regression trees and random forest. For each of these techniques how to know whether the prediction model is significant?
