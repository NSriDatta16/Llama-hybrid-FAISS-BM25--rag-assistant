AFAIK, you cannot say that $p > \frac{1}{2}$ or even $\mathbb E[p]>\frac{1}{2}$ is an "observation" or "event", but rather a constraint on your model parameter(s). The term "observation" is usually reserved for specific realizations of a random variable (i.e. draws from a distribution). In your model, one could plausibly observe $p$ (numbers between 0 and 1) or the outcomes of $Bernoulli(p)$ (either 0 or 1). There is no way to observe $\mathbb E[p]>\frac{1}{2}$ , this information lies outside your probabilistic model. As a rough rule (some caveats apply) you should be able to simulate observations from your probabilistic model, given model parameters. How would you simulate a model where $\mathbb E[p]>\frac{1}{2}$ is a possible observation? If you start with the $p\sim Beta(a_0,b_0); a_0, b_0 \in \mathbb{R}^+$ model and then learn that $\mathbb E[p]>\frac{1}{2}$ , it means your initial model was incorrect and you should change your model to reflect the constraint ( $\mathbb E[p]>\frac{1}{2}$ implies $\frac{a_0}{a_0 + b_0} > \frac{1}{2}$ , so some combinations of $a_0$ and $b_0$ are ruled out). Adding a constraint cannot be AFAIK directly handled in the language of Bayesian updating. Hope that helps.
