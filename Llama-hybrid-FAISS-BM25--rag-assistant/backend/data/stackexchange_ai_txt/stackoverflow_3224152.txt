Format Number based on Format String in JavaScript/jQuery

Let's say I have a format string "XXX - XXX - XXXX" (to format a phone number), or any other format string in which X stands for a number I want to preserve the formatting in the format string (spacing, dashes etc.), but exchange each X for a number and drop all formatting in the source string Examples: Input: "abc+d(123)4567890", Format String: "XXX - XXX - XXXX", Output: "123 - 456 - 7890" Input "a b c 1 2 3 4567890", Format String: "X:X!XXXXX,XXX", Output: "1:2!34567,890" Input "1234567890", Format String: "(XXX)XXX-XXXX", Output: "(123)456-7890" I'm thinking I could grab the number by iterating through the source string (foreach character in '0123456789') but I'm not sure how I can then put this together elegantly to the right format. Maybe there is a jQuery function which does this already?
