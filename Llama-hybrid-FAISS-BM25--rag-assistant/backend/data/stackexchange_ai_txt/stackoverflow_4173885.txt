Thanks to everyone for the great input! Since we were kind of in a rush to solve the problem, and our group is relatively new to Mercurial, we used a very pragmatic solution. On our repository server we created a new repository, then we cloned the old repository up until the revision right before the merge. Then pushed the new clone to the server and sent out the new link to everyone. Luckily we are a quite small development team. Perhaps not the most cosher way to solve the problem, but it worked :)
