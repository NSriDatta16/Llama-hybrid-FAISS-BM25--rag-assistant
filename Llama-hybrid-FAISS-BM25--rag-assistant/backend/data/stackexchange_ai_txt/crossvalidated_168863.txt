convergence rate of Pearson correlation matrix

I posted recently a related question about the convergence rate of a Pearson correlation coefficient, here . Now, I am interested in the matrix version. Let $X_1,\ldots,X_N \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ be correlated random variables. Let $\hat{\rho}(X_i,X_j)$ be the estimated correlation between $X_i$ and $X_j$ from a sample of size $T$. I derived (cf. the previous post ) the following tail bound. For $t > 0$, $$\mathbb{P}\left(\left|\hat{\rho}(X_i,X_j) - \rho(X_i,Y_j)\right| \geq t \right) \leq \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}T \left(\sqrt{1 + \frac{2t}{1-\rho}} + 1 + \frac{t}{1-\rho} \right) + \ln 2 \right\}$$ Now, I wish a rather sharp tail bound for $$\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{ij} \left|\hat{\rho}(X_i,X_j) - \rho(X_i,Y_j)\right| \geq t \right)$$ An obvious one is $$\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{ij} \left|\hat{\rho}(X_i,X_j) - \rho(X_i,Y_j)\right| \geq t \right) \leq N^2 \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}T \left(\sqrt{1 + \frac{2t}{1-\rho}} + 1 + \frac{t}{1-\rho} \right) + \ln 2 \right\}$$ Can we do better? My guess is that we can leverage the correlation between the (correlation) coefficients to improve this bound. There are some results for " simultaneous confidence interval estimation ", but I do not know if it can be applied here.
