Confidence Limits for normal vs rayleigh distributed random variables

I have a device to measure a coordinate in one axis, the measurement error is $\Delta x$ , which is specified that $3\sigma , where thr is say 1 nanometer, and the average is not specified. Now I combine 2 such devices to measure an $(x,y)$ position and the measurement error is $r=\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2}$ . I understand r is Rayleigh distributed. How would I write the specification for $r$ ? I tried something like $\bar{x} + 3\sigma$ , but the deviation is relatively high.
