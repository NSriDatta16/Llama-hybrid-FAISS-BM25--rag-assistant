A learning curve is a plot of the training and cross-validation (test, in your case) error as a function of the number of training points. not the share of data points used for training. So it show how train/test errors evolve as the total data set increases. See here for examples and more detail. The 'train error' would be the error (according to your loss function) achieved for the training set, and the 'test error' means the same for the test set. See here for more detail. If I interpret your chart correctly, then the fraction of data you are using to test your model increases to 90%, while the error decreases for the 'test' data, while it increases for the (simultaneously shrinking) train set. In other words, as you are training your SVM model using fewer and fewer data, the 'train error' increases, which makes sense. It is a bit odd that the test error would be decreasing as you reduce the size of the train set, so perhaps I am misinterpreting your chart?
