What is normal memory usage of an asp.net mvc website?

I have really tried to Google it but only articles about how to troubleshoot memory issues come up. Before I start to troubleshoot, I would like to know if my web site's memory usage is really abnormal or not. So it is an asp.net mvc 2 website that runs on IIS 7.5 in production. I guess normal memory usage depends upon traffic, so here are the numbers of an average day: 300 unique visitor 400 visits 3000 page views I would be really happy to get some idea how much is the normal memory usage for this traffic. Also I would be curious to know how memory usage normally increases with traffic growth. Thanks a lot
