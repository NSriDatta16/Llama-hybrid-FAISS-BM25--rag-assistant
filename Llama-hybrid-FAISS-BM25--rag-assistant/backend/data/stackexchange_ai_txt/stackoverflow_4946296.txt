Code/Description. That code value is (I assume) going to be a smaller, more efficient integer. Furthermore, you don't want to be in a situation where you need to update all your foreign keys just because a text description changes at some time in the future. EDIT : Based on the sample code you just added, I would encourage you to make your code value an integer value rather than a string like 'CN', 'IN'. You want your key value to be agnostic to any "meaning" associated to the description. 'CN' still implies 'Contractor' and if/when that description changes to be 'External Resource' then 'CN' is going to be misleading.
