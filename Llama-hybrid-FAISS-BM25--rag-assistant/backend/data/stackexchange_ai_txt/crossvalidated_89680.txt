One way is to manually inspect the members in your clusters for a specific k to see if the groupings make sense (are they distinguishable?). This can be done via contingency tables and conditional means. Do this for a variety of k's and you can determine what value is appropriate. A less subjective way is to use the Silhouette Value: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18285434/how-do-i-choose-k-when-using-k-means-clustering-with-silhouette-function This can be computed with your favorite software package. From the link: This method just compares the intra-group similarity to closest group similarity. If any data member average distance to other members of the same cluster is higher than average distance to some other cluster members, then this value is negative and clustering is not successful. On the other hand, silhuette values close to 1 indicates a successful clustering operation. 0.5 is not an exact measure for clustering.
