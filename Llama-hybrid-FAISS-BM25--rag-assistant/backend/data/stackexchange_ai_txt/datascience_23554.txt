In R, can I integrate different classifying algorithms in one bagging model?

I use R to do data analysis. I have a dataset. When I use different classifying algorithms, such as random forest, SVM, etc, I have the different accuracy. So, I want to integrate all the algorithms into one framework, let's say adaboost. We know that adaboost framework use multiple "weak" classifying algorithms to combine a strong classifier. So, can I customize the "weak" classifying algorithms as I want? Here is just my current idea: In this framework, I use SVM first. Then give the data that are classified incorrectly more weights. Then, I use random forest. ... In the end, all the classifiers in this framework will work together. This is just what I think about this issue. If there is other method working such as voting, please let me know too. Any help is appreciated.
