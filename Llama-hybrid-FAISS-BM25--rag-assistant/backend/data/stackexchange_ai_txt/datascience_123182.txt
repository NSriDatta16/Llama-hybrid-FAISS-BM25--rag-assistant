Teach LLM to generate code using a specific library

I am curious to know after seeing good code examples generated by Github copilot. I am wondering if I can create an Agent which basically takes commands as plain English and generates code based on one particular framework. Lets say I have a basic web library like jQuery or even simpler one library which only has two functions makeCircle(radius) and makeRectangle(a,b) Now I want to build a system, which if I command it like this - "Create a big rectangle of size 8 X 10 and fit as many 2 radius circles keeping a gap of 1 unit between the circles as well as the rectangle" and it does the calculation and generates code or even pseudo code like - makeRectangle(8X10); for (int i=0;..... checkOverlap() ........ and so on Is it possible to achieve this on a particular library? without a lot of training data?
