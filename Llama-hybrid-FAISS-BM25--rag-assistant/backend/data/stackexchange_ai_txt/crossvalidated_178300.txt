Can we apply BIC to select between models in which the parameters are estimated by MCMC

I never considered this problem before. Assume we have two models, $A$ and $B$, we estimate the parameter in $A$ and $B$ respectively by sample mean. Two questions: We can always use the means of both samples to estimate the parameters, then is it possible to do so via the mode of the sample? Once we get estimates of the parameters, can we use BIC to select models? As the definition of BIC involves the maximized likelihood function, $\hat{L}$, then it seems that BIC is not suitable as a selection criterion in MCMC, is it true?
