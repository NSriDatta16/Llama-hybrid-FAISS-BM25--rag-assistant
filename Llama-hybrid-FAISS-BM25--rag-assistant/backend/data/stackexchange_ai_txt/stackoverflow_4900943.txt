Looking at your screen shot, Layer 2 (which contains the slideshow movieclip) is locked. If you unlock the layer by clicking on the padlock icon you should then be able to edit the script. To edit the script double-click on the script in the Movie Explorer panel and the Actions panel should open. You can edit the script here. The second part of your question - how to create a hyperlink - is very broad and there are many different ways to approach it. The most elegant approach would depend on how your project was structured. The simplest way might be to define a variable to hold the path to the current image and add another onClipEvent handler. So in the existing onLoad you would addâ€¦ this.path_to_image = http://your-domain.com/images/your-first-big-image.jpg; Then add the new event handler onClipEvent(mouseUp){ getURL (this.path_to_image); } You would then have to update the path_to_image variable whenever the image changed. slideshow.path_to_image = http://your-domain.com/images/your-next-big-image.jpg;
