Touch times to authenticate user

for a project I gathered touch data of different users when they tap a rhythm repeatedly on the touch screen in a game. [ 0.23076923076923, 0.46153846153846, 0.69230769230769, 0.92307692307692, 1.1538461538462, 1.8461538461538, 2.3076923076923, 2.7692307692308, 3.2307692307692, 3.6923076923077, 4.3846153846154, 4.6153846153846, 4.8461538461538, 5.0769230769231, 5.3076923076923 ] This is one such dataset. It is an simple array of points in time in seconds the user has touched the screen since the start of the game. I have a lot of "training" data where the user has tried to learn his pattern (like the dataset above). Now I want to teach a algorithm with the training data that the user normally touches. Later on I want to give the algorithm a single data set and it gives me a probability how likely it is that this is the user that learned the pattern or not. I only vaguely now that this is part of machine learning and pattern recognition but i could not find a fitting algorithm that provides a solution to my problem. Maybe the main problem is that the examples are only like "how likely is a sunny day tomorrow" or only pure mathematical equations that are hard to break down to a actual problem without advanced knowledge of this particular problem Do you have any tips on what algorithm I should look for or what a similar problem like this is called? With no knowledge in this field it is hard to find the correct problem that describes the one I have.
