What's the difference between test suite and test group?

What's the difference between test suite and test group? If I want to organize my unit tests in phpunit.xml in groups of tests (i.e. groups of directiories), e.g. tests for specific application module. How should the phpunit.xml look like to utilize groups and test suites? How to run specific group/test suite from the command line? Similar question: PHPUnit - Running a particular test suite via the command line test runner PHPUnit manual about test suites and groups in xml configuration: http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/appendixes.configuration.html http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/organizing-tests.html How to configure the groups in phpunit.xml , that phpunit --list-groups showed them?
