My personal experience is that, on average, dealing with annotations is far easier for most developers than dealing with your standard Java XML Configuration hell. For things like JPA and Spring testing they are absolute life-savers. The good thing about annotations is that they make configuration on your classes self-documenting. Now, instead of having to search through a huge XML file to try and figure out how a framework is using your class, your class tells you. Usually the issue with changes like this is that getting used to them simply takes time. Most people, including developers, resist change. I remember when I started working with Spring. For the first few weeks I wondered why anyone would put up with the headaches associated with it. Then, a few weeks later, I wondered how I'd ever lived without it.
