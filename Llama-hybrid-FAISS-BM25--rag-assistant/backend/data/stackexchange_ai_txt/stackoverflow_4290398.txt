Mouse events over the scrollbar vary widely between browsers and aren't something you can rely on. I did a few tests and here's what I found: Firefox fires all events (mouse down, move and up) correctly over the scrollbar, even when dragging the bar. IE6 fires mouse down but not up, and fires move events only when not dragging the bar. Chrome (hence I assume Safari too) fires only mouse down events. I should add that I don't see any situation where you would want to do what you describe, i.e. react in different ways to scrolling.
