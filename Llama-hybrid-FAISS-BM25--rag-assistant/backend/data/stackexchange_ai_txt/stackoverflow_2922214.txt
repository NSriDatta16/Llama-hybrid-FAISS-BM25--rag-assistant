This kind of approach is the only one i can think of that feels (to me) slightly better than writing anchor manually: ${Html.ActionLink("Feed me", T4MVC.Home.Index(), Fragment: "food")} Apart from spark viewengine - it costs 1 good old htmlhelper extension method & named parameters. I assume that this isn't available in the default viewengine? I've decided to write a quick extension for the ActionLink, but it's not elegant, and I would have liked any solution to be available to others in future versions of T4MVC. Spark replaces with ${}. Mentioned just because I prefer it (You should try it if You emphasize code elegance). C# 4.0 is required in order to use named parameters. That's because I would like to avoid losing information to which parameter "food" argument maps. And yeah, i strongly agree with Mattias Jakobsson.
