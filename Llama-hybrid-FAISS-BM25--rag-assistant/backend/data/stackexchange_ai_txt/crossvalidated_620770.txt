In g-computation after matching, do we mimic the formula used in matching even if you would have typically added more terms such as polynomial terms?

I have some questions regarding best practices in g-computation post-matching in the standard case of a dichotomous treatment and a continuous outcome. When defining the regression model with the matched data, I've read the following from the MatchIt vignette in R : (I didn't use propensity scores for the problem I'm working on, but I assume it is analogous) ...recommend only including the same terms included in the propensity score model unless there is a strong a priori and justifiable reason to model the outcome differently . Then, it is also recommended that in many cases we should add interaction terms with the treatment and covariates, like as follows: #Extract matched data md Thus, my interpretation is that the go-to practice, unless you have some strong reason to, is to only include the covariates used in the matching, X1 - X3, but you can add additional terms that are modifications of those covariates. Would this mean that I can also add (or should add) polynomial terms for X1, if I know that X1 has a nonlinear relationship with outcome? My confusion comes from the fact in the actual matching process, polynomial terms might not be added to X1 depending on the matching specification - for example, it may be added if you're using logistic regression to estimate propensity scores, but not if you're using something like ANN to estimate the propensity scores as it does not require making assumptions about the functional form. But in g-computation, if using regression, would we "go back" to specifying interactions and polynomial terms? I would assume so, as one benefit I've heard of this framework is that the matching and treatment estimation are separated, but I'm not very confident in this. To summarize, is the main focus that the same covariates are used in both steps, but however they are modified will just depend on what model is being used for the matching or the outcome?
