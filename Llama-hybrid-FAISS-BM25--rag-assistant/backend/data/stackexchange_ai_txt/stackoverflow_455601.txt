Best way to recruit a virtual team to a "garage" software project?

I have a working prototype for a killer app implemented in C# for Windows Mobile. It needs to be packaged into a commodity and efficiently sold. Possibly also converted to a web-centric platform. Now I'd like to assemble a community of seasoned, possibly semi-retired IT professionals. They should be willing to work for fun and free, with an eye to future profits. I realize not many people have the option to risk their time on something like this, but - hey - on a global scale there should be more than one. I've googled variants of the above, but no dice. And I don't really see SourceForge et al as venues for recruiting, but more as the place where you MIGHT put your code base when the project is under way. I'm not well versed in Open Source, and I'm not sure I want to "open the kimono" on the source until there's been some modicum of vetting process (goes both ways, of course). So, rephrasing the question: what is the best site for recruiting people to a project like this?
