magento insert product list for category 18 under cart

In Magento under the cart I would like to insert the products for category 18 just as they are listen on any ordinary product page. I can see how to insert a block on a CMS page. But how to I call the template(?) for product listing below the cart? BR. Anders UPDATE: Can see that the file layout/catalog.xml has this block that probably is the one I wish to insert on the cart page: I have tried to copy it and insert in different ways into the catalog.xml under cart and tried to insert the block into cart.phtml. Cannot figure out how to do it based on the answer below (I am obviously new to modifying Magento) UPDATE 2: Had it been on a CMS page then it should just be this line. {{block type="catalog/product_list" category_id="4" template="catalog/product/list.phtml"}} So I am just looking for the equivalent when going into cart.phtml or into layout/checkout.xml. Thanks
