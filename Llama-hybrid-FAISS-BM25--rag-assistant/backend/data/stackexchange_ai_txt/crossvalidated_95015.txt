Is it valid to use Hartigans' dip test to reject uni-modal null hypothesis with large N?

first time questioner, so please be gentle :) I have two distributions of data from a simulation. By eye, one looks like it might be bimodal, one not. I copy them below A: parameter value 1 : by eye possibly bi / multi modal B: parameter value 2 : by eye unimodal I thought I would use Hartigans' dip test to test H1:not uni-modal vs H0:uni-modal. The problem is that the test statistic suggests that I reject the null hypothesis of unimodality for both distributions with values well under the suggested 0.05 threshold. In fact, the test statistic for the distribution that looks more unimodal is lower than that for the one that looks potentially multi-modal (dist A: D = 0.00814; dist B: D = 0.00340) I think what I'm seeing is the effect of fairly large N (N=5000), so the sample size lends statistical power to the test. But inspection of the histograms suggests this is not valid. Is there some way to formalise discussion of whether it is valid to reject the null hypothesis based on this test? I've read a few posts on here ( Test for bimodal distribution and @whuber 's suggested search ). I also found this elsewhere, but the answer is a bit generic - basically saying that with large N you're likely to find lots of tests significant, which I already suspect is the case here. I realise that some consideration of causal mechanisms for uni / non-uni modal outcomes could aid the discussion, but want to understand the statistical tests, too. I'd like some advice on 1) Am I interpreting the test statistic correctly (i.e. D 2) Is there a way to determine whether large N is giving the test undue statistical power?
