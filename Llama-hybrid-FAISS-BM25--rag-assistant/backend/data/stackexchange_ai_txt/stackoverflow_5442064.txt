Help me get started (traffic manipulation)

My main goal is to create an advanced program for manipulating the packets that route within my network via the router. Let my program have total control over the router. Set the download/upload speeds to my inputs, apply the effect to certain devices within in my network. Block upload or download traffic. Set second delay for either the upload or download speed. Specify % of loss packets, and the list goes on. The problem is that I don't know where to start. I know most languages at the very most basic level. I'd like to create this program in either C, C++ or C# but I don't know yet. What else do I need to know before creating this program? Winsock or something? Winpcap APIs? This goal is my motivation to learn programming to the extreme, and I'm really looking forward to it. Thanks in advance!
