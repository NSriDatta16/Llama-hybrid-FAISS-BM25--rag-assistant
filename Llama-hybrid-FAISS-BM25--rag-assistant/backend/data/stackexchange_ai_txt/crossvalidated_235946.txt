PCA before cluster analysis

I am trying to do a PCA to reduce the no. of variables in my data before performing a cluster analysis. Suppose I extract 3 principal components P1, P2 and P3. Now when I am to do the clustering, on which variables should I run my analysis? I am not very clear as to should I use all the initial variables (then how will PCA help) or should I use the extracted 3 components? A detailed answer with example will be very helpful
