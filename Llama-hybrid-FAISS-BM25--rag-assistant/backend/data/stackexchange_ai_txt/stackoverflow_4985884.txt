So, I'm just doing what I've been doing, what I mentioned in my question, just have the page fade in with jQuery which gives IE a fraction of a second to get its act together before displaying my Javascript-driven stuff. I've been using: $(window).load(function(){$("THE DIV CONTAINING MY PAGE").fadeIn(0);}); ...and will continue to do so. @alex provided a solution in his answer having all of the html fade in. That might work too, (I haven't tested it on the page in question specifically, but I still prefer my more localized fade-in as his method makes everything fade in, including the background color. I could see that being really cool on another site, but that look isn't quite right for me on this site...) @Marc B suggested a very elegant solution in a comment under my question. I've invited him to restate it as an answer and if it works (and no one provides a better idea in the meantime,) I'll green-check him. (I'm thinking it'll work--I'll try it out next time I'm in front of my windows machine...) If anyone else has any other ideas, I'd love to see them!
