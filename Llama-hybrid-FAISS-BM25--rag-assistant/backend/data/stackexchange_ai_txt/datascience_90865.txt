Technical term to describe/differentiate the structure of an instance by the number of samples per instance ('tuple' vs 'time series')

Several terms are used to describe the structure of instances of a dataset. For example, an instance can be ' univariate ' if it depends on only one variable or ' multivariate ' if it depends on 2 or more variables. I wonder if there are technical terms to distinguish the structure of a, let's call it a ' tuple ', and a ' time series ' or ' sequence '. Here are two examples that I am trying to describe or distinguish structurally: The left example is a time series, where all 11 samples belong to one instance. The right example is a collection of 'tuples' (if that is the correct term), where each row represents a separate instance. I always refer to the term ' tuple ' here, because the concept seems similar to me with the record in a database or the representation of points from mathematics. I am not sure if ' time series ' and ' tuple ' are the correct terms to describe how many samples an instance consists of. The terms should be analogous to uni/multivariate to describe the number of features in an instance. Hence my question: If univariate/multivariate describes an instance in the horizontal, what terms are used to describe an instance vertically?
