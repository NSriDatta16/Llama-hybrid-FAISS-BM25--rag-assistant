I've been wrestling with this idea myself in some current projects. I think you need to ask yourself what is being estimated here. If a one-factor model fits, then the factor scores estimate the latent factor. The straight sum or mean of your manifest variables estimates something else, unless every observation loads equally on the factor, and the uniquenesses are also the same. And that something else is probably not a quantity of great theoretical interest. So if a one-factor model fits, you are probably well advised to use the factor scores. I take your point about comparability across studies, but within a particular study, I think the factor scores have a lot going for them. Where it gets interesting is when a one-factor model does not fit, either because a two-factor model applies (or higher), or because the covariance structure is more complicated than a factor model predicts. To me, the question is then whether the straight total of the variables refers to anything real . This is particularly true if the data have more than one dimension. In practice, what often happens is that you have a bunch of related variables (items on a survey, perhaps), with one or two of them being way different from the others. You can say, "to Hell with this", and take the average of everything, regardless of what it means. Or you can go with the factor scores. If you fit a one-factor model, what will typically happen, is that the factor analysis will downweight the less useful variables (or at least, those variables that really belong on a second factor score). In effect, it spots them as belonging to a different dimension and ignores them. So I believe that the factor score can sort of prune the data to give something more uni-dimensional than you started with. But I don't have a reference for this, and I'm still trying to figure out in my own work if I like this approach. To me, the big danger is overfitting when you plough the scores into another model with the same data. The scores are already the answer to an optimization question, so where does that leave the rest of the analysis? I hate to think. But at the end of the day, does a sum or total of variables actually make sense if something like a one-factor model does not apply? A lot of these questions would not arise if people designed better scales to start with.
