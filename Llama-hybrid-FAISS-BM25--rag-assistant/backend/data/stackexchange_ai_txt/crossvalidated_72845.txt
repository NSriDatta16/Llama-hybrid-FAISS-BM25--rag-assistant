The information from the summary() command you have attached to the question allows you to see, e.g., the proportion of the variance each principal component captures (Proportion of variance). In addition, the cumulative proportion is computed to output. For example, you need to have 23 PCs to capture 75% of the variance in your data set. This certainly is not the information you typically use as input to further analyses. Rather, what you usually need is the rotated data, which is saved as 'x' in the object created by prcomp. Using R code as a short example. pr 80% newdat Then you can use the data in the newdat for further analyses, e.g., as input to SVM or some regression model.
