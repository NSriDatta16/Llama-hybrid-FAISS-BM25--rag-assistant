Email Tracking - Apple Mail

I have asked a similar question to this but for GMail and I was greatly satisfied with an awesome answer I received. However, I am having trouble with another email client: Apple Mail. I am creating my own email tracking system for email marketing tracking. I have been able to determine each persons email client they are using by using the http referrer but for some reason Apple Mail like GMail does not send across HTTP_REFERRER. For GMail the solution was to use https for where I hosted the transparent image but this hasnt worked for Apple Mail. print_r($_SERVER); only gives this sort of header: WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER - http://aaaaaaaaa HTTPS - on ACCESS_DOMAIN - aaaaa DATABASE_SERVER - aaaaaaa SITE_ROOT - /home/121000 SITE_CGIROOT - /home/121000/cgi-bin SITE_HTMLROOT - aaaaaa PHPRC - aaaaa HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST - aaaaaaa HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SERVER - aaaaa HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR - aaaaaa HTTP_HOST - aaaaaa HTTP_CONNECTION - close HTTP_USER_AGENT - Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_5; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) HTTP_ACCEPT - */* HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE - en-us HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING - gzip, deflate SERVER_SIGNATURE - Apache/2.2.9 Server at aaaaaaa Port 443 SERVER_SOFTWARE - Apache/2.2.9 SERVER_NAME - aaaaaa SERVER_ADDR - aaaaaa SERVER_PORT - 443 Please note, certain details where hidden with a string of a. Is there any other way I can find out when the Apple Mail client requests this image? As a side note, this is when I wish SO had a way to invite certain users to questions as yc was a great help last time!
