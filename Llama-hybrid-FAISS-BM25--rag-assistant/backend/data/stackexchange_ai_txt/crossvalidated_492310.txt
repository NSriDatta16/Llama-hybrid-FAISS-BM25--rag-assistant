From working as a statistician where my main role is a consultant to the subject matter experts that also work for us, I have noticed that people with less of an understanding of statistics throw the word bias out when they just want to say something is wrong. They really have no idea what they are saying when they are saying something has bias and will say it anytime they are concerned as a kind of catch all even if the context has nothing to do with bias. Many times when I am explaining something to someone they respond "what about bias" even though it has nothing to do with conversation at hand. I suspect this may be the case with your scenario specifically when you see them saying something like: "All datasets are biased in some way. How is your dataset biased?" Which is certainly not true. Just a note that this gets multiplied when we start talking about buzz words like machine learning. I've had people give me a dataset and ask me "can you machine learn this....".
