This really is a question on jQuery, and jQuery's Ajax methods. You're not asking about anything too difficult here. Just a menu that makes asynchronous calls to the server for content, and loads the respose HTML into a particular DIV. $("a.homePage").click(function(){ showLoadingAnimation(); // Indicate ajax-loading $("div.Container").load("/home", {}, function(){ hideLoadingAnimation(); // Hide indicator after content is loaded }); }); This would load in your home view. Just be sure that it doesn't bring a template along with it. Once you get started on the actual development, return here to ask more specific questions to get quicker and more thorough responses.
