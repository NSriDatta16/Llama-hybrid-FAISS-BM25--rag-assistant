There is definitely validity to the NoSQL movement, but I wouldn't worry about your SQL skills going to waste. NoSQL storage architectures were born out of the need for highly available and scalable data stores that went beyond what a typical relational database could provide. This comes at a cost though, and typically that cost is guaranteed consistency. This isn't always a large concern. In the case of something like Facebook doesn't have complete consistency for a period of time for things like your pictures, status updates, etc. As long as they get consistent at some point, it's okay. On the other end, take your bank account. That type of data store needs to provide the strong ACID characteristics that a relational database provides. NoSQL isn't something that I see taking over the world, it's an alternative to the common approach of RDBMS's and as with everything else it has it's strengths and weaknesses. Here is an excellent article on the subject written about NetFlix.
