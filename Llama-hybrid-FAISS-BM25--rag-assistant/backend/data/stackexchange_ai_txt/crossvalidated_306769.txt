Small Sample (N=32), using simple regression instead of multiple regression to test Hypothesis?

As part of my thesis I have proposed hypotheses: Perceived Supervisor Support is positively related to Employee Engagement Perceived Organization Support is positively related to Employee Engagement Perceived HRM Practices are positively related to Employee Engagement I have done the survey in my company and have received 32 valid responses. Correlation analysis provides significant results. Now to test for hypothesis I was using multiple regression but my beta values are all statistically insignificant, whereas when I do simple regression for each individual driver with Employee Engagement I get statistically significant results. My question is will using simple regression valid approach to prove these hypotheses? If yes can i quote a reference which will justify this approach in this case? Is there another way I can prove these hypotheses?
