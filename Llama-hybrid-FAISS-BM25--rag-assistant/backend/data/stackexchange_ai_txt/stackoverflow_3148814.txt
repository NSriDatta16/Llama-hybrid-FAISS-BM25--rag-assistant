Drag-n-Drop from UIPopoverController to other UIView

How would I go about implementing dragging and dropping a UIView from UIPopoverController into the back UIView . This is the functionality that Pages provide in their insert media popover, where you can drag a shape out from the UIPopoverController and drop it into the main document. I am actually confused with the pan UIGestureRecognizers and where they will be implemented. Thanks, Umer
