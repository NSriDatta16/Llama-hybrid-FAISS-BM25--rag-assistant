Silverlight allows for multi-threading which is great for processing large amounts of data (and as an aside makes the UI seem faster/more responsive to a user) Silverlight 2 apps written in >Net should run just as fast as .Net apps. There are compiled locally and run "natively" in a managed environment so the performance should be the same as any .Net app which I have found to be pretty darn good or at least programmer-talent-contrained and not toolset-constrained. My big concern would be that you are running on the client and you will have little ability to know what the speed will be client to client. The min requirements for SL are pretty meager Also, lots-o-processing typically means lots-o-data so you will want to look into using Isolated Storage (another neat SL feature) and compressing any WCF calls (use IIS7 and turn on dynamic compression)
