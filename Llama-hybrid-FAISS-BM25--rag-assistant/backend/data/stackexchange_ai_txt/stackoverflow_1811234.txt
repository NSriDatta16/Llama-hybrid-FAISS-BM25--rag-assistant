The list of methods executed is called "code coverage". There are tools called "code coverage analyzers" which log the methods called: this is useful when testing code, when you have one or more test cases and want to know what methods the tests are 'covering'. One example of such a tool for C# is called NCover: for links to this and other tools, see Code Coverage for C#/.net .
