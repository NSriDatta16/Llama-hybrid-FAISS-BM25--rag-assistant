Update: 10/21/2015: The following answer required you to explicitly provide values such as 100em in order to achieve offsets. This is not ideal. Instead, you can translate the element . Update You can indeed do this today without flash or JavaScript. You can use the keyframes feature in modern browsers to move text in modern browsers. I took the liberty to work up a quick demo demonstrating the concept: (horizontal) http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/XxUXD/ , and (vertical) http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/h7SYp/ . Essentially we set the initial starting-point of the animation to text-indent: 100% to set it out of view and to the right. Then we set the last frame to text-indent: -100% , or whatever is needed to hide the text (will vary depending on character-length). Old Answer You won't be able to do this without flash or Javascript. HTML is structure, while CSS is presentation. Neither of the two provide animation-capabilities. I would suggest you go a route that includes a small javascript framework like jQuery, as this can convert standard HTML into the animated effect that you desire. I would encourage you to look into the Cycle Plugin for jQuery.
