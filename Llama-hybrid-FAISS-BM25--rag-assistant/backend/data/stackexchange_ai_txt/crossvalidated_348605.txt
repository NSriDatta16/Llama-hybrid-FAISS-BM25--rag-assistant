The concept you're calling 'exceptionality' is simply a combined variable (via a weighted average) from two or more variables standardized to a Z-score. If there were a way of observing 'exceptionality' as sampled data, you could potentially fit a (standardized) multiple regression with your variables to find the best weights to use. Let's consider two random variables $A$ and $B$ , which are standardized to $Z_A$ and $Z_B$ respectively (meaning each follows a standard normal distribution, i.e. mean of 0 and variance of 1). The weighted average of $Z_A$ and $Z_B$ , where $w_A$ and $w_B$ are the respective weights for $Z_A$ and $Z_B$ , is then: $$ W = \frac{w_A}{w_A+w_B} \cdot Z_A + \frac{w_B}{w_A+w_B} \cdot Z_B $$ Note that $w_A$ and $w_B$ are constants, whereas $Z_A$ and $Z_B$ are random variables. Therefore, the expected value of $W$ is as follows: $$ \text{E}(W) = \frac{w_A}{w_A+w_B} \cdot \text{E}(Z_A) + \frac{w_B}{w_A+w_B} \cdot \text{E}(Z_B) = 0 $$ The variance of $W$ , assuming the independence of $Z_A$ and $Z_B$ , is: $$ \text{Var}(W) = \left(\frac{w_A}{w_A+w_B}\right)^2 \cdot \text{Var}(Z_A) + \left(\frac{w_B}{w_A+w_B}\right)^2 \cdot \text{Var}(Z_B) \\ = \left(\frac{w_A}{w_A+w_B}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{w_B}{w_A+w_B}\right)^2 $$ The variance of $W$ , depending on the discrepancy between weights $w_A$ and $w_B$ , must fall inside the interval $[.5,1)$ . Although the mean is 0, because the variance is not 1, $W$ does not follow a standard normal distribution and therefore cannot be treated as a $Z$ -score. To make inferences like "a value of $W$ (the weight-averaged Z-scores) $= 1$ is greater than ~84% of observations" would involve having to standardize by dividing $W$ by its standard deviation. Therefore, the Z-score of $W$ becomes: $$ Z_W = \frac{\frac{w_A}{w_A+w_B} \cdot Z_A + \frac{w_B}{w_A+w_B} \cdot Z_B}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{w_A}{w_A+w_B}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{w_B}{w_A+w_B}\right)^2}} $$ A value of $1$ for $Z_W$ would indicate that it's greater than ~84% of observations of $Z_W$ . Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions.
