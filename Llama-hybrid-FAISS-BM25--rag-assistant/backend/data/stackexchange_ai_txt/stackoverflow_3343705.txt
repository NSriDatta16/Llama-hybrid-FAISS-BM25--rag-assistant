Fitnesse deployment practices

Is there some documentation on the best ways to organize the deployment of Fitnesse for use in projects? I have many questions: How should it be stored? Should the whole fitnesse root be stored in SVN? How do you deal with acceptance tests that span multiple svn repositories? We have some code that runs only on linux (server) and other code that runs only on windows (client) that make up the complete system, how do you run these? Do you have multiple Finesse servers?
