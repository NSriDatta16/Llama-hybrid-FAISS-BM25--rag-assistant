Which classifiers work well with unbalanced data?

I have a binary classification problem which is very unbalanced - it can have 98% of data from one class. Which classifiers work well with this sort of data? I have an unlimited supply of training data, since I produce it using a pseudo random number generator. However, I found that to get a neural network to produce decent results, I had to generate balanced (50:50) data. This is the equivalent of over-sampling. The problem with this approach is that the training data is then not representative of real life.
