Can a Multivariate Normal Distribution be used as a Bayesian Prior?

Suppose you have a regression model : Y = B_0 + B_1 * X If you wanted to perform Bayesian Linear Regression, this would require you to place priors on "B_0", "B_1" and "Sigma". I have seen people place priors on each of these 3 terms as (independent) univariate Normal Distributions. For example: Prior on "B_0" = Normal(mu_1, sigma_1) Prior on "B_1" = Normal(mu_2, sigma_2) Prior on "Sigma" = Normal(mu_3, sigma_3) These priors can then be multiplied by the joint likelihood, and the MAP estimates of "B_0", "B_1" and "Sigma" can be calculated (e.g. either via theoretical conjugacy properties or MCMC sampling). My Question: Instead of the above approach where 3 different independent univariate normal distributions were used as priors - could the likelihood be multiplied by a trivariate normal distribution containing a mean vector as well as a specific type of variance-covariance matrix? Is this an acceptable approach? Thanks!
