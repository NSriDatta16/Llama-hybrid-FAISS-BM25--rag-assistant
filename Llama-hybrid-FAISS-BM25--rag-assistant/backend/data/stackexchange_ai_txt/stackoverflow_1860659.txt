will encrypting a comma seperated list of ID's make it smaller to fit into a cookie?

say I want to store ID's in a cookie: 123,1232,3443,2343,2344422,2342 seeing that a cookie has a 4kb limit (or whatever), would encrypting the value allow for more storage somehow? if so, which encryption would be best? (not really worried about security, just want to store more with less footprint)
