I don't believe that IE(any version) plays nice with the Accept header. See this link: [ http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/07/01/IE-and-the-Accept-Header.aspx] A possible solution might be to check the User Agent to see if it's IE. If it is, then check for the presence of text/xml. Good Luck! Edit: Opps on the link. My hunch was IE is always adding the / and setting the accept header just adds the desired mime type after the / .
