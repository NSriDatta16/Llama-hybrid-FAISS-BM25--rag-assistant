rails validation messages

My Rails app began returning funky validation error messages of this form upon create/save of a model. {{count}} errors prohibited this {{model}} from being saved There were problems with the following fields: {{attribute}} {{message}} {{attribute}} {{message}} {{attribute}} {{message}} {{attribute}} {{message}} Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Thanks
