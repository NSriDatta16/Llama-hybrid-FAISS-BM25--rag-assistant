Variable selection in logistic regression

So I'm trying to make a multivariate logistic regression model in R studio. I'm not sure how to go about this. What seemed to make sense to me was to model every predictor against the response individually and see whether there's any individual significance. If there's no relationship between a single predictor and the response why would I add that to my model? Then I'd make a model with only predictors that were individually significant and then run AIC/BIC or ridge/lasso to reduce or remove non significant predictors. And what I'd have would be my resulting model. I just want to know whether that's an intelligent way to go about constructing a multivariate regression and if not what a better way or ways there are. Thanks
