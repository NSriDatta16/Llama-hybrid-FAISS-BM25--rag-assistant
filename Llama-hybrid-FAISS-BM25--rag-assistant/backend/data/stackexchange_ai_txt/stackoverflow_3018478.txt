I think you've overstepped your role. While XSS vulnerabilities are a serious concern, if you are not in the Information Security role at your organization you really have no business intruding on how the development organization down the hall operates. There is no such thing as absolute security, but I imagine that the people overseeing the blog project rest easy at night knowing that if any employees misuse the technology they can be tracked through logs and be dealt with accordingly. If you've writen malicious code "to demostrate this" without their consent, it's a pretty serious action to undertake without approval and I would imagine your superiors would feel the same way.
