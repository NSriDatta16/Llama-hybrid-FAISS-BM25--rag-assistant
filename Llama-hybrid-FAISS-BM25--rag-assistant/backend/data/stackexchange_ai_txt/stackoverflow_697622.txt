No, you can have security problems arising from accepting numbers from an external source. If an external source gives you a number of elements in (say) an array that you will need to process, a large number, trusted blindly, can cause denial of service by allocating enough memory to cause slow-down or memory exhaustion. Conversely, if you accept too-low a number and blindly continue reading more elements than you've allocated storage for, you can cause stack or heap over-writes.
