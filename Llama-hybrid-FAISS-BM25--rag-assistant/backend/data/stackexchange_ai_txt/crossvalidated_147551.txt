How does one use Bayes theorem with a continuous prior?

If my prior is modelled as a continuous probability distribution, say, a beta distribution skewed to reflect my bias towards certain models, how can I calculate the posterior probability? The challenge for me is calculating the probability of a given model, since the continuous distribution will only give me estimates for intervals . Please forgive the naivety of the question, I've only recently started studying Bayesian statistics.
