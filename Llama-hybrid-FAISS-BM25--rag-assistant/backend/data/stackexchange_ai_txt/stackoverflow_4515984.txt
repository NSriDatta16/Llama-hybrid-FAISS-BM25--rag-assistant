Downcasing & Upcasing in Ruby on Rails

I have built a ruby on rails app that allows for users to track their workouts. I also allow them (like a blog) to create tags for their workouts. When users add tags to their workouts, they are assisted through auto_complete to help keep things organized. As the site has grown in popularity I am getting a little bit of clutter/inconsistency because of capitalization. Is there a way to tell the app to only create tag.name 's in uppercase or lowercase?
