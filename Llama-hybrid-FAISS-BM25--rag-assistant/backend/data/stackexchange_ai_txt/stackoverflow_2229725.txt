Object[] isn't a list, it's an array. Arrays in Java are allocated in contiguous blocks of memory and so indexing into them ( myArray[3] ) is very efficient. They're storage-efficient too (not a lot of overhead). Lists are different things, and in fact there is no implementation of List ; that's an interface, an abstract way of dealing with a list. There's LinkedList and ArrayList , etc., which are actual implementations of the interface with different trade-offs between various operations -- indexing into the list, traversing it, modifying it, etc. -- and between how much storage overhead they introduce. Arrays are great when you're not going to change how many elements are in the array much at all; lists are great when you'll need to change how many elements there are.
