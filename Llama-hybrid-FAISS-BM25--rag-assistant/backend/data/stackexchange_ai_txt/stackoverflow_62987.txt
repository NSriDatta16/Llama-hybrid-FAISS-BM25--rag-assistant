Best way of constructing dynamic sql queries in C#/.NET3.5?

A project I'm working on at the moment involves refactoring a C# Com Object which serves as a database access layer to some Sql 2005 databases. The author of the existent code has built all the sql queries manually using a string and many if-statements to construct the fairly complex sql statement (~10 joins, >10 sub selects, ~15-25 where conditions and GroupBy's). The base table is always the same one, but the structure of joins, conditions and groupings depend on a set of parameters that are passed into my class/method. Constructing the sql query like this does work but it obviously isn't a very elegant solution (and rather hard to read/understand and maintain as well)... I could just write a simple "querybuilder" myself but I am pretty sure that I am not the first one with this kind of problem, hence my questions: How do you construct your database queries? Does C# offer an easy way to dynamically build queries?
