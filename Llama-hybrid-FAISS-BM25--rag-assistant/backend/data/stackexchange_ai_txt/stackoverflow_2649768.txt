Memcache, like any cache, should be used as... a cache. If you can't find something in the cache, there must be a strategy to find it in permanent storage. In addition to the reasons you mention, Memcache and other caching approaches have limits to the amount of items they will hold (discarding usually the least recently used ones when the cache is full), and often also set other cache invalidation policies (e.g. flush everything unused for one hour). If you don't configure and operate the cache yourself, you have NO guarantee of when and how items might be removed from the cache intentionally / by design.
