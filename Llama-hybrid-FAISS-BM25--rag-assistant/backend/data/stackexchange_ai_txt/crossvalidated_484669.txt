There are no hard rules to follow as to how many fixed effects can enter your model so long that you have sufficient observations to to make your design matrix full rank and therefore, your effects uniquely estimable. To uniquely estimate your effects, you'll at least need one observation for every parameter that will be estimated by your model. Of course, the more observations you have, the more powerful your analysis will be and the easier it will be to detect differences when carrying out statistical tests. It seems like you've already fixed the sample size, so you'll need to carry out a power analysis for the given size to determine how powerful your tests will actually be once you've decided what your model will look like. There are many resources on the web and papers written on sample size estimation for linear mixed effects models. I've listed a few below. Statistical software will alert you if you have an insufficient number of observations to carry out the analysis so pay attention to any warnings or error messages.
