Dynamically set TinyMCE file path for file browser and image viewier using PHP

I am using tincymce as the content editor and file manager in a PHP admin area. How can I change the file path dynamically so that I can use one instance of the editor for different organized functions? I can easily pass a variable to the tinymce.init configuration, but I am not aware of and can not find a configuration option for the file path. The actual file path variable is in the plugin's config.php file as $mcFileManagerConfig['filesystem.path'] and $mcFileManagerConfig['filesystem.rootpath'] How can I pass my variable to this file?
