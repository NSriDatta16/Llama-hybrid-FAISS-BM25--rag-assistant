Is it a good idea to use log scale on scree plots for PCA/ICA/FA?

I always found the concept of determining the "ideal" number of components/factors for an ICA/PCA/FA via a scree plot useful and quick, but also a bit shaky. In an effort to try to make the scree plot "elbow" more obvious (and without trying to fit a function to the scree plot data points). I was thinking whether plotting on log-scale coordinates might help shed some light. The non-log plot (first from the left) is pretty bunched up, but it's as "obvious" as it gets with scree plots that the third factor is the elbow (and thus my ideal number of factors should be 3). Now, it also seems that whether my log scale is in base 2 or 10 makes little difference for the plot appearance - which I guess is good. Lastly, I find that the X/Y log plots show the most quaintness for the 3rd factor, making it the point where 2 types of "curves" in the plot meet. I also think this feature stands out better here than in the first (linear) plot. Is it safe to assume this is always the case? Is it worth recommending to use X/Y log coordinates for scree plots?
