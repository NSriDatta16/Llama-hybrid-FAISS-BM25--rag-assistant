There are quite a few books around. The above are all pretty good. I've also done a book focusing specifically on predictive analytics in retailing and financial services. Finlay, Steven (2012). Credit Scoring, Response Modeling and Insurance Rating. A Practical Guide to Forecasting Customer Behavior. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. ISBN 0-230-34776-2. Its certainly not a "Hard core" mathematics book, but it does give a basic introduction to they key methods such as logistic regression, neural networks etc. In particular it focuses on the entire model development process. Starting with project planning and going through to implementation and monitoring of the model post live.
