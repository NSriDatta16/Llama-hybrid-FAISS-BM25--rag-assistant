Are you getting the exception code (not the trapped exception, which you want) when you are running this from within the IDE, or also when you are running from your executable directly? The reason I ask is that the IDE will report the error/exception first and if you do not continue, you will never see the actual exeception trap. It is possible to turn off IDE trapping for certain error types, although I don't like to do that, on average. You can check to see if this is the problem by running your application on its own, outside of the Delphi IDE. Also, the code that you originally wrote should keep all errors from bubbling to the surface, which is probably not what you want. By the same token, if you want to make it look better, you can display the message, as below, then handle it. try CDS.CommandText := 'SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE fieldname = 1'; CDS.Open except on E: Exception do begin ShowMessage(E.Message); // optionally Exit, Abort or what else, to stop execution of the next statements end; end;
