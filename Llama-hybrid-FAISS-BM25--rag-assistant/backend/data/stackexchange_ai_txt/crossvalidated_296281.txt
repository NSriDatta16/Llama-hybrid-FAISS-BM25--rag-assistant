If $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$, the population equivalent of this probability is: $$f(\lambda):=1-P[\lambda-2.5\sqrt{\lambda} \leq X \leq \lambda+2.5\sqrt{\lambda}]$$ In general, we can show that $f(\lambda) \leq 1/(2.5^2) = 0.16$ by Chebyshev inequality, for all $\lambda$, so it is no more than 16%. Whether it is greater or smaller than 5% depends on the value of $\lambda$. Here is some R code that illustrates this: cheb And the result below: For very large $\lambda$, it tends to the same value as for the normal (which is not 5%, as you claim, but closer to 1.2%). What you are suggesting with regards to "outliers" involves estimating $\lambda$ from data, so the empirical coverage of this interval may differ from the one that assumes the true $\lambda$, but the point still stands that the answer to your question is "it depends on the parameter of the Poisson distribution".
