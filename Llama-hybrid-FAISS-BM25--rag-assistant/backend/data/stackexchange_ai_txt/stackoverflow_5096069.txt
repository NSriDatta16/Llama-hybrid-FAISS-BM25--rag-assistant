gTest and multiple main()

I have an Eclipse project. All testcases are in one *.cpp file. The problem is that this way I end up with two main() functions. One for the app itself and one for the testcases. And Eclipse, of course, refuses to build... I would like to keep everything together under one project (and avoid having multiple configurations, SVN repositories etc). Ideally, I would want to force Eclipse to build two executables (one for the app and one for the testcases). I had a quick look at the Eclipse Makefile, but to be honest, I don't quite understand how exactly it works. It is possible to always exclude Main.cpp/Testcases.cpp and build one executable, but it is not very elegant... Anybody with similar experience?
