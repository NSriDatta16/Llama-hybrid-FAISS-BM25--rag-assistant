Can you show us a stack trace when you get the error? How much memory does it consume at the time of the error? I made a memory logger (for FastMM) some time ago which logs all memory between 2 points (using a "startlog" and "endlog" procedure) to find a "soft leak": I was allocation objects in a list but never clearing the list, only when closing the app, so FastMM reported no leak. By using my memory logger I could find those objects (it only logs new allocated memory that is not released before you execute the "endlog" procedure). I will see if I can find this code. Btw: you can get an "out of memory" in 3 other ways: FastMM gives this error when it detects an error while allocating. So not a real "out of memory" but more an internal fastmm error (due to corruption etc) Alloc a very big block (e.g. 1Gb). I once got this because of a stream read error (RemObjects) so it read a wrong size value for a string, so it tried to pre-allocate a (random) big string. Such an error looks weird because in my case my app had allocated about 150Mb so also no real "out of memory" Fragmentation: if you try to alloc a block of 10Mb but Windows cannot find one contineous block of 10Mb then Windows will give an "out of memory". So please give a stack trace and amount of memory used at the time of the error!
