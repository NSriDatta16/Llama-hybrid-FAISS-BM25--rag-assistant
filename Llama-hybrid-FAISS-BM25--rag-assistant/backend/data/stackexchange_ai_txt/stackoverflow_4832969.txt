Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler - Please help me wrap my brain around this

I am working on an application that will have a background process running for quite a while and I want to report progress to the UI. I want to use Tasks in .Net 4.0 so that I gain a working understanding of them. I found a wonderful article by Stephen Cleary that shows this and includes a class, ProgressReporter (article link at the bottom). I could just take the class and use it as-is, but then I don't own the knowledge. The part that I simply cannot understand is regarding the TaskScheduler object. I have read the documentation, but it makes the assumption that I already know what a Scheduler is and I don't, actually. From Stephen's article it appears that if I create a TaskScheduler, using "FromCurrentSynchronizationContext", from the event that's about to kick off the background task, then I can use that TaskScheduler instance from within the async process to create a new task that will then have access to UI controls and will, in fact, be running on the UI thread. At least that's what it looks like from the clean, elegant code. Can someone help me understand what a TaskScheduler (or just a Scheduler) is so that the "FromCurrentSynchronizationContext" makes sense? Thanks so much!
