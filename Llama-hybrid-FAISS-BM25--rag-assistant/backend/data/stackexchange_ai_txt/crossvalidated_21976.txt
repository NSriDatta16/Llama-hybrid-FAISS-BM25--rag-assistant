Effect of uncertainty in a parameter of a probability model on decisions

I am exposing several experimental organisms to a toxin in the food. If the dosage is high enough, they will die. I am examining the number that are dead after a day. For practical reasons, the dosage they get is not directly under my control. I have decided to model the number that are dead after one day as a binomial distribution, Bin(n,p). In order to figure out what p is for my model, I did an experiment with 300 organisms and counted the number that had died after a day. In the experiment of interest, I have exposed them to a potential enhancer of the the toxic effects. I would like to know if substantially more of the organisms have died. For a particular result m, I can easily compute the probability of m or greater. If this is less than 1% then I accept that the putative enhancer works otherwise I reject the hypothesis that the putative enhancer is an actual enhancer of the toxic effects. I am wondering if my analysis of the putative enhancer needs to take into account the uncertainty in the value of p. If so, how would I do it? (I am good with R and able to program if necessary.) Update: I just want to emphasize that I only care if my enhancer works i.e. more organisms die than I'm expecting. Any answer should leave out cases where fewer than expected organisms die.
