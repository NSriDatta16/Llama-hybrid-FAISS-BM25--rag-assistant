Yes, it would still be a fallacy. Here is a very simple figure showing four different situations. In each case red dots represent women, blue dot represent men, horizontal axis represents brain size and vertical axis represents IQ. I generated all four datasets such that: there is always the same difference in mean brain size between men ($22$) and women ($28$ - units are arbitrary). These are population means, but this difference is big enough to be statistically significant with any reasonable sample size; there is always zero difference in mean IQ between men and women (both $100$), and also zero correlation between gender and IQ; the strength of correlation between brain size and IQ varies as shown on the figure. In the upper-left subplot within-gender correlation (computed separately over men and separately over women, then averaged) is $0.3$, like in your quote. In the upper-right subplot overall correlation (over men and women together) is $0.3$. Note that your quote does not specify what the number of $0.33$ refers to. In the lower-left subplot within-gender correlation is $0.9$, like in your hypothetical example; in the lower-right subplot overall correlation is $0.9$. So you can have any value of correlation, and it does not matter if it's computed overall or within-group. Whatever the correlation coefficient, it is very well possible that there is zero correlation between gender and IQ and zero gender difference in mean IQ. Exploring the non-transitivity Let us explore the full space of possibilities, following the approach suggested by @kjetil. Suppose you have three variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and (without loss of generality) suppose that correlation between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is $a>0$ and correlation between $x_2$ and $x_3$ is $b>0$. The question is: what is the minimal possible positive value of the correlation $\lambda$ between $x_1$ and $x_3$? Does it sometimes have to be positive, or can it always be zero? The correlation matrix is $$\mathbf R = \left( \begin{array}{} 1&a&\lambda \\ a&1&b \\ \lambda &b&1 \end{array}\right)$$ and it has to have a non-negative determinant, i.e. $$\mathrm{det} \mathbf R = -\lambda^2 + 2ab\lambda - ( a^2+b^2-1) \ge 0,$$ meaning that $\lambda$ has to lie between $$ab \pm \sqrt{(1-a^2)(1-b^2)}.$$ If both roots are positive, then the minimal possible value of $\lambda$ is equal to the smaller root (and $\lambda$ has to be positive!). If zero is between these two roots, then $\lambda$ can be zero. We can solve this numerically and plot the minimal possible positive value of $\lambda$ for different $a$ and $b$: Informally, we could say that correlations would be transitive if given that $a>0$ and $b>0$, one could conclude that $\lambda>0$. We see that for most of values $a$ and $b$, $\lambda$ can be zero, meaning that correlations are non-transitive. However, for some sufficiently high values of $a$ and $b$, correlation $\lambda$ has to be positive , meaning that there is "some degree of transitivity" after all, but restricted to very high correlations only. Note that both correlations $a$ and $b$ have to be high. We can work out a precise condition for this "transitivity": as mentioned above, the smaller root should be positive, i.e. $ab - \sqrt{(1-a^2)(1-b^2)}>0$, which is equivalent to $a^2+b^2>1$. This is an equation of a circle! And indeed, if you look at the figure above, you will notice that the blue region forms a quarter of a circle. In your specific example, correlation between gender and brain size is quite moderate (perhaps $a=0.5$) and correlation between brain size and IQ is $b=0.33$, which is firmly within the blue region ($a^2+b^2 Relevant figure from the original study You wanted to avoid discussing gender and brains, but I cannot help pointing out that looking at the full figure from the original article ( Gur et al. 1999 ), one can see that whereas there is no gender difference in verbal IQ score, there is an obvious and significant difference in spatial IQ score! Compare subplots D and F.
