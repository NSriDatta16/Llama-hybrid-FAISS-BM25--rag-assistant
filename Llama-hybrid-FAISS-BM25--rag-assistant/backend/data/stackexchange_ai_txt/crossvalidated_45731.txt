Random forest is overfitting

I am trying to use Random Forest Regression in scikits-learn. The problem is I am getting a really high test error: train MSE, 4.64, test MSE: 252.25. This is how my data looks: (blue:real data, green:predicted): I am using 90% for training and 10% for test. This is the code I am using after trying several parameter combinations: rf = rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, max_features=2, max_depth=1000, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, n_jobs=-1) test_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, rf.predict(X_test)) train_mse = mean_squared_error(y_train, rf.predict(X_train)) print("train MSE, %.4f, test MSE: %.4f" % (train_mse, test_mse)) plot(rf.predict(X)) plot(y) What are possible strategies to improve my fitting? Is there something else I can do to extract the underlying model? It seems incredible to me that after so many repetitions of the same pattern the model behaves so badly with new data. Do I have any hope at all trying to fit this data?
