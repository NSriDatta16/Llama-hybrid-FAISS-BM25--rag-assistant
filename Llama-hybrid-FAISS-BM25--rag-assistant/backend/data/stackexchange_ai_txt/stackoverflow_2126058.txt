Additionally, if you have a reference to the ListBoxControl already, and you also have the data item representing the row (I assume so since you have the binding, and thus can drag it out of the DataContext on the button), you can ask the ItemsContainerGenerator. ContainerFromItem to give you give you the actual UIElement for the row. The itemcontainergenerator can be found as a property on the listview itself. (technically the itemscontrol, since thats where it's defined)
