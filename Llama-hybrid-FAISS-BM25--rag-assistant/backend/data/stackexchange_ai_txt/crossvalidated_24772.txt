Finding the Bayesian classifier for a bivariate Gaussian distribution

Very close to: Joint Gaussian of two Gaussians I am trying to find the Bayesian classifier for two classes given by the following bivariate Gaussian distributions: $$p(x|c_1) = N(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$$ $$p(x|c_2) = N(\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$$ What is the formula and the methodology I should use to do this? I am confused with out a proper understanding on a formula to do that at the moment. Prior probabilities of $c_1$ and $c_2$ are 0.5 respectively. FYI: μ1 = ( 2 Σ1 = (2 0 2 ) 0 1) μ2 = ( 2 Σ1 = (4 0 4 ) 0 2)
