Survival analysis with unobserved right censoring

Assume we have a tire shop and would like to build a survival curve for the lifetime of our tires.Once we know how long our tires are useful, we can send push notifications prompting customers to get their tires replaced. We know when our tires have been installed, and we have data on change outs with dates. However, some customers buy tires from us then at an unknown time they get their tires replaced at a different store and never do business with us again. So, until we see the customer for tire replacement, we do not know if their last set of tires is still in use or has been changed out elsewhere. Can we still use records where 'death' is unobserved in this case? How so? Thank you for giving this the once over fellow gangsters of data.
