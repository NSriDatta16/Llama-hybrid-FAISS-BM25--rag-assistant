Unless your users are going to an open folder with a directory listing of your images, I don't think folder structure will significantly increase or decrease retrieval speeds for your users. As other people have said, make sure indexing is turned on. However, if I were you, I'd look into writing (or copying and pasting) a service that dynamically serves the images, rather than storing them directly in your web file structure. Look into using LibGD within PHP -- it should be preinstalled on most LAMP servers. Disadvantages: Serving the images via a service will be a tad slower than providing direct links If you use a backend image store, such as a database, it could crash and render all of your images temporarily unavailable Advantages: You'll save storage space by dynamically resizing the images to thumbnails, and make maintenance easier Generally, processor speed is cheaper than storage space Using URL rewriting, you can even turn ugly URLs such as /imageServer.php?userID=12345imageId=67890&size=full into something sleeker and more transparent to your users: /jeremyZX/images/myPhoto.jpg /jeremyZX/images/tn/myPhoto.jpg This will give the apperance of an entire directory structure of images, whereas they're really stored in whatever backend format you'd like.
