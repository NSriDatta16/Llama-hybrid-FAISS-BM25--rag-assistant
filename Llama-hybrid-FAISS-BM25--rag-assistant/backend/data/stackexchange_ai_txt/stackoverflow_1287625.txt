How to avoid messages like "Profiler Agent Warning: Failed to lookup cached class org/apache/derby..." when profiling with visualvm?

When trying to monitor a Java application using visualvm I can't obtain useful information, because a lot of my classes (but not only mine) can't be instrumented, displaying the following message: Profiler Agent Warning: Failed to lookup cached class org/apache/derby/impl/services/locks/ActiveLock Thus, the profiler doesn't show any information about the method invocation to those classes :-( Is there any workaround for this problem? Some details: OS: Linux 64 bit (Ubuntu 8.10) Java: sun jdk 1.6.0.14 (64 bit) VisualVM: 1.1.1 Application: running on top of Tomcat 5.5.17
