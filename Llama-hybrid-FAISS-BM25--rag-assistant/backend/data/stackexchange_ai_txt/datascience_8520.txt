You can take a look at Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX). An annual competition with number of different tasks from MIR. The most relevant to your question being Audio Key Detection. Explanation papers for the used approaches can be found here . In terms of library for extracting knowledge from audio signal I'd recommend Essentia . There are numerous features you can compute over time window in a track including tonal descriptors (key and scale). Once you've built discriminative representation of a track for your task you can use any supervised classification model fed with labeled data. There are several musical datasets on the web labeled with track information. Take a look at GTZAN, each track has genre, tempo and key as meta.
