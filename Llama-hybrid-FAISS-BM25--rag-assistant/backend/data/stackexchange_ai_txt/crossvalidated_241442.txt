How can one estimate compute requirements for Machine Learning algorithms?

Has anyone developed formulas or rules of thumb for estimating CPU, memory and time requirements for running various Machine Learning algorithms (or families of algorithms), with respect to training and predictionâ€“classification? I realize algorithm implementations vary and a variety of parameters can be tuned, thus affecting the requirements, but I'm interested in ballpark estimates. I'm aiming for a generalized view of the problem, e.g. constructing functions with parameters for size of the input-data, and so on.
