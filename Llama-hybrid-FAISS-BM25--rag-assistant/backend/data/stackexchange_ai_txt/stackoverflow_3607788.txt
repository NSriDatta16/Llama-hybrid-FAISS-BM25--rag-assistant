You need two things: some means of serializing the selection and some means of saving it. Cookies and/or local storage would do for the saving part. For the serializing/deserializing, I'd suggest creating some kind of path through the DOM using child node index at each level to specify the selection boundaries. See this answer to a similar question: Calculating text selection offsets in nest elements in Javascript Edit: summary of the linked solution The user's selection can be expressed as a Range object. A Range has a start and end boundary, each expressed in terms of an offset within a node. What the the answer I linked to is suggesting is serializing each boundary as a path though the DOM that represents the node, coupled with the offset. For example, for the following document with the selection boundaries represented by | : Foo On|e t|wo ... you could represent the selection start boundary as "1/0:2" , meaning offset 2 within the child node at position 0 of the child node at position 1 in the document root. Similarly the end boundary would be "1/1/0:1" . You could represent the whole thing JSON as '{"start":"1/0:2",end:"1/1/0:1"}' .
