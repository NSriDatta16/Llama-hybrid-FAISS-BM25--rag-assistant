In simple terms, multiagent research tries to design system composed of autonomous agents. That is, you have a bunch of robots/people/software-agents around, each of which can take its own actions but can only "see" stuff that is around him, how do get the system to behave as you want? Example, Given a bunch of robots with limited sensing capabilities, how do you get them to monitor a field for enemies? to find all the mines in a field? Given a bunch of people, how do you get them to maximize the happiness of the least happy person? without taking away their freedom. Given a group of people, how do you set up a meeting time(s) that maximizes their happiness? without revealing their private information? Some of these questions might appear really easy to solve, but they are not. Multiagent research mixes techniques from game theory, Economics, artificial intelligence, and sometimes even Biology in order to answer these questions. If you want more details, I have a free textbook that I am working on called Fundamentals of Multiagent Systems .
