What is my best option for submitting code to github from within an NTLM firewall?

I'm thinking of using github to more nicely organise some of my code projects (i'm on a mission to implement all the major crypto algorithms in c, c#, js, golang, and ruby - but that's another story...). But i'm stuck behind an NTLM firewall. Any suggestions for how i'd check code in? Some kind of configuration of tortoisegit and ntlmaps to work through the firewall? I'd even be happy to upload code through a web form, although i don't think github works that way. Thanks all
