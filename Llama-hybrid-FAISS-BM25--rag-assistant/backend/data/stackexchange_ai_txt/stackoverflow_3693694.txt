What are the implications of node.js?

I've been reading about node.js lately. I've seen many articles about how it's really great and all from some prominent people. Given the inertia that this project seems to have, and that I am currently learning javascript and jQuery, the project has gotten my attention. I get that many people are excited about it, but I don't quite understand what the implications are. I understand that it is event driven and non-blocking and all of that, but where I'm confused is in regards to its intent. Does node.js mean that we now have a foundation to run Javascript on the server-side, so that later maybe someone will create the Ruby on Rails or ASP.NET MVC equivalent for node.js/Javascript? Perhaps there already are web frameworks out there, but if so I haven't heard the hype machine yet. I hope my question is clear.
