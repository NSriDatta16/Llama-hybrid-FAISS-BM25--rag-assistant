Can simple vector distance work as a SVM kernel?

I'm considering using the following simple function as an SVM kernel. It basically computes the distance between the 2 input vectors (norm): $K(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = \left\| \vec{x}_1- \vec{x}_2 \right\|$, where $\vec{x}_1$ and $\vec{x}_2$ are $N$-dimensional vectors. I'm not familiar with documentation of such a kernel. Is it valid? Anyone experienced with such a kernel?
