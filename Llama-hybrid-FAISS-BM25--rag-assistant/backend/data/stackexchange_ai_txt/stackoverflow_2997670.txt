What -W values in gcc correspond to which actual warnings?

Preamble: I know, disabling warnings is not a good idea. Anyway, I have a technical question about this. Using GCC 3.3.6, I get the following warning: choosing ... over ... because conversion sequence for the argument is better. Now, I want to disable this warning as described in gcc warning options by providing an argument like -Wno-theNameOfTheWarning But I don't know the name of the warning. How can I find out the name of the option that disables this warning? I am not able to fix the warning, because it occurs in a header of an external library that can not be changed. It is in boost serialization ( rx(s, count) ): template inline void load_collection(Archive & ar, Container &s) { s.clear(); // retrieve number of elements collection_size_type count; unsigned int item_version; ar >> BOOST_SERIALIZATION_NVP(count); if(3 > BOOST_SERIALIZATION_NVP(item_version); else item_version = 0; R rx; rx(s, count); std::size_t c = count; InputFunction ifunc; while(c-- > 0){ ifunc(ar, s, item_version); } } I have already tried #pragma GCC system_header but this had no effect. Using -isystem instead of -I also does not work. The general question remains is: I know the text of the warning message. But I do not know the correlation to the gcc warning options .
