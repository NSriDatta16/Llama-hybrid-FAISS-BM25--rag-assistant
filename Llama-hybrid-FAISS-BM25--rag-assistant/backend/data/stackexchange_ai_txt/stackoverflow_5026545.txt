You have the right idea, get a baseline measurement, tweak and then measure again. I made a quick routine that runs a query X times (normally 20 or so) and averages out the response time. That way I can see if I am making an improvement. Before you start make sure that you have compacted the access database as this often helps to speed things up. After that I would look at indexes and what queries are being run. A common mistake is to bind a form to a whole table, it works fine when the app is small but once you have lots of records it can drag.
