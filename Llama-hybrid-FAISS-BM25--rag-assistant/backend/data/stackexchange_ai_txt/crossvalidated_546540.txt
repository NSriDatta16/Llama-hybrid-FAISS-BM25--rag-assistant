Scaling features for neural network input

I have a df with many features that take both negative and positive values.For example a feature may have values in range (-10 , 10).For each feature which has negative values the negative sign means direction and this -10 is actually a larger value than - 5. After finilizing my model i tried many scaling techniques such as Minmaxscaler from (0,1) and mean max scaler from (-1,1),robust scaler,standarization and found the minmaxscaler from (0,1) has the best results. My concern is this: Scaling the data with this technique does not account for the true meaning of my feature as seen belo and -2 will be smaller than -1 after scaling to (0,1). Is there a way to enforce this rule(negative means only direction) during my scaling process?
