How do I change the engine to MyISAM when using a SOURCE import in mysql? You could only edit a source file then. If an engine is explicitly specified for CREATE TABLE (and I bet it is) then it is the only solution. It currently defaults to InnoDB. would there be any difference between the speed of the import between the engines for say a 5gb .sql file? There should be no significant difference between speed of import to different storage engines, but you could save CPU cycles if you remove all indexes and recreate them right after you have imported all the data.
