Generating a Change Log from Subversion Logs and integrating with Jira

We use Subversion for version control and Jira for tickets. All our commit messages have a Jira ticket id in it. The repository has a traditional organization with a main trunk and a version branch. I'd like to answer this question: Which closed ticket items entered in this release? See that there are some caveats, like when an item is committed in a release branch and in the main trunk. Is there a tool that already does it for me? Or should I write my own Subversion log analyzer tool?
