If you want to use the readily available services in Windows itself, check out this article A New Task Scheduler Task Library on CodeProject on how to create scheuled tasks in Windows from your C# application. You probably have more flexibility and power if you use C# and scheduled tasks in Windows, rather than limiting yourself to what can be done in SQL Server. SQL Server Agent Jobs are great - for database specific stuff, mostly - maintenance plans and so forth.
