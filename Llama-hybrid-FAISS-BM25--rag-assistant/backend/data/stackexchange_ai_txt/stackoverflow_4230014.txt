What other debug arguments are there besides NSZombieEnabled?

I am having issues with something being released or not retained, and Xcode will not show me exactly where the error is at. I am working collaboratively with an individual who has a horribly organized project, and I think Xcode is even freaking out, because [CALAyer release] is thrown, but no explanation of what or where.
