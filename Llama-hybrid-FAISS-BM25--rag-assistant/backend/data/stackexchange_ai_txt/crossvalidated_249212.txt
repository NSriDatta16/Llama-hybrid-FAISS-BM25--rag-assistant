Discrete distribution model

I am wondering if its possible to model or fit a discrete distribution where there are only three possible outcomes: 0, 1, and 3. These outcomes are numbers which result from a game. I get hung up on the fact that 2 is not an allowed outcome and don't really see how to do it. A sample table is below. I will also mention that the intention is to determine the average and error on that average, so if there is an alternate method I am oblivious to, please let me know. Obs | Counts -------------- 0 | 35 1 | 22 3 | 25 Any help is appreciated.
