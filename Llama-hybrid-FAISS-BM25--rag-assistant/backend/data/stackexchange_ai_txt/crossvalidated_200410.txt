Is Principal Component Analysis a parametric method?

Principal component analysis assumes that the features are distributed by a Gaussian distribution. Does this make Principal Component Analysis a parametric approach? I can't seem to find a concrete answer saying that PCA is indeed a parametric approach. As we know, that parametric approaches assume some distribution of the input data.
