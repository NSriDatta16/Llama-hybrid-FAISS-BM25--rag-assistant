To know that the system is non-stationary and that differencing may help, you calculate ACF and PACF. Then, after differencing, you calculate ACF and PACF again to see if they are decaying relatively rapidly and the time series is stationary. If yes, you use them for identification of the modeling framework for the mean process (AR vs MA vs ARMA). You use them on squared residuals for identification of the modeling framework for the variance (constant vs ARCH vs GARCH)... Note, ACF & PACF should not be used solely. They are just a part of the model selection toolkit. Other methods to look at: Box-Ljung test on residuals, AIC , BIC , the test on whether Implied_CDF_of_Model_Forecast(model forecast at time t) is uniformly distributed on [0,1]. \2. ACF and PACF are not in competition. They should be used jointly in decision making. Check out the Box-Jenkins approach.
