Bounds checking for the center of a UIView while dragging it around

I have UIView elements that i want to drag around the screen. But i want that no-matter what, their center should be always inside the bounds of their superview. I added to them an UIPanGestureRecognizer and i making the bounds checking as follows: -(void) dragInProgress : (UIPanGestureRecognizer *) recognizer { if ([self.delegate hallElement:self shouldMove:recognizer]) { CGPoint translation = [recognizer translationInView:self.view.superview]; CGPoint currentCenter = self.view.center; CGFloat maxX = self.view.superview.bounds.size.width; if (currentCenter.x + translation.x = maxX ) { translation.x = (maxX - currentCenter.x - 1); } CGFloat maxY = self.view.superview.bounds.size.height; if (currentCenter.y + translation.y = maxY ) { translation.y = (maxY - currentCenter.y - 1); } [recognizer setTranslation:translation inView:self.view.superview]; CGPoint translationInViewCoordiateSystem = [recognizer translationInView:self.view]; self.view.transform = CGAffineTransformTranslate(self.view.transform, translationInViewCoordiateSystem.x , translationInViewCoordiateSystem.y ); [recognizer setTranslation:CGPointZero inView:self.view]; } } But this bound checking is not working at the best case, and usually results in weird behavior. How can i ensure that the center will remain within the bounds of the superview?
