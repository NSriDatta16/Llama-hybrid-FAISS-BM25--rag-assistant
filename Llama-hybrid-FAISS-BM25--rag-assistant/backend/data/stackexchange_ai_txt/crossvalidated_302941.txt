The actions the agent takes are still the same: buy, sell, hold. That's all you can do. I don't think there is any need for augmentation of the action space. You can e.g. take that all into account for the reward. Make it less if you hold a buy position in a down trend and higher. This will have the behavior emerge in a natural way, if you train it properly. So you should rather adapt the reward function to shape the agent in a way you want it to be.
