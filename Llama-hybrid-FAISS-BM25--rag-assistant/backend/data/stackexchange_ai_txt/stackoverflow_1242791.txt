Robert is correct. Indexing expressions are compiled to pointer arithmetic expressions and so there's no difference. What can have an impact is access order however, and so you may want to implement things yourself so you can control the access order. For example column first vs row first forms. On modern processors, accessing large arrays at various strides can have unexpected performance differences. Sequential access is always fastest, and other strides can be up to 30 times slower due to cache interactions. Multi dimensional arrays where the inner dimensions are a power of two often have poor performance because of they way they interact with the cache associativity. To understand these issues there's no real substitute for doing measurement.
