Basically you instrument your code to analyze your software as it is running (dynamic) rather than just analyzing the software without running (static). Also see this JavaOne presentation comparing the two . Valgrind is one example dynamic analysis tool for C. You could also use code coverage tools like Cobertura or EMMA for Java analysis. From Wikipedia's definition of dynamic program analysis : Dynamic program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed with executing programs built from that software on a real or virtual processor (analysis performed without executing programs is known as static code analysis). Dynamic program analysis tools may require loading of special libraries or even recompilation of program code.
