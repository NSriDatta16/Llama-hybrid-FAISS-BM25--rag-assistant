I like to keep all of the logic in a single, high-level domain (that being the app written in php). MySQL is a storage tank--as it should stay. I prefer to use a class such as http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfDateTime2Plugin and then ->dump() or ->get() to the appropriate format anyways. It's much faster and easier to write (and extend) high level manipulations in the application domain than it is using the static mysql interface. PostgreSQL's interface cleans up on MySQL. But we're still talking about MySQL here because it's popular. Which brings up an important consideration. When writing code or designing systems, often it makes sense to observe the convention, even if it is less computationally efficient than other less known options. This is important because it favours a different kind of efficiency--readability for others. Often readability and understandability inefficiencies account for larger business expenses (and time) than do computational inefficiencies. I'm all for trying INTs though. Please give it a shot and write about your findings. Cheers
