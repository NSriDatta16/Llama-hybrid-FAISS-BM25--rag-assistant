Conditional logistic regression is not a model that's been widely developed in a lot of software packages, and requiring results for screening diagnostics such as sens/spec from conditional is more problematic. For your first question, yes you could implement a cluster variable to represent each cluster of a case and its controls, and then adjust a regular logistic model by the cluster variable. When time is involved in e.g. clinical trial data, most of the longitudinal regression models allow you to set a cluster id for subjects in order to appropriately determine the regression coefficient standard errors based on within-cluster, i.e., within matched sets, correlation between covariates. You might consider evaluating the model using GEE regression, but without using a time-treatment interaction term. You would be able to specify a logit family link (logistic), Gaussian (normal), Poisson, etc. as well as specify the correlation structure between outcomes within each matched set like exchangeable, autoregressive, independent, unstructured. So perhaps consider using a panel data approach via longitudinal regression with a logit family link, and specify that e.g. each of the four data records for the first matched set (1 case, 3 controls) has an ID=1, the same covariate values, but the case (first record) has y=1, and records 2-4 have y=0. This will preserve within matches set correlation, but may not get you close to sens/spec and marker AUC, as GEE commonly doesn't output sens/spec/AUC, but you may find a package that does. Many packages allow you to use a cluster variable (i.e, matched set number) in the majority regression models. So firstly, start looking for software that will allow use of a cluster ID within logistic regression, and then merely set the ID=1 for the first 4 subjects in matched set one. The rest is a variation on a theme. Going back to the need for having a conditional logistic package capable of running screening diagnostics (sens/spec/AUC) may bomb out. I fully programmed conditional logistic years ago for matched case-control sets, but never developed screening diagnostics for it. For your second question, yes, employ standard logistic regression.
