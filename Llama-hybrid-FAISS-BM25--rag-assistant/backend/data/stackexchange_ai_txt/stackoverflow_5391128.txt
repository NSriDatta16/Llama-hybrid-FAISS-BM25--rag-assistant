Drag listbox items down to autoload data on WP7

I'm working on a Windows Phone 7 project with a listbox filled with RSS news, I want to be able to drag items down in the list box (to drag the first item down the top border) in order to load new items feeds... I've seen this note http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/150166/Loading-Data-when-the-User-Scrolls-to-the-End-of-a.aspx , which works great to load data at the end of the ListBox, I'm trying to do the opposite; to load items at the beginning of the listbox... In the listener attached to the ScrollViewer, following condition is used to detect that end of listbox is reached: bool atBottom = scrollViewer.VerticalOffset >= scrollViewer.ScrollableHeight; tried to change it to bool atBottom = scrollViewer.VerticalOffset However, it loads once I reach the top of the list, but I need to drag the top item in order to do the loading... Any Advise...
