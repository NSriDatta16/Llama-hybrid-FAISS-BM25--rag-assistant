get referer of website that is requesting your js file

I have an embed script that simply does this: document.write(unescape('%3Cscript src="' + mp_protocol + 'blah.cloudapp.net/js?location="' + window.location +' type="text/javascript"%3E%3C/script%3E')); As you can see right now the URL of the webpage that is embedding the code is passed in using window.location. But this can easily be edited by the client. I wanted to know if I can get the referrer instead of passing the url. I wasn't sure if referring info would be passed since this script is embedded? (yes, you can also fake referrers... but that is a bit more effort than I think most people will want).
