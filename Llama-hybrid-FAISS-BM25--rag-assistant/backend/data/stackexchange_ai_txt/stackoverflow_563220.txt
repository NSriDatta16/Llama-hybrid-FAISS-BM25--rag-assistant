No, this is not possible[*] with Drupal 5 / Views 1. With Drupal 6 / Views 2, you get the option to create multiple View "Displays", each of which can have customized sorting (among other things). [*] Well, technically, you /could/ do it, by creating a module that implements a new "View Type" that randomizes the rows before displaying them (and select that for the Block, and the normal View Type for the page), but I encourage you to instead put the effort into upgrading your site to Drupal 6.
