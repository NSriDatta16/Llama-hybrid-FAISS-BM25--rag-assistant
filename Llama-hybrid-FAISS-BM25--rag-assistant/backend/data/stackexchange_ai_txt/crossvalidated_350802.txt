I'm not an expert on Lee-Carter model, but from what I gasp, $\alpha_x$ is the mean per age group, $\beta_x$ is the effect per age group and $\kappa_t$ is the effect per time. As noted in the Understanding the Lee-Carter Mortality Forecasting Method paper by Girosi and King (I adapted the notation): The constraint $\sum_t \kappa_t = 0$ immediately implies that the parameter $\alpha_x$ is simply the empirical average over time of the age profile in age group $x$ . . . We therefore rewrite the model in terms of the mean centered log-mortality rate . . . What leads to the following model $$ \log \tilde{m_{xt}} = \beta_x \kappa_t +\varepsilon_{xt} $$ where $\log \tilde{m_{xt}}$ is the centered $\log m_{xt}$, what looses the constraint on $\kappa_t$. As about $\beta_x$, you can use Dirichlet distribution for this parameter, as it already satisfies the constraint and is a common choice for a "distribution over probabilities".
