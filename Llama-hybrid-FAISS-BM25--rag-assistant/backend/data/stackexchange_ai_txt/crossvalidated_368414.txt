A quick google search with "confidence intervals for acfs" yielded Janet M. Box-Steffensmeier, John R. Freeman, Matthew P. Hitt, Jon C. W. Pevehouse: Time Series Analysis for the Social Sciences . In there, on page 38, the standard error of an AC estimator at lag k is stated to be $AC_{SE,k} = \sqrt{N^{-1}\left(1+2\sum_{i=1}^k[AC_i^2] \right)}$ where $AC_i$ is the AC esimate at lag i and N is the number of time steps in your sample. This is assuming that the true underlying process is actually MA. Assuming asympotic normality of the AC estimator, you can calculate the confidence intervals at each lag then as $CI_{AC_{k}} = [AC_{k} - 1.96\times\dfrac{AC_{SE,k}}{\sqrt{N}}, AC_{k} + 1.96\times\dfrac{AC_{SE,k}}{\sqrt{N}}]$ .
