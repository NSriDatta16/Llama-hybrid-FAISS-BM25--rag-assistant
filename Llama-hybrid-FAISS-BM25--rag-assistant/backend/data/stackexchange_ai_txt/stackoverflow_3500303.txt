I would like to know about some template engine for maven too, but maybe you don't need maven at first for that. There is a way to include another xml file in a xml file : http://bobcat.webappcabaret.net/javachina/faq/xml_01.htm#dtd_Q408 ]> &xmlfrag; xmlfrag.txt(well formed xml fragment without xml decl) text1 text2 else, for merging xml resources between dependencies/modules in maven, you can use maven-shade-plugin (with the resource transformer). In your case : ... org.apache.maven.plugins maven-shade-plugin 1.4 package shade file.xml false --> ... to merge module1/src/main/resources/file.xml and module2/src/main/resources/file.xml (depending on dependencies) in module3/src/main/resources/file.xml.
