SHORT ANSWER: If (and only if) the statistical distribution of a model's noise (error) can be described using only linear combinations of observations, factors and/or predictors, that model is linear. Otherwise, it is not. People often hear someone in an academic setting state that linearity is "in the parameters," which does get to the point of linearity. But what does that really mean? The answer to this question requires a background in abstract algebra to understand. If a model has the following form: $$ y = \beta x + \epsilon ,$$ this "normally" (pun intended) implies that its noise (a.k.a. the model error) has a Gaussian distribution with mean $y - \beta x$ , e.g.: $$ \epsilon \sim N(y - \beta x, 1) .$$ after proper "normalization" to obtain a variance of 1 (pun not intended). NOTE: the dimensions of $y$ and $x$ must be the same, and if they are not scalars, $x$ becomes a vector or matrix, usually written in uppercase as $X$ to avoid confusion. The notation above usually implies that $\beta$ is a parameter (or vector/matrix of parameters). A parameter is not what is measured physically (and often transformed via arithmetic or algebra afterward); those quantities are in $x$ . Linearity is an algebraic concept, involving items called vectors and scalars (and every scalar is also a vector in an abstract sense, by the way). It means that you can form what are known as "linear combinations" of vectors and remain within the "vector space" where you began. Therefore, if (and only if) you can parametrize your model in the format above such that each parameter in $\beta$ is a scalar, and such that the noise and each predictor in $x$ is a vector (sometimes 1-dimensional), then your model is linear. But what does it mean to be a scalar or a vector, you may ask? A scalar is literally what it claims to be: something which causes a change in magnitude or scale. In the sense of abstract algebra, it specifically scales things called vectors--for example, real numbers are scalars, and they are also vectors because they can be scaled by any field of scalars, even themselves. If a predictor quantity can be multiplied by a parameter scalar (shrunk or expanded) and can also be added to other predictor quantities (either with or without scalar multiplication before or afterward) then the predictor is a vector in a linear (vector) space. If you treat all your predictors as vectors and all your parameters as scalars, you can create linear combinations of them, and thereby (and in no other way) you can create a linear model.
