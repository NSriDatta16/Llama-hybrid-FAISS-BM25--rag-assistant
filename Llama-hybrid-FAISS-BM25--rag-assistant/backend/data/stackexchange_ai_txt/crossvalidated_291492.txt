How can Logistic Regression produce curves that aren't traditional functions?

I think I have some fundamental confusion about how the functions in Logistic regression work (or maybe just functions as a whole). How is it that the function h(x) produces the curve seen in the left of the image? I see that this is a plot of two variables but then these two variables (x1 & x2) are also arguments of the function itself. I know standard functions of one variable map to one output but this function clearly isn't doing that-- and I'm not totally sure why. My intuition is that the blue/pink curve isn't really plotted on this graph but rather is a representation (circles and X's) that get mapped to values in the next dimension (3rd) of the graph. Is this reasoning faulty and am I just missing something? Thanks for any insight/intuition.
