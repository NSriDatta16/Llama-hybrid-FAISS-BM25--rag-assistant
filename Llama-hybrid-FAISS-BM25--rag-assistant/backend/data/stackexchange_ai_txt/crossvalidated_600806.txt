Regression model has very high const VIF value where as the other features have value between less than 4. Should I drop const?

I am a beginner in modelling. I have created a linear regression model using statsmodel and I see the const has VIF value around 124 where as the other features have value around 4. I already referred to a post and that says this is scaling issue. But I have used MinMaxScaler and all the features are between 0-1. Is this because the const is highly correlated with my features and I should drop it? If not, please help me understand what else might be the reason. Here is the kaggle norebook link. Open for suggestions on my work. https://www.kaggle.com/sownikturaga96/housing-prices-dataset-modelling Thank you.
