Cumulative standard deviation of variables with different distribution

Suppose we have a set of basketball players, each of which have 9 associated performance categories. Each of these categories has a different distribution. I want to find a good way to represent how far away each player is from the "average player". My method so far has been to calculate the number of standard deviations from the mean for each category (z-score), then take the sum of them. This number is the total number of standard deviations away from the mean across all 9 categories for a single player. Is this number meaningful as a way to measure total deviation from an average player when each of the 9 categories has a different distribution?
