Lets say you have a time series data 42 observations. Observation 7 to 13 have step(level shift) intervention and observations 29 to 35 have step intervention of 5 units. The remainder observations are 0. As an example, see below chart for simulated data with actual and actual + error. If you would like to model this data as a intervention analysis using arima transfer function, you simply need to create a dummy coded variable with 1's for 7 to 13 and 1's for 29 to 35 and pass this is a step intervention in ARIMAX model. I don't know how to use R for transfer function modeling, so I used SAS. See below the actual and predicted data. The ARIMAX approximated the data very well. See below the SAS code that I used to create the data and as well as the ARIMAX. If your second intervention has a first intervention has a decaying effect, all you need to do is create a second intervention variable at the end of first step function and code it appropriately. Hopefully this helped. data temp; input actual @@; error = rand("NORMAL"); datalines; 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; run; data temp; set temp; actual_error = actual+error; *add random error; if 7 EDIT: as b_miner would like to know how to model this with temporary level shift with a linear decay, I have modified the example. I have shown only the first level shift, the second level shift could be easily added. If you are looking for a decay other than a linear decay then it is fairly easy to do, just use a step+gradual permanent decay function using transfer function. Intervention modeling is more of an art than science. You assume a shape, test the hypothesis, if acceptable move on else change the shape. Intervention modeling is deterministic in nature. If you are interested in learning more about transfer function modeling/intervention detection, I would highly recommend Forecasting-Dynamic-Regression-Models-Pankratz . This text has all the different types of intervention models possible, in addition to transfer function modeling. Hope this helps. data temp; input actual @@; error = rand("NORMAL"); datalines; 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4.1 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.75 1.25 0.75 0.25 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; run; data temp; set temp; retain ramp 0; actual_error = actual+error; *add random error; if 7
