The principal components you calculated from your test set are the axes of a two dimensional space into which you projected your training data. You need to project the test set into this space (defined by the principal components of your training data) to calculate predictions in your model. I don't have weka handy so I can't poke around the specific PCA implementation there, but the basic idea is that you need project the test data into the same space you projected your training data into. I'm guessing that the weka output includes a matrix of your eigenvectors. If we call this matrix $M$ and your training data $X_{train}$, you project your training data into this space via: $X_{train}^*=X_{train} M[,1:2]$ Just do the same thing to project your test data onto your principal components: $X_{test}^*=X_{test} M[,1:2]$ Where $M[,1:2]$ is the matrix produced when we strip off all but the first two columns of $M$
