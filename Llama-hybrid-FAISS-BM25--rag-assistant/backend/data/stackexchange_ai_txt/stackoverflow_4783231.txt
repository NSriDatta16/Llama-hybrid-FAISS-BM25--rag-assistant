At the end of your SQL statement, it looks like you're including everyone with a first name starting with "Meg", which is why Meg Meg and Megan Fox both match. Try shortening your WHERE clause to: WHERE users_friends.bID='1' AND users_friends.type = 'friend' AND users_friends.accepted = '1' AND ( (users.firstname = 'Meg' AND users.lastname='Meg') OR (users.firstname LIKE 'Meg%' AND users.lastname LIKE 'Meg%'))
