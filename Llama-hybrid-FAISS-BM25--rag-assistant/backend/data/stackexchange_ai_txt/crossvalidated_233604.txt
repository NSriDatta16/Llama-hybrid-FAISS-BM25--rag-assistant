I also faced same dilemma when I was solving a problem. I didn't try both the architecture, but my take is, if the input variable is discrete then the output function of neural network will have the characteristic of impulse function and neural network is good at modeling impulse function. In fact any function can be modeled with neural network with varying precision depending on complexity of neural network. The only difference is, in first architecture , you have increase the number of input so you more number of weight in first hidden layer's node to model the impulse function but for the second architecture you need more number of node in hidden layer compared to first architecture to get same performance.
