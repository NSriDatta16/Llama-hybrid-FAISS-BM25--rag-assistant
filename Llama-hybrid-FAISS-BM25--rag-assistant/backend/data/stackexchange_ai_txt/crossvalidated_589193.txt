I am not able to understand how did the elementwise multiplication came into the picture of backpropagation in neural networks

I have understood the backpropagation algorithm along with the chain rule well enough that I can derive it on my own, but I don't understand where the elementwise multiplication came from and how does it affect the final result. When I derived it, I didn't consider it as elementwise multiplication, this is where I might be wrong. How do we arrive at elementwise multiplication from matrix multiplication ?
