Entity Framework 4 load Record by ID

So I am looking at creating a generic Interface to interact with my DataStorage of my objects one that I can swap out to use EF4 or SubSonic or NHibernate or some NoSQL option. So I have an ERD and every table has an auto incrementing int column "TableNameID" that is the primary key I am trying to figure out how to get a single record from the DB using the primary key in a Generic method public T GetSingle (int primaryKey) where T : class How do you do this using EF4?
