There have already been a lot of great points in favor of PostgreSQL, but I am going to add 1 more: PostgreSQL has the best documentation of any database product I have worked with. This is why the documentation stands out: It actually teaches you the basics of SQL It is easy to understand It has good examples It is very well organized It isn't just a feature list with tech notes It is all around, well written Other vendors should be ashamed of what they try and a pass off as documentation.
