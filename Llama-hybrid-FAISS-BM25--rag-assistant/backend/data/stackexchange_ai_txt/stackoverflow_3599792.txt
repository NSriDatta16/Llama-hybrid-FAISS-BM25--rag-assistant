ClearCase for source code control?

I have never used ClearCase, but have used Subversion and for a short period of time Perforce. The IT department in our company officially supports ClearCase and some people have their code checked in it and some people sort of use it as a back up storage. I am still undecided on weather to use ClearCase itself or setup my own repository using Subverison. It will be a two or maximum of three person developer team. From people whom I have heard from, I got this perception that ClearCase is complex and is not worth learning as it might not increase the productivity. Is it true or is it wrong? Thanks...
