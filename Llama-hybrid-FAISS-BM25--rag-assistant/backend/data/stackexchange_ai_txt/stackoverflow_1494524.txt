Separate Admin/User authentication system in Django

I've recently started learning/using django; I'm trying to figure out a way to have two separate authentications systems for administrators and users. Rather than create a whole new auth system, I'd like to leverage django's built-in functionality (i.e. session management, @login_required decorator, etc.). Specifically, I want to have two separate login tables - one for admins, one for users. The admin login table should be the default table that django generates with its default fields (ie. id, username, email, is_staff, etc. ). The user table, on the other hand, I want to have only 5 fields - id, email, password, first_name, last_name . Furthermore, I want to use django built-in session management for both login tables and the @login_required decorator for their respective views. Lastly, I want two separate and distinct login forms for admins and users. Anyone have any suggestions on how I can achieve my goal or know of any articles/examples that could help me along?
