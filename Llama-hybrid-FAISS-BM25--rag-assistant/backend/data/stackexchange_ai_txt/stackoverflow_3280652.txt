URL fragments are purely client side. The RequestDispatcher#forward() is entirely server-side. The in the forward given URL won't be sent to the client side. You can however redirect to the given URL using HttpServletResponse#sendRedirect() . The URL fragment will then be sent to the client side and reflected in browser address bar as well. Redirecting the request has however the disadvantage that the current request will be garbaged and a brand new one will be created. If that's not affordable, then you'll indeed have to look in the JavaScript corner for the solution.
