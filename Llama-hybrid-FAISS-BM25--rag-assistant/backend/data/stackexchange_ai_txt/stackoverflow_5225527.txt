What ports are open on xbox? Will it respond to pings/TCP connection?

I'm trying to write an application to shut down my pc when I shutdown my xbox. The issue I'm having is my xbox dosent seem to respond to pings. I downloaded a port scanning tool and that didn't find any open ports on it. So I put up wireshark and ran a trace while streaming media to it. I can see TCP traffic travelling initially on 6453 then as "complex-link" on various other ports. I cant connect on telnet to 6453 or the other few I tried. Any advice on how to progress? I'm not sure if the xbox even listens on any ports or how I find out if it does. Possibly there is a more elegant way of doing what I want? (I'm intending to use C# for the actual application)
