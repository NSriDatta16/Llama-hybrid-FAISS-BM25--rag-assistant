Why is handwriting recognition treated as classification problem instead of a regression problem?

I have just started learning about machine learning, and I started reading about handwriting recognition. Apparently (please correct me if I am utterly wrong), handwriting is treated as a classification problem. It makes sense because you are assigning a certain value depending on other factors (e.g. two vertical lines + one horizontal line = "H"). Now, if we were to treat it as a regression problem, would it not work just as fine? It would try to predict the value of the letter by looking at the patterns - just like classification. Please, correct me if I am wrong. I am just really confused right now.
