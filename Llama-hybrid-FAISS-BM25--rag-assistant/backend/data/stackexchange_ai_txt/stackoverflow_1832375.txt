The short answer is yes. Even teams of pure developers will tend to self organize into specialties or owners of specific subsystems (unless you tend to force them to rotate work, but that is a topic for a different issue). Therefore, you will be estimating stories with a significant number of members in the room that have little knowledge of the subsystem work associated with the story. Story estimation is supposed to be more about comparing scales of complexity/work. It this two times, four times, eight times (or similar scales) more work than defined base point. Or, is it similar to this other item we rated at eight. At least that's the goal. At the sprint level (versus overall backlog), I find teams prefer to estimate with more concrete scales (ie hours). For people in specific disciplines, you may or may not want them to be included in the estimation process. If those individuals have a reasonable understanding of the complexity of the task, there estimates may be just as good as another member. If not, then they shouldn't provide an estimate. One benefit of including their estimates as it often creates more outlying estimates (overly high or low). When we have an item with estimates outside of a reasonable envelop, it is a trigger to have a short, but deeper discussion of the work. Often, that discussion forces a group discovery of work/complexity that wasn't obvious from the story description and acceptance criteria.
