Add ActiveX and NPAPI Plugin in one page using Nested Object Tag

I want to embed both an ActiveX and NPAPI plugins in one page using nested object tags (as recommended by Mozilla) instead of relying on user agent. The problem is: I want to use one object id, such as id="MyObject", which will be defined in both object tags (for the ActiveX or NPAPI) so that my Javascript calls the object MyObject directly regardless of whether it is an ActiveX or NPAPI. I hope I made myself clear.
