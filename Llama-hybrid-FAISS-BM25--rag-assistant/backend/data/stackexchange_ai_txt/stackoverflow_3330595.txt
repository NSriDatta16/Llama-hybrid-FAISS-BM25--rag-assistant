jQuery/JavaScript: Reorder Unordered List via Dragging

I have an unordered list with list items which I'd like to be able to "reorder" via dragging. I'm using jQuery. How could I accomplish this? I tried hooking into the click event but I can't get the drag to work right (I want the other elements to move out of the way once I drag an element over a suitable spot so the user can see where it would end up). Help?
