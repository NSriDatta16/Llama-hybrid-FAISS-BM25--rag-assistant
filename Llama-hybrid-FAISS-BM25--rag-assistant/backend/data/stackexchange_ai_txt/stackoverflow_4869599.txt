This happened to me today as I was moving an existing project into a new Git repository structure, while simultaneously using a development certificate obtained via being added to my client's team as a "Member". So lots of opportunity for things to screw up. In my case, the issue turned out to be the "Build Products Path". I had it set to the relative path "../../../build" instead of an absolute path. This was causing the Validate tool to screw up since the actual path wasn't being collapsed properly. I changed it to an absolute path and the Validate tool then began to run successfully once more. I submitted this as a bug to Radar as #8946204.
