PCA is a linear transformation ( Linearity of PCA ), and a composition of linear transformations (effectively the same as a product of matrices representing those linear transformations) is itself a linear transformation. Say: Let $x$ is your original data and $y = Ax$ is the data after some PCA transformation If $z = By$ is a linear transformation of that data $y$ , which seperates the data Then $z = BAx$ and thus there is also a linear transformation, the composition $(B \circ A)$ that seperates the data $x$ . The above lines prove that if the PCA transformed data is linearly seperable, then also the non-PCA transformed data will be seperable. By contraposition we also have that If the non-PCA transformed data is not linearly seperable, then also the PCA transformed data will be not be seperable.
