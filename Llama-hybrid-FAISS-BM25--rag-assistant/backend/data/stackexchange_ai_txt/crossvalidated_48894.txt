Normal distributed random numbers in time - expected behaviour - askew distributions?

I have a 3D array of numbers, initialised with normal distributed values. The mean of the distribution is $0$, the standard deviation in the order of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-8}$, but would be constant for the entire array and all time steps. The array is large enough to see that the introduced standard deviation and mean are there. Before the next time step, the array gets relaxed (converges to the average of the field, that gets introduced by another force), but does not fully reach it. If it did, the distribution (minus the average of the field) would get the normal distribution again and I would reach the previous state again, with a slight shift. The average would for example be gravity, a force acting equally on the entire array (simply adding $+10^{-6}$ to every number, every timestep) and later something a little more complicated, but still a shift that could be resolved locally, by comparing to the almost identical surrounding numbers. The biggest difference to the surrounding would be the fluctuations, due to the mentioned normal distributed random. The opposite would be no relaxation, so the normal distributions sum up over time. Since I am somewhere in between: What would the analytical solution of the time averaged normal distributed randoms be? Could there be an influence of the average of the field? What would it be? Am I right in expecting the distribution to be askew, if the field did not fully relax? (Over)simplified idea: I will implement this in 3D, but since that does not change the problem I tried to simplify the example. first scenario, full relaxation Normal distributed random numbers $\Rightarrow$ add force $\Rightarrow$ set to mean $\Rightarrow$ add more normal distributed random numbers $$ \overbrace{\begin{array}% 0.2&0.3&0.1\\ -0.4&0.1&0.3\\ 0.5&0.0&-0.2 \end{array}}^\text{random numbers} \Rightarrow \overbrace{\begin{array}% 1.2&1.3&1.1\\ 0.6&1.1&1.3\\ 1.5&1.0&0.8 \end{array}}^\text{added force/offset=1} \Rightarrow \overbrace{\begin{array}% 1.0&1.0&1.0\\ 1.0&1.0&1.0\\ 1.0&1.0&1.0 \end{array}}^\text{full relaxing} \Rightarrow \overbrace{\begin{array}% 0.8&1.2&1.0\\ 0.4&1.3&1.1\\ 1.4&1.1&0.7 \end{array}}^\text{added further random} $$ second scenario, no relaxation Normal distributed random numbers $\Rightarrow$ add force $\Rightarrow$ add more normal distributed random numbers $$ \overbrace{\begin{array}% 0.2&0.3&0.1\\ -0.4&0.1&0.3\\ 0.5&0.0&-0.2 \end{array}}^\text{random numbers} \Rightarrow \overbrace{\begin{array}% 1.2&1.3&1.1\\ 0.6&1.1&1.3\\ 1.5&1.0&0.8 \end{array}}^\text{added force/offset=1} \Rightarrow \overbrace{\begin{array}% 0.8&1.2&1.0\\ 0.4&1.3&1.1\\ 1.4&1.1&0.7 \end{array}}^\text{added further random} $$ But basically the idea is, in the second case I sum up randomly distributed variables, so this would not result in the same standard deviation, right? Also, the mean one of these variables would be $\neq 0$, therefore resulting in an askew distribution in the last array. Or would they really be as equal as I wrote in my oversimplified example? The added force would (for now) be a constant and the added random would be normal distributed randoms with $0$ mean, different at each site. This could result in the same distribution (not necessarily the same numbers as above), but will it really be equal over several iterations?
