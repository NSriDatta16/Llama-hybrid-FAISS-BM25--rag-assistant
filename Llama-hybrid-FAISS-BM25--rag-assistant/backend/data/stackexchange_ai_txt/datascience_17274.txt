how do I calculate p-value?

I need to calculate statistical significance of difference between two time series, each with 4500 terms. My null hypothesis is that $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ . How can I calculate p-value? Is Z-statistic useful for p value calculation? How to get p-value after computing Z-statistic? I have $\alpha = 0.05$ .
