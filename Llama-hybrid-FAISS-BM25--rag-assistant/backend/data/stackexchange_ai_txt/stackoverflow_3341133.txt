What you describe is a standard problem in machine learning called: data classification. Methods for data classifiation include: Neural Networks (as you mention), Support Vector Machines (see for example LIBSVM), Decision Trees (as mentioned in the previous answer). The output from these types of methods while very accurate can be difficult to interpret. You can also look probabilistic graphical models like Bayesian Networks, to answer deeper questions like: what is the probability that a male from southern California who likes to party is in his mid twenties.
