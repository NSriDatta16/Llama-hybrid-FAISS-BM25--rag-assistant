AUC is based on rank order of your predictions, not the actual class to which it's assigned. It's very likely that the scale of the output is misbehaving. Look at the values of your predictions, I suspect that the predictions of your model are within a tight range. If that's the case, the argmax will yield the same class for all of your observations (which is what's happening). You may wish to tinker with some of the hyperparameters to see which one is causing this exactly (might start with the learning rate). It's probably worth testing if a logistic regression gives you the same problem, which will help identify whether or not it's a problem with your inputs/features.
