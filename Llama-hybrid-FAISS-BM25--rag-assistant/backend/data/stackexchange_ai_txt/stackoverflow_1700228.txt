IPC between Python and C#

I want to pass data between a Python and a C# application in Windows (I want the channel to be bi-directional) In fact I wanna pass a struct containing data about a network packet that I've captured with C# (SharpPcap) to the Python app and then send back a modified packet to the C# program. What do you propose ? (I rather it be a fast method) My searches so far revealed that I can use these technologies, but I don't know which: JSON-RPC Use WCF (run the project under IronPython using Ironclad) WCF (use Python for .NET)
