ConfigurationSaveMode.Modified only saves the parts of the configuration that are different to the application/system configuration to a user local or roaming configuration (i.e. using ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel) with ConfigurationUserLevel.PerUserRoaming or ConfigurationUserLevel.PerUserRoamingAndLocal ). Since ASP.NET doesn't have user levels (and user isolated storage) this doesn't make sense. From the documentation is not clear if any of the Configuration.Save overloads will really work in the case of ASP.NET which uses a completely different configuration setting inheritance model to non-ASP.NET .NET applications. In practice using one of the WebConfigurationManager to load the configuration manager is likely to be a necessary pre-condition to saving the file. Another approach might be to explicitly load a explicitly designated file with ConfigurationManager.OpenMappedExeConfiguration .
