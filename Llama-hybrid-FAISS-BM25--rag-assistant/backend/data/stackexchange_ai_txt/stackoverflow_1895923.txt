Has Chrome improperly implemented the dataTransfer object?

When I do this in dragstart event: e.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', 'text'); e.dataTransfer.setData('text/html', 'html'); e.dataTransfer.setData('application/x-bookmark', 'bookmark'); and this in drop event: for (var i = 0; i I was supposed to have: text/plain:text text/html:html application/x-bookmark:bookmark as what I got in FF, but actually I got: Text:text text/plain:text in Chrome. Where are those data gone? Does this mean chrome did not implement the dataTransfer object properly? And what can I do about this? I ran this in Chrome 4.0.266.0
