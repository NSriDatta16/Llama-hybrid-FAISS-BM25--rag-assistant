Per wikipedia : Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set Prediction will not be affected , even for a logistic regression model. Multicollinearity will make the model coefficients unstable - the standard errors will be greater in the presence of multicollinearity. See here . You can still use the VIF to assess multicollinearity among categorical variables. the vif function in the car package in r will do this (although, I'm not sure how it works with categorical variables). Condition Indices can also be used to assess multicollinearity. See here and here .
