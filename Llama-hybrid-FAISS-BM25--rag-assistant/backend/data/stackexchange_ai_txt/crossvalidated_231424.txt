This question is very broad. It first of all really depends on the model you want to test, in which a higher complexity would decrease the validity of an ML-SEM model (but probably also of a BSEM model). I would say, as a starter, try both and experience/see which difference you get. To give you a gross insight in the debate between both you could read the following literature (as a start): Asparouhov, T., Muthén, B., & Morin, A. J. S. (2015).
