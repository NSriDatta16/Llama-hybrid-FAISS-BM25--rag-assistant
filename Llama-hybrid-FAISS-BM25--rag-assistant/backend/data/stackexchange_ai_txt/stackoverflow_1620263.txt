Then I wrote up some code to test if I could update some of the fields. The problem is that no updates occur to the database, but I see the changes when the data is bound to a DataGrid. I have no idea why it's not working or what I am doing wrong. Here is the code: DataClasses1DataContext data = new DataClasses1DataContext(); List result = new List (data.StoredProcedure1()); int i = 0; foreach (StoredProcedure1Result r in result) { r.TestField = "A" + i.ToString(); i++; } // to see what has changed, set break point on next line var changeSet = data.GetChangeSet(); // submit changes and show result in datagrid data.SubmitChanges(); dataGrid.ItemsSource = result; The stored procedure just grabs all of the records from a table: USE [E:\test\test.MDF] GO SET ANSI_NULLS ON GO SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON GO CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[StoredProcedure1] AS SELECT * FROM TEST_TABLE RETURN
