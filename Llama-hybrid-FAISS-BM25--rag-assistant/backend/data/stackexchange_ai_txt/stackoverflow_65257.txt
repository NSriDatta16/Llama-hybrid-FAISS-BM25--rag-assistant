If it's an older SVN repository (or even quite new, but wasn't setup optimally), it maybe using the older BDB style of repository database. http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/fsfs has notes on the new one. To change from one to another isn;t too hard - dump the entire history, re-initialise it with the new svn format of file system and re-import. It may also be useful at the same time to filter the repo-dump to remove entire checkins of useless information (I, for example, have removed 20MB+ tarball files that someone had checked in). As far as general speed goes - a quality (speedy) hard-drive and extra memory for OS-based caching would be hard to fault in terms of increasing the speed of how SVN will work. On the client side, if you have tortoisesvn setup through PuttyAgent for SSH access to an external repository machine, you can also enable SSH compression, which can also help. Edit: SVN v1.5 also has the fsfs-reshard.py tool which can help split a FSFS based svn repository into a number of directories - which can themselves be linked onto different drive spindles. If you have thousands of revisions, that can also help - if for no other reason than finding one file among thousands takes time (and you tell tell if thats a problem by looking at the IOwait times)
