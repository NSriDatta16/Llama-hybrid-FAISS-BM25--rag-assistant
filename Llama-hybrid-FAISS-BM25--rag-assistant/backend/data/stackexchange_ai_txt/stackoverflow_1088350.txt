How come no one mentioned weak and strong pointers? A strong pointer is a smart pointer that acts normally. A weak pointer is a smart pointer that cannot delete itself unless all of the strong pointers are out of scope. Strong pointer indicates ownership, a weak pointer indicates sharing. Look at boost.shared_ptr and boost.weak_ptr and Loki's StrongPtr for implementations. Also take a look at RAII . If you knew RAII you would have known the answer to this question yourself.
