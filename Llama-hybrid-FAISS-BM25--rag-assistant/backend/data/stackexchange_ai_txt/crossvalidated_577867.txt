Following Therneau and Grambsch, Equation 3.4 of Modeling Survival Data--Extending the Cox Model (Springer, 2000), if there are no tied event times the score equation solved to estimate the parameter-value vector $\theta$ is: $$ U(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \int_0^{\infty} \left[X_i(s) - \bar x(\theta,s)\right] dN_i(s) = \sum_{i=1}^n U_i(\theta)$$ where $dN_i(s)$ is 1 if case $i$ has an event at time $s$ and 0 otherwise, $X_i$ represents the covariate values for case $i$ and $\bar x$ is a risk-weighted mean of $X$ over observations at risk: $$\bar x(\theta,s) = \frac{\sum Y_i(s) r_i(s)X_i(s)}{\sum Y_i(s) r_i(s)}. $$ Here, $Y_i(s)$ is the at-risk indicator for cases at time $s$ and the risk-weighting is $r_i(\theta,s) =\exp[\theta' X_i(s)]$ . When you group 2 dummy variables into 1, you thus are changing the score equations solved to obtain the Cox model coefficients. With the nonlinearity introduced by the exponentiation needed to calculate the risk-weighted average, combining your original groups 2 and 3 together could change the corresponding risk-weighted covariate averages and thus the estimates of the other coefficients.
