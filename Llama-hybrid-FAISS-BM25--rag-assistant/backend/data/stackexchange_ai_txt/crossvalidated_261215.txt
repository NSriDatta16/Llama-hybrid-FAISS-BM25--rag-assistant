The Box-Ljung residuals can be used to assess the fit of the time series model. Of course, there are no absolutes and all measures have drawbacks. I am not sure how one would interpret $R^2$ in the context of a time series. Also, ARIMA models are not linear models; they are more general. Besides the many threads on this site covering these types of models, you can find out a lot about them in the most current edition of Box and Jenkins book titled Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control . This book is now in its 5th Edition published in June 2015 by Wiley. Additional co-authors include Gregory C. Reinsel and Greta M. Ljung. In addition, the bootstrap approach to time series analysis is covered in a number of books including my book An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to R which I coauthored with Robert A. LaBudde and was also published by Wiley in 2011.
