I am facing both problems above but apparently there is a solution to the issue of time variance of the treatment. Try using what is called proportional random assignment of treatment. If for instance 10% of your treated items occurred in 2010, then hypothetically assign that as treat year for 10% of the items in your control group. After this process you need to adjust your time series variable before further analysis. For more details read Petkova (2008)
