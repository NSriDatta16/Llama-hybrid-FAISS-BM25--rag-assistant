Quick Answer: No, F-measure formula does not consist of TN factor, and it is useful on retrieve problems (doc) . Thus, it's ( F-measure ) the correct approach to evaluate the imbalanced datasets or in retrieval problems case instead of accuracy and ROC . Accuracy = (TP+TN) / (TP+FP+FN+TN) F1_Score = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision) # or F1_Score = 2*TP / (2*TP + FP + FN) [ NOTE ]: Precision = TP / (TP+FP) Recall = TP / (TP+FN)
