What is a good reference for compound Poisson processes?

I've seen a couple of descriptions of the basic statistics of a compound Poisson process, basically just simple statements about how to compute the mean and variance given the mean and variance of the underlying processes. Unfortunately I haven't found anything which I feel comfortable citing in a professional context. Can anybody recommend a good desk reference that would cover compound Poisson processes/distributions? Preferably it would be general enough to serve as a good desk reference on statistics for an engineer (with a tendency to do a lot of numerical analysis), rather than focusing purely on compound processes. Bonus points if it also gives a good outline of Bayesian inference in general.
