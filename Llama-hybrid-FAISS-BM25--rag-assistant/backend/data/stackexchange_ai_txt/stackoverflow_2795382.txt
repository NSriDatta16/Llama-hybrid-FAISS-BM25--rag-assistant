Enter custom file name to be read?

I want to allow users to type the name of any .txt file to be read/written. This is my code : printf("Enter .txt file name\n"); scanf("%s",&fname); FILE *inputf; inputf=fopen(&fname,"w"); Problem is this method does not work (having &fname) as a parameter. I can imagine its because C needs "filename.txt" for it work ... even if I enter for example : "custom.txt", the program returns an error of "Storage block not big enough for this operation" What is the correct method to accomplish this ? Im using C and im pretty much using basic commands .. (not too advanced) Thanks alot !!!
