What Anderson describes is probably sufficient for the particular requirement you describe. However, you may want to look into Expression Blend Behaviors which provide powerful support for interactions between view models and views, which may be useful in more complex scenarios - using binding for 'messages' will only get you so far. Note, the expression blend SDK is freely available - you don't have to use Expression Blend to use the SDK or the behavior; although the Blend IDE does have better inbuilt support for 'drag and drop' of behaviors. Also, note each 'behavior' is a component - in other word it's an extensible model; there are a few built-in behaviors in the SDK, but you can write your own behaviors. Here are some links. (Note, don't let the 'silverlight' in the URL mislead you - behaviors are supported for both WPF and Silverlight): information Blend SDK video on behaviors
