Which value of output should be taken in multiple sessions of training Neural Network

Suppose I am using Neural Network for a 2 class classification. After training the network with the training set, I want to predict the class label of a dataset with no class label. Now with retraining, the same dataset gives different result. For example in one training session, a sample gave the output of it belonging to class 1 while in the other session it gave the output of it belonging to class 2. Then which value should be taken as the correct one?
