This critique is no longer justified: While it is true that most of the standard and most respected R libraries were restricted to in-memory computations, there is a growing number of specialized libraries to deal with data that doesn't fit into memory. For instance, for random forests on large datasets, you have the library bigrf . More info here: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigrf/ Another area of growth is R's connectedness to big data environments like hadoop, which opens another world of possibilities.
