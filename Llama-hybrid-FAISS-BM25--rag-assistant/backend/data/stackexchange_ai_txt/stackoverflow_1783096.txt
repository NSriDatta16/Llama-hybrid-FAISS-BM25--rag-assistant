In addition to all the other answers and agreeing, that it is impossible to have a single TreeMap structure with different comparators: From your question I understand that you have two requirements: the data model shall be case sensitive (you want the case sensitive values when you use get() ), the presenter shall be case insensitive (you want an case sensitive ordering, presentation is just an assumption). Let's assume, we populate the Map with the mappings (aa,obj1), (aA,obj2), (Aa,obj3), (AA,obj4). The iterator will provides the values in the order: (obj4, obj3, obj2, obj1)(*). Now which order do you expect if the map was ordered case-insensitive? All four keys would be equal and the order undefined. Or are you looking for a solution that would resolve the collection {obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4} for the key 'AA'? But that's a different approach. SO encourages the community to be honest: therefore my advice at this point is to look at your requirement again :) (*) not tested, assumed that 'A'
