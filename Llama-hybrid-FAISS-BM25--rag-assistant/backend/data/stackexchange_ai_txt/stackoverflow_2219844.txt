Use subsonic 3.0 to work with stored procedures

Hi I just downloaded subsonic 3.0 and I want to work with stored procedures. I don't know which template to choose: ActiveRecord or LinqTemplates. I don't really know the difference. I know that I don't want to deal with Linq code. I just want subsonic to generate classes based on tables and also their relationships (if possible) and generate code to interface with stored procedures. I couldn't find a lot of info on the subsonicproject site. I don't know which template folder to drag into my project, and which _settings.tt file to change. Under the T4 templates, there are four folders: ActiveRecord, LinqTemplates, SubSonic.TemplatesVB, TemplateProviders. I don't know which one to deal with for my situation. Can somebody post step by step instructions please, or point me to a page that already does? Thanks
