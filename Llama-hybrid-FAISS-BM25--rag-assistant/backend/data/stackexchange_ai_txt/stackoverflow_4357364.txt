I've been an ASP.NET programmer for a few years, and I think it's pretty easy to get into. The downsides here are that Microsoft products (TFS in particular) are expensive. Of course, my experiences have been directly related to that -- I've never tried Python in any regard -- so I can only offer my perspectives as an ASP.NET programmer. There are a lot of people who would (accurately) tell you that the page lifecycle in ASP.NET is a gigantic pain in the ass, and that's true too. I personally don't use the server-side part of ASP.NET very often anymore because juggling the lifecycle just leads to messy code and built-in obtuseness. That said, it's really easy to integrate ASP.NET WebServices with jQuery and JavaScript. My experiences with IIS have been pretty good as well, although I can't speak to its problems in more complex environments. I do love TFS, though. In particular, if you're working as a part of a team and need to get user bug reports or enhancement requests, there's a lot of great built-in integration. However, configuring and maintaining TFS is a full-time job in and of itself if you're a part of a development team in a corporation. All that said, I'm not sure it makes much sense to limit yourself to two core languages and then ask about career opportunities. These are going to vary from place to place. I don't see many Python positions where I live, and there were a lot of MS/C#/ASP.NET positions available when I was looking for a job.
