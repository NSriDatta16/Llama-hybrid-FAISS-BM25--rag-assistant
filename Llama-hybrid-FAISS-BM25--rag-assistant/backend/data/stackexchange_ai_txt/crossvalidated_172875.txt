Can you calculate Bayes Factors for a Bayesian Random-effects meta-analysis?

I have the following problem and I wanted to see if somebody with more experience can help me. I'm doing a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis in rJAGS with models like these: model { for (i in 1:12) { P[i] Basically, I have about a dozen studies and for each of them I have calculated an effect size in ms, e.g.: T I have a theoretically-motivated prior for a null hypothesis (e.g. μ ~ N(0, 0.1)) and an alternative hypothesis (e.g. μ ~ N(15, 0.1)). My question is : is it possible to calculate Bayes factors to quantify the evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis compared to the null hypothesis? So far, I haven't been able to find a solution to this. I know that the R package "BayesFactor" has a function for a meta-analysis, but it uses t-values from individual studies, which doesn't work for me (it also assumes that the studies estimate the same effect size, which is also not what I want to do).
