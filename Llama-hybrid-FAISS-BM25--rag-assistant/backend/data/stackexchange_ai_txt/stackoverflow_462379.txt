I would look into the XAML only Windows Workflow. You can rehost the designer, and provide custom activities that can be dragged out and used to manipulate the data in any way they like. VERY visual. I'm currently using this in one of my applications, and the users seem to love it. While there is a small learning curve to it, it is much less than a typical scripting language, and people seem to be able to grasp it fairly quickly, especially those with experience using flow charts and Visio.
