You're on the right track in trying to identify whether the univariate time series is stationary. There are four assumptions that typically underlie all measurement processes; namely, that the data from the process at hand "behave like": 1. Random drawings; 2. From a fixed distribution; 3. With the distribution having fixed location; and 4. With the distribution having fixed variation. Stationary data, simply stated, is data whose mean and variance are constant over time and do not follow any trend (#3 and #4 above). To check if these assumptions hold, you can use the following graphs: 1. Random drawings: lag plot 2. From a fixed distribution: histogram and/or normal probability plot 3. With the distribution having fixed location: run sequence plot 4. With the distribution having fixed variation: run sequence plot In R, the stats package will provide you with functions to create these plots. Run Sequence plot(x) Lag Plot lag.plot(x) Histogram hist(x) Normal Probability Plot qqnorm(x) qqline(x) *qqline(x) will add a line to fit the data and will make it easier to judge whether the data follows a fixed distribution
