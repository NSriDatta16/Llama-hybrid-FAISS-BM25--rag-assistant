I assume you mean file system directories, i.e., on the SD card for example? If so, IMHO you 'really' don't want to do that - I've seen examples of this kind of 'filing' system go horribly wrong due to complexity. I'd recommend some form of simple storage but with some form of indexing/cataloguing system which can be as simple as using date/time strings for file names. Example - suppose the journal entries are simple text files, you could use a file name format such as YYYYMMDD_XXX.txt and simply save all files into one directory. In this case XXX would be numeric characters from 001 -> 999 representing the entry 'number' allowing a possible 999 journal entries per day (more than enough). Using a year-month-day (YYYYMMDD) format would allow sorting of file name strings in a chronological order strengthened by XXX ("001" would come before "002" in an ascending string sort operation). It would also allow wildcard searches (all journal entry text files for a given month would start "YYYYMM". The above is a simple example and I'd probably go at least one step further and use a single XML file for each day. A format such as... On my way to work today blah... Fell asleep, blah... I would then omit the XXX from the filename and just use YYYYMMDD.xml . OK, just a couple of angles (I could ramble on but I won't). You mention using a SQL DB - in general, basic SQL is quite simple but it can get as complex as you're prepared to go. For your requirements, you could get away with using a single table with a relatively small number of columns and the DB engine would handle a great deal of the 'filing' system for you. I'd recommend you try a few introductory SQL tutorials before deciding which way to go.
