when you set several servers, the client libraries use a first hash to pick one where to store each key/data pair. that means that there's no replication, and also that every client has to use the same set of servers. pros: almost zero overhead, storage and bandwidth grow linearly. server code is kept simple and reliable. cons: any change in the set of servers (one goes down, or you add a new one) suddenly invalidates (almost) the whole cache. you have to be sure to use the same algorithm on every client. if you have control to the client's code, you can simply store each key/data pair twice on two servers. just be sure to search on the same places when reading from a different client.
