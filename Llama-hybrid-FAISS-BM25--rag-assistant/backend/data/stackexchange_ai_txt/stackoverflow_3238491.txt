Magento site - Embed an email contact form which allows user to send a file attachment

I'm trying to add a page to my Magento site which contains an enquiry form. User would fill out name, email, tel no and add a file attachment. The store owner would then get the email with the uploaded file as an attachment. I'm a Magento newbie and the client I'm doing this for is reluctant to pay for an extension. My understanding so far is that I cant just use a standard php email script as I will have permissions issues regarding the file upload. I've been working on the idea of using the /media/ folder to upload the file. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Steve
