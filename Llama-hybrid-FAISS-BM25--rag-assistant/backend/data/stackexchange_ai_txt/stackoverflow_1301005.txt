ReSharper conflict with Visual C#

This happen after I installed the ReSharper. It's a problem that if I fix for one the other is going to alert and vice-versa. private readonly System.ComponentModel.IContainer _components; R# tries to add readonly if it does VC# gives this warnning(not error) Warning 1 Field 'MFA.Visa.Form1._components' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value null C:\Users\Athiwat\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\Visa\WindowsFormsApplication1\Form1.Designer.cs 8 59 Visa So how should I fix this?
