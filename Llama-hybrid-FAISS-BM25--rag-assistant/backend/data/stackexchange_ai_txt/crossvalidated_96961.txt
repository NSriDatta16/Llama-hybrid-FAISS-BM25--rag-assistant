How to choose the right number of parameters in Logistic Regression?

I am studying Andrew Ng's Machine Learning lecture notes . I understand either we can manually choose the number of parameters, or we can use regularization to make it correctly fit. I was wondering are there any basic rules for choosing the right number of parameters? Can anyone give any explanation please?
