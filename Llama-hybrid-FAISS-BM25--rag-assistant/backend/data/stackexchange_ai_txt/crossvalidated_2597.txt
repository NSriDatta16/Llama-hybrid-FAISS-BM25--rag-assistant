What stop-criteria for agglomerative hierarchical clustering are used in practice?

I have found extensive literature proposing all sorts of criteria (e.g. Glenn et al. 1985 (pdf) and Jung et al. 2002 (pdf)). However, most of these are not that easy to implement (at least from my perspective). I am using scipy.cluster.hierarchy to obtain a cluster hierarchy, and I am now trying to decide how to form flat clusters from that. My goal is to discover common patterns in my observations, so I have no reference to compare the obtained clustering to. Can anyone suggest a pragmatic solution?
