Liferay's default guest page and it's purpose in a Website

I'm currently building a website for a company, that will for the moment contain 3-5 static pages (i.e, just content). User registration may be added in time to come. Now, I've been reading through the Liferay docs, forums and wiki, and I'm still pretty unclear on the approach to take in designing this website: If I were to model my company Website as an organization in Liferay where I would have the public pages of the Website, what would be the purpose of the default guest page? (/web/gues/home)? Do I remove this and redirect the guest to my organization? If so, how do I do this? Who is the creator of an organization in the real world? Is this site administrator? or the person responsible for adding content? Who is the creator of an organization in Liferay? Is this the administrator to Liferay (i.e the default Test user)?
