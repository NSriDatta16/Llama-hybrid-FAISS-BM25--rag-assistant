Deep learning methods with seasonal data

I have been building an LSTM model in Python which will predict the number of passengers arriving at a station in the next 15 mins. My dataset is arrivals at the station every 15 mins across a 50 day period. A plot of the data shows a clear seasonal pattern i.e. most entries to the station occur during the evening rush hour. My question is this: prior to training an LSTM model, do I need to clean up the data - by this I mean take differences to make it stationary? I have normalised the data as all the examples I have seen say it's best to do this, but I am unclear about whether the trend/seasonality should be removed.
