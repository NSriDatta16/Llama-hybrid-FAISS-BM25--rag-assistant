How to scale on x-axis with Core Plot

I have a barchart display the smoking counter, day by day. Each column represents one day. I would like to view the data on week, month, year, on the same graph by drag on the X-Axis. If I drag the x-axis to the right, the value on the x-axis come from month to day (smaller value scale). If I drag the x-axis to the left, the value on the x- axis come from day to month (bigger value scale). I would like to ask: Can I make that functionality? I am new with Core-Plot. So would you please show me how I can do that, which method, class, delegate I should implement to make that functionality. Any help will be great appreciated. Thank you.
