I guess everyone who has looked at and upvoted this question has been waiting for someone to have an awesome, elegant answer, but it does not look that that will happen here. To help others who need a usable answer now... What I have done with other unit-testing situations is use an AutoResetEvent like you have mentioned in the question: AutoResetEvent MyAutoReset = new AutoResetEvent(); [TestMethod] public void MyTestMethod() { var MyItem.GetItem(x => { // Return handler MyAutoReset.Set(); }); MyAutoReset.WaitOne(5000, false)); } Obviously there are a few things to consider with this approach, but it gets the idea across.
