Has anyone applied Machine Learning methods to Geochemical Data?

I am looking to do a project on geochemical data , on which I will apply Machine Learning Technqiues to hopefully achieve good results. I was wondering whether anyone has done anything like this and could guide me to some resources or research papers?
