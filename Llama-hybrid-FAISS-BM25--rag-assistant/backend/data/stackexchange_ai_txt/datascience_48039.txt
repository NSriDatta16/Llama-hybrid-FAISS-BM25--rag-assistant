Why me? I care about the community I know DS very well - 9+ years as a professional DS , founded a large offline DS community in the SF bay area, very involved in DS ed., etc. Educational-orientation - this site helps members of all levels to learn rapidly. As the designer and content-creator of 2 Data Science microcredentials and an international lecturer on ML, I am devoted to teaching & learning. Expert appreciation of the highly cross-field nature of DS I've made every possible mistake and learned from it I believe that mods are empowered by the community for the purpose of paying it back via servant leadership I want our SE site to be a welcoming community Why not me? Limited rep on this SE site (mitigated by StackOverflow + other rep totally > 20K points) See #5 above I have never been a moderator on another SE site Promises: I will be available at least 2 hours per day and 20 hours/week total, potentially significantly more I will contribute content at an exponentially greater rate
