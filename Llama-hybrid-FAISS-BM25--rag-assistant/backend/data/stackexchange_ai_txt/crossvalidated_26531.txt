Do zero inflated continuous covariates cause "problems" in binary logistic regression?

I am trying to do a logistic regression to look at the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked by subjects in a sample (0-60 per day) and a yes/no outcome. As a lot of people in the sample are non-smokers, there are lot of zeros for the continuous covariate. I have a few questions about this: Is this correctly described as a zero-inflated continuous covariate? Will this cause "problems" in the logistic regression e.g. affect the validity of the coefficients etc. Should a stratified be carried out on smokers and non-smokers instead? Thanks
