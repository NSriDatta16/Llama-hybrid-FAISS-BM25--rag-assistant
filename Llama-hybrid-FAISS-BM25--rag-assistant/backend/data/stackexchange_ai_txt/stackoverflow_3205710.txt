As others have said this doesn't change the method definition. However, if you want to label groups of methods, why not use Ruby semantics to label them? You could use modules to split your code into chunks that belong together. This is good practice for large classes, even if you don't reuse the modules. When the code grows, it will be easy to split the modules into separate files for better organisation. class Example module ExampleGroup def method1 # .. end def method2 # .. end end include ExampleGroup def method3 # .. end end
