I recently did a screen-cast here. Setting up on MVC2 is in the video at 6min40sec if you want to see how it's done. http://blog.robertgreyling.com/2010/08/elegant-mvc-with-spark-way-views-were.html As a side note - The source code has now been moved to VS2010 in the master branch and it will also compile views dynamically to .NET 4.0. avoiding the error you got. You can either download the source and recompile the latest binaries, or for your convenience, we added them to NuPack/NuGet if you'd prefer to reference them that way. Hope that helps
