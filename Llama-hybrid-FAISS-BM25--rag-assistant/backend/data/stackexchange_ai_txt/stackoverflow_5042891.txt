Assuming you are logging events/tasks/actions, and not modifications to individual tables, I'd go with the first, for the same reasons @Kragen says (upvoted). But if you're auditing changes to incividual tables, I'd go with one audit table for each table being audited. A side-question, do you really want those foreign keys? If an item (row) in a table is deleted, you would then have to delete the audit trail for that item. Do you only need audit logs for existing items? ("Audit" generally implies "watch what they're up to", and if "they" can wipe out all trace of their activities that's generally frowned upon, even on Wall Street.)
