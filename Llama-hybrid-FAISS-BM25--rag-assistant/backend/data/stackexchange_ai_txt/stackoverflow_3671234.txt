What is the purpose of the second parameter to std::allocator ::deallocate?

In here is declaration of deallocate mem. of allocator class. My question is what for is second argument in this declaration? If this function calls operator delete(_Ptr) this argument is unused so what's for is it there? Thanks. Excerpt from MSDN: Frees a specified number of objects from storage beginning at a specified position. void deallocate( pointer _Ptr, size_type _Count ); Parameters _Ptr A pointer to the first object to be deallocated from storage. _Count The number of objects to be deallocated from storage.
