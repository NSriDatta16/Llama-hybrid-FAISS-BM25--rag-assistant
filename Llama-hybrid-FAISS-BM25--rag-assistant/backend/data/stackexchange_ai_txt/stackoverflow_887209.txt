Why are blank lines being matched in this regexp?

G'day, I am using the following Perl fragment to extract output from a Solaris cluster command. open(CL,"$clrg status |"); my @clrg= grep /^[[:lower:][:space:]]+/, ; close(CL); I get the following when I print the content of the elements of the array @clrg BTW "=>" and " => nas-rg mcs0.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Online mcs1.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Offline apache-rg mcs0.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Online mcs1.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Offline When I replace it with the following Perl fragment the blank lines are not matched. open(CL,"$clrg status |"); my @clrg= grep /^[[:lower:][:space:]]{3,}/, ; close(CL); And I get the following: =>nas-rg mcs0.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Online mcs1.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Offline apache-rg mcs0.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Online mcs1.cwwtf.bbc.co.uk No Offline Simple question is why? BTW Using {1,} in the second Perl fragment also matches blank lines! Any suggestions gratefully received! cheers,
