Dirichlet Process Concentration Parameter - collapse at zero

Background I've implemented the blocked gibbs sampler for sampling from the posterior of a dirichlet process mixture model as described on p.552 of Bayesian Data Analysis , placing a Gamma prior on the concentration parameter $\alpha$ . When using the Dirichlet Process to estimate the mixture membership of a sample consisting of three different Poisson distributions (See simulation document and code for full details ), the Dirichlet Process is able to nearly perfectly estimate cluster membership, but estimates P( $\alpha$ =0)=1. That is, all the MCMC samples for $\alpha$ are 0. I'm looking for perspectives to help me work through whether $P(\alpha=0)=1$ offers any problems for the validity of any inference made from this (or future, similarly constructed) model(s). Question Do these model results suggest any problems since $\alpha = 0$ is on the boundary of the parameter space?
