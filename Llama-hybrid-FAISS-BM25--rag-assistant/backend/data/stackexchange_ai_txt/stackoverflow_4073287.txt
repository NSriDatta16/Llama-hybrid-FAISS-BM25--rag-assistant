Chris's answer is probably the simplest given your situation, where your upload control handles the embedding, but for future readers it's worth checking out swfobject , which can handle both the feature detection and the embedding. I believe something like this would work: if (swfobject.getFlashPlayerVersion().major === 0) { // Do alternate content stuff } else { swfobject.embedSWF(flashUrl, "jcupload_content", width, height, "10.0.0", expressInstallUrl, {} { menu: "false", allowScriptAccess: "always", scale: "noScale", wmode: "transparent", salign: "lt" }, {}); } Substitute in your own flashUrl , width , height , and expressInstallUrl values. You can use the second parameter to supply flashvars, the third to customize the params to the embedding, and the fourth to customize any attributes you want the resulting object or embed tags to have.
