Scalling and unscalling of data for SVR prediction

I'm trying to use SVR to predict a certain feature. I create the model with the following code: from sklearn.svm import SVR from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler X = data # this is the outcome variable y = data.iloc[:, 10].values sc_X = StandardScaler() sc_y = StandardScaler() X2 = sc_X.fit_transform(X) y = sc_y.fit_transform(y.reshape(-1, 1)) # my_custom_kernel looks at certain columns of X2 / scaled data my_regressor = SVR(kernel=my_custom_kernel) my_regressor = regressor.fit(X2, y) After creating the model, I want to test it to see if the prediction is good. The first thing the code does is scale the row that I want to test, using the same scaler as above ( sc_X ). Then I try to reverse the scaling of the prediction result (using sc_y ). During this process, I get datatype errors. Here is the code: line1 = X.iloc[0].as_matrix().reshape(1, -1) line1_scaled = sc_X.fit_transform(line1) res = regressor.predict (line1_scaled) pred_line1 = sc_y.inverse_transform (res) # The error appears to be here Error: ValueError: non-broadcastable output operand with shape (1,) doesn't match the broadcast shape (24,) Thanks.
