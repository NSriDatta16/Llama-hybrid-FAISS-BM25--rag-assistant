Creating a popup position indicator on WPF Slider control

I am styling all WPF slider controls in my application, and I want them all to behave so that when the user is dragging the 'thumb', a Popup appears above the thumb (and follows it as the thumb is dragged), and the Popup displays a live update of new slider value. How can I do this all in Xaml with no C#? Thanks
