You can do this much more elegantly with the VLOOKUP formula by making separate table mapping lower bounds to letters. The mapping table must be sorted by grade number ascending. For example: Table A B 0 D 49.5 C- 54 C 59.5 C+ ... ... Formula: =VLOOKUP(SomeCell, $A$1:$B$9, 2, TRUE) Where $A$1:$B$9 is the range with the grade table. (The $ signs tell Excel not to move the reference if you copy the formula). Passing TRUE as the last argument will cause Excel to do a binary search to find the value, which (as long as the data is sorted) is exactly what you want it to do.
