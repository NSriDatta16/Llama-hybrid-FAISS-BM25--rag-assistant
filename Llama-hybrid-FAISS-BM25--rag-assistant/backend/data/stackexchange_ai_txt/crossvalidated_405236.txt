Bayesian method to determine effect size

I have data on heights of 2 groups of persons. Usually Cohen's-d is used to determine effect size. Is there any Bayesian equivalent of Cohen's-d which reflects effect size of the difference between 2 groups? I tried to search the Internet but could not find an easy answer. Thanks for your insight.
