If you're referring to Google, you can throttle the speed at which Google spiders your site by using your Google Webmaster account ( Google Webmaster Tools ). There is also this, which you can put in robots.txt User-agent: * Crawl-delay: 10 Where crawl delay is specified as the number of seconds between each page crawl. Of course, like everything else in robots.txt, the crawler has to respect it, so YMMV.
