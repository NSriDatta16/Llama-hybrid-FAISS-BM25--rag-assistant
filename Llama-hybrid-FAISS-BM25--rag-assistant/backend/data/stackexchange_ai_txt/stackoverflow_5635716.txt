Obj-C, need to find out if an imageview is inside another imageview?

I'm just wondering if there's some methods which would make it simple to determine if an image view is inside another image view. In my app theres several imageviews which can be dragged into another larger image view. So far i think I'll have to check x and y co-ordinates against each object in a loop. Just thought I'd ask EDIT The views will be on top of the larger view. I need to evaluate locations rather than view hierarchy.
