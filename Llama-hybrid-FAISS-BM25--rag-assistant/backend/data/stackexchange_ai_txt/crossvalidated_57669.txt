What exactly is the equation for SVM classification for new example?

I understand that in the case of Logistic Regression, we simply multiply our weights with Input example for classification. But what exactly is the equation that we calculate in the case of SVM to predict? I have already gone through Matlab's svmclassify, and it doesn't help. I will be absolutely grateful for a response.
