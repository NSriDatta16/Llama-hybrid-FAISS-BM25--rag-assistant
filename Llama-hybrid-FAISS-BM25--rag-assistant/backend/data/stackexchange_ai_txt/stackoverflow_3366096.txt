I'm pretty sure I understand it, but I'm not sure it's worth doing. Does it provide much benefit over just casting to the interface (or assigning to a variable of the interface type) at the calling side? I suppose it encourages you to think about using an interface instead of the concrete type... but it's still not going to enforce that: the caller could just specify the same type twice.
