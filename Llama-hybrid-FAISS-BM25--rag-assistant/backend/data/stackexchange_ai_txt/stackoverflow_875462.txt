I'm somewhat surprised that XSLT hasn't come up as an answer. Granted, I don't think it's a particularly elegant language, and most existent solutions tend to favour procedural approaches rather than pattern matching, and it's gotten a mighty bad rep from being blindly applied just because it's XML being applied to XML -- but otherwise it fits the bill. Pity its canonical representation is so verbose, though...
