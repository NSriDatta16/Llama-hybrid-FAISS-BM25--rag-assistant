This can be done without VBA by creating a pivot table grouped by month. When you double click on the value for a particular month, a new sheet will automatically be created and populated with a filtered set of the data for that month. Select your data then click on ' Data - PivotTable and PivotChart Report ' Click on the Next button, the Next button again and then the Finish button Drag your date field into the row fields Drag the employee name into the data item section Right click on the row fields containing the date and select ' Group and Show detail - Group ' Set a start and end date and choose to group by months Now double clicking on any amount in the data item area will create a new sheet showing the data that was used to generate the number. As your data is continually changing, create a Dynamic Named Range using ' Insert - Name - Define ' to use as the pivot table range. The formula for the Dynamic Named Range would look similar to this: =OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$1,0,0,COUNTA(Sheet1!A:A),3) If you are using Excel 2007, then mark your data as a table ( Ctrl-T ) and use this as the basis for a pivot table to achieve the same effect.
