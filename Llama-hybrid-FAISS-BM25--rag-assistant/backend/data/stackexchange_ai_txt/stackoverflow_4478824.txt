This is because the # character in a URL references the local page. It is used for named anchors (or any ID) within a page, so a link can jump directly to that area. Wikipedia calls it the fragment identifier and has this to say: The fragment identifier, if present, specifies a part or a position within the overall resource or document. When used with HTTP, it usually specifies a section or location within the page, and the browser may scroll to display that part of the page. As a practical example - this link to wikipedia has a fragment identifier (always at the end of the URL): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax In the page, there is a tag, and the browser jumps directly to it.
