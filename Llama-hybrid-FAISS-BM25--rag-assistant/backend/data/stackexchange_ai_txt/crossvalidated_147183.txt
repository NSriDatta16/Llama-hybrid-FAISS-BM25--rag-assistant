How to analyze time series with multiple readings per unit time

I have data as follows: day_number readings 1 4,5,6 2 4,7 3 5,6,4,3 4 3,5,6 5 5,6,4,3,2 .... Multiple values of readings come from different subjects seen on the same day. No subject is repeated in the data. Hence 3 subjects were seen on day1, another 2 on day 2, further 4 on day 4, etc. These go on for about 4 years. I want to determine if there is a seasonal effect on readings. How can I analyze this data? Do I take mean at each time only but then I will not be taking into account the variances on different days. I checked at other sites but here they had same readings per unit time: Time series with multiple subjects and multiple variables in R and Time series with multiple subjects and multiple variables
