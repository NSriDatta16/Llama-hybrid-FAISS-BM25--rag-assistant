How to best categorize a continuous variable that has many observations with the same value?

I have an air pollution variable (PM2.5 measurements) for a dataset of 9,506 participants based on geographical location. Because many of the participants live in the same general area, there is a large proportion of observations with the same exact value for PM2.5. For example (biomeclean being my df and avgpm25 being the air pollution measure variable), quantile(biomeclean$avgpm25) returns Average PM2.5 [ug/m3] 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 4.562985 7.908445 9.464553 9.464553 10.275000 Similarly, > summary(biomeclean$avgpm25) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 4.563 7.908 9.465 8.738 9.465 10.275 And trying to split it into smaller chunks gave me this: > quantile(biomeclean$avgpm25, probs = seq(0, 1, 1/6)) Average PM2.5 [ug/m3] 0% 16.66667% 33.33333% 50% 66.66667% 83.33333% 100% 4.562985 7.819733 7.908445 9.464553 9.464553 9.464553 10.275000 So you can see that a lot of participants have the same exact value of 9.464553 (basically because they live in a similar area as defined by my geographical variable). Does anyone know of a better way to categorize this variable? I am keeping it continuous for my actual regression analyses later on, but it's much easier to visualize categories in my table. Should I create arbitrary cut points rather than ones based on the distribution of the variable?
