How to store efficiently very large sparse 3D matrices

To train a CNN, I have stacked arrays of images over observations [observations x width x length] . The dataset is very sparse ( $95\%$ ). What would be an efficient way of storing these matrices efficiently in terms of format (e.g. pickle, parquet) structure (e.g. scipy.sparse.csr_matrix , List of Lists)
