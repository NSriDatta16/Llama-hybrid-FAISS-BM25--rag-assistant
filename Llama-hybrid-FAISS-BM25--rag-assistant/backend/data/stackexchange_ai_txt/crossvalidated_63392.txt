Power analysis refers to analytical procedures that attempt to determine the power of a statistical test (i.e., the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis) or the sample size (i.e., $N$ ) required to achieve a given power. You can search Cross Validated for more information about power analysis by clicking here: power-analysis , here: power , or possibly here sample-size .
