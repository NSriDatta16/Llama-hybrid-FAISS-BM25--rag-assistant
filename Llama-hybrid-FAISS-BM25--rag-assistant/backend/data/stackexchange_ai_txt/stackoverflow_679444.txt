Where should I store data on a VMWare Server (or any virtual machine) install?

I have a Linux server at home that runs VMWare Server. I have one virtual machine for my web server, another for my zimbra server, another for my mysql server, and another that runs windows xp for testing. My problem is where to store the data. Web files, email files, mysql, etc? Which of these scenarios are the best? Each virtual machine stores it's own data on it's own virtual hard disk Create a new virtual machine for data storage and use Samba or NFS to share Use Samba or NFS on the host machine to share the data something else i haven't thought of yet I know that storing Mysql data files remotely via NFS or Samba is a bad thing but I would like to keep my data consolidated together. (Or maybe i'm on crack for thinking that) Anyway, please set me straight! Thanks.
