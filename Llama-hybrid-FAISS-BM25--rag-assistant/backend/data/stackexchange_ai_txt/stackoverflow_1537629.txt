Can the size of a stretchable button image be animated in Cocoa Touch?

I'm creating a UIButton with a stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight: I would like to change it's size smoothly with Core Animation like so: float shrinkFactor = 0.2; NSTimeInterval slowSpeed = 5.0; [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:slowSpeed]; UIButton *thisButton = (UIButton *)[self.view viewWithTag:2]; thisButton.frame = CGRectMake(thisButton.frame.origin.x, thisButton.frame.origin.y, buttonStretchedWidth * shrinkFactor, thisButton.frame.size.height); [UIView commitAnimations]; The button image size doesn't animate, it just snaps to the new size. When I make the backgroundColor of the button visible, I see the frame itself animates correctly. Am I missing something or is the image stretching not animatable?
