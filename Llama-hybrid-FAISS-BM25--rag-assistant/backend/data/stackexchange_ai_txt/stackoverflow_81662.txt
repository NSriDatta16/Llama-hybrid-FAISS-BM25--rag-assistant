Thanks for the answers guys, ajryan, you seem to always come up with help for my questions so extra thanks. Thankfully this time the answer was fairly straightforward.... ImageList_DragShowNolock(FALSE); m_pDragDropTargetWnd->SendMessage(WM_USER_DRAG_DROP_OBJECT_DRAG_ENTER, (WPARAM)pDragDropObject, (LPARAM)(&dragDropPoint)); ImageList_DragShowNolock(TRUE); This turns off the drawing of the dragged image, then sends a message to the window being entered to repaint in a highlighted state, then finally redraws the drag image over the top. Seems to have done the trick.
