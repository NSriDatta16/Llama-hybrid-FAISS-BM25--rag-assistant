The problem is because of the line scrollPane.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(250, 200)); You are setting the width of the scrollpane here. I commented out this line and the table filled the "results" panel. But: There are multiple things wrong in the code. For instance frame.show(); in the last line: the show method is deprecated. Use the setVisible method You are using JTextField s for the addresses, this means no new lines, the entire address will be in a single line. Try using a JTextArea with a JScrollPane There are possibly others, but i did not look at the code completely. If you are trying to develop a UI fast, I suggest using an IDE with drag drop swing development ( eclipse with visual editor , or netbeans )
