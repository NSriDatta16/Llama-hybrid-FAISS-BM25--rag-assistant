How to deal with date field while modeling in R

My df contains data for 2 years history of user values, coming from different countries. value user country pdt date 1 a aa xx 01/01/2000 1.3 a aa xz 02/01/2000 2 b aa xx 01/01/2000 4 c bb yx 01/01/2000 5.9 c bb xx 03/01/2000 2 d cc yy 01/02/2000 I want to predict the value per user . In this minimal model I can use lubridate to extract a variety of date fields ( dayoftheweek , month , is_weekend and so on). I want to estimate the simplest linear model - and I am taking out the user field as redundant: value = a*country + b*pdt + c*date + err My question is: How should I deal with date field in the regressors? Should I just use the extracted fields ( dayoftheweek , month , is_weekend and so on) as regressors and leave out the original date column formatted as dd/mm/yyyy ? It is not clear to me the point where I could model it as a multivariate regression problem or a time series problem (that it is be able to predict value per user and not general time series sale per country or per product ). When I roughly check the assumptions on the simplest model, using gvlma package: library(gvlma) mod None of the assumtions are met (no linear relationship for X,Y; relationship skewed, the distribution is kurtotic and residuals are heteroscedastic).

Should I transform somehow the date? Should I add trend/splines? Should I move to a glm/random forest model to account for non-linearity? Or a time series? Thanks!
