Naive Bayes classifier has, on occasion, ended up as the worst classifier for specific datasets. Try different classifiers: k-nearest neighbors (k should be odd), linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, random forests, decision tree classifiers, artificial neural networks, etc. Also, because there may be scale issues among your input features, try mean-zero standardizing and normalizing feature values before input into classifiers. Simply inputting data into a classifier won't always result in the best performance. You commonly have to first remove scale differences of features, and then input into classifiers.
