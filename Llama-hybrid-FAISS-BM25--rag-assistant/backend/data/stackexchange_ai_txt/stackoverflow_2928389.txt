I suppose that you are using : yourDB.execSQL("your statement"); If so, the google documentation mentions this : Execute a single SQL statement that is not a query. For example, CREATE TABLE, DELETE, INSERT, etc. Multiple statements separated by ;s are not supported. it takes a write lock So you have to fragment each create table statement and repeat the query for each table.
