GOTOs don't make good code spaghetti, there are a multitude of other factors involved. This linux mailing list discussion can help put a few things into perspective (comments from Linus Torvalds about the bigger picture of using gotos). Trying to institute a "no goto policy" just for the sake of not having gotos will not achive anything in the long run, and will not make your code more maintainable. The changes will need to be more subtle and focus on increasing the overall quality of the code, think along the lines of using best practices for the platform/language, unit test coverage, static analysis etc.
