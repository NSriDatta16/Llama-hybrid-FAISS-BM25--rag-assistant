I too learnt C++ first and then Java. It took very less time as I was already familiar with OOPS concepts. In the initial phase of learning I was really happy with new concepts in Jave like garbage collector. I referred The Complete Reference by Herbert Schildt and it did help me to get the syntax quickly.
