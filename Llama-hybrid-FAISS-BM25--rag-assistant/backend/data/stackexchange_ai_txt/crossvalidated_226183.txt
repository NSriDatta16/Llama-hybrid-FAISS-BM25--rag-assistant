Testing whether a seasonal dip in a time series this year is abnormal compared to previous years

Let's say I have sales data for each month of the year for the last few years. Sales tend to dip in the summer, and I want to determine if the dip this year (or for a given month) is abnormal. month 2014 2015 2016 1 7775 8454 7700 2 12122 16229 20978 3 11631 16308 21051 4 11840 16004 21045 5 12108 16800 21807 ... Would an F-test/ANOVA be appropriate for this kind of year-over-year data? If not, what might be?
