Machine Learning: Predicting target based on a feature

I have a df looks as follow: -It is very likely that the same feature1Xfeature2Xfeature3 combination will appear multiple times. -type values are in the range of 1..4. I want to train a model, that for each feature1Xfeature2Xfeature3 combination as input, will predict a type s.t this type will match to the lowest price. e.g, if there are two rows with the same feature1Xfeature2Xfeature3 = [5.0, 3.6, 1.4] combination, one has price of 5000 with type 3, the other has price of 2000 with type 1, then inputting the model with feature1Xfeature2Xfeature3 = [5.0, 3.6, 1.42] (a combination which is very close to the above one) will likely output 1 since it has lower price. I've got some experience with models and learning using python and sklearn, but it sums to training a model with one target, which is not based on a specific feature. The final goal is to try and fit several algorithms on this problem(KMeans, DecisinTree, NN..), and check who did the best. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks
