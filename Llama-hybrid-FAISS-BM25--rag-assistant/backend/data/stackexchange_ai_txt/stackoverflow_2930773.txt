I think you need to also pass the argument 'posts_per_page' as -1 in your $args array (see the Codex on query_posts() ). UPDATE: Apologies, I've just re-read your question and I think I know the problem. Pass $nlPostIds as the direct argument, without placing it an array. You only pass an array when each element is an ID. In this care you're just passing a comma-separated string. UPDATE: Use; $args = array('post__in' => @explode(',', $nlPostIds), 'posts_per_page' => -1);
