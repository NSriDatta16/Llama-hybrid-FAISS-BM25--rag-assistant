Concurrent connection and performance?

I have a Comet application that may have many instances open at once. This means many concurrent connections. It shouldn't be too hard to vary the connection hostname in order to overcome browser concurrent connection limit. My question is: How would this fair on an average internet connection? Will I run into performance issues?
