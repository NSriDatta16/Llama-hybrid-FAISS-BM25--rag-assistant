I think that is the check box for FULLTEXT indexing. You turn it on only if you plan to do some natural language queries or a lot of text-based queries. See here for a description of what it is used to support. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142571.aspx From that base link, you can follow through to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142547.aspx (amongst others). Interesting is this quote Comparison of LIKE to Full-Text Search In contrast to full-text search, the LIKE Transact-SQL predicate works on character patterns only. Also, you cannot use the LIKE predicate to query formatted binary data. Furthermore, a LIKE query against a large amount of unstructured text data is much slower than an equivalent full-text query against the same data. A LIKE query against millions of rows of text data can take minutes to return; whereas a full-text query can take only seconds or less against the same data, depending on the number of rows that are returned. There is a cost for this of course which is in the storage of the patterns and relationships between words in the same record. It is really useful if you are storing articles for example, where you want to enable searching by "contains a, b and c". A LIKE pattern would be complicated and extremely slow to process like %A%B%C% OR LIKE '%B%A%C' Or ... and all the permutations for the order of appearance of A, B and C.
