I'm afraid the results are just all quite inconclusive with this dataset. In any case, with a sample size of about T=80 you're not very far into the asymptotics. That would mean that the p-values are artificially small, and that "in reality" they might not be below the 10% threshold. On the other hand, the point estimates for your autoregressive coefficient 'a' in the various test equations are quite low, sometimes basically zero (a-1 = -1). That indeed would point to stationary series, where the estimation uncertainty is just so large that almost no null hypothesis could ever be rejected. Of course one could also look at the plots of the time series and use other test approaches, but personally I think it would feel strange to impose the assumption of a unit root if my point estimate of the root is close to zero. But that may be a matter of taste, too.
