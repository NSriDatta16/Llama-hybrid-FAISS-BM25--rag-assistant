If the bank really is concerned with NPL status and not gradations of it, then I think your initial instinct to treat this as a classification problem is a sound one. If you go that route, you don't need to compute probabilities of missing first or second payments. Instead, you can use information about number of consecutive payments missed as another feature in your model, along with things like total number of missed payments since loan initiation, repayment amounts, and so on. I would be inclined to treat that feature as categorical rather than scalar, however, so you consider interaction effects with other covariates (e.g., maybe a cash payment means something different when you've already missed one payment than when you haven't missed any). You'll also want to use an approach that lets you group the data by customer/loan, e.g., a mixed-effects model or conditional logistic regression . Survival analysis is another solid option. Here, you would probably treat months since loan initiation as your primary "clock," NPL status as your failure event, and successful repayment of the entire loan as right censoring. Features like the repayment amount and make of the car would be included as initial conditions, and prior consecutive missed payments could be incorporated as time-varying covariates--or, maybe better, strata across which the shape of the hazard function and the effects of other covariates could vary as well. This approach naturally handles the grouping and sequencing of your observations, which is a big plus, and it can also be used to generate predictions in the form of expected time to failure (NPL status).
