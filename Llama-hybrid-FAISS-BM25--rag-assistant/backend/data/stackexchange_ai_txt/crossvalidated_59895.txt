Python module for change point analysis

I'm looking for a Python module that performs a change-point analysis on a time-series. There are a number of different algorithms and I'd like to explore the efficacy of some of them without having to hand-roll each of the algorithms. Ideally I'd like some modules like the bcp (Bayesian Change Point) or strucchange packages in R. I expected to find some in Scipy but I haven't been able to turn up anything. I'm surprised that there aren't any facilities in: statsmodels.tsa : Time series statistical analysis tools scikits.timeseries : Time series analysis tools to extend scipy scipy.signal : signal processing tools in scipy Are there any modules with change point detection algorithms in Python?
