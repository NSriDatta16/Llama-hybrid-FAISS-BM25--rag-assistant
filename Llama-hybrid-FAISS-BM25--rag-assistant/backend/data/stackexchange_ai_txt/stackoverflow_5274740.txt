Identify mip map levels by coloring different screen areas in GLSL

I don't wish to bombard this post with code. I've got a main file, fragment shader and a vertex shader file. I need to know the steps that I should take to color the screen according to mipmap level? I.e. where the loop should go that asks for mipmap level, then sets colour accordingly. I don't know where to implement this or how, a simple example would suffice many thanks.
