Rather than learning a lot of special cases, it is better to learn unified models that not only cover the special cases but also allow several extensions, including multilevel modeling, longitudinal data, and allowing for continuous covariate. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation are your friends. Special emphasis should be given to semiparametric models. And with models it is more clear what assumptions you are actually making. The CMH technique should be considered obsolete.
