Are you asking about these results in particular or the Breusch-Pagan test more generally? For these particular tests, see @mpiktas's answer. Broadly, the BP test asks whether the squared residuals from a regression can be predicted using some set of predictors. These predictors may be the same as those from the original regression. The White test version of the BP test includes all the predictors from the original regression, plus their squares and interactions in a regression against the squared residuals. If the squared residuals are predictable using some set of covariates, then the estimated squared residuals and thus the variances of the residuals (which follows because the mean of the residuals is 0) appear to vary across units, which is the definition of heteroskedasticity or non-constant variance, the phenomenon that the BP test considers.
