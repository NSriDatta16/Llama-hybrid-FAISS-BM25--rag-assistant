ANALYZE TABLE will scan keys and store data that'll help future JOINs. I don't know how useful/needed it actually is but I bet it surely depends on what your typical db workload and table structure are. OPTIMIZE TABLE will defragment your tables and reclaim unused space but, as you can read in the documentation, it is often unnecessary at all. You can invoke them via SQL or with the mysqlcheck tool. While mostly unnecessary, I usually schedule a mysqlcheck -Aao during low activity times (that means weekend nights in my case).
