Embedding a program's source code into its binary using GCC for GDB's later use

I'm getting tired of having to keep my source code untouched until I'm through with its debugging. Any time I change my code, GDB starts complaining about it: warning: Source file is more recent than executable. until I recompile it, which can not always be done quickly. I think it would be great if it was possible to include a program's source code into its binary and to make GDB use it instead of its up-to-date version. Could anyone suggest a way how to do it? Has this been implemented at all?
