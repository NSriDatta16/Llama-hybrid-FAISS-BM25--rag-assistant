Set a project default for VB.NET projects so that the default Modifiers property for controls is Private

Is it possible to set a project default for VB.NET winforms projects so that the default Modifier for controls added to winforms is Private (not Friend)? I know there's a "modifiers" property in the properties window so I can set it for each individual control... however I would like to change the project so from now on myself and other developers have to specifically decide to change from private . (Which I would strongly discourage them from doing). I believe there is no way of doing this, but on another forum a while ago someone mentioned it would be possible with an add-in (but didn't name the add-in or where to get it).
