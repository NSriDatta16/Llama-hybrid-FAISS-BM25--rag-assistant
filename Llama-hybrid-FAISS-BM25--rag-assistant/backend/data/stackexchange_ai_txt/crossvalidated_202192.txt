You likely will need more data than just averages. Predicting some future outcome relies on past data and trying to estimate how it behaves and then extending that to future values. I have no idea how Baseball scores behave but I would think that they change a little over time. Teams might go on hot or cold streaks, some key players might get injured, the team might make a trade for a new player. With that in mind, how they played over the last week or so might be more indicative of their upcoming performance than how they have played for the whole season. With that being said I would assume (again these assumptions are based off little baseball knowledge) that you should look into getting scores for a game by game basis and try treating it as a time series with possible external factors such as 'opponent', 'stadium', etc. To analyze this time series, something like a regression might be applicable or maybe fitting some ARIMA model if there is that time factor.
