Destruction of objects with static storage duration

Consider the following program. struct s { ~s(); }; void f() { static s a; } struct t { ~t() { f(); } }; int main() { static s b; static t c; } I'm trying to figure out what exactly the standard guarantees with respect to the destruction of static objects, but I'm finding the text of C++03[basic.start.term] rather insufficient. Is the behavior of the program defined? If so, what is the order of destruction of the static objects a , b and c ? What would happen if s::~s threw an exception? Please explain your reasoning, preferably with quotes from the standard.
