This is not a particularly elegant answer, but it may serve your purposes. You can use the maven-dependency-plugin to output the classpath to a file. The build-classpath is the relevant goal. the configuration below will output Maven's classpath to [project directory]/target/.mavenClasspath You could write a small script or ant task to read the .mavenClasspath file contents and append the entries to the Eclipse .classpath. If you make the script a bit smarter and remove previous entries, then set it up as an external builder , you have a nearly integrated solution. org.apache.maven.plugins maven-dependency-plugin output-classpath package build-classpath ${project.build.directory}.mavenClasspath
