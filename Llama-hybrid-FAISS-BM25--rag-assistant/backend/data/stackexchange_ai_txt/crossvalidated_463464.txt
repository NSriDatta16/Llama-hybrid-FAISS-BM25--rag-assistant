Why Asymptotic Equipartition Property theorem proofs assume the source is memoryless?

I do not understand the assumption 1,2,⋯ are i.i.d. ~p(x) in the AEP proofs I have seen. I have read some different sources for understanding the Asymptotic Equipartition Property. Using Cover & Thomas 1 as an example (page 51): Theorem 3.1.1.(AEP): If 1,2,⋯ are i.i.d. ~p(x), then (...) The proof is by using the weak law of large numbers and the fact that a statistic of independent random variables is also a random variable. Shannon defines a Source X as an ergodic Markov chain of order k, therefore in the message ()=(1,2...), are not independent. The aforementioned AEP proof assumes a memoryless Markov chain. Why? Why this proof of AEP holds for a source that is an ergodic Markov chain? (This same question was posted at cstheory.stackexchange, I do not know which exchange is best suited for this kind of question.) 1 T. M. Cover and Joy A. Thomas.
