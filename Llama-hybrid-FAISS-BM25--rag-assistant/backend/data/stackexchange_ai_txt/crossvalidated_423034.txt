Expressing Confidence Intervals as a percentage for simplicity

I am running some stats on a feeding experiment where 6 rodents were given the choice between control seeds and treated seeds for 12 hours. seed count consumed was the response variable. I've analyzed the data using a paired t-test and got a p-value of 0.0007. I'm assuming this is the right analysis to do but let me know if you disagree. Here is the raw data. Mean control seed consumed 1082 Mean treated seed consumed 32.5 For the sake of making the data easy for the layperson to interpret, I would like to present the results as a percentage which I got using the following equation which I applied to the means control seeds consumed / total seeds consumed 1082/(1082+32.5)= 96.8% I noticed that if I apply this same equation to the 6 replicates individually I get 100% 100% 92.9% 99.4% 99.8% 100% which if averaged yields 98.1% So which is correct 98.1% or 96.8% Should I be taking the average of the proportions or the proportion of the averages In the end I would like to be able to say "rodents showed a (##)% +/- (#)% preference for untreated seeds" I'm also not sure how to do the +/-. should this plus or minus be the standard error? Should I calculate it from the equation... σp = sqrt [ P(1 - P) / n ] using the proportion of the averages 96.8% or use the equation σx = σ / sqrt( n ) using the list of proportions to find the standard deviation and applying the standard error to the average of the proportion 98.1%
