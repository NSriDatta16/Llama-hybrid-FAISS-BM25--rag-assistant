You can try reversing your approach a bit. I'm developing a tool called Wizardby which allows you to write database migrations in a special DSL. Thus, instead of relying on fragile schema comparison algorithms (for example, none of them can handle column/table renames properly), you write all modifications to your database schema in an mdl file, which later gets compiled by Wizardby into platform-specific SQL. It can also be integrated into your build process.
