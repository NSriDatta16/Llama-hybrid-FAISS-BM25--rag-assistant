A partial dependence (PD) plot depicts the functional relationship between a small number of input variables and predictions. They show how the predictions partially depend on values of the input variables of interest. The partial dependence plot (short PDP or PD plot) shows the marginal effect one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model (J. H. Friedman 2001). A partial dependence plot can show whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. For example, when applied to a linear regression model, partial dependence plots always show a linear relationship. The partial dependence function for regression is defined as: $$\hat{f}_{x_S}(x_S)=E_{x_C}\left[\hat{f}(x_S,x_C)\right]=\int\hat{f}(x_S,x_C)d\mathbb{P}(x_C)$$
