Umbraco Document.getProperty(...).Value throws Null Reference Exception

I am writing a small app that links into Umbraco (a small stand-alone console application that will eventually run as a scheduled task on the server) and I'm using the Umbraco APIs (4.5.2) to make changes to the database/document. Here is a fragment of what I'm doing: IEnumerable documents = Document.GetChildrenForTree(parentDocumentId); foreach (Document doc in documents.Where(d => d.Published)) { doc.getProperty("myData").Value = "some data"; // Exception here // ...other stuff here... } However I always get a NullReferenceException because there are no properties. This confuses me because I can see that there are 5 properties in the umbraco interface. A colleague suggested that I use a Node instead of a document, however I can't even create one as I get a NullReferenceException from the Node class constructor. Node myNode = new Node(-1); // NullReferenceException here Does anyone have any ideas?
