See GoF on Composition vs Inheritance . The one thing to take away from the Design Patterns book is to always favour composition over inheritance . The reason that inheritance feels more "elegant" is that the type system already implicitly converts from subtypes to supertypes for you. But you run into a limitation in that you lock yourself into a specific hierarchy that becomes extremely resistant to change. Where you need polymorphism, use parametric polymorphism via generics rather than implicit type polymorphism via subclassing.
