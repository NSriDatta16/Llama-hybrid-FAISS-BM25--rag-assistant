Magento - Multi-domain & Filters

We're looking to build in a filter to our Magento site with drop down choices for the first two options, a selection box for price plus a colour chooser. Firstly how easy is it to fetch the info for the first two dropdowns from the database so the first box is populated with the first category then the second box populated with the choices for that particular category? (and then change if someone changes the first selection) Secondly how easy is it to set up a separate filter for each site so it only fetches info for the corresponding store and doesn't show products from other stores? The filter will only have to show the products when you press a 'find' button so I guess it's a case of building up the search query? Thoughts and ideas on this would be great, only been working with Magento for a month so still not sure of it's full capabilities. Thanks
