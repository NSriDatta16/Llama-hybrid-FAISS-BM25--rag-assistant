How to organize images for delivery performance in a website

I've a website with listings and images associated with each listing. I currently have images organized like this in the file system: D:\Images\Original D:\Images\Thumbnail Each listing can have up to 12 images in the original size and in the thumbnail size. I'm wondering how to best organized the images in the file system to get better performance in terms of locating the images for a listing. I'm thinking about this organization: For listing with Id 101: D:\Images\Original\101 D:\Images\Thumbnail\101 For listing with Id 102: D:\Images\Original\102 D:\Images\Thumbnail\102 etc. In other words, each listing will have a folder (named after the listing Id). In that folder, you only have images for that particular listing. Are there better ways to organize the listing images? I almost have 1 million images in total.
