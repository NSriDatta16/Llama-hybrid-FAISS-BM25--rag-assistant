Is there a good jQuery pattern for managing initialization?

Basically I want to do something like this: $(document).ready(function() { if ($(body).attr("class") === "HomePage") { HomePage.init(); //bind events for home page (Crockford's module pattern) } else if ($(body).attr("class") === "AboutPage") { AboutPage.init(); //bind events for about page } }); The reason is so I can minify everything into one js file, thus reducing the number of http requests. This solution is definitely not elegant, since I need to add another 'else if' statement whenever I add new pages. I could use: $(document).ready(function() { eval($(body).attr("class") + ".init();"); }); But eval is evil and I don't know the performance implications using this method.
