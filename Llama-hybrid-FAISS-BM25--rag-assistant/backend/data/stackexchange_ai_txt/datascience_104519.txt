Automatically finding business opportunities in text documents

I am new to machine learning and NLP. I am exploring the possibility of using one of these approaches to automatically examine a large collection of text documents and determine, first of all, if they talk about funding opportunities for small-medium enterprises. Then, considering only the matching documents, I would need to automatically understand the (1) (who is providing the funding), the (2) what kind of business is being funded, the (3) how (how many funds), the (4) when (the deadline for applying), as well as other information of this kind. Do you have any idea about what kind of automated approach, if any, can be pursued to this end?
