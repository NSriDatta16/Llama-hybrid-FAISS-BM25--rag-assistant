It is possible to use Kmeans for several (many) time series. I did it and it very slightly improved performance. Actually some other method were far better In a many time-series context, using KMeans would naturally split series into clusters and do a different training of $y_{t+1}=f(y_1,y_2,...y_t)$ (like linear regression for example) on each cluster. What is essential is the distance you choose. If you use just rough $L_2$ basic distance it won't work. The distance should reflect the idea that curves are "similar". It's a lot of work: scaling, affine transformation, time translation, maybe even time warping... Ideally the small distance between two curves would reflect the idea that "something likely to have the same consequences on the future has happened in a past". And still, the result may be very disappointing. If you have a clever distance between curves, then nearest neighbours or kernel smoothing might be much better. For me it worked much better.
