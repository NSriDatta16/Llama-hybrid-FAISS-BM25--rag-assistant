Open two instances of a file in a single Visual Studio session

I have a file, xyz.cpp . I want to open two instances of this file in Visual studio (BTW, I am using Visual Studio 2005). Why would I want to do so? I want to compare two sections of the same file side by side. I know workarounds such as: Make a copy of the file. But the problem is that it's not elegant, and I don't want to make copies every time I am faced with this. I can split the window into two. The problem with split it that I can split it horizontally only. The result of a horizontal split is that the right half of my screen is white space. If I were able to split it vertically or open two instances of the same file, it would increase the number of lines of code I can compare.
