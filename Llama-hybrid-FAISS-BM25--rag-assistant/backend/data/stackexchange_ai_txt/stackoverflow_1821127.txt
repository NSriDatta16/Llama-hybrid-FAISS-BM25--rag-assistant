You didn't tell anything about your system. I'm assuming you're using Linux or a Unix. The best way to get the current load is by executing the uptime system command which will give a line with some status and the load averages. The exact calculation of this is system dependent and "high load" is also depending on your system (how many cores, is your application IO or CPU bound ...) So to get the load something like preg_match("#load average: ([0-9\.]+), ([0-9\.]+), ([0-9\.]+)#", `uptime`, $matches); print_r($matches); might do the trick.
