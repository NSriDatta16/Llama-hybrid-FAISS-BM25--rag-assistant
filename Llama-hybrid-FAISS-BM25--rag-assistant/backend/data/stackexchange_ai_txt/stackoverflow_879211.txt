If you don't explicitly need the IN clause, you could use UNION: select 2 from dual union select 6 from dual union select 1 from dual union select 8 from dual There is a more elegant variant to INSERT multiple rows into a table: INSERT ALL INTO table (col) VALUES ('a') INTO table (col) VALUES ('b') INTO table (col) VALUES ('c') SELECT * FROM dual; But I don't know a way to do that for a SELECT.
