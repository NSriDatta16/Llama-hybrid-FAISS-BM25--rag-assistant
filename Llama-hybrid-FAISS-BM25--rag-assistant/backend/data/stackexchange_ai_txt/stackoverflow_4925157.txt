Though I may misunderstand your question, if storage in your question means definition , my answer might apply. As for one definition rule, 3.2 p5 of the standard says: There can be more than one definition of ... static data member of a class template ... in a program provided that each definition appears in a different translation unit, and If the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if there were a single definition of D. There are some requirements for this rule. In this question's case, since the variable is initialized by an integral constant 0, the requirements are satisfied.
