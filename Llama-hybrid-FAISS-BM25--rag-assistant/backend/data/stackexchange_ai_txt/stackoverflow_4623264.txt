That's weird that it's giving you the "not compatible with Firefox version x" message since, as you say, that doesn't seem to be the actual problem. See if this works: Right-click on the installer link and select "Save Link As..." and save the file on your hard drive. It will be called something like webdeveloper.xpi. Then just drag and drop the file onto Firefox.
