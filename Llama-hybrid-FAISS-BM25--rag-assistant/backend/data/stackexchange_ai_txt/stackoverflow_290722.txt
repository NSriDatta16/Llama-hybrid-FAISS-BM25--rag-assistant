I actually found out what my problem was through the eclipse webtools usergroup . The issue for me was the use of the Spring form custom tag library. If you self-close the tag... ...then you get the goofy JSP validation error. If you close the tag as if there was body content... Then the error goes away. I need to follow-up with a bug for the Ganymede team.
