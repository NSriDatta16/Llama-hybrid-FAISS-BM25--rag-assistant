You could think about rebalancing the dataset using undersampling of the majority class, oversampling the minority dataset or by applying SMOTE to the dataset. If you've got the dataset more balanced then either Logistic Regression / Random Forests aren't a bad starting place. Random Forests I believe are better at handling unbalanced classification problems, but they might still have troubles with the degree of unbalance that you're talking about. Survival analysis generally has an aspect of time to the problem (i.e: when might a hard drive fail?) so if time is included in your data then you definitely could frame it as a survival analysis problem. However if time doesn't enter the problem then it might be easier to just analyse as a ML problem.
