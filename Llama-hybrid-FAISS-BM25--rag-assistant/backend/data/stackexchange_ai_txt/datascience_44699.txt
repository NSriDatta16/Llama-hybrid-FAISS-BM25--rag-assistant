How to train neural word embeddings?

So I am new to Deep Learning and NLP. I have read several blog posts on medium, towardsdatascience and papers where they talk about pre-training the word embeddings in an unsupervised fashion and then use them in supervised DNN. But recently I read a blog post which suggested that training the word embeddings while training the neural network gives better results. This is the other link. So my question is which one should I follow? Some YouTube videos that I referred: Deep Learning for NLP without Magic Part 1, 2 and 3
