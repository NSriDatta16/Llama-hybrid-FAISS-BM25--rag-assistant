Intervention Analysis with binary time series

I need to do a intervention analysis to see if a marketing campaign affected conversion rate. I would normally would use Causal Impact package to train a time series and then forecast it on the post period, then run a statistical analysis between the two. However, since conversion rate is bounded between 0-1, I don't think that will work. I suspect can I use a logit with time fixed effects, but am not sure. I have around 3 years of data, so I can use dummy variables or something to pull out seasonality. I have weekly and yearly seasonality. Thanks
