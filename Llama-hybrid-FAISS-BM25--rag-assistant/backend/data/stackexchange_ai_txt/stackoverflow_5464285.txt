jQuery UI draggable - constrain inner element within parent when inner element is larger than parent

I am trying to achieve this effect with jQuery UI - very much like the way you crop an image on Facebook: http://blog.creonfx.com/examples/javascript/facebook-cropping-mootools.html Here is a very simple test case in HTML (an img within a div ): and here is the logic that seems fit for the purpose - however it is unfinished: $("img").draggable({ drag: dragHandler }); function dragHandler(event, ui) { var x = event.target.x - event.target.parentNode.offsetLeft; var y = event.target.offsetTop; if(x > 0) { // How to constrain the movement here? } if(x 0) { } if(y My first attempts were to modify the offsetLeft & offsetTop variables, in all their multiple access points, but nothing seems to be working for me. Here is a jsFiddle with what is explained above: http://jsfiddle.net/g105b/FdkBK/
