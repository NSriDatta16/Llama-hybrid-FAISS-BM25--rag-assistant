The general advice is Use scaling 1 where you want a biplot focussed on the sites/samples and the (dis)similarity between them in terms of the species (or variables), use scaling2 where you want to best represent the correlations between species (or variables). As these numeric scaling codes are really a reflection of software implementations from the DOS era (or earlier), we recently implemented scaling selections via one of the following strings: sites (for samples) species (for variables) symmetric for the various scalings in the vegan package for R. In a PCA, if the variables were environmental or species, the interpretation is the same; arrows/species scores scaled with scaling 2 best represents correlations between species. Which scaling you use really determines what values are preserved in the biplot and hence how you go about interpreting it and reading information off the plot.
