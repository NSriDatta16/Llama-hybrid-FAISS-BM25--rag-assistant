Difference between Weighted Average Entropy and Adjusted Mutual Information (for evaluating Clustering)

I was advised by my team leader to use this weighted average entropy to evaluating the performance of my dbscan clustering algorithm, and its mathematical formulation is: Scikit provides what many would consider standard metrics for clustering performance evaluation such as Adjusted Mutual Information, Homogeneity, completeness and V-measure (which are all based on the calculation of entropy. I wonder the difference and relationship between two metics, aka Weighted Average Entropy and Adjusted Mutual Information? And are they both good for clustering evaluation? Thanks!
