Conflicting Scripts

I've read the Jquery docs page on conflicting scripts. But i'm not really understanding it. As well, it's multiple .js files that are conflicting, and they have the same names to boot. (but they aren't the same within.) I have a set of .js for a fisheye effect. Then i have another set of .js for draggable. Draggable won't work with the fisheye scripts, and vice versa. These links are for the fisheye effect. These files are for draggable. From what i understand of what the doc said, File1.noConflict(); // Use script File1 via File1(...) File1(document).ready(function(){ File1("div").hide(); }); // Use script File2 with $(...), etc. $('someid').hide(); I'm not sure what to do with regards to the multiple files, I'm sure that speaks to how new i am to this. EDIT After looking online, i thought it would do me good to use a single jquery.1.3.2.js file, hosted by google. However, that didn't work. So it would seem my problem is that i need each of the scripts above for my effects to work, and this just seems wasteful to me. Is there a more efficient way to do this?
