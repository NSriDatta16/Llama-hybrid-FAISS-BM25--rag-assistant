The feasibility of this task depends on what two kinds of strings you're comparing. If you're comparing PNR numbers (which are formed as arbitrary combinations of numbers and letters) to any arbitrary string, I think you'll be hard pressed to do better than flipping a coin. I've heard it asserted that the set of valid PNRs is smaller than the set of all alphanumeric arbitrary strings of the same length, but I haven't found any reference to that effect. In practice, it's probably true on an airline-by-airline basis that not all combinations are valid because airlines all have their own business practices (caveat: acquisitions and mergers may make this effect nonuniform within airlines). If airline information is known, then you could work on discovering which combinations are/are not invalid and why... Since PNRs are recycled over a long enough time interval, you can just check which patterns never occur in that interval and mark those as invalid. If you're comparing PNR numbers to natural language (like what a person might send in an e-mail), then you can make a few simple rules that will give you considerable leverage. Check the length of the word. If it's no the length of a PNR number, it's not a PNR number. Likewise if it contains non-PNR characters like @ or $. Check if the word has numbers. If it contains numbers and letters, then it's almost assuredly a PNR number. Check the vowel/consonant patterns. Some linguists have characterized the vowel/constonant patterns in languages, so you can leverage that literature here. Check if it's a dictionary word. If it is, it's probably not a PNR-- but at the same time, "SEEING" is a valid PNR (provided the particular reservation system admits $I$), and it is also an English word.
