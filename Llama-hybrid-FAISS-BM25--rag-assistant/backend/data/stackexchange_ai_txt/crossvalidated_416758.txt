You can use mc-stan.org or https://docs.pymc.io/ for this. You need some prior on the mean and standard deviation for each variable. Input your observations. Then you sample posterior means and standard deviations for each of the random variables. Within each sample, determine the order of the random variables, and the distribution over these orders will give you a full probability estimate. If you don't like priors or you know absolutely nothing, and you have at least some observations, you can choose an almost flat prior. Hierarchical priors are almost always applicable to a realistic setting. As a bonus, this will give you an estimate of the probability of each of the orders. You can think of this information like the position matrix in this post: http://gijskoot.nl/bayesian/sports/soccer/predictions/pymc3/2018/02/07/knvb-model.html , the second from the top. The problem discussed there is similar, the number of goals each soccer club makes is a random variable, you observe some data and you want to estimate their "real" scoring rate.
