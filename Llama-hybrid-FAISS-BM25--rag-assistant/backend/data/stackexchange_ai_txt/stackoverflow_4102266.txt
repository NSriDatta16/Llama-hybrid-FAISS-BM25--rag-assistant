Number of downloads with awstats and WebClient class

I'm using WebClient class to download a xml file where is written the latest version of my program to check for updates. I thought that I can see how many people are using my program by checking how many hits my update.xml gets with awstats. Me and my friend are testing the program for 2 days but awstats still says 0 hits. Is it because I have no user-agent header? Still server logs (where awstats get it's data) should show that the file was downloaded?
