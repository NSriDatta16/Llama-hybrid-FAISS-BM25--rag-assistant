Cool question! The samples aren't iid, but you can partition them into subsets that are each internally iid. If you've chosen $x_1, ... x_n$ and $y_1, ..., y_n$ all independent, then for any fixed $j$ , you can select a subsequence of iid samples by only using samples of the form $x_i, y_{i+j}$ (where the $y$ index is modulo $n$ ). The average over each subsequence should converge under the usual assumptions (e.g. no half-Cauchy-distributed mountain summits). The grand mean can then be written as an average of those terms, one per $j$ , and each of them converges individually, which guarantees convergence overall (by Slutsky's Theorem). EDIT: For the geographical area example, your $x$ and $y$ samples should be uniform. In other words, to approximate $\frac{\int h(x,y)dxdy}{\int dx dy}$ , you rewrite as $\int h(x,y)f(x)g(x)dxdy$ where $f,g$ are the PDF's you're sampling from. Those PDF's should be constant. Otherwise you're doing importance sampling , and you need to account for the difference between the weights of the average you want (uniform/constant) and the weights of the average you're computing ( $f(x)g(y)$ where $f$ and $g$ are the actual pdf's you're using).
