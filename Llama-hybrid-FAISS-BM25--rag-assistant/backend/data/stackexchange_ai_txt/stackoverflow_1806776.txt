Is the concept of a link inseparable from its html markup?

I'm looking for a strategy for managing links within articles. The body of the article is saved in a database and pulled during page assembly. What all should be saved in the database to easily define and manage links? Some purists believe that markup should NEVER be stored in the database. Some believe its ok in moderation. But to me, the notion of a link is almost inseparable from its html markup. Is there a better, more succinct way of representing a link in an article (in a database) than simply embedding "anchor text"? One idea I've kicked around involves embedding just enough markup to semantically describe areas of interest, and in a different table, map those notions to actual URLs. All encounters of a particular notion get wrapped with the link. Here is an example of a semantic approach to link management. A table then might associate the URL of the article and the key class of 'semantic-web' to a URL like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web Here is an example of a semantic approach to link management. Things I like about this approach is that all my URLs are in one location in the database. I could technically change or remove links without touching the body of the article. I have very good class names for CSS. I don't like having another table to maintain, and another step/phase in render time. It could slow down response time. Are there any other strategies out there that provide superior link management?
