Machine learning or NLP approach to convert string about month ,year into dates

I'm currently in the process of developing a program with the capability of converting human style of representing year into actual dates. Example : last year last month into December 2018 string may be complete sentence like : what were you doing 5 years ago it will gives 2014 The purpose is to evalute human style of represting year or date into actual date, i have created collection of this type of strings and matching them with regex. I have read some machine learning but I'm not sure which algorithm suits this problem the best or if I should consider using NLP. Does anyone have a suggestion of what algorithm to use or where I can find the necessary literature to solve my problem? Thanks for any contribution!
