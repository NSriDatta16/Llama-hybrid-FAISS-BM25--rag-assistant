Dense variables or sparse variables contribute more on random forest and svm?

I have a GC-MS data set containing 256 variables and 150 observations. Of these 256 variables, about 70 variables are very dense, and others are sparse. I performed a random forest and support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination with a caret package. Then, I found that the most important selected variables are dense; the sparse, biologically important ones seem skipped by rf and svm . Then I tried to replace all the 0 values with a super small value (Limit of detection), and it seemed better than before but was still dominant by dense variables. So, I want to know if that means dense variables contribute more to the rf and svm ? and how to solve the density-driving bias in the models. Thank you very much.
