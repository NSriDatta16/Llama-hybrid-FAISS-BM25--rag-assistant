Observer is like a direct line of communication. Rather than have all your relatives call you to find out how you are, when you get sick write a card and everyone who is interested gets it (or a copy). When you get better, you send out a card. When you stub your toe, you send out a card. When you get an A, you send out a card. Anyone who cares gets on your mass mailing list and can respond however they see fit. This dependency is great for UI. If I have a process that is slow (for example), it can fire an even when progress is made. A progress bar element could observe that and update its coverage. An OK button could observe that and become active at 100%. A cursor could observe that an animate until the progress is 100%. None of these observers needs to know about each other. Furthermore, none of these elements strictly needs to know what is driving them either.
