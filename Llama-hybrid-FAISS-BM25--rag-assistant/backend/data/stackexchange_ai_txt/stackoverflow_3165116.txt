To get a specific branch of the android source, you use the repo just like you would to get the latest version. After you follow the instructions on the info for setting up the machine in the links that were supplied by the other answers, you would run repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b cupcake That will pull the 1.5 version of the source code.
