R has routines for doing PCA ( prcomp is the preferred method), and also SVD ( svd ) * , which are the bases for EOF. It also has a screeplot and other tools, but I'm not sure how much code you'll have to put around the SVD itself to do what you want. There is a spacetime package that has a function EOF . On github there is the sinkr package with an EOF function. At one point, there was a clim.pact package in R, which features an EOF function, but it has been removed from CRAN (perhaps because no longer maintained). EDIT: You may find answers to a similar question useful. EDIT 2: There are also at least three versions of "EOF": EOF, REOF (Rotated EOF), and EEOF (Extended EOF, to include time correlations). At least according to one page I saw online, which might be outdated and perhaps EOF always refers to EEOF now-a-days. Do you know what version you want to use? * The prcmp documentation mentions it does an SVD under the hood, so these two options are not totally distinct.
