You can use JpCap to listen to ARP Packets. Jpcap is a Java library for capturing and sending network packets. Using Jpcap, you can develop applications to capture packets from a network interface and visualize/analyze them in Java. You can also develop Java applications to send arbitrary packets through a network interface. Jpcap has been tested on Microsoft Windows (98/2000/XP/Vista), Linux (Fedora, Mandriva, Ubuntu), Mac OS X (Darwin), FreeBSD, and Solaris. Jpcap can capture Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, ARP/RARP , TCP, UDP, and ICMPv4 packets. Jpcap is open source, and is licensed under GNU LGPL. Edit: The last commit on JPCAP in github is from 9 years ago.
