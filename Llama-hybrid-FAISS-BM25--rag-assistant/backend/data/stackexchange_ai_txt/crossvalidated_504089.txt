From what I understand of the study design, the grouping variable is simply based on the paragraphs read. Therefore, if you include paragraph as a grouping variable for random intercepts, for example using: time ~ difficulty + (1 | paragraph) + (1 | subject) then you will not need to include group in the model at all.
