People should fix their own code. Take advantage of the fact that no one likes going back and fixing old stuff when they could be writing new stuff. If the developer responsible for the bug can be identified, make sure they are responsible for fixing the problem. This will encourage developers to be more diligent in writing clean code the first time since no one wants to be seen as the person who has to keeping fixing things they've broken. This is true during development as well when someone breaks the current build. Update : Having said that, I wouldn't necessarily be dogmatic about it. The customer's needs come first and if the person who created the bug can't be reassigned to do the fix, you may have to assign the fix to someone else.
