SSIS, splitting a single row into multiple rows

My problem is as follows. I have a CSV file (~100k rows) containting history information with the column format of: ID1,History1,ID2,History2...ID110,History110 Each row may have anywhere between 0 and 110 history entries. Each separate entry requires a stored procedure to be called. If there were a small number of possible entries per row, I imagine the way to do this would be to transform the data using a script, and send it to a unique path. Creating 110 paths would probably work, but isn't very elegant (and quite time consuming). What would the best way to approach this be?
