C#: Speech Synth with PromptBuilder not working right

I'm of course guessing something is wrong with my computer, maybe a library somewhere.. not sure. First off, at home, I can't get a male voice. I figure this is because it has a different library at home, on Win7 Ultimate. If anyone has any thoughts, I'd appreciate it. On my work PC, winXP SP3 (.NET 4), I can get a male voice.... but... pbuilder doesn't work right: pbuilder.StartStyle(pStyle); pbuilder.StartParagraph(); pbuilder.StartVoice(VoiceGender.Male, VoiceAge.Teen, 2); pbuilder.StartSentence(); pbuilder.AppendText("Checking current weather."); pbuilder.EndSentence(); pbuilder.EndVoice(); pbuilder.EndParagraph(); pbuilder.EndStyle(); ss.SpeakAsync(pbuilder); Works at home... but at work, all it says (and I'm not joking) is "Blah". If I put: ss.SpeakAsync("Checking current weather"); Then it will say that. ??? In case anyone is interested, I'm working on building my own... mini Jarvis (from Iron Man) http://code.google.com/p/jarvisv2win7/ At the time of this writing, has speech recognition, will recognize given commands (Play Tchaikovsky.... Check email.. How cold is it?... etc)
