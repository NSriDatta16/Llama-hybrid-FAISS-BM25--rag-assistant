I would seriously consider using the bsts package (in R), with 'logistic' as the model family. That will give you a forecast of the probability of 1's and 0's, based on past trends or periodicities (depending on how you construct the model). You can also add covariates, i.e. other things that change in a way related to your 1/0 observations, to act as predictors. See Figures 9 and 10 on this page: http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2017/07/fitting-bayesian-structural-time-series.html
