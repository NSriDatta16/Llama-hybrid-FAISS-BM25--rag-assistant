Inserting text at cursor in a textarea, with Javascript

I've had a look round the web for solutions, and there are some, but they all seem to split code into supporting IE and Firefox. I was wondering if there's a more elegant way which would work on every browser, to insert some text at the cursor in a textarea . Thanks very much.
