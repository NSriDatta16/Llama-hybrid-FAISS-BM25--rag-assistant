An informative "learning curve" will indicate the current performance of success. A cumulative average, however, doesn't do that, because it includes old results along with the new. When learning truly improves, the cumulative average will be biased low. A good solution is to use a Lowess smooth of the response plotted over time. This robust nonparametric smoother is implemented in many R packages: search for the current choices on the RSeek page . As an example, here is a scatterplot of simulated data, their cumulative average, and a Lowess smooth of the data: The green (upper) curve is the Lowess smooth. (This coding uses 1 for success, 0 for failure, so that an improving curve slopes upward .) The two curves differ substantially : the cumulative average barely has a positive slope (about 0.0015) and ends up around 0.5 at the most recent time, whereas the Lowess smooth has a slope around .005 (over three times as great) and ends up around 0.85. To get a sense of which is correct, consider the most recent responses, say those after time=80: there are 26 of them averaging 0.77. The Lowess curve is consistent with that level during this period but the cumulative average curve is clearly too low. (This is a standard exploratory technique to prepare for logistic regression. If, on a logit scale , the Lowess smooth is approximately linear, then logistic regression of the response versus time should work well to model the learning curve. If the smooth is not linear, you could consider logistic regression with cubic splines , allowing for changes in slope over time.)
