How to determine when an embedded flash object is loaded?

When embedding a flash object, is there a way to determine when it's fully loaded? That's my basic question, but for anyone interested in the details behind it: I am using the ( DOMWindow ) jQuery plugin. For those not familiar, it's a basic overlay the appears centered on the page, above all other content which is dimmed. Inside of the DOMWindow, I am embedded a YouTube video. The markup used to embed the video is AJAX injected. The DOMWindow has a built in loading graphic, but the problem I am having is that the AJAX GET request is completed almost instantly, and for 3-5 seconds, I'm stuck looking at a white rectangle while waiting for the YouTube video to load. If I could figure out how to determine when it's finished loading, I could code a more graceful loading scheme (using a animated spinner) inside of the DOMWindow.
