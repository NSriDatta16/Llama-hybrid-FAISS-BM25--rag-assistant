Feature Selection, Machine learning and Time Series analysis, for large financial timeseries

I have m( around O(millions) ) of rows of type timestamp | val | ind1 | ind2 | ind3 | .... k entries My task is to predict the value of "val" for any future given time. How should I model this as a machine learning problem. Note that we want the value of "val" given the past data without knowing the current value of ind1 | ind2 | ind3 | .... etc. of the same row. This is different in that sense. Formally, assume that I have first i rows(each entry is known) of the table. And I want to predict the value of $val_j$ (j>i, i.e. near future). How will I do that? I have not done these kind of predictions using ML or TensorFlow earlier . If we were given $ind1_j,ind2_j,...$ etc but not $val_j$. This kind of prediction would have been easy. Even if I model my val as a function of ind1, ind2, etc of previous indices. How will I get it for different future times ? About data I do not know much about data. All I know is that it is related to stocks and exchanges. Maybe "val" is the entity which is dependent on ind1, ind2, etc. You assume whatever is suitable apart from that.

And please give any idea, How will system learn iteratively as new data rows are added. I do not want to do the whole training again and again.
