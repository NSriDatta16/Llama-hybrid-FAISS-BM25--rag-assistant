Comparing random forest vs step wise regression

We have a dataset that we would like to compare the performance between random forest vs regression. However, due to the limited total amount of data, we used 5-fold cross validation with 5 repeats on the whole dataset. Also, we would like to limit the total amount of features inside the models. We wonder if we can do the following: train.control One main question is that there is simple implementation of feature selection for regression (stepAIC); however, I could't find one for random forest that be simplly integrated in when using the caret package.
