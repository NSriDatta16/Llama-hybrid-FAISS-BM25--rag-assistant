TO @Colin HEBERT: The assumption here is that equals() method does abide by the contract of equivalence relation. So for objects x and y if x.equals(y) returns false then y.equals(x) is also false. This is the symmetric relationship between them. Now for transitivity, if we have another object z and y.equals(z) is true. What should x.equals(z) return in context of this equivalence relation where x.equals(y) and y.equals(x) return false, and why?
