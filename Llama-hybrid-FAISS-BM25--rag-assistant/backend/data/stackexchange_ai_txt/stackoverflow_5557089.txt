python code organisation

As a beginning programmer (I'm rather doing scripting), I'm struggling with my growing collection of scripts and modules. Currently, small scripts are in a general folder that is added to my pythonpath. Specific projects get their own subfolder, but more and more I try to write the general parts of those projects as modules that can be used by other projects. But I cannot just import them unless this subfolder is also in my pythonpath. I don't know how to organise all this. I will be happy to get your hints and recommendations on organising (python) code. Thanks!
