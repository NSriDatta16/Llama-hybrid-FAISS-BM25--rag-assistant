Python 2.6: Process local storage while using multiprocessing.Pool

I'm attempting to build a python script that has a pool of worker processes (using mutiprocessing.Pool) across a large set of data. I want each process to have a unique object that gets used across multiple executes of that process. Psudo code: def work(data): #connection should be unique per process connection.put(data) print 'work done with connection:', connection if __name__ == '__main__': pPool = Pool() # pool of 4 processes datas = [1..1000] for process in pPool: #this is the part i'm asking about // how do I really do this? process.connection = Connection(conargs) for data in datas: pPool.apply_async(work, (data))
