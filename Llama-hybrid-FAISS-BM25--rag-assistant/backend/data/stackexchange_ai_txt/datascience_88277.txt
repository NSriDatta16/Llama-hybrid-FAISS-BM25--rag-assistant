Is "nb_steps_warmup" set for each episode or globally?

When I configure a DQN agent, nb_steps_warmup can be set. Is this parameter set for each episode or once globally? What I am trying to ask is, imaging I have a game environment which takes about 3000 max. steps per episode . The DQN is fitted as follows: dqn.fit(env, nb_steps=30000, visualize=True, verbose=2) So, as I understand it, the fitting will run approximately 10 episodes ( nb_steps / max. steps per episode ). If I set nb_steps_warmup = 5000 , what actually happens? A) nb_steps_warmup=5000 , so 5000 out of nb_steps=30000 are used for warming up B) within each episode the first nb_steps_warmup=5000 steps are used for warm up. As nb_steps_warmup > max. steps per episode , the complete episode is used for warming up, which essentially means the fitting never leaves the warming up phase. C) sth. else?
