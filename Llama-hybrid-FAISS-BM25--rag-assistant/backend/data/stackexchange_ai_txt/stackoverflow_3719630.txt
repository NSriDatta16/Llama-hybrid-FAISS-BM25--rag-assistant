If you have a bareword filehandle named LOG , you can pass it to a function by saying \*LOG (you can read more about this in perldoc perldata ), but don't do that. Bareword filehandles are a very old style and should no longer be used. Try using a lexical filehandle and the three argument version of open: open my $log, ">>", $opt{l} or die "could not open $opt{l}: $!"; you can use $log anywhere you used LOG in the past. You should also be using the strict and warnings pragmas.
