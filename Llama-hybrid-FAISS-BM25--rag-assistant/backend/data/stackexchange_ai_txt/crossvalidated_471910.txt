This looks like it is showing that a function $\phi()$ of an observation sampled from the empirical distribution has expected value equal to the expected value of $\phi()$ over the underlying distribution $p(x)$ . Which would be relevant to bootstrap estimation. If so, $x\sim p\left(\{x^{(r)}\}_{r=1}^R\right)$ means that $x$ is sampled with equal probability from the $R$ observations $\{x_1, \dots, x_R\}$ . In the first equality, the average on the right-hand side is the expectation over sampling from $\{x_1, \dots, x_R\}$ of the function $\phi(x)$ . The $\mathbb{E}$ is expectation over the distribution $\{x_1, \dots, x_R\}$ came from. The second equality pulls the sum out through the $\mathbb{E}$ , by linearity of expectation. The third equality is the key. It says that since any $x^{(r)}$ was just sampled from $p(x)$ originally, $\mathbb{E}[\phi(x^{(r)}]$ is just the same as $\mathbb{E}[\phi(x)]$ for any observation from the population distribution $p(x)$ . The final step just notices that you have the average of $R$ identical things. I don't like the notation here. I tried something a bit different: Write $P$ for expectations over the population distribution and $\mathbb{P}_R$ for expectations over the empirical distribution. By definition of the empirical distribution $$\mathbb{P}_R[\phi(X)]\equiv \frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^R\phi(X^{(r)})$$ Now $$P\left[\mathbb{P}_R[\phi(X)]\right] = P\left[\frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^R\phi(X^{(r)})\right]$$ By linearity of expectation $$P\left[\frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^R\phi(X^{(r)})\right]= \frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^RP[\phi(X^{(r)})]$$ And because $X^{(r)}$ was an iid sample $$\frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^R P[\phi(X^{(r)})]= \frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^RP[\phi(X)]=P\phi(X)\equiv\Phi$$ I'm not sure it's an improvement (except for easier typesetting). It's still less obvious than it should be that you can just drop the $r$ superscript. I worried initially that $x^{(r)}$ was supposed to indicate the sample has been sorted from smallest -- $x^{(1)}$ -- to largest -- $x^{(R)}$ . In that case, though, the proof as written is incorrect because the sorting stops the $x^{(r)}$ being exchangeable. The result is still true, for the same reasons, because the empirical distribution forgets the sorting.
