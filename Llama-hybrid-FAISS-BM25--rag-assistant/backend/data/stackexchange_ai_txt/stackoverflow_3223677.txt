You have what is called an off-by-one error , compounded by the fact that you're convoluting your loop logic unnecessarily. With regards to the loop, I recommend two things: Don't loop for (int i = 1; i ; it's atypical Do for (int i = 0; i ; it's more typical Instead of checking for the last iteration to do something, refactor and take it outside of the loop Related questions What is exactly the off-by-one errors in the while loop? See also Wikipedia/Off-by-one error On Double Avg In Java, variable names start with lowercase. Moreover, Double is a reference type, the box for the primitive double . Whenever possible, you should prefer double to Double See also Java Language Guide/Autoboxing JLS 5.1.7 Boxing Conversion and 5.1.8 Unboxing Conversion Effective Java 2nd Edition, Item 49: Prefer primitives to boxed primitives Related questions What is the difference between an int and an Integer in Java/C#? Java: What’s the difference between autoboxing and casting? Why does int num = Integer.getInteger(“123”) throw NullPointerException ? Why does autoboxing in Java allow me to have 3 possible values for a boolean ? Is it guaranteed that new Integer(i) == i in Java? (YES!!!) When comparing two Integers in Java does auto-unboxing occur? (NO!!!) Java noob: generics over objects only? (yes, unfortunately) Rewrite Here's a way to rewrite the code that makes it more readable. I used java.util.Scanner since I don't think TextIO is standard, but the essence remains the same. import java.util.*; public class ExamsFor4 { public static void main(String[] arguments) { Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); final int NUM_EXAMS = 4; int sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i An example session is as follows: Please enter the first exam: 4 Please enter the next exam: 5 Please enter the next exam: 7 Please enter the next exam: 9 Total is 25 Average is 6.25 Note that: Only necessary variables are declared The loop index is local only to the loop There are no cluttering comments Instead, focus on writing clear, concise, readable code If it makes sense to make something final , do so Constants in Java is all uppercase Related questions Why does (360 / 24) / 60 = 0 in Java Because it performs integer division. This is why the cast to (double) prior to the division in above code is necessary, so that it performs floating point division. How does the ternary operator work? This is the ?: operator in above code, also known as the conditional operator. See also: JLS 15.25 Conditional Operator ?:
