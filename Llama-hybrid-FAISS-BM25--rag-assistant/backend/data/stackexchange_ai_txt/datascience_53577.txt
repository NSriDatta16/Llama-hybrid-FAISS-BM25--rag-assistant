Data Science is a very broad expression, meaning: let's use a combination of statistics, math and computer science to make sense of data and produce predictive models that can generalize on data they have never seen. (Please refer to mainstream sources for a more thorough definintion). Machine Learning is an approach to data analysis. It is based on splitting your data into (at least) train and test sets, training predictive models on the train set, and assessing their generalization capacity on the test set. When it comes to choose the right language for DS / ML, please keep in mind that: R is the best language for econometrics and statistics Python is the best language for Deep Learning They are pretty much equivalent for non-deep ML You can do anything you want with both of them, though. Choose based on your preferences and/or needs.
