As a statistician I think of this in more general terms. We have biometrics and econometrics. These are both areas where statistics is used to solve problems. With biometrics we are dealing with biological/medical problems whereas econometrics deals with economics. Otherwise they would be the same except that different disciplines emphasize different statistical techniques. In biometrics survival analysis and contingency table analysis are heavily used. For econometrics time series is heavily used. Regression analysis is common to both. Having seen the answers about terminology differences between economatrics and biostatistics it seems that the actual question was mainly about terminology and I really only addressed the other two. The answers are so good that I can't add anything to it. I particularly liked StasK's answers. But as a biostatistician I do think that we use logit model and logistic model interchangeably. We do call log(p/[1-p]) the logit transformation.
