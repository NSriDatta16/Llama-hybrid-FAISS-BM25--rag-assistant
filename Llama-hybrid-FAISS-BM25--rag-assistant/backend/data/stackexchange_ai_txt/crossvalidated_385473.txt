Bayes inference: hypothesis testing on the average parameter

Bayesian inference field: given a dataset, if I assume a normal a priori distribution on the average parameter with zero mean and a given variance, those hypothesis tests can be carried out on the posterior distribution to assume (with a certain confidence level) that is the average really zero? Does it make sense to apply the t-test statistic on a posterior distributions (t.test in R) or is the t-test an exclusive hypothesis test of the sample media?
