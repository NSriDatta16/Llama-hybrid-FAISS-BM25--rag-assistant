If your cell array is really big, you might want to keep away from the above solution because of its memory usage. I'd then suggest using the utility mtimesx which is available from Matlab Central, here . N = length(Data); b = cell(N,1); b(:) = {1}; averageData = mtimesx(Data,b)/N; In the above example, I assumed that Data is a line-shaped cell array. I have never used personally mtimesx , this solution comes from there , where timing issues are also discussed. Hope this helps. A.
