How do I determine how well a discrete variable is predicted by a continuous response variable?

I have a response variable which is the number of days it takes for an insect to emerge from the pupal stage. I measured this daily, and most of the individuals emerged after about 20-21 days, with a tail of some individuals trailing as far off as 33 days. For ease of analysis, I have a variable called, "ClaustPer", which is this number of days minus 20. ClaustPer is not continuous (it can only have a narrow range of integer values), but it also has quite a number of "categories", if they can be called that. I want to figure out whether MLH, which is the average heterozygosity of these individual insects (across a number of genes), is a significant predictor of the number of days it take for an insect to emerge from the pupal stage. I'm currently using generalized linear models (GLMs), but I'm not sure whether that's appropriate and/or how to designate the link function, so I thought I would make this more a question of how best to figure out which type of analysis is best suited to a not-quite-categorical response variable. I provide the data set below in R (note that there are missing data designated as NA and some individuals have been omitted prior to analysis): data
