IIS6 Wildcard Mapping Security Concerns?

We are looking to utilize extensionless URL's for the first time in our organization. We've requested our sys admins add a wildcard mapping to IIS6 so all requests get processed through the asp.net. They are pushing back, citing security concerns. I don't have enough information about potential security issues with the wildcard mapping to know what security issues it may or may not create. Any feedback would be appreciated.
