Both indicate the goodness of the fit. R-squared is conveniently scaled between 0 and 1, whereas RMSE is not scaled to any particular values. This can be good or bad; obviously R-squared can be more easily interpreted, but with RMSE we explicitly know how much our predictions deviate, on average, from the actual values in the dataset. So in a way, RMSE tells you more. I also found this video really helpful.
