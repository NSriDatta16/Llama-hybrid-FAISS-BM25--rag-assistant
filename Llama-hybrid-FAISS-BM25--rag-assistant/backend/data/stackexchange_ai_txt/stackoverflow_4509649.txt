Question about xsd. Elements inside complex type must be allowed in any order

If you look at the following xsd fragment you can conclude that the corresponding xml will first contain cars followed by busses eg: car,car,bus,bus HOWEVER I want the xml to be able to contain car,bus,car,bus What change do I need to make in the xsd below in order to achieve this?
