You can use the Request.Browser.ClrVersion property to get the client's highest .NET version and Request.Browser.GetClrVersions() method to get all the installed .NET versions. These methods simply parse the Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_USER_AGENT") server variable. But please note that a browser (or user or hacker) may put anything he wishes in the string, so you won't have 100% accuracy.
