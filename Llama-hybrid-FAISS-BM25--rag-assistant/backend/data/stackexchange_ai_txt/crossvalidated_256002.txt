t-SNE on a small sparse matrix

I performed t-SNE on a this small sparse matrix with 2 identical points: [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], # [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], # [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]] I expected these two points would still be identical in the 2 dimensional embedding but they are not. Why is this?
