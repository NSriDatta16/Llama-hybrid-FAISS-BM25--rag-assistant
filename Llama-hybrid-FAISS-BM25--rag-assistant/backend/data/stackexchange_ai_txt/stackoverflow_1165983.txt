Declare array size in header file without #define's

I have a code a following (simplified version): #define MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX 1024 #defined MESSAGE_COUNT_MAX 20 class MyClass { public: .. some stuff private: unsigned char m_messageStorage[MESSAGE_COUNT_MAX*MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX]; }; I don't like defines, which are visible to all users of MyCalss. How can I do it in C++ style? Thanks Dima
