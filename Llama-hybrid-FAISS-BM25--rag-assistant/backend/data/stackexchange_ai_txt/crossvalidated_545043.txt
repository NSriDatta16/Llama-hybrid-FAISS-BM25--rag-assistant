Those two models don't have almost anything in common, so you cannot easily transfer the computation from one model to another. The beta-binomial model is a univariate model for binary data, the generalized linear regression model is a model considering the relation between two or more variables and the outcome is continuous. If you had a single variable following a log-normal distribution, you could use a conjugate prior for its parameters, similar as you do in the beta-binomial model. For the regression model, a better counterpart would be the Bayesian logistic regression model . Similar, linear regression can be viewed from a Bayesian viewpoint. However this is not a simple "adjustment", the models do not have a closed-form solution, to estimate them you need to use optimization, approximate inference, or MCMC sampling. For details, I recommend you check one of the many Bayesian statistics handbooks . Bayesian paradigm is a completely different way of estimating the parameters of the model, so you don't use it to "adjust" the parameters estimated using maximum likelihood, but rather estimate them differently from the scratch.
