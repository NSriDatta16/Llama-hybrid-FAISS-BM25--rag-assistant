For a mixed model, does the temporal correlation should be checked for each site (random effect)?

When a model fitted in a dataset with multiple time series from different sites, does the temporal correlation should check for each site? And if some sites show auto-correlation but some don't, what's that mean and how to deal with? Thanks. Here is details. I fitted a model like: m1 I checked the auto-correlation plot for residuals for each site. Most of sites don't show residual problems, but some sites do. I added a residual auto-correlation structure, for example: m2 or m3 Always have a message = iteration limit reached without convergence (10) Any advices would be appreciate.
