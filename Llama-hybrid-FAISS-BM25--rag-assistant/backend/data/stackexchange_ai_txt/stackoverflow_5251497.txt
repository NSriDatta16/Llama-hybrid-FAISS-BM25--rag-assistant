Guys, i had the same question, my needs might have been a little more specific than general, but i have written a post about my findings here. http://www.mediabandit.co.uk/blog/215_mysql-bulk-insert-vs-load-data For my needs load data was fast, but the need to save to a flat file on the fly meant the average load times took longer than a bulk insert. Moreover i wasnt required to do more than say 200 queries, where before i was doing this one at a time, i'm now bulking them up, the time savings are in the region of seconds. Anyway, hopefully this will help you?
