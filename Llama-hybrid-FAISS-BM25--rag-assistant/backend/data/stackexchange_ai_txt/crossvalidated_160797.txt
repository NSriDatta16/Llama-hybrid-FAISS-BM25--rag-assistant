There are already many answers to this question: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to name a few. You should have a look through these and perhaps look into a book on the topic. I recommend Applied Logistic Regression by Hosmer, Lemeshow for a rather comprehensive take on the subject, or this site this tutorial from IDRE for a quick brief. However, to give you a few starting pointers, the interpretation of the odds ratio, strictly, is that a one unit change in the predictor , here wintermin$thaw, increases the risk of a negative respone by 1.03 times . The confidence intervals that you have computed so far are in fact the intervals of the estimates of the coefficients, not the odds ratios. Even so, you should reach a similar conclusion given that these do not cross 0. To get the confidence intervals for the odds ratios, you type: exp(confint(glm_wintermin_neg))
