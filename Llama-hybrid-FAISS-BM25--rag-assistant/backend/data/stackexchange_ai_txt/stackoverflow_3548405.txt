Generally speaking, having two interdependent modules is a design smell. You can either 1) merge the modules into a new one C, or 2) extract a common subset into I, making A and B depend on I but not each other. update Use forward declarations and #pragma once or #include/#ifndef protection: When can I use a forward declaration? Should I use #include in headers?
