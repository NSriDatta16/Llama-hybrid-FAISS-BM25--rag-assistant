With recent versions of PHP, POSIX regex functions are indeed deprecated -- you should stop using them, and use the preg_* functions instead. Here's your code, rewritten to use preg_match : preg_match("#([0-9]{1,2})/([0-9]{1,2})/([0-9]{4})#", '22/01/2010', $redgs); $billdate=$redgs[3]."-".$redgs[2]."-".$redgs[1]; var_dump($billdate); And you'll get : $ /usr/local/php-5.3/bin/php temp.php string(10) "2010-01-22" To be more precise, quoting the documentation of ereg : This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0 and REMOVED as of PHP 6.0.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged. So, don't hesitate to read the documentation of Regular Expressions (Perl-Compatible) -- which are more powerfull, faster, ... than the POSIX ones.
