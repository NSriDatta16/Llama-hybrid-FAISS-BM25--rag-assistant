The default storage location for drupal files is /sites/default/files. If you uploaded the file via Drupal (as a node or whatever) it will be here. You should also check out the file /sites/settings.php or your file uploads settings (http:///admin/settings/file-system) to see where your files are being stored. This is not a MIME type issue, so remove the entry for the apk files unless you want the server to attempt to read them.
