You can lay out different scenarios in a table like this: The 1 and 0 indicates if the regression estimates will be included (1) or excluded (0) Since there isn't an indicator just for father's income, both non-immigrants with either rich or poor father were grouped together, represented just by the intercept, $\beta_0$. Now, if we recast this into a 2x2 table, it'd be easier to look at: Pay attention to which two groups that are only differ by $\beta_2$, and those are the groups whose mean difference $\beta_2$ is intended to capture. Hints: focus on the last column.
