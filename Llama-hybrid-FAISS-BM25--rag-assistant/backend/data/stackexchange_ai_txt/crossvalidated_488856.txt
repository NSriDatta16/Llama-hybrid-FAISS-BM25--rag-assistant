Does using a random train-test split lead to data leakage?

I am trying to understand data leakage in modeling practice. If we had a dataset of patient instances from 2000-2018 (with all patient visits included), and used a randomly selected train-test split (say 80%/20%), would that lead to data leakage? To me, the answer seems to be yes , because a patient could very well have their 2018 visit be included in the 80% train set and their 2011 visit be included in the 20% validation set. Doesn't this imply that using k-fold cross-validation leads to data leakage? Reason being that the folds internal to the CV process could very well have jumbled up the years. Edit for clarity: this data is not explicitly a time series dataset. It's patient visit data. These visits, viewed closely, have some temporal properties (such as having several visits in different years for the same patient), but it would be inaccurate to say "this is a time series dataset".
