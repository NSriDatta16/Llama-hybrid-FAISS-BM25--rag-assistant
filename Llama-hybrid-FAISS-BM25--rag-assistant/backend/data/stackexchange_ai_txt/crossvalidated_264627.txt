Having integration in Bayesian model: what package to use?

I have a bit experience on Bayesian analysis and am a JAGS user. Recently I have to run a more complicated model that contains integration (I use adaptIntegrate from cubature package in the original codes) for a part of the calculation under Bayesian framework. From what I understand, in JAGS/BUGS we cannot use user-defined function or function from other R packages in the model. In the earlier post , some people suggested using LaplacesDemon and nimble as they allow more flexibility on customizing functions. But from the user manuals, LaplacesDemon and nimble still seem to have limit ability to include integration in iterations. I was wondering what package do people usually use when they have to include integration in Bayesian models? Hope my question sounds clear.
