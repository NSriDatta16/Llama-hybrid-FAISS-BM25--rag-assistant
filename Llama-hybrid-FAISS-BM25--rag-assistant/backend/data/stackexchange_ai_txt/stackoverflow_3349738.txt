No, there is no simple or elegant way to detect client disconnection. It would be a nice environment if, when the client shut down or crashed, the service received a "ClientTerminated" event. However, this behaviour simply doesn't fit with a message-based architecture. A not-so elegant solution is to periodically ping the client with a callback method, and see if this call times out. Alternatively, if you are using PerSession instancing, you can set the inactivityTimeout to a short value (say, one minute as opposed to the default 10), and on the client side use a timer to periodically invoke an empty method on the server. See this question for a similar discussion.
