How to override search in Magento?

My user should be able to use the search box to search by some attribute (numeric) it works. But I'd like to my customer to be able to search using separator. Example: search by : 12345678 = works great search by : 12-34-56-78 = doesn't work Which will the best way to override magento search to parse/rewrite/modify this behavior? Thank you
