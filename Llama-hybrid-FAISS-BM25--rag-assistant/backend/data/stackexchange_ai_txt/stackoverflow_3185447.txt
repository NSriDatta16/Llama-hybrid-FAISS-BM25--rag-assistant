The url returned be _get_url is actually generated by the used Storage class; it would probably make more sense to create your own Storage and use it when creating the ImageField ! See: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/files/#file-storage , http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-file-storage/ You will neet to override the Storage.url method for that!
