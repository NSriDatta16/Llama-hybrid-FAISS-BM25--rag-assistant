Drag Drop Within WPF ToolWindow in VS2010 Extension Not Allowed

I have a strange problem here. I've created a simple plugin using the wizard for a Visual Studio Integration Package / VSIX project with a tool window. Within that window I want to do a simple drag/drop from a listbox and drop within the same window. I've done the same thing in a normal WPF program, but when I do this in a WS toolwindow it's not allowed. I start the drag/drop operation (initiated by a PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown event) and call the DragDrop.DoDragDrop() method, I get the stop-sign-cursor at once. No dragging allowed. Any ideas? Security restrictions or an effect of the fact that these WPF controls are hosted inside a ToolWindowPane and old Visual Studio IDE COM stuff I guess... Thanks for any help!
