You are embedding a font and specifying that it should be used whenever the fontWeight is normal. This is what the fontWeight: normal style means. However, the labels in combo boxes are bold by default (this is done by the Flex framework), so they will not use the embedded font. To fix: Either create another copy of your @font-face declaration and make that one fontWeight: bold , or specify fontWeight: normal on your .comboBox rule.
