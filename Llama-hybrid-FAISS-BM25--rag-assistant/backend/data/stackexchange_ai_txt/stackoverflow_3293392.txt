If you have only that single clustered index on your table, that might not be too bad. However, the clustering index is also used for looking up the real data page for any hit in a non-clustered index - therefor, the clustered index (all its columns) are also part of each and every non-clustered index you might have on your table. So if you have a few nonclustered indices on your table, then you're definitely a) wasting a lot of space (and not just on disk - also in your server's RAM!), and b) your performance will be bad. A good clustered index ought to be: small (best bet: a 4-byte INT) - yours is pretty bad with up to 28 bytes per entry unique stable (never change) ever-increasing I would bet your current setup violates at least two if not more of those requirements. Not following these recommendations will lead to waste of space, and as you rightfully say, lots of page and index fragmentation and page splits (having to "rearrange" the data when an insert happens somewhere in the middle of the clustered index). Quite honestly: just add a surrogate ID INT IDENTITY(1,1) to your table and make that the primary clustered key - you should see quite a nice boost in performance, just from that, if you have lots of INSERT (and UPDATE) operations going on! See some more background info on what makes a good clustering key, and what is important about them, here: GUIDs as PRIMARY KEYs and/or the clustering key The Clustered Index Debate Continues... Ever-increasing clustering key - the Clustered Index Debate..........again!
