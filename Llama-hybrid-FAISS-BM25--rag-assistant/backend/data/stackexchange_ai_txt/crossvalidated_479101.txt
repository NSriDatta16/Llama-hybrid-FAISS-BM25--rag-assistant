Types of data interpolation

Consider the following two "types" of interpolation. In one case, our model passes through all observed data, in the other one, it doesn't. Do these types of interpolations have a name? If I recall correctly: Some authors would say that in (a) the model " fully interpolates the data " In classification, I believe some authors may say that model (a) " fully shatters the data ". I think it's also common to say that model (a) "memorizes" the data. I know that (a) is fitting the data more closely (it has a higher risk of overfitting), but I am wondering if there is a name or denomination for the actual phenomenon of having a model that takes on the actual values of the observed data instead of "averaging" through it.
