Exchangeability is really a modeling assumption and not something you can test for empirically. Some aspects of it can be tested in some settings, but not more. So to make your Q meaningful, we must take it as asking what does this modeling assumption really imply. Exchangeability is a form of symmetry , basically the symmetry that the ordering of the sample is not informative . So it excludes things like time series ... see Independence of events in real-life data . So, a simple random sample is (finitely) exchangeable. More information can be found at Exchangeability and IID random variables , What is the intuition behind exchangeable samples under the null hypothesis? and search this site.
