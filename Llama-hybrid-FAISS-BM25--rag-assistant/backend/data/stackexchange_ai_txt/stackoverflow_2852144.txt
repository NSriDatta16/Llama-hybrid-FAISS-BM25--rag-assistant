SQL Query with computed column

Please help me with a query. Assume that we have a table with columns: Transaction StartTime EndTime Now, I need a query with computed column of (value = EndTime-Startime). Actually I need to group Users(Transaction has a FK for Users) and sort them by average time spent for transaction.
