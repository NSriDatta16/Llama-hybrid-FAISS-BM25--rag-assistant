Your question is very similar to this one . Is your load primarily reading your images or writing? If it's read scalability you need, the post describes memcached, which is probably all you need. jackrabbit has loads more features, but is more for hierarchical text storage. Not sure it will do any better performance wise on your images. Also, if you do choose jackrabbit, make sure your content hierarchy is deep enough for jackrabbit to stay efficient. Any parent with 10,000 or more children is going to have sub-par performance.
