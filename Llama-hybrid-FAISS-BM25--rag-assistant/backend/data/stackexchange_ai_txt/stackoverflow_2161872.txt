How do you organise your tasks related to a single project?

I'm working on a project that has components, components have features, features have bugs. I can't organise these tickets tidily. What kind of tool do you use to keep these things in order? I'm using Eclipse PDT + mylyn. This tool described above should: be centralized , mulitple programmer/machine should read the same tasks. support subtasks , in order to organise my tickects, assign features to components and so on. cheap enough for personal use have mylyn connector. Because of this point, the options are very limited. So the point of my question again: How do you organise your tasks ?
