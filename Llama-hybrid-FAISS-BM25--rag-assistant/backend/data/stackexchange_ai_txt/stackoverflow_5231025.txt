Time series numeric again after indexing?

I wanted to cut a quarterly time series and did the following: cuttedts 1984.00] which worked inasmuch as I got all data after the first quarter of 1984. Strikingly is.ts(initialts) # returns TRUE while is.ts(cuttedts) # returns FALSE What did I do wrong, should I use subset? What's the best way to do this?
