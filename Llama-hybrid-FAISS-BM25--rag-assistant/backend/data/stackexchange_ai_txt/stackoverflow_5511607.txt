You did not mention what is the operation for these criteria and/or If its or (|(objectCategory=group)(ou=david test*)) It will try to find all the object either with objectcategory group or an organizational unit starting with 'david test' from the root. If its and (&(objectCategory=group)(ou=david test*)) It won't find anything because an organizational unit object category wont be a group. Instead what you can do is, set the base dn as ou=david test,... and just search for 'objectCategory=group'. If you dont know the organizational unit dn, do a first search with the filter (ou=david test*) and get the dn and set it as base dn for the next search and now search for 'objectCategory=group'
