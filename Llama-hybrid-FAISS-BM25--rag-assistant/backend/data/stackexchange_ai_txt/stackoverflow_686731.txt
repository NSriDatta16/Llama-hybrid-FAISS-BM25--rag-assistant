I must say I find all of the above very surprising reading. Usability experts tell us to keep the number of choices in a menu to a limited number so we can immediately see all the choices. The same applies to how you organise your work. I would typically expect 4-10 types in a namespace. Saves so much hunting round for stuff and scrolling up and down. It's so quick and easy to move stuff around using resharper that I don't see any reason why not to.
