Training for 'large' number of epochs can indeed lead to overfitting. Accuracy of nearly 1 on train and validation set also tends me to believe that your model is overfitting. What is the accuracy on the test set? It should be quite close to the train & validation error if the model was trained properly. I suggest you take a look and try to employ some regularization techniques, maybe early stopping, dynamic learning rate, and also, some hyperparameter tuning. That being said, the question lacks a lot of context. What kind of algorithm are you using? What is the machine learning problem/task that you are solving? What have you tried, which software, what arguments, etc. Try to give more details so that people can give you more specific advice.
