Panel moving after visibility changing

Using WinForms and C#: I have a panel that contains a groupbox, some checkboxes, and textboxes. This panel is not always visible. Depending on user selections I show the panel. However, the screen is large enough that it requires scrollbars depending on your screen resolution. Does anyone know why the panel would move based on the AutoScrollPosition? I cannot find why it jumps around. I am not changing the location anywhere in the code. I have found a work around that I have listed below. But it would be nice to understand why it is happening. if (m_PanelHoist.Location.Y != m_GroupBoxDrag.Location.Y) { Point point = m_PanelHoist.Location; point.X += AutoScrollPosition.X; point.Y += AutoScrollPosition.Y; m_PanelHoist.Location = point; }
