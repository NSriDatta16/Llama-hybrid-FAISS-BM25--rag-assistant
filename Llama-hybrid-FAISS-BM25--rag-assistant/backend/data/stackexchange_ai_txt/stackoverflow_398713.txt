MySQL is good enough for Flickr, Facebook, Wikipedia, Google, and YouTube to use it (says Wiki) - I'd say they each serve more load than you're likely to reach. I believe WordPress.com - four million+ blogs ( stats ), including CNN, Time, etc. blogs - also uses MySQL. Oracle/MSSQL are definitely not required to develop a robust product.
