You may find it easier to use the Arima() or auto.arima() functions from the forecast package, than using the arima() function from the stats package. Either way, your time series y should be a ts object with frequency set to 7. Setting seasonal = c(0,0,7) is unlikely to give a good model. Usually, the seasonal orders would be no more than 2. If you used the auto.arima() function, the orders will be selected automatically: fit Documentation for auto.arima() is here: https://otexts.com/fpp2/arima-r.html
