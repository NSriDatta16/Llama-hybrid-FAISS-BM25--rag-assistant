What does the following mean with regards to Poisson distribution?

A text I'm reading says the following, Consider the occurrence of any uncertain event over time or space in such a way that the average occurrence of the event over unit time or space is m. We may take the number of accidents occurring over a time period with m denoting the average number of accidents per month; or we may be interested in the number of defects occurring in a strip if cloth manufactured by a mill, with m denoting the average number of defects per metre. For each of such situations, we see the possibility of dividing the time or space interval into n very small segments such that within a small segment the conditions of the Bernoulli process hold. Thus, one month can be divided into (say) 30 x 24 x 60 intervals of one minute each, so that the probability of occurrence of an accident in any minute = m/(30X 24 X60), and reduces to a very small quantity, so that there is almost no chance of having two accidents occurring in one minute, The independence property of the Bernoulli trial also holds true here, as a one minute interval basically corresponds to a trial. Similar possibilities also exist in the cloth example. Question : If m is the average occurrence of accidents in a month, then how can average occurrence of accidents in a minute i.e. m/(30 X 24 X 60) be equivalent to probability occurrence of accident in a minute?
