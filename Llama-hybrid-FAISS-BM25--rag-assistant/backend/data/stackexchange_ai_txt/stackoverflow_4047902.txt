Regex is not very elegant when it comes to expressing such arbitrary number ranges. Either of these should work though: interface GigabitEthernet [1-6]/0/([1-3][0-9]|4[0-8]|[1-9])$ or interface GigabitEthernet [1-6]/0/([1-3][0-9]|4[0-8]|[1-9](?![0-9])) One or the other might be more or less suited to your regex engine or target data, but only you would know that.
