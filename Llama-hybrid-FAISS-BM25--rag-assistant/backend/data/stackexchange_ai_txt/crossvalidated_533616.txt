If you standardize all your variables (independent and dependent) then you do not need to include an intercept, because then the intercept will be 0, the standardization made sure of it. In this case the $DF$ will be $n-k$ because you are estimating one parameter less. This is not a "cheat". You are actually missing one piece of information which you do not have in the original model... the intercept. Yes the intercept is 0, but what does that translate to on the original scale? If you want to find what the effect of a standardized variable is on the original scale you can unstandardize it. There is no such option for the intercept as it is missing in your model (you are missing a constant - an average). Therefore, if you want to unstandardize the intercept you will have to include it into the model, which will add that missing $DF$ . By removing the intercept you are essentially saying that you do not care for the intercept, not on the original or the standardized scale. If this information is of interest to you then you will have to include it, and the $DF$ will be the same. Note: if you only standardize your independent variables then you still have to include the intercept (if of interest).
