If it's just the one function being called in different areas, sounds like you're just wanting some sort of basic semaphore test, e.g: isRunning = false; function whatever() { if (!isRunning) { isRunning = true; $.ajax(...., function() { isRunning = false; }); } } This question looks slightly related. RE your edit: It's also worth noting that whatever javascript solution you put in place here to avoid a barrage of requests should additionally be considered on the server side.
