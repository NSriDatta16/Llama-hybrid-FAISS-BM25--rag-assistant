I believe that must be an error in the example: it's getting a JSON result (indeed if you copy and paste that URL in your browser, you'll download a file names search.json which starts with {"results":[{"profile_image_url": "http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/255524395/KEN_OMALLEY_REVISED_normal.jpg", "created_at":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 14:52:07 +0000","from_user":"twilightlords", i.e. perfectly normal JSON; but then instead of parsing it with modules such as json or simplejson, it tries to parse it as XML -- and obviously this attempt fails. I believe the fix (which probably needs to be brought to the attention of whoever maintains that code so they can incorporate it) is either to ask for XML instead of JSON output, OR to parse the resulting JSON with appropriate means instead of trying to look at it as XML (not sure how to best implement either change, as I'm not familiar with that code).
