I tend to use a bottom margin on elements when I want them to have space before the next element, and then to use a ".last" class in the css to remove the margin from the last element. This is the heading This is a paragraph Here's another heading This is a footer div { margin-bottom: 1em; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } h1 { margin-bottom: 1em; } .last {margin-bottom: 0; } In your example though, this probably isn't that applicable, as a footer div would most likely have it's own class and specific styling. Still the ".last" approach I used works for me when I have several identical elements one after the other (paragraphs and what-not). Of course, I cherry-picked the technique from the "Elements" CSS framework.
