Caching a Django queryset for the calendar date

I have a query which results only change once a day. Seems like a waste to be performing that query every request I get for that page. I am investigating using memcached for this. How would I begin? Anyone have any suggestions or pitfalls I should avoid in using Django's caching? Should I cache at the template or at the view? This question might seem vague but it's only because I've never dealt with caching before. So if there's something I could elaborate on, please just ask. Elaboration Per Ken Cochrane: How often does this data change : The relevant data would be locked in for that calendar date. So, for example, I'll pull the data for 1/30/2011 and I'm okay with serving that cached copy for the whole day until 1/31/2011 where it would be refreshed. Do I use this data in more then one place: Only in one view. How much data is it going to be: An average of 10 model objects that contain about 15 fields with the largest being a CharField(max_length=120) . I will trim the number of fields down using values() to about half of those.
