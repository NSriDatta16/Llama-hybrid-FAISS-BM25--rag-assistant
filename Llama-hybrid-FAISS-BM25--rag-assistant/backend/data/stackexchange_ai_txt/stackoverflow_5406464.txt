Individual block elements with overflow-y:scroll are only scrollable with two fingers on the iPad. That's just the way it is. So how does Gmail do it differently? Manually, with JavaScript, reacting to various touch events. Your best bet at the moment is to use iScroll . This used to be a bit un-smooth (compared to Gmail and others' implementations), but the latest version is really good. Try their demo . It works on iPad/iPhone, Android, and you can even use it in a normal browser using your mouse. It has the nice elastic effect when you reach the top/bottom of a scrollable area, and it has the iOS-style scroll indicator thing that appears on the right during a scroll. It's almost as smooth as scrolling on a native app. By the way, if you want to examine an iPad-specific website's source, the easiest way is using Safari (I've tried this on 5.0.3 for Mac, but probably works on other platforms too). Turn on the Develop menu (Safari>Preferences>Advanced), then you can set your User Agent to iPad. You can do the same thing in Firefox, posing as an iPad, but I often find the websites look completely broken. I think this is because many iPad/Android-specific websites rely on Webkit features that aren't present in Gecko. In fact, Apple's iPad guide site, which also uses a two-pane scrolling technique, simply rejects you if you're not (a) sending an iOS User Agent string and (b) using Webkit. And Chrome doesn't have an easy way to change your User Agent string. So Safari is the easiest way to examine these kind of sites.
