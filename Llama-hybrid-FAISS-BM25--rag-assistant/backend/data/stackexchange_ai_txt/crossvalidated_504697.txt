How to completely remove the influence of a variable y from a variable x

Consider the case where you want to predict a certain objective variable z using an independent variable x. At this time, another independent variable y contains both information about z and information about x as well. If I don't want machine learning model to use information of y in when to predict z, how can I get rid of information of y from x? If there is only a linear relationship between x and y, I think that it can be removed by setting the correlation to 0, but is there a method that can be used when the type of relationship is unknown?
