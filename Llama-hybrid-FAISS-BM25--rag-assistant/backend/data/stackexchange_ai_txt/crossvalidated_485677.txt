Does XGBoost require standarized data?

In related question ( What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM? ) every answer stated that XGBoost doesn't require any standarization, but someone wrote in comment that: +1. Just note that XGBoost actually implements a second algorithm too, based on linear boosting. Scaling will make a difference there. I wonder what is that second algorithm and why it's sensitive to scaling? And, finally, should I standarize my data while using XGBoost?
