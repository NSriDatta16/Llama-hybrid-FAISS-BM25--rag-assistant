Comparing accuracy of answers to a question to expected accuracy by chance - statistically significant?

I'm sure this is a very simple one, but I'm struggling to find an explanation online for something so simple. I have a survey with 38 respondents. Each one has answered a multiple choice question with 3 possible answers, one of which is correct. I would like to know whether the success rate of my respondents can be explained by chance alone. The average accuracy of the respondents is 36.8421%. How do I work out if the gap between this and 1/3 is statistically significant? I have been looking at T-tests and chi squared, but they seem to be for more complicated data sets. Is it something really obvious? Thank you.
