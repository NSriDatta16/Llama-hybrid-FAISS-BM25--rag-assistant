Can you suggest any good books, online tutorials, etc, for developing with Bluetooth in JavaME?

I have limited experience with JavaME in the past. I've worked in only basic UI of JavaME. I have not used any Bluetooth APIs before. My organization has assigned me to a team involved in Bluetooth application development in JavaME.
