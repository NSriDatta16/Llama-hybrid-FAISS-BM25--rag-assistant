multiple contenteditable elements, using arrow keys to navigate

I got multiple elements on a page. I'm looking for a solution to use arrow keys for navigating across those disjoint elements just as if they were one single editable element. So for instance, if the caret is at the 10th character on the last line of the 1st paragraph and the user hits the down arrow key, the caret should jump to the 2nd paragraph and place the caret at the 10th character (if there's one) on its first line. Appreciate any comments.
