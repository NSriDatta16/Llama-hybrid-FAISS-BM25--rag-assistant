Measuring the performance of Logistic Regression

Being quite new to the field, it occurs to me that there are multiple and fundamentally different ways of assessing the quality of a logistic regression: One can evaluate it by looking at the confusion matrix and count the misclassifications (when using some probability value as the cutoff) or One can evaluate it by looking at statistical tests such as the Deviance or individual $Z$-scores. Although I more or less understand the aforementioned tests, I am curious to know when it is appropriate to use the misclassification count and when one should apply more statistical tests?
