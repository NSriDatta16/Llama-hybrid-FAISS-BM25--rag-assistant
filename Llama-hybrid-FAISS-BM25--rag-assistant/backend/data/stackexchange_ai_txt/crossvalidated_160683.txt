It has been a while since I used it, but I am pretty sure you have add a parameter when running the training to say that you have a regression problem not a classification problem. I also think SVM will just interpret NA as 0 and push that through the projection. So it will interpret a new customer the same way as an old one, who did not buy anything in all your time periods. Hope that helps.
