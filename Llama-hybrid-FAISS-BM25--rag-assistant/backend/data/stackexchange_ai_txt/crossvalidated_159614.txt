You can use the Matching package instead in the following steps: Use any package (preferably the MICE package) to impute n complete data sets. You will need to impute at least 5 data sets. Extract n complete data sets from the imputation. Calculate a propensity score (for treatment) in each complete data set. Average the propensity score in all n data sets and use that to retrieve your matched cohort by using the Matching package, in which you can use externally obtained propensity scores for creating matched groups. This is one of the alternatives for doing multiply imputed matching in R.
