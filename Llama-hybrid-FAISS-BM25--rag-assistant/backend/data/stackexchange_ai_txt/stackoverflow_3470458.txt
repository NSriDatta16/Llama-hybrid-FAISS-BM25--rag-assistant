What java android files should I not upload to my SVN Server?

I just setup SVN for my java Android project through SubEclipse. Can anyone advise me on which files I should not upload to the repository? Just like in Objective C I have my build files in a separate folder, I still don't know how the build system in Java organizes files and what is considered "build" files. Any advice?
