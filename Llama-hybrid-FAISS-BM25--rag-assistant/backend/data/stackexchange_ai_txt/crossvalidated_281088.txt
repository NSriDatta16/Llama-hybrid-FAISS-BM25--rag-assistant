What is the typical taxonomy for clustering methods?

What is the typical taxonomy for clustering methods? For example, for regression we can talk about: simple regression, multiple univariate regression, and multivariate regression. And then, we can divide each of those three branches in two sub-branches: linear and non-linear. In that sense, I need a taxonomy for clustering methods, so I can approach them and study them in a more organized way. Kind Regards
