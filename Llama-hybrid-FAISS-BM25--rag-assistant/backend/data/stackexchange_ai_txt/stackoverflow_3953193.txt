jquery,prototype,mootools altogether in magento

I have got a template which is really nice with great Ui. But they used jquery and mootools without any prob. And now i incorporate that one with magento but i have the prob with prototype. Is it possible to use all these libraries together. Please help me. And one query with stackoverflow : here i had more than 110 reputation but certainly today i see only 1. I dont know why? Thanks
