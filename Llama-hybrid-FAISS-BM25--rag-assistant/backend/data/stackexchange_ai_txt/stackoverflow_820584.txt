First thing is to get the begin date, which would be the following function: =Now() - 7 If you renamed that cell to "WeekBegin", then you could use the following formula to calculate the total hours: =SUMIF(A:A,">=" & WeekBegin,B:B) Notice that I used column references; this was to both simplify the formula, but also allow you to add new data to the end of the range easily. You will need to take care that your WeekBegin cell is not in that column A or column B, otherwise you'll get a circular reference warning. If you planned to have numeric data above or below your input range, you would need to explicitly call out the sum and criteria ranges as follows: =SUMIF(A2:A14,">=" & WeekBegin,B2:B14) Additionally, you may find that your result comes up initially as a decimal. That's Excel's date serial format, so you may need to format your result as time. Hope that helps! [Edit: On second pass, if you're looking to sum a range based on a from and to date (so any 7 days as you seem to imply in your post), look for the previous poster's note, i.e.: =SUM(B:B) - SUMIF(A:A, " "& EndDate, B:B) A more elegant solution is offered in Excel 2007 using the SumIFS() function: =SUMIFS(B:B, A:A, ">=" & FromDate,A:A, " Note that the arguments for SUMIFS are in a different order than the standard SUMIF. Happy Summing!]
