I can't say with 100% certainty, but I can give you my two cents. Let's start with the difference in philosophy between statistics (as practised in the books mentioned) and machine learning. The former is (usually, but not always) concerned with some sort of inference. There is usually a latent parameter, like the sample mean or the effect of a novel drug, which requires estimation as well as a statement on the precision of the estimate. The latter (usually, but not always) eschews estimating anything except the conditional mean (be it a regression or a probability in the case of some classification models). Thus "model selection" in each context means something slightly different by virtue of having different goals. Cross validation is a means of selecting models by means of estimating their generalization error. It is, therefore, primarily a tool for predictive modelling. But statistics (again usually, but always) is not concerned with generalization error as much as it is concerned with parsimony (for example), hence statistics don't use CV to select models. Prediction from a statisticians point of view is not absent of cross validation. Indeed, Frank Harrell's Regression Modelling Strategies mentions the technique, but that book is primarily concerned with the development of predictions models for use in the clinic.
