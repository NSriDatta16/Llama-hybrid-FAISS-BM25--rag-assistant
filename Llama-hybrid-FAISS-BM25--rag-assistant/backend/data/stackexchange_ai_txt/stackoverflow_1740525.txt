@deceze and RageZ: I'm using load() to get its attribute like this $url = 'web address return an XML result'; $xml = load($url); $node1 = $xml->getElmentsByTagName('tagname'); $value = $node1->getAttribute('attribute1'); But I have an error $xml is not an object and I check out by print_r and I get nothing but with print_r(file($url)) its print out an array as I expect! @Franz: May be I get an error tag in XML file but I could not fixed this just work with the result!
