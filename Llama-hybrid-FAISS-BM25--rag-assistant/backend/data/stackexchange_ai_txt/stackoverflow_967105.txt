Just a couple of resources make it pretty easy to roll your own Here is an example of a GET request via ASIO (the C++ networking library in Boost) Here is the HTTP protocol made really easy The GET request is how you can view any page on your site. With that code you can download any page and get it as raw text. As you can see it sends a GET header to the server. As explained in that HTTP protocol page , the POST request looks like this POST /path/script.cgi HTTP/1.0 From: frog@jmarshall.com User-Agent: HTTPTool/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 32 home=Cosby&favorite+flavor=flies To send a file: You put your URL after post change the content type to the type of file you are trying to upload. Set Content-Length to the number of bytes in that file Append the file after a carrage return (replace "home=Cosby&favorite+flavor=flies")
