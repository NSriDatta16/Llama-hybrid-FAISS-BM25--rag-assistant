Detecting position with drag-and-drop and jQuery?

I need to know how to detect the position of a dragged item as opposed to other divs. I need to detect whether an item is dropped outside of two different divs. (I am building a mac dock type start page and I need to know how to do this so I can delete icons by dragging them off the bar.) Any help would be greatly appreciated.
