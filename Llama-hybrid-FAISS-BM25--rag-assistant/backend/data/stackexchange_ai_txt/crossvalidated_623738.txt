Ratio of random variables and the expected ratio of the average

Suppose I have the following random variables $X_1, X_2, Y_1, Y_2$ , their support is the natural numbers. $X_1$ and $Y_1$ as well as $X_2$ and $Y_2$ are not independent. I am given that $E(X_1/Y_1 ) \leq b$ and $E(X_2 / Y_2) \leq b$ . Is it necessary that also $E\left( (X_1 + X_2) / (Y_1 + Y_2) \right)\leq b$ ? Is there a proof or counter example?
