If you're trying to do dimensionality reduction, you should use Mahout- it is best in class, and the only open source project afaik to offer truly distributed versions of PCA / SVD. http://mahout.apache.org/docs/0.13.1-SNAPSHOT/algorithms/linear-algebra/d-spca.html http://mahout.apache.org/docs/0.13.1-SNAPSHOT/algorithms/linear-algebra/d-ssvd.html Mahout also has DBSCAN implementation, WIP as part of a Google Summer of Code project, worth keeping an eye on. I'm guessing Anony's "Mahout is Bad" remark (I agree Spark is) is relevant to the deprecated MapReduce version of Mahout (as the new version hasn't implemented K-Means out of the box yet, though there is a discussion on the mailing list about how to do this fairly easily).
