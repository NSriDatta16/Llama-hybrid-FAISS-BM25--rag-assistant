You could capture the URLRequest here: - (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType and hand the request over to the delegate and return no. Then in the received response call from NSURLConnection cancel the connection and if everything is fine (check response) load the urlrequest once more in the webview. Make sure to return YES in the above call when loading the urlrequest again. Not very elegant, but it might work.
