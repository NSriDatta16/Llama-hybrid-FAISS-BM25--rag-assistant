The best approach is to think again and not do this. Frank Harrell wrote, of categorizing continuous variables, "Nothing could be more disastrous" ( Regression Modeling Strategies, 2nd ed p. 19). I know you start off with a discrete scale, but the principle is the same. I also recently put up an article on Medium about this, using graphs to show just how bad it is. What should you do instead? That depends on what your goal is, what data you have, how it was collected and so on. Is this "Quality" going to be a dependent variable, an independent variable or what? Or are you just trying to describe the level of quality? For instance, one place where quality ratings come into play are ratings of services (the little cards you sometimes get in hotels or restaurants or some other places). These are not used to measure satisfaction because the people who fill them out are not a random sample - they are more likely to be either very satisfied or very dissatisfied. Here, you would use these to identify problems or areas that are superlative. If quality is a DV, then you might start with ordinal logistic regression.
