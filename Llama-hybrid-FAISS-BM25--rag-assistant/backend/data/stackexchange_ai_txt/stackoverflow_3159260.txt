GPS Signal Strength Calculation

I want to display a signal bar for a GPS device using .NET CF. I'm able to read NMEA data and get the SNR signals. But they are a number of satellites with some active and some inactive with various SNRs. I thought about getting average of total SNR but it won't give a accurate value as three strong signal satellite is enough for GPS fix and with another 5 satellites with bad SNR can mess up the signal bar calculation. How am I gonna calculate GPS signal in percentages in a proper way?
