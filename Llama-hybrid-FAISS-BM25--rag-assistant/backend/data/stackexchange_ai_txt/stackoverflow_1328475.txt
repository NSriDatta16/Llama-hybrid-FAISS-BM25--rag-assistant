Have you tried sendEmail ? I have had success with a similar standalone Win32 commandline mail agent called Blat and am also looking for a similar solution on linux that does not require system support. In the past I have used ssmtp as light weight alternative to sendmail although it typically requires system wide configuration and support. While this is useful for many application that require a functioning MTA, I understand that it does not solve your specific concern.
