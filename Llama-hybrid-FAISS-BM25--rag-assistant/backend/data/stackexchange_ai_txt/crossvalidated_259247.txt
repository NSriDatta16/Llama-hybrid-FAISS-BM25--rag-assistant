To add the time step you may need the Recurrent Neural Network, and as a simple solution, you can just have the last state information by adding the $\sum u_{jJ}s_{J}(t-1)$ and $\sum v_{ji}x_i(t)$ as the net in the tanh hidden layer. $s_J(t-1)$ is the Jth neural in the recurrent layer $u_{jJ}$ is its weight between it and the jth neural in the next layer; $x_i$ is the ith neural in the normal input node, and $v_{ji}$ is the weight between it and the ith node in the next layer(the input layer of the softmax).
