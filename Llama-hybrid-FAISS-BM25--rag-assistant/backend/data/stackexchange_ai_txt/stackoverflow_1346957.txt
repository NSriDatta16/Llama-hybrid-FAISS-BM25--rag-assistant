IPhone - How to fire the event immediately

I am working on Iphone application and new to dev. I am sorry if my question is very basic one. I searched net, but could not get answer. My question is, when user touches the iphone, I want to get that event to be exexecuted immediately instead of waiting for the previous event to complete. I call while loop(present in different class) inside touchBegan method. I want to stop that loop when I get another touch event. But touchBegan event is not called (instead queued) as I am still present in the touch began. Can anybody please help me how to fire the touch event immediately instead of waiting for the previous event to finish. Thank you in advance.
