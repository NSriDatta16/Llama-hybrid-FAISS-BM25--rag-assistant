Criteria for choosing between PCA and sparse PCA

A bit of a neophyte question: I want to conduct data reduction on an NLP dataset 2000+ variables and 100000 plus cases. I am looking at different data reduction techniques discussed in "Robust Methods for Data Reduction" by Alessio Farcomeni and Luca Greco However, I am not quite clear as to what criteria I need to consider when selecting between a "standard" PCA and a sparse PCA methodology. Any pointers would be appreciated
