How to ANSI-C cast from unsigned int * to char *?

I want these two print functions to do the same thing: unsigned int Arraye[] = {0xffff,0xefef,65,66,67,68,69,0}; char Arrage[] = {0xffff,0xefef,65,66,67,68,69,0}; printf("%s", (char*)(2+ Arraye)); printf("%s", (char*)(2+ Arrage)); where Array is an unsigned int. Normally, I would change the type but, the problem is that most of the array is numbers, although the particular section should be printed as ASCII. Currently, the unsigned array prints as "A" and the char array prints as the desired "ABCDE".
