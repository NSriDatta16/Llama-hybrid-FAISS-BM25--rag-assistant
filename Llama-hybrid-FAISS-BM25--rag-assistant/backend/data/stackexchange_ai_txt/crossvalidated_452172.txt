To be honest, I think this is an ill-posed problem as you have too few data points while the dimension of the data points is too high. From a machine learning perspective, we would treat the 1800 gene expressions as a feature vector for each patient. (Of course, you can do some dimension reduction like principal components analysis for the gene expression data) Then you can train a classifier to predict healthy donors/patients for each disease given gene expressions. From a regression perspective, considering you have 1800 genes, I think you can easily find some genes that strongly (albeit suspiciously) correlate with some symptoms.
