Too many ways to skin a cat?

I just started another new job in a PHP LAMP role, and once again I am faced with a steep learning curve. As great and as useful as PHP is, I'm starting to feel that it's a little too flexible. Unlike Ruby, which has the single accepted Rails framework, us PHP developers have a plethora of possibilities to be thrown at us such as code igniter, zend, cakephp and kohana. Various blogging tools may also come into play such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomal etc.. Then we have presentation abstraction frameworks like Smarty. The list goes on. It seems that PHP as a language gives so much freedom for developers to do things in different ways that it is very difficult to keep things consistent or to "hit the ground running" so to speak when you start at a new organization. Since my experience is predominantly PHP based I'm wondering if developers in other language get this as much? Or am I way off on this one?
