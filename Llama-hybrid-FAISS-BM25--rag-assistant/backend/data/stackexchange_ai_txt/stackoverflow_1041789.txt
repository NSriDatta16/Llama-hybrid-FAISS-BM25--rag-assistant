Can I combine my two SQLite SELECT statements into one?

I have a SQLite table called posts . An example is shown below. I would like to calculate the monthly income and expenses. accId date text amount balance ---------- ---------- ------------------------ ---------- ---------- 1 2008-03-25 Ex1 -64.9 3747.56 1 2008-03-25 Shop2 -91.85 3655.71 1 2008-03-26 Benny's -100.0 3555.71 For the income I have this query: SELECT SUBSTR(date, 0,7) "month", total(amount) "income" FROM posts WHERE amount > 0 GROUP BY month ORDER BY date; It works fine: month income ---------- ---------- 2007-05 4877.0 2007-06 8750.5 2007-07 8471.0 2007-08 5503.0 Now I need the expenses and I could of cause just repeat the first statement with the condition amount , but I am wondering if there is an elegant way to get both income and expenses in one query?
