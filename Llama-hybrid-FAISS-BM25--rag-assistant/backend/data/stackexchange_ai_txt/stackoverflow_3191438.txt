The answer to your question is obviously no, because the specs say you can't do it. Like you, I like to maintain semantics, so I usually go with your 2nd option (paragraph, list, another paragraph). However, off the top of my head, I can't think of any text where the list doesn't actually break the flow of text, so it seems that starting a new paragraph after a list can't hurt.
