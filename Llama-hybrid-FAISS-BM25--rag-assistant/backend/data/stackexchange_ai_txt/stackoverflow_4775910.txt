How do most people organize code within an application (sub folders)?

In a website, I see some developers put code into app_code, and sometimes appcode (due to some bug), other files into DataModel, and other files into miscellaneous folders. Is there a standard approach to organizing code within an application? How is it different between an ASP.NET, MVC, Silverlight, Console, Database, and WCF application? The reason I mention WCF is because many people seem to have a shared types library that is linked between the server and client code. Where can I learn these common practices without having to try, fail, and try again. I'd rather just learn it once from the experts.
