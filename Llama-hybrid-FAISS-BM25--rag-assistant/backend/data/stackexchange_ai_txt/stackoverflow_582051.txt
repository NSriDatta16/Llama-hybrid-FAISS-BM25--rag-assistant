As people have mentioned here, your indexes do not automatically rebuild. This is quite a big problem in SQL Server, as your indexes will fragment over time. Your could find your indexes are 95% plus fragmented, affecting query performance badly. Here is a simple query to check fragmentation on your existing indexes: DECLARE @DBNAME VARCHAR(130); SET @DBNAME = 'MYDBNAME'; DECLARE @DBID INT; SET @DBID = DB_ID(@DBNAME); SELECT OBJECT_ID AS objectID , index_id AS indexID , avg_fragmentation_in_percent AS fragmentation , page_count INTO #indexDefragList FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (@DBID, NULL, NULL , NULL, N'Limited') WHERE index_id > 0 OPTION (MaxDop 1); SELECT i.[name] as indexname, d.fragmentation, d.page_count FROM #indexDefragList d INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON d.objectid = i.object_id ORDER BY d.fragmentation DESC DROP TABLE #indexDefragList This will return a list of all indexes in your current DB with their fragmentation in %. You can easily build a script to automatically rebuild or reorganise them. There is a great article from SQLFool on this including a complete pre-made script.
