When I was myself looking for a replacement to Hibernate I stumbled upon DataNucleus Access Platform , which is an Apache2-licensed ORM. It isn't just ORM as it provides persistence and retrieval of data also in other datasources than RDBMS, like LDAP, DB4O and XML. I don't have any usage experience, but it looks interesting.
