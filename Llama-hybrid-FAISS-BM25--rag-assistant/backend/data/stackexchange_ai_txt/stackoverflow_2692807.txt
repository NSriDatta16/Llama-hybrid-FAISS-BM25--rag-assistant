C# - Recursive / Reflection Property Values

What is the best way to go about this in C#? string propPath = "ShippingInfo.Address.Street"; I'll have a property path like the one above read from a mapping file. I need to be able to ask the Order object what the value of the code below will be. this.ShippingInfo.Address.Street Balancing performance with elegance. All object graph relationships should be one-to-one. Part 2: how hard would it be to add in the capability for it to grab the first one if its a List<> or something like it.
