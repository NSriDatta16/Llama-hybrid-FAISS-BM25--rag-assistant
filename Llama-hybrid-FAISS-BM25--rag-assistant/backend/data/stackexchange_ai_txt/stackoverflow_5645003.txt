UITableViewCell ( cell is object of this class) has few subviews added on it, one of them is referred by textLabel . textLabel is UILabel object and it is declared as property in UITableViewCell so that we can access it using UITableViewCell object. text is property of UILabel which helps to set text apearing on label. So cell gives you UITableViewCell then you access textLabel and set its text property. [myArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; is call for accessing an object from array( myArray ) with given index. Here myArray should return NSString as its object so that it could be set as text of textLabel . objetAtIndex is method that will return you array element located at given index. as we do for examle in C , myArray[0]---> [] bracket is for our (primitive type) data retrieval at given index in bracket. In object-c you have this method, objectAtIndex: (defined for NSArray ), does the same work. indexPath.row denotes we are accessing row property of indexPath ( NSIndexPath object)[similarly it has section property ] . and " . " is operator for accessing the properties. more detailed insights are available in apple documentation. Thanks,
