Postgres replication

Right now I have a database (about 2-3 GB) in PostgreSQL, which serves as a data storage to RoR/Python LAMP-like application. What kind tools are there that are simple and robust enough for replication of the main database to a second machine? I looked through some packages (Slony-I and etc.) but it would be great to hear real-life stories as well. Right now I'm not concerned with load balancing and etc. I am thinking about using simple Write-Ahead-Log strategy for now.
