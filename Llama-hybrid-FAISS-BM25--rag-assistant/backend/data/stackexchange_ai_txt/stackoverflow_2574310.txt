I don't think TDD is limited to OO at all. Try the frameworks Unity & CMock. an example from their wiki: void test_ShowSomeSillyExamples(void) { TEST_ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL(0, -1); TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT(1, 1); TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX16(0x1234, 0x1234); TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_STRING("These Are The Same", "These Are The Same"); TEST_ASSERT_BITS(0x1111, 0x5555, 0x7175); TEST_ASSERT_INT_WITHIN(5, 100, 102); } see: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/embunity/wiki A book: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jgade/test-driven-development-for-embedded-c A Yahoo group about this stuff: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/AgileEmbedded/ If you would do TDD in C, would you need to write your tests in C? I would probably write the production code in C and the tests in C++ using Google's gtest.
