parametrizing dataset into normal distribution for simulation and dealing with an impossible negative values

I am trying to simulate the production based on the historical data of the ratio between production planning vs realization. I have some doubt regarding my distribution, here are what I did so far: the data was given by this distribution: with n=315, mean=1.03 std=0.52 I cut the outlier at 1.5IQR so the distribution looked this: with n=299, mean=0.80 std=0.38 then I create 1000 random normal values based on the previous mean and std n=1000 mean=0.80 std=0.36 as you can there are some negative values on the resulting distribution which is impossible in real situation. as far as I understand, I have two option to dealing with this negative values, which is just drop it, or drag it to 0 n=987 mean=0.82 std=0.35 n=1000 mean=0.81 std=0.36 so in conlusion my question are: 1. Is it right for me to model it with normal distribution? 2. Which is the best practice to dealing with the negative values?(I know in this case the results of both are not that far off, but I need to do this with a lot of other dataset, and some of it seems to have lower mean and larger std which I think would give me a lot more negative values.) Thanks.
