It means what it says: your installation of MySQL is compiled or configured not to provide any support for the ‘InnoDB’ database backend. The alternative and default database backend, ‘MyISAM’, is largely undesirable as it does not offer the data-integrity features that robust applications require. If you have access to the my.cnf on your server, edit it to see if you can re-enable InnoDB support (by eg. removing any skip-innodb statement). If not, you'll need to install or compile your own copy of MySQL that hasn't been neutered in this way. If you are on some sort of shared hosting where you don't have access to any of this stuff, you'll have to move to a different host or plan that doesn't lump you with a pathetically broken MySQL install. It may be possible to make Magento run on MyISAM by hacking its code to remove ENGINE=InnoDB from its schema-creation code, but you don't really want to run anything critical on MyISAM.
