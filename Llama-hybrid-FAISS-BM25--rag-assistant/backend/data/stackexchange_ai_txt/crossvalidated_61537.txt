What is the average value and standard deviation of the resulting recognition rates? If you have a high deviation, that would point out that your classifier is sensible to training data, i.e. you might be overfitting. If the deviation is high, what if you use 70-30% or 80-20%. Do you still have the same problem?. Do you shuffle the samples before splitting them into groups? Since you are using SVM, another possibility could be that if the distribution of samples is skewed across classes (you get by change a lot of samples from one class and very few from another) that you run into this problem too. A possible solution would be to try stratified cross validation in scikit-learn. The point is to ensure same number of samples per class.
