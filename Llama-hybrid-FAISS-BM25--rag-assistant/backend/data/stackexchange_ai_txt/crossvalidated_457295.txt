Numerous works have come forward after Ladder Networks. The most recent and state of the art as of March 29, 2020 is Fixmatch . Recent approaches are making use of new data augmentation techniques like RandAugment, AutoAugment, Cutout, Mixup, CutMix, etc. as well as formulate the problem in the following ways: Consistency-training Train model such that it predicts the same label for both original and augmented versions of an unlabelled image. Example: Unsupervised Data Augmentation Self-training Train model on labeled data, predict on unlabelled data and combine confident labels along with the labeled examples to train a new model. Rinse and repeat). Example: Noisy Student Combined Approaches Combine both the above approaches along with a combination of augmentation techniques. Example: FixMatch You can view the papers after Ladder Network organized by month and year here .
