Firefox To Play Ogg

I have an ogg/audio file converted from mp3 using Alt WAV MP3 Ogg Converter. When I drag and drop the file in Firefox or in Google Chrome, the audio plays nicely. But when a use the following code to place the file inside a page it only works on Chrome. My code is simple as that: Someone can tell me why? Thanks
