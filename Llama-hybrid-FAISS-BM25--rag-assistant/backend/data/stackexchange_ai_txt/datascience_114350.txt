Python and R are both very popular in Data Science field, so it's hard to say which one to prefer. From my experience I would say that python is probably more commonly used when it comes to more Data Engineer-oriented positions, while R in more mathematical-modeling-oriented ones, but this is not necessarily a hard rule. I think being a software engineer you will probably also find python easier to learn at a good level, so if I were you I would go with python probably. One thing that needs to be said though, is that Data Science is a field that needs constant evolution of your knowledge and skills. For instance, Matlab used to be the most commonly used tool in the industry 6-8 years ago and now it is almost completely replaced by Python and R, Neural Networks were completely out of the picture until 2012 that they very quickly became state of the art,etc. So just keep in mind that entering in Data Science - at least from my experience - means that you are willing to keep updating your knowledge.
