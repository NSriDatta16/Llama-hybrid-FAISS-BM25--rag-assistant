SVM hyperplane equations for linearly seperable data

I'm going through Wikipedia article on SVM and came across these equations: It says: With a normalized or standardized dataset, the parallel hyperplanes to our required hyperplane $wx+b=0$ , can be described by the equations $wx+b=1$ and $wx+b=-1$ What is meant by normalized and standardized data here? If the data is not standardized, what equation should be used?
