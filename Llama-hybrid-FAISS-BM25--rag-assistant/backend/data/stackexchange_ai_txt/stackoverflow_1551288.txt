Catch network adapter up/down and address changed event (Windows, C#)

I am searching for a method to be notified when any windows network interfaces go up or down or the addresses of any network interfaces are changed. I would prefer solutions in C#, C is also possible. Winpcap could be used. I am aware that there is an event for network adapter address changes in C#, but this also possible without enumerationg all adapters and looking the changed settings? May some advanced programmer help a fellow newbie. with best regards
