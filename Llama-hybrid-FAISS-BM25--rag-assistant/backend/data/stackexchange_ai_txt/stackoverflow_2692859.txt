How to open a URL containing a fragment (#foo) using SharedApplication and openURL on iPhone

I have a URL containing a fragment part, used to indicate a certain state of the webpage. I want to open this link in Safari on the iPhone by using something like the following: NSURL* fragmentURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.exampleurl.com/index.html#foo"]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:fragmentURL]; The link is successfully opened by Safari, but the fragment part is stripped. Has anybody got an idea on how to make Safari also use the fragment part?
