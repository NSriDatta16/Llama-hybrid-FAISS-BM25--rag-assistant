The 12-month rolling aggregation will remove seasonality which makes the task easier. For non-seasonal time series, the methods in the strucchange package for R are excellent. For seasonal time series, you might look at the BFAST (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend) method which is implemented in the bfast package for R. This method involves applying strucchange to the trend and seasonal components obtained from a decomposition of the data (applied iteratively to allow for the breaks discovered). You could apply bfast on the original data (without the 12-month aggregation). Neither of these methods requires stationarity. I would think that a direct modelling approach such as the one you propose would be less capable of finding general breaks due to the additional assumptions being made.
