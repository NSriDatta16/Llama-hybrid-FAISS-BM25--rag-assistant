Some hints and observations: I guess you want to enter 1 Student and 10 marks and calculate the average for that student. So you may not need the names array (you only get one name) name is only visible inside the block. If you need the name outside of that block, just remove the curly braces. for your average calculation you may try casting the integer values to double, like (double) total / (double) SIZE) (even though casting just one value should be enough) For GUI usage problems - you import a custom library, bet you have to double check the manual on how to use it. EDIT Your comment changed it a bit ;) Usually you would now create a small class like Result that holds a studentName attribute and a mark attribute (for simplification: we assume all students have unique names, so we don't need a studentID here). If you feel better solving the task without a class, we can emulate it with to arrays, one for names and one for marks. The following code demonstrates the flow: public void process() { final int SIZE = 10; String[] names = new String[SIZE]; int[] marks = new int[SIZE]; for(int i = 0; i Note: there are some things you could (should) do better in Java, but I think that's easy enough to get an understanding and get a solution.
