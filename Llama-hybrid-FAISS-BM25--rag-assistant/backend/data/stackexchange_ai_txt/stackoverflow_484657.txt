Just one point. In many ways, he has a point, but... Perl (or bash scripting) is a glue language. It is one of the best languages out there for sticking to systems and making them work better. Perl is a fully-interpreted language, which affords it significant power for run-time-code-rewrite and more dynamic programming styles. You can pass perl code blocks around as data, and modify them up until the moment you call "eval" on the string. Whether or not there's native java functionality to embed perl, you can easily create such embedding yourself, making for an immensely powerful system. You might want to make clear to your supervisor what potential you will lose if you remove the perl. At my last job, two of the developers got IronPython added to our "legal language list" so that we could implement libraries and trivially pass them through the database for a massive-scale automation project that turned into a very simple, very tiny project, with a bunch of python code gluing and being glued to compiled modules. All in all, there are times when a million lines of Java cannot do what 10 lines of Bash script does. That's when you want to use it. The rest of the time, your boss is right, so long as you're afforded the time to do it.
