I think there should be one set of tools and standards that are specified at architecture time that describes how design should be documented. It's really important to have a standard for documenting these things; otherwise, they tend to fall by the wayside; and if the design documentation is heterogenous, there's a danger that the people who really need to know the most about the design may not be able to find the design information they really need when they really need it. That said, the choice of tools and standards is entirely up to each different organization; whatever works for an organization is right for them. So long as there is consistency in the standards (and the tools, to some extent), whatever is chosen for an individual organization is right for them. It just needs to be decided upon, and enforced.
