How to use cross validation to estimate autocorrelation?

I have a stationary time series and I want to calculate the autocorrelation coefficient of order 1. For that I use OLS. I know the autocorrelation parameters change over the time. Thus it is not trivial to fix a window length for the regression. Moreover I can easily do over-fitting by finding the windows which optimize a criterion such as mean squared error, for example. Can I use cross validation to find the optimal window length?
