I believe the code used to convert your svg into a sprite is done with this code here which uses Batik . FWIW, the svg embedding documentation says: Flex supports a subset of the SVG 1.1 specification to let you import static, two-dimensional scalable vector graphics. This includes support for basic SVG document structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) styling, transformations, paths, basic shapes, colors, and a subset of text, painting, gradients, and fonts. Flex does not support SVG animation, scripting, or interactivity with the imported SVG image. ... but that doesn't help you with specifics. Depending on which version of Batik Adobe has bundled, this list might help. This looks helpful - information on which gradients from inkscape are not supported fully in batik .
