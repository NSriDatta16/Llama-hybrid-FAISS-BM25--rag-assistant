You can "use" deep learning for regression. You have to consider the following: You can use a fully connected neural network for regression, just don't use any activation unit in the end (i.e. take out the RELU, sigmoid) and just let the input parameter flow-out (y=x). Consider that a NN with one neuron without activation unit is basically a simple linear regression. More generally this is not what you want, you will be using a very complicated structure of chained linear regressions that can tend to overfitting. Ridge regressions, Lasso, SVR and Bayesian predictors would do a better job at it and you would have better control about what you want to do.
