This test is more prominently know as Breusch-Pagan test . It is a test for heteroscedasticity . In a standard linear model, the variance of the residuals are assumed to be constant (i.e. independent) over the values of the response (fitted values). In your specific case, there is some evidence for a non-constant variance of the residuals (heteroscedasticity). A good suggestion would be to plot the residuals vs. the fitted values which you can do in R with plot(reg.mod) after calculating the regression model. Also, have a look at the search page with the term "Breusch-Pagan" of cross validated. There are a lot of questions similar to yours.
