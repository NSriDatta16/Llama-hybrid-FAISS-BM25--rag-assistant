Is there an equivelant to spring's ContextLoader for a non-webapp

I would like a class analogous to spring's ContextLoader/ContextLoaderListener/ContextLoadServlet. These classes are invoked when the application server initializes and puts your configured context into memory. What is the analogy of this for an application that does not have a container wrappering it? This would preclude multiple instantiations, provide a unified retrieval location, and not suffer Double Checked Locking lameness either.
