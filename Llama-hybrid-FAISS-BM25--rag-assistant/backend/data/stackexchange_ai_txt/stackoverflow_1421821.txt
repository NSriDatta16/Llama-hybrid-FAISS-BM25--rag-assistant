Things that are 'relatively' fast in C# may be extremely slow in C++. You can write 'faster' code in C++, but you can also write much slower code. Especially debug builds may be extremely slow in C++. So look at the type of optimizations by your compiler. Mostly when porting applications, C# programmers tend to use the 'create a million newed objects' approach, which really makes C++ programs slow. You would rewrite these algorithm to use pre-allocated arrays and run with tight loops over these. With pre-allocated memory you leverage the strengths of C++ in using pointers to memory by casting these to the right pod structured data. But it really depends on what you have written in your code. So measure your code an see where the implementations burn the most cpu, and then structure your code to use the right algorithms.
