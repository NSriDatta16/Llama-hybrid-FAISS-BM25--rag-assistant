I've been there before! Legacy surveys: can't live with them, can't live without them... While I agree with @Peter Flom's approach to look at correlations and reduce the number of highly correlated statements (this is a standard approach to reducing what I call "brick walls" of rating scales in surveys, and has the advantage of being simple enough for most people to understand and buy into your changes), there are a couple of other things I would point out. Survey length impacts responses through "differential mortality" , or that some respondents will be more likely to fail to complete than others. Typically, but not always, you will find that happier respondents are more likely to complete a long survey than unhappy respondents. If your main reason to continue using this questionnaire is to provide comparisons to prior data, then shortening the survey may not serve your needs. If you only need to use this one more time, you may be better off leaving it as is for now and focusing your efforts on the complete re-write. Some correlations reflect redundancy, some reflect coincidence : make sure you bring a level of judgment to what statements you choose to eliminate. A standard design for a hotel satisfaction survey will include a question about the customer's overall satisfaction with check-in, and later ask satisfaction with different aspects of the check-in experience like door staff, desk staff, etc. They will all be highly correlated with each other in a typical situation, but each drives different actions in the business, and though they are correlated now , if one aspect of the business reduces its performance, that's something the survey should detect. Consider an organizational solution : You might be able to eliminate a lot of questions just by asking the consumers of the data which different questions actually matter to them. If the survey is GIGO to start with, the statistical approach might just be layering on top of a bad base.
