JqueryUI Draggable - Auto resize parent container

I have two divs, one within the other. The outer div (the container) is of arbitrary dimensions. The inner div is set to a specified dimension smaller than its container. I have applied jquery draggable to the inner div and I'm looking to automatically resize its parent container when I drag the inner div past the outer edges of the container. How can I go about doing this? I see a similar feature here on StackOverflow when asking a new question. The textarea for typing in a question has a div named 'grippie' which resizes the textarea. This is exactly the functionality I'm looking for, but with a div instead of a textarea.
