Choosing the right build and deployment tools

I have a very large, mostly HTML/SSI site that I manage part-time and do weekly deployments on in addition do being an enterprise Magento developer. The site in question has ~5000 static HTML files and requires a lot of upkeep to manage deployments. In addition to that site, I manage numerous Magento installs. I currently manage them from SVN and do exports/checkouts from various production and qa branches/tags. While this is manageable, I don't get some of the things that I know build tools provide. Some of those features would be: Automatic Minification of CSS/JS Revision History Multi-server deployment Runtime configuration Stats of broken builds/build time/deployment frequency Integration with Testing frameworks The three tools I've been reviewing are Apache Ant phpUnderControl Capistrano (at the insistence of a friend of mine who is a RoR dev) I briefly looked at Hudson, and had a ton of problems trying to get it up and running. My Questions: What is the upside/downside of going to this type of strategy? Any hidden pitfalls that you've experienced? Which tool do you think would best fit for the deployment/management of the HTML site? Does anyone have experience with deploying distributed Magento from a deployment/build management system? Thanks in advance... Update Still no movement here, so I'm going to ask this: Should I rather rebuild in HTML5 Boilerplate which has Ant build scripts out of the box? This would afford me the ability to use Ant, but the build scripts are already pre-made so I have a good starting point. Your thoughts and suggestions are welcome.
