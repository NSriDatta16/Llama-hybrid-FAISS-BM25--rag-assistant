Cox model: how to model treatment variable when timing is unknown

We have cancer medical registry data, including information on date of diagnosis, treatment, and followup e.g. date of death etc. However, we only know type of treatment received for each person. We have no information on WHEN they received treatment, nor dose, frequency etc. Whilst this is not optimal, I guess this is better than not knowing at all. However we are uncertain how to model such treatment variables in e.g. a Cox model. It seems to me that a fixed in time covariate is not appropriate (e.g. may begin treatment well after time zero). Time varying covariate we cannot properly do either as this is precisely the information we lack. Running as a logistic regression model is one thing we thought of but that seems wasteful since we do know time to outcome. Any advice would be great! Update Only information on primary cancer and primary treatment is known. We don't have any information on subsequent treatment if recurrence occured. We have date for initial diagnosis of cancer (in situ) and also dates for diagnosis of invasive cancer and death (if either occured). Suppose we want to use a Cox model for time FROM in situ diagnosis to event (e.g. invasive cancer or death from cancer), we are unsure on where to start time zero in our situation . If we set time zero equal to in situ diagnosis date (unique to each person), then clearly nobody at that time has actualy had any treatment yet! Or we could make some assumptions about the likely timeframes which treatment USUSALLY occurs fololowing diagnosis and set time zero to after that? I guess I was thinking that this might lose power and also different treatment is likely to start at different times...e.g. maybe chemo, then radio etc. making it very confusing. I'm thinking along the lines of the comment from @EdM on this question: Cox model: advice on constructing time varying exposure to drugs where the comment says... Any fixed-in-time covariate should have a value that was in place at time=0 in the survival analysis. Despite this statistical requirement, might it be "valid" to still set time zero equal to in situ diagnosis date and think of it as patient will at some time over follow up experience treatment x, y z etc. even if they have not yet experienced any treament at all at time zero? And then model these treatemnt variables as just ordinary main effects (i.e. fixed in time rather than time varying) in the Cox model?
