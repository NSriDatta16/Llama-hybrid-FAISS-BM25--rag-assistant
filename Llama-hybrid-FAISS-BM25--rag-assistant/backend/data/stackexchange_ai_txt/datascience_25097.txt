What is the difference between 8 filters twice and one 16 filters in convolutional layers at CNN?

Why would we use two convolution layers in a row with same spec? E.g. in VGG16 first two layers, they used 3 x 3 filter with 64 depth twice. What is the difference if we use 3 x 3 filter with 128 depth once.
