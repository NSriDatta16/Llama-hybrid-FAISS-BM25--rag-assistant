No, it does not annoy me, because you can use multiple classes for an element and BOTH will match: .idiot { color:pink; text-decoration:underline; } .annoying { font-weight:bold; } /* and if you want to get REALLY specific... */ .annoying.idiot { background-image('ann.jpg'); } ... Ann Coulter Personally, I find this a much more versatile solution to the problem. For example, in jQuery (or in another framework), you can add and remove these classes -- most commonly, you'll add a "selected" class or something that might do something like highlight a table cell, and when someone clicks to toggle it off, you just remove the "selected" class. Uber-elegant IMO. In response to your edits, all you would have to do to remove the CSS from all of your A links would be to do something like this: #message > div > a { font-size:12px; } #footer > a { font-size:10px; } Where the > symbol means "is a child of" or, more generally (but this would also match an A directly inside #message and anything deeper -- the space means "is any descendant of") #message a { font-size:12px; } #footer a { font-size:10px; }
