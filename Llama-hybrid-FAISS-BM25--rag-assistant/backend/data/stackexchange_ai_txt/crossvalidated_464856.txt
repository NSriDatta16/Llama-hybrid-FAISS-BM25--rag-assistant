Should I group this dataset for Random Forest model?

I would like to make a model to predict grid id using two sensors (s1 and s2) features. A device emits a signal (e.g., WiFi) and sensors detect the signals. Each sensors record the RSSI (strength of signal) and freq (detection frequency). grid_id s1_RSSI s1_freq s2_RSSI s2_freq 0 grid_01 100 10 5 5 1 grid_01 200 20 3 3 2 grid_02 100 10 200 20 3 grid_02 30 5 100 10 In above table, it assumed that s1 sensor is near grid_01. If a device is in grid_01, there is higher RSSI and freq of s1 sensor rather than s2 sensor. If I make a randomforest model, below is the simple code. fp.rf However, I think that s1_RSSI and s1_freq should be grouped separately because these two variables would be highly correlated rather than s2_RSSI and s2_freq . In real datasets, there are more sensors (s1 to s6) and more parameters (RSSI, freq, ...). Here is my questions: 1) The term 'group' is right to apply my model? 2) Do I need to group the variables for my model?
