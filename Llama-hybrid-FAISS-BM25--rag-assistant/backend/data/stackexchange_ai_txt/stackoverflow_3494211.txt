The only way I know of is using FFMPEG. I have never used this script, but looking at it seems to be what you need, and may need some tweaking. http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/forums/jw-player/setup-issues-and-embedding/447/show-first-frame-as-preview-image EDIT To get the image / display it you would just use the html code: From what I gathered from that script. But of course, it would probably be better to, when you upload the video, run that and generate a "cache" of the image so that whole process does not have to run for each call.
