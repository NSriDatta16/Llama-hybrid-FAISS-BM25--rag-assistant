In order to leverage a collection for binding you'll need to check out ObservableCollection ( MSDN link ). By using that, you should subscribe to most of the binding you're looking for automatically. If you happen to be using something other than a bool for your objects, though, you'll have to implement INotifyPropertyChanged on whatever object you decide to bind to.
