Is there a way to link to a that has a unique "uri" attribute?

I am trying to link to a specific paragraph in a website that has added a "uri" attribute to each of their paragraphs. ie.: Any way to do that? (To clarify, this is not a site that I have any control over or can change beyond suggesting that they change, just wondering if there is a way to link to the way they currently do it.)
