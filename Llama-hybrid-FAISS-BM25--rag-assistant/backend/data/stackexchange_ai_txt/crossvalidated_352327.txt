Why are the coefficients in a multinomial logistic regression a matrix?

I am conducting an analysis in which I have 3 different groups and a set of 80 continuous variables that I think can discriminate between the 3 groups. I want to: see if indeed I can discriminate the groups with these variables, and get an idea of which of these variables are the most effective in discriminate between the two groups. To this aim, I have decided to conduct a multinomial linear regression with l1 penalty as implemented in scikit-learn. After having fitted the model with my data, I found that indeed the 3 groups can be discriminated and the l1 penalty worked as expected: the solution is sparse as most of the coefficients are set to 0. However, I do not understand the output of the model: when I look at the coefficients of the model, what I got is an array with the dimensions: number of groups x number of variables . This seems to mean that the coefficients are calculated for each group, but this does not make much sense. This is the type of output that I would have expected using a one-vs-rest approach to multiclass logistic regression, not using a multinomial one. How should interpret the output of my model?
