Regarding the missing condition: This seems to be a result of dummy/effect coding. That is what happens in the background of the regression functions as these are not able to deal with ordinal data directly. It splits your ordinal predictor (your conditions) into three minus one binary predictors (condition 1: 0, 1; condition 2: 0,1) - one for each condition. The estimate that you get for the two presented conditions is to be interpreted relatively to the third ("missing") condition, which is described here as the intercept. Regarding model selection: You want to conduct a logistic regression. Therefore, you should use the modeling approach accordingly. In your case, this would be your glmer model. lme is a purely linear model which does not suit your assumptions.
