They can, if you're using old style tags, i.e. derived from BodyTag. SimpleTag implementations can't however. Because JSP fragments do not support scriptlets, the of a SimpleTag cannot be "JSP" Personally I'd avoid using Java to write tags at all if you can, and just use the new .tag style. You can incorporate Java code into such tag files, though in general if you are forced to do that you're probably doing something wrong.
