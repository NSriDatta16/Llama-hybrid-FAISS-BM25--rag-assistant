Why are emmip( "response") y axis numbers not probabilities for ordinal regression?

I used emmeans functions (with help from this site) to obtain pairwise comparisons for different levels of variables in a model with interactions. Interpreting an interaction term in the context of study The model int was estimated with lrm() from the rms package . The plot below was plotted with emmip(int, ses~fam, type = "response", CIs = T, levels = 0.95) and I also tested type = "linear.predictor" . These two options returned exactly the same plot. Using the emmip function with response mode to plot the effects, I expected to get the probabilities for the levels of ordinal response, but the y axis has values between-3 and -1. I also printed the plotted means. The means and their were called with emmeans(model, specs = pairwise ~ ses*fam ) and I also extracted $contrasts adding %>%confint(adjust = "tukey") . I cannot work out what these numbers are and why they are negative. What do they reflect and how do they relate to the pairwise comparisons from emmeans? I expected them to be probabilities for each outcome adding to 1. In response to the comments: So the negative numbers come from the "Latent Variable" that underlies the ordinal regression model. A vignette for emmeans describes different ways ("modes") to express the results. With respect to rms models, it says: rms models have an additional mode. With mode = "middle" (this is the default), the middle intercept is used, comparable to the default for rms::Predict() . This is quite similar in concept to mode = "latent" , where all intercepts are averaged together. As the intercepts of my model are: cat1|cat2 2.198193 cat2|cat3 3.158535 Could I ask how these means relate to the contrasts that can be obtained for the combinations of all the levels of ses and family type (from emmeans contrasts)? For example in contrasts there is a significant difference between low ses family and and low ses family c, but the means of predicted response are not different as their confidence intervals overlap. And is it possible and does it make sense to "remove" the average intercepts from the plot?
