Building random forest and svm in R caret take a very long time

I have searched for that problem but I haven't found a straight forward answer, so I am working with about 1.4 million numeric values and a few train() funtions. Now the problem is with "svmradial" and the "Random Forest" models which they take a really long time with my i7 6500U CPU and my 4GB of RAM. Is there a way to speed up that process? control=trainControl(method="cv", number=10) metric="Accuracy" fit.knn=train(class~., data=dataset, method="knn", metric=metric, trControl=control) fit.rf=train(class~., data=dataset, method="rf", metric=metric, trControl=control)
