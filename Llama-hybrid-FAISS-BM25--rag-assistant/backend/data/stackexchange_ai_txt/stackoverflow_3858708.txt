Android phones are getting cheaper, soon you could get an android phone for almost the price of the mid-range J2ME handsets Android SDK doesnt face the issue of the first mover that J2ME had, so the SDK is quite powerful and in tune with the times, where as J2ME wasn't updated for years Android, though fragmented in terms of versions, doesnt have the JSR nightmares that J2ME has (Vendors not implementing the JSR completely or in a different fashion) However, things could really be great for J2ME, if Oracle succeeds in making the J2ME.next, We could really get an almost write once run anywhere, if they can somehow also allow installable VM's like standard J2SE VM
