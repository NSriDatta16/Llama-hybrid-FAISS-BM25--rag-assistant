magento - Image type and information need to be specified for each store view

I have a working Magento 1.4.1.0 installation that is due to go live next week, all was well until yesterday when I noticed the following message when uploading images to a product ' Image type and information need to be specified for each store view' . The image uploads fine and is visible on my server, the preview works when I hover over it too. But when I attempt to load the product on the front-end the template breaks in places and when I view the source the img src="" is blank? Two things I played around with before I noticed it wasn't working were image watermarks and attribute sets, could this be a factor? I have searched the Magento forums but cannot find a solution that works.. I have tried the following to fix it... Installing the dull uploading to replace the flash one, tweaking the .htaccess and php.ini , flushing the cache and indexes. I am at a total loss and have a fast approaching deadline. Please can someone help? Thanks Dan
