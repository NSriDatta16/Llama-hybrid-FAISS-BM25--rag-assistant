I don't like this approach because the default case is untestable. This leads to reduced coverage in your unit tests, which while isn't necessarily the end of the world, annoys obsessive-compulsive me. I would prefer to simply unit test each case and have an additional assertion that there are only four possible cases. If anyone ever added new enum values, a unit test would break. Something like [Test] public void ShouldOnlyHaveFourStates() { Assert.That(Enum.GetValues( typeof( DrivingState) ).Length == 4, "Update unit tests for your new DrivingState!!!"); }
