Learning XML, what are the next steps? (navigating a document elegantly)

The xml fields seems filled wit jargon, (well to new XML users its jargon), DTD, DOM, and SGML just to name a few. I've read up on what an XML document is, and what makes a document valid. What I need are the next steps, or how to actually use an XML document. For the .Net platform there seems to be a plethora of ways to traverse an XML document, xpath, XMLReader (from System.Xml), datasets, and even the lowly streamreader. What is the best approach? Where can I find more "advanced beginner" material? Most of the material I find is about differences in XML parsing approaches (like performance, more advanced stuff that assumes one has XML experience), or explaining XML in general terms for non-programmers (how it's platform independent, human readable, etc.) Thanks! Also for specifics I'm using C# (so .Net). I've tinkered around with XML in vba, but Ive run into the same problems. Practical application here is getting an iOS application to dump info into a SQL server.
