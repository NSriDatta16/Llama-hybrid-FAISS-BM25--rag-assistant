How to map base entity properties in Entity Framework?

I am setting up an entity model where I have a common base entity for most of the other entities. For example: Person -> BaseEntity BaseEntity Id Created etc... Person FirstName LastName ect... In the corresponding storage table all the columns are in the Person table. Person Id Created FirstName LastName etc... When I go to map the entity properties in the Person entity I want to map the Id column in the Person table to the Id property in EntityBase and the FirsName column to the FirstName entity property. However, when you are on the Person entity and add the Person table for mapping you can only map the properties in the Person entity not those in the inherited class? Have I setup something wrong conceptually? Thanks
