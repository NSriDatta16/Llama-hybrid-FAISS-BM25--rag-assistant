The PollingDuplexHttpBinding is probably the most elegant way to do it. One possilby less involved alternative is to use a TCP socket from your Silverlight client. Whenever one of the Silverlight clients needs to have an update pushed you can send it a TCP message which contains the name of the WCF service it needs to call or some other light weight piece of information. I use this approach for an application and it works well.
