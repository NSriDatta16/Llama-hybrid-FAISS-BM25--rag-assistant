As elaborated here for implementation reasons (basically it makes performance faster and that is their priority) the JVM requires contiguous memory addressing, so it has to establish that it has that at startup, otherwise it might to be available later. The fact of the matter is that the JVM in many ways is a server-side oriented technology. That is where Java is popular so that is what gets the development attention.
