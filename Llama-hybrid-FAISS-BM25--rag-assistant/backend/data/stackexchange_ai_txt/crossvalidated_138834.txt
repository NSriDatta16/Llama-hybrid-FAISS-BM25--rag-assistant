The distribution of a second order Markov chain $(X_n)_{n\geqslant0}$ on some state space $S$ is characterized by: the initial distribution $\mu$ of $(X_0,X_1)$ on $S\times S$, such that, for every states $(x,y)$ in $S\times S$, one has $P(X_0=x,X_1=y)=\mu(x,y)$ the transition matrix $Q$ indexed by $(S\times S)\times S$, such that, for every time $n\geqslant0$ and for every states $(x,y,z)$ in $S\times S\times S$, one has $P(X_{n+2}=z\mid X_{n+1}=y,X_n=x)=Q(x,y;z)$ Then, for every time $n\geqslant1$ and every sequence $(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of states in $S$, one has$$P(X_0=x_0,X_1=x_1,\ldots,X_n=x_n)=\mu(x_0,x_1)Q(x_0,x_1;x_2)Q(x_1,x_2;x_3)\cdots Q(x_{n-2},x_{n-1};x_n).$$
