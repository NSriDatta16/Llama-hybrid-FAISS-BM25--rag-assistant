Your SVM implementation is very likely based on the LibSVM library . Please refer to LibSVM's documentation (eg. this FAQ item ) for an explanation how probabilities are calculated. In brief, probability calculation is based on a separate procedure, which has nothing in common with the decision function. It is even possible that the decision function and calculated probabilities predict different class as winner. The PMML specification does not support LibSVM's probability calculation procedure. Hence, you can't use the probability output feature with SVM models.
