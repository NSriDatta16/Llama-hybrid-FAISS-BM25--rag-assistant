Adding procedure labels to Objective-C and C code

In the second paragraph from the bottom of this post on reading crash logs the author mentions adding labels to the methods so that you can clearly see which task caused the crash. How do you do this? Mind you I'm talking about C and Objective-C within XCode for the iPhone. Thanks!
