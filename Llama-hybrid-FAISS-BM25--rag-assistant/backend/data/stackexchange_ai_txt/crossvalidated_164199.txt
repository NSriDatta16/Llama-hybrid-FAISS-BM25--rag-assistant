Part one of the question: If this is indeed a Brownian process, $B(t)$, then we can use the following: $$Pr(\sup |B(t)|> x = 1- \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \exp \left( \frac{-\pi^2(2k+1)^2}{8y^2} \right)$$ and we can calculate this with e.g. probSupBr The use of 1e4 in place of $\infty$ allows for a practical numeric approximation; larger values do not appear to improve this beyond $4$ significant digits. As to your example values: > sapply(c(0.1, 0.5, 1), probSupBr) [1] 1.0000000 0.9908430 0.6292226 I believe the equation was first is attributed to Billingsley (much of this is on Google books . As to part two, I would be interested to hear if you have managed to solve this with a more precise method than those given below. As I understand it, the approach used depends on your need for accuracy: We can use the values of the asymptomtic limits of the distribution, given by Csaki (Springer, paywall) for 'large' or 'small' values of $c$ ($=y$ below): $$ P[B(t)^2 > y] = \frac{4 \sqrt{2}}{\pi^2 \sqrt{y}} \exp \left( -\frac{\pi^2 y}{8} \right) \quad \mathrm{as} \quad y \rightarrow \infty $$ which is: probSqGr giving: sapply(c(0.1, 0.5, 1), probSqGr) [1] 1.0000000 0.4374169 0.1669114 Note that $y \leq 0.2 \rightarrow P=1$ and so for such small values the lower tail should probably be used instead (same source): $$ P[B(t)^2 For values closer to the center of the distribution, we can simulate values of the distribution as per @ThePawn's answer here . As this involves random sampling, this will produce slightly different results each time, even when a very large distribution is generated. Using the suggested cdfW function this poster suggests, with $1 \mathrm{e}^5$ Markov chains and $\mathrm{d}t = 1\mathrm{e}^{-4}$ we have: 1 - sapply(c(0.1, 0.5, 1), cdfW) [1] 0.83834 0.32298 0.13506 which is not far from the values above. There is an exact method for this, but I'm having trouble turning the equation into code; it can be found on the link above or here: Erdos On certain limit theorems of the theory of probability .
