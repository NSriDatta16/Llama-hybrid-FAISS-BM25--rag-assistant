You'd have to fire up something like Fiddler to see what is happening at the transport layer, but IMO it sounds like maybe you've been hitting them too much and the server has cut you off for a while (yes: many sites will do this if you hit them aggressively i.e. via a script). In particular, since you mention google: see the terms of service (emphasis is mine): 5.3 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Google, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Google. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services through any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers) and shall ensure that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on the Services. It is also fairly common for sites to block access to images based on the referer http header, to discourage cross-site embedding of their image in your site.
