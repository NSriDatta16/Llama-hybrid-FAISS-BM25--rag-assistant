De-normalising your database should be a last resort since (to choose just one reason) you don't want to encourage data inconsistencies which de-normalisation will allow. First thing is to see if you can get some clues from the query execution plan. It could be, for example, that your sub-selects are costing too much, and would be better done first into temp tables which you then JOIN in your main query. Also, if you see lots of table-scans, you could benefit from improved indexes. If you haven't already, you should spend a few minutes re-formatting your query for readability. It's amazing how often the obvious optimisation will jump out at you while doing this.
