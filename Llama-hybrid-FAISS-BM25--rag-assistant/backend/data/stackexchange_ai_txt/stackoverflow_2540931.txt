Moq a function with 5+ parameters and access invocation arguments

I have a function I want to Moq. The problem is that it takes 5 parameters. The framework only contains Action and Moq's generic CallBack() only overloads Action and the four generic versions. Is there an elegant workaround for this? This is what I want to do: public class Filter : IFilter { public int Filter(int i1, int i2, int i3, int i4, int i5){return 0;} } //Moq code: var mocker = new Mock (); mocker.Setup(x => x.Filter( It.IsAny (), It.IsAny (), It.IsAny (), It.IsAny (), It.IsAny (), It.IsAny ()) .Callback ( (int i1, int i2, int i3, int i4, int i5) => i1 * 2 ); Moq doesn't allow this because there is no generic Action that takes 5+ parameters. I've resorted to making my own stub. Obviously, it would be better to use Moq with all of its verifications, etc.
