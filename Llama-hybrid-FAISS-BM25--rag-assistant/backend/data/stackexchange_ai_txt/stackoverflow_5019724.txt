In Emacs, what does this error mean? "Warning: cl package required at runtime"

I am byte-compiling a module. It gives me this warning: Warning: cl package required at runtime Why is this a warning? I am well aware that I am using the cl package. In fact there is a (require 'cl) statement in the module. Is there something wrong with using the cl stuff? If so, is there a list of published workarounds? The main things I use are mapcan and delete-duplicates .
