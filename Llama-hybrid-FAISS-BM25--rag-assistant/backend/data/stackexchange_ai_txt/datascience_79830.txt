I tried loading my saved .h5 model and predicting with that model, i'm getting error list index out of range

I saved my keras model into .h5 format. Again I've loaded that .h5 file into my colab and tried to predict with that model. model.save("/content/drive/My Drive/Datasets/sentiment_analysis.h5") from keras.models import load_model loaded_model = load_model("/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/sentiment_analysis.h5") loaded_model.predict("i love machine learning and google") It's giving error list index out of range. IndexError: list index out of range
