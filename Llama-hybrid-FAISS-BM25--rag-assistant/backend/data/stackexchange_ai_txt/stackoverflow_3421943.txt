I have managed to solve it by overriding the following method at the main window: - (void)sendEvent:(UIEvent*)anEvent I also check if it is the right event with through if ([[[anEvent allTouches] anyObject] phase] == UITouchPhaseBegan) I do the same for UITouchPhaseMoved and UITouchPhaseEnded , execute my custom code and then send [super sendEvent:anEvent];
