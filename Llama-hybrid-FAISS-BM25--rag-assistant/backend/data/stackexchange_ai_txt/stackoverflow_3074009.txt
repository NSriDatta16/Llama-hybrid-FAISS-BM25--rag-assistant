I'd actually suggest either the liquibase plugin, or possibly just liquibase outside of grails. The plugin itself isn't truthfully documented all that well (but it works great), but the liquibase framework itself is, and is easy to use. Autobase is also based on liquibase under the covers, but as other have noted, it isn't supported anymore and I'm not sure that it was feature complete when Robert stopped working on it.
