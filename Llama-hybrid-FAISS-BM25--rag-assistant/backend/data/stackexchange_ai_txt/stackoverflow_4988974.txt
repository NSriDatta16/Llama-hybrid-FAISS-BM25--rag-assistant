Assuming that you are trying to extract some useful information from the comments, you could apply some machine learning to the comments to classify or categorize the data contained within, the sentiments etc. There are number of different types of learning you can do on the text, however I personally recommend using support vector machines or a naive bayes classifier to be able to categorize and analyze the comments. You could also possibly use clustering, but there needs to be an element of natural language processing in the solution you choose. There are number of different libraries that you can use to implement the code to use either, i.e. svmlight , javaml , etc. I have personally used javaml and it is a good library.
