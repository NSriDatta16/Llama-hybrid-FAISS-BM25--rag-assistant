What is and is not in $_SESSION is basically under your control. Apart from using some advanced stuff like hacking the server and editing your temporary PHP storage files, the browser has no control over this. Almost every authentication relies on the setting of some variable in the SESSION array to keep track of the current user. This can be regarded as safe. As long as you avoid specifically handing control over to the browser with statements such as: $_SESSION['id'] = $_POST['id'] or the like. Nevertheless, the others answers about never constructing database queries by string concatenation are valid. It is good practice to always run things through mysql_real_escape_string() , so being a good programmer, you use a wrapper function/class that automates that for you, so you never ever get it wrong.
