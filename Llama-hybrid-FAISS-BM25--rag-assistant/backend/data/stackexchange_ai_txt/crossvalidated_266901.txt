Why are logistic regressions good for calculating odds ratios associated with attributes?

In many epidemiology papers I'm reading, they estimate odds ratio and confidence intervals using a multivariate logistical regression. For example: We examined the association between young age at first sexual intercourse (age 14 years) and subsequent risk-taking behaviours by using multivariate logistic regression by which odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated (SAS statistical package version 9.1). However, isn't the fact that logistic regression is a linear classifier a problem for doing that? How does the logistic regression take into account variables that interact in a complicated way (i.e. together have a big impact but separately do not)?
