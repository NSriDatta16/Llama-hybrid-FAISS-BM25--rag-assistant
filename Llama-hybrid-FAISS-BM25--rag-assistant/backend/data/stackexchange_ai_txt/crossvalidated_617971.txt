Ok. So is saying that $K(x)$ is at least $b$ everywhere on a ball (of radius $r$ ) centered at zero. In one dimension that means it can't have a local minimum of $K(0)=0$ -- for example, it can't have peaks at $\pm 1$ and then go back down to zero in between. Or a kernel that's nominally centered at zero but has its peak at 1. In two or more dimensions, you're also ruling out weird things like a 'valley' leading into the kernel, and spiralling in towards zero. is ruling out 'spikes' in the kernel. The supremum looks for the highest value within $r$ of each $x$ . If you had one or more high, narrow spikes, you could have a situation where the integral of the supremum was infinite. The first problem would be bad because it's hard to prove things and because the 'centre' of the kernel-weighted average could be offset from the 'real' centre. The second problem would be bad because you aren't smoothing with a kernel like that. I imagine it could also be a problem for proofs using the Dominated Convergence Theorem
