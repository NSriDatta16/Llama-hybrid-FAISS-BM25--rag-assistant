Hotaka has the right approach I think. Bootstrapping is a great way of looking at the stability of model. This is a perhaps subtle distinction, but the 10/variable rule of thumb is meant to guide model building rather than variable estimation. If you have very few outcomes for a variable - the model will give you large SE/CI for the coefficient estimate for that variable. You can fit the model and the estimates are accurate, the estimates may just not be useful given the lack of data. This is different from when you try to fit too many variable to a model, where the estimates may be bias, rather than accurate but not useful. * - if this is of importance you could run a simulation to see if your model is reasonable. I wouldn't trust either my coding or statistical know how. But assuming only one binary predictor looking at parameter estimate. here the true value is 1.5--> overfit2 0),] I'm just looking at parameter estimates. But you could include coverage as well. p1
