Linear regression when observations may not be independent

I conducted an experiments where each participants played 5 rounds. For each round and for each participant I collected information regarding the dependent variable $y$ and the independent variables $X$ . Using linear regression to understand how $X$ drives $y$ I was wondering if any of the two below approaches are considered to be better from a methodological or statistical stand points: Mean approach: for each participant calculate the mean of $y$ and $X$ and run a regression on the reduced dataset (reduced by factor 5, i.e. the rounds). Rounds approach: use the raw data and include as control variable the round number. Given that approach 2 has more observations and I don't average out anything I prefer to do approach 2. However, the observations are not independent using this approach so I was wondering if I can do this? I would be grateful for some insight on a. if the approaches both are correct / can be applied or if there are any flaws. b. what other "typical" methods there are to analyse this kind of data (anova, panel regression?)
