Trying to reap the benefits of the Rich WEB.UI.Gridview control in a C# application

I know that I can't use this web control in my C# windows application and that I am restricted to DataGridView control. But this does not display results in an elegant manner as the Web.UI.Webcontrol.GridView control but instead displays it like the results when a SQL query is executed in sql server. I prefer not going down the path of hosting a webuser control which in turn would launch my website using the Web.UI.WebConntrol.GridView control.
