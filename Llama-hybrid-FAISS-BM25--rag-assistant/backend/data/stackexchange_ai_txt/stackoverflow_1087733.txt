Magento My Account Layout XML Problem

I'm having issues getting the customer.xml layout file to work properly for the customer's "my account" pages. The navigation links and the previously ordered items that are usually on the left hand side of the page won't show up on the page, but if I change the reference name to "content" in the xml file, it shows up (except it's obviously then on the right hand side). I've checked the template it's referencing (2columns-left.phtml), and the getChildHtml('left') is there in the correct position. The block that's causing the problem: page/2columns-left.phtml catalog.navigation.all callout.sendcard callout.specialorder account customer/account/ Account Dashboard account_edit customer/account/edit/ Account Information address_book customer/address/ Address Book This was basically copied straight over from another one of our sites where this works 100%. I've tried everything I can think of (changing the name of the reference in both the template and the layout xml, for example) to no avail. The templates that the layout is referencing are obviously working because they do show up when put into the "content" area. This installation of magento is version 1.3.1.1. I appreciate any advice you have to give me... Update: I tried changing the reference to "global_messages", and it doesn't show there either. It only seems to work in the "content" section. Update 2: These are the results of using the "showLayout=page" query string on the page when used with Alan Storm's very handy debugging module (which you'll find in his answer below). prototype/prototype.js prototype/validation.js paypoint/validation.js scriptaculous/builder.js scriptaculous/effects.js scriptaculous/dragdrop.js scriptaculous/controls.js scriptaculous/slider.js varien/js.js varien/form.js varien/menu.js mage/translate.js mage/cookies.js css/reset.css css/boxes.css css/clears.css css/menu.css css/calendar-blue.css css/styles.css skin_css css/iestyles.css IE skin_css css/ie7.css IE 7 skin_css css/ie7minus.css lt IE 7 js lib/ds-sleight.js lt IE 7 js varien/iehover-fix.js lt IE 7 css/print.css media="print" My Account My Account 10 page/2columns-left.phtml Site Map Site Map Search Terms Search Terms Advanced Search Advanced Search footer_links tag/popular.phtml Contact Us contact-us Contact Us true RSS rss RSS testing true class="link-feed" bundle bundle/catalog_product_price bundle/catalog/product/price.phtml bundle bundle/checkout_cart_item_renderer checkout/cart/sidebar/default.phtml page/2columns-left.phtml catalog.navigation.all callout.sendcard callout.specialorder account customer/account/ Account Dashboard account_edit customer/account/edit/ Account Information address_book customer/address/ Address Book orders sales/order/history/ My Orders tags tag/customer/ My Tags newsletter newsletter/manage/ Newsletter Subscriptions bundle bundle/checkout_cart_item_renderer checkout/cart/sidebar/default.phtml catalog_compare_sidebar top right.poll customer_account_dashboard_info2 right.newsletter Log Out Log Out 100
