I think I found the problem. Thanks to IE 9 Beta's developer tool, which actually allow me to debug it and I saw script exception when the page loads and the problem is because of the newly added user control render html in correctly and block the functions call in the old user control. After I comment out the other user controls in the pages, the problem is gone. Now I need to figure out which control actually cause the problem. Update: I think I found the right answer for this problem: I have initialization code written as below: $(document).ready() { UserControlNameInit(); } Which blocks the call in the other user control which is written as this: $(document).ready(function(){ UserControlNameInit(); }); Although I don't know the difference between these too. But the later code seems to cause no problem to other user controls. Thank you for all the attention and help.
