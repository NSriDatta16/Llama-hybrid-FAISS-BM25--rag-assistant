I've used the Cavaj decompiler and it worked pretty well for me. You can just open up the jar file with any unzipping program like 7zip, .jar files are really just zip files. Then all you need to do is feed the .class files to Cavaj. The .class files are organized by package, so com.foo.Bar will be com/foo/Bar.class inside the .jar Like Danny said, legality might be questionable depending on the situation. I've only ever used it to look at the source for an older version of an application I wrote but no longer had the source for.
