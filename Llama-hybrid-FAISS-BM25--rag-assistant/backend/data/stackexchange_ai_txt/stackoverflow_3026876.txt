If you set an IP address with ifconfig , that's likely not going to be enough. Usually, you must also configure the routing table, which usually consists of adding two routes: One saying that "this network is attached at eth0 " and one saying "this is the default gateway". (The latter is not strictly required.) "Network is unreachable" - I'm assuming you tried to ping the PC from the OMap? If your PC was 192.something.something.something , and your "OMap" has the routing table your comment: Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS Window irtt Iface 10.0.0.0 * 255.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 ...then it won't be able to send. That routing table will only work if you try to send things to 10.something : that's the only route it knows. If you're not running a 10.0.0.0/8 network, then that route is wrong. Look up some material on routing tables, IP addresses, etc. if you want to do this. Although, if you want to just have the average person "plug it in" - they're going to be running DHCP - what's so wrong with that? You can't just pick an IP address on a network without some form of mediation: Either a human mediates, and sets it manually, or you use something like a DHCP server. Otherwise, you could be picking somebody else's address. Also, you need to know whether you're on a 10.0.0.0/8 network, a 192.168.0-255.0/8 network, some other LAN, or the Internet... something DHCP does for you...
