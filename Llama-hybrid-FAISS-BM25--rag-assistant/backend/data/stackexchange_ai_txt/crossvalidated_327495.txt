Interpretation of Importance score in Random Forest

Can I interpret the importance scores obtained from Random forest model similar to the Betas from Linear Regression? For example, if I have an equation $$ y=\alpha +\beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2,$$ a 1 unit change in $X_1$ is associated with a $\beta_1$ unit change in $y$. Does a similar analogy hold for Importance score?
