To your point about where the collection of points making up the lines is stored, it is not stored in this example. EDITED Yeah, to store them, I'd just add to a NSMutableArray. something like - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (!_points) _points = [[NSMutableArray array] retain]; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; [_points addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:[touch locationInView:self]]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; [_points addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:[touch locationInView:self]]; [self setNeedsDisplay]; } The setNeedsDisplay is going to invoke the drawRect that's where you use the points and your draw methods.
