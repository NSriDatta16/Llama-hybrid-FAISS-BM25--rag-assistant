If you're talking about passing an instance of one object to the method of a another one, then yes of course it's allowed! And it's considered fine practice. If you want to know more about good object oriented coding, may I offer some suggested readings: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John M. Vlissides Known as the Gang Of Four book, this lays out a number of design patterns that seem to show up in object oriented code time and time again. This is a good place to go for ideas on how to handle certain problems in a good object oriented way. Another good one: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, John Brant , William Opdyke, Don Roberts This is a great book for learning what NOT to do when writing object oriented code, and how to fix it to make it better when you do encounter it. It offers a list of code smells that suggest bad object oriented code and a reference section of refactorings that provide instructions on how to fix those smells and make them more object oriented.
