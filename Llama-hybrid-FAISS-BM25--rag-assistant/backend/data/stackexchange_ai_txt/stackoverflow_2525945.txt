In SQL Server 2008 is there a way to generate a report as to how much space on disk each table takes?

IN SQL Server 2008 is there a way to generate a report as to how much space on disk each table takes? I can do it one by one by checking the storage properties, but I was wondering if there was a way, maybe even a query to generate such a report.
