Storage of an integer in an NSNumber will likely have lower overhead — however minimal it might seem — compared with an NSString . A character string can be multiple bytes per glyph depending on the character encoding, and then you need a null character at the end of the string to terminate it. A parser has to work through all of that to turn a string back into an integer at the end of the day, such as when you will inevitably need to do arithmetic on these values. Further, using NSNumber will make it clearer to you what primitive data type you are working with from the SOAP request or response, not only when you write your app, but when you come back to it several months down the line and you need to make changes.
