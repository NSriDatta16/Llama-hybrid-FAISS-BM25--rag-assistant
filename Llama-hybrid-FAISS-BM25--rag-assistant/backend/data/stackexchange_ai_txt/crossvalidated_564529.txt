Running regression on the entire dataset vs running on smaller dataset then take average of coefficient?

Suppose we have a big data set where even if I break it into 10 smaller pieces the number of data points in each piece still far outnumbers the number of variables. Now if I run regression using two methods: run OLS on the entire dataset break data set into 10 random subsets, run a separate OLS on each. Then take the average of the coefficients. I would like to know Would the coefficients from the two approach would be the same? Would the standard errors of the coefficients be the same? Overall is there any advantage of one over the other? (outside of computation considerations) Thank you all in advance!
