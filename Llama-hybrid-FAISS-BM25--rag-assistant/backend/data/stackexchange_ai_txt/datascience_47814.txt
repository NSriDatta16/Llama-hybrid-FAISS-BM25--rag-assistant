When to question output of model

I'm unsure of how to ask a question without making it seem like a code review question. At what point does one question whether they've actually implemented the algorithm and-or model correctly? Getting spot-on results is great and all, but seems highly suspect. Also, what checks can be done to ensure that the algorithm and-or model is being implemented correctly? The reason I'm asking is because I'm getting perfect classification and subsequently accuracy, precision, etc. w/ the implementation of SVM. I am including the code, but feel free to ignore. # Make a copy of the df iris_df_copy = iris_df.copy() # Create a new column, labeled 'T/F', whose value will be based on the value in the 'Class' column. If the value in the # 'Class' column is 'Iris-setosa', then set the value of the 'T/F' column to 1. If the value in the 'Class' column is # not 'Iris-setosa', then set the value of the 'T/F' column to 0. iris_df_copy.loc[iris_df_copy.Class == 'Iris-setosa', 'T/F'] = 1 iris_df_copy.loc[iris_df_copy.Class != 'Iris-setosa', 'T/F'] = 0 X_svm = np.array(iris_df_copy[['Sepal_Length', 'Sepal_Width', 'Petal_Length', 'Petal_Width']]) y_svm = np.ravel(iris_df_copy[['T/F']]) # Split the samples into two subsets, use one for training and the other for testing X_train_svm, X_test_svm, y_train_svm, y_test_svm = train_test_split(X_svm, y_svm, test_size=0.25, random_state=4) # Instantiate the learning model - Linear SVM linear_svm = svm.SVC(kernel='linear') # Fit the model - Linear SVM linear_svm.fit(X_train_svm, y_train_svm) # Predict the response - Linear SVM linear_svm_pred = linear_svm.predict(X_test_svm) # Confusion matrix and quantitative metrics - Linear SVM print("The confusion matrix is: " + np.str(confusion_matrix(y_test_svm, linear_svm_pred))) print("The accuracy score is: " + np.str(accuracy_score(y_test_svm, linear_svm_pred))) print("The precision is: " + np.str(precision_score(y_test_svm, linear_svm_pred, average="macro"))) print("The recall is: " + np.str(recall_score(y_test_svm, linear_svm_pred, average="macro")))
