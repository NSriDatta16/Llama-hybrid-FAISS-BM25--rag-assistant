How can I make a GUI frontend to a command line tool in OSX?

I'm dying to know how I can make a GUI for ffmpeg and jhead in OSX. I've been looking for a solution for a while and thought you, stackoverflow's users, could help me. Maybe you know some document I haven't come across of or, better, a tutorial to make a GUI. I love those two tools but I like the simplicity of drag/drop operations. Note: I don't need a GUI for them, I want to make one.
