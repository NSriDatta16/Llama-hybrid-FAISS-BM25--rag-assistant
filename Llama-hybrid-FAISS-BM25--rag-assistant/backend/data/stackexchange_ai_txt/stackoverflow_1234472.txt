How can I organize my dll's into multiple folders under the bin directory in ASP.NET?

How can I take several dll's in my bin folder for my ASP.NET application organize them into seperate folders and leave them under the bin directory so that they still are readily accesible to the application as if they were in the root of the bin? I want to reduce the monstrous list of dlls and group them into folders related to their core purpose.
