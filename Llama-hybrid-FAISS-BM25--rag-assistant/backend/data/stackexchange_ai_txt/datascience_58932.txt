Can we use Binary Cross Entropy for Multiclass Classification?

In this link , the author has implemented a CNN which classifies 15 classes and has used Binary Cross Entropy as the loss function. But since it's multiclass classification, is it valid to use Binary Cross Entropy? Or should we use Categorical Cross Entropy instead?
