Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but since you're using SQL Server: I've found LINQ to be a great tool test stored procs. You can just drag the stored procedures onto a DBML diagram and then call them as methods on your datacontext. Beats setting up ADO connections etc for a test harness. If you set up a test project in Visual Studio for example, you can simply test your procedures like methods on another object. If your stored procs return result sets, I think LINQ will translate that into anonymous variables that you should be able to access via IEnumerable or IQueryable (somebody pls verify this). But if you're returning return codes only, this should be a quick and fairly easy way.
