After more investigation, I understood that WatiN need a real user logged directly on the server. So I configure the AutoLogin in windows 2003 server following this instruction: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324737/en-us . So the server automatically logs as TeamCity user when it starts. After, I disable the TeamCity Service and put in the Startup folder of the TeamCity user this batch file: cd c:\BuildAgent\bin agent.bat start So it starts the agent when it logs, so at start up.
