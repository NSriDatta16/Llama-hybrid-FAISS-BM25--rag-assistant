How to organise a C project in Eclipse /w multiple binaries?

I'm in the process of converting a project to Eclipse CDT, it consists of 2 (static) libraries and produces about 12 binaries, a few of the binaries have 2-3 different build configurations, and is built by scons How should I structure this in an Eclipse workspace ? 1 project for everything ? 1 project for each of the binaries/libs ? Something else ?
