What should I enter as n when doing a meta analysis involving correlation coefficients- the number of observations or the sample size?

The r package and function (metafor; escalc) I am using to calculate effect sizes asks for n's (the sample sizes). Should I put the sample sizes of the study or the number of observations that went into calculating the correlation? A little more detail: in some of the studies each participants' score was correlated with the a variable of interest and therefore the number of observations equals the sample size. Yet, in other studies, several participant's scores were averaged to get a summary score for text A, text B, etc., and then those texts score summaries of performance were used to determine the correlation coefficient. In this latter case, the sample size could have been 100 but then only 20 texts were used to get the correlation coefficient. I'm assuming I still use sample sizes but wanted to check because I am new to meta analysis.
