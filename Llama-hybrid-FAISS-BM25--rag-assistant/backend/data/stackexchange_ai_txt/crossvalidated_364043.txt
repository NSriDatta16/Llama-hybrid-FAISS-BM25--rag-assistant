To be fair, there isn't a good method of testing if a coin is "fair" in Bayesian methodology. You should either use Fisher's method of maximum likelihood or Pearson and Neyman's Frequentist method, depending on your goal. The method cited by MotiN is a rigorous version of ROPE, or region of practical equivalence. This creates a region around $\pi=\frac{1}{2}$ where no one could distinguish between $H_0:\pi=\frac{1}{2}$ and $H_A:\pi\ne\frac{1}{2}$. This is not the same as testing to determine if $\pi=\frac{1}{2}$. It is used for that purpose in Bayesian methods, but Bayesian methods are very ill-suited for testing sharp null hypotheses. The issue comes from the fact that the number of points in the interval [0,1] is uncountable, while $\pi=\frac{1}{2}$ is a countable point. As such, the null hypothesis has zero measure and so has zero probability. $\Pr\left(\pi=\frac{1}{2}\right)=0$. Likewise, you could use Bayes factors against any single point to get a relative probability, but not a point versus a region, which is what is required here. If you really need to know if a coin is fair, which you cannot really know, then you should use one of the two classical methods. Use Fisher's method of maximum likelihood if you want the p-value to provide information regarding the weight of the evidence against, or use the Frequentist method if you want to know how you should behave. If the null is not rejected, you behave as if it is true. If the null is rejected, then you behave as if it is false. There is no good Bayesian answer, but if you must use a Bayesian method, then ROPE is as close as you can get.
