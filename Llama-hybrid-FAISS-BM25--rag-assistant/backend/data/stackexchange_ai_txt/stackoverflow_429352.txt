What are the minimum security precautions to put in place for a startup?

I'm working with a start-up, mostly doing system administration and I've come across a some security issues that I'm not really comfortable with. I want to judge whether my expectations are accurate, so I'm looking for some insight into what others have done in this situation, and what risks/problems came up. In particular, how critical are measures like placing admin tools behind a vpn, regular security updates (OS and tools), etc. Keep in mind that as this is a start-up, the main goal is to get as many features as possible out the door quickly, so I'll need as much justification as I can get to get the resources for security (i.e. downtime for upgrades, dev time for application security fixes). Background Info: Application is LAMP as well as a custom java client-server. Over the next 3 months, I project about 10k anonymous visitors to the site and up to 1000 authenticated users. Younger audience (16-25) which is guaranteed to have an above average number of black-hats included. Thanks in advance for your responses, and I'll welcome any related advice.
