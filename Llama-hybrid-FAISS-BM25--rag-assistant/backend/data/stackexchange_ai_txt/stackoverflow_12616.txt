I think I understand your second paragraph to mean you are considering a second events table that has a row for each occurrence of an event. I would avoid that. Re-occurring events should have a start date and a stop date (which could be Null for events that continue every X days "forever") You'll have to decide what kinds of frequency you want to allow -- every X days, the Nth day of each month, every given weekday, etc. I'd probably tend toward two tables - one for one time events and a second for recurring events. You'll have to query and display the two separately. If I were going to tackle this (and I'd try as hard as I can to avoid reinventing this wheel) I'd look for open-source libraries or, at the very least, open source projects with Calendars that you can look at. Any recommendations guys?
