does cross-validation aid me in the endeavor? No. I have also read that the parameter is fixed and the confidence interval random, what does this mean? In the frequentist paradigm, the parameter (or estimand) is considered fixed. This means that it does not vary. Were we to get lots and lots of datasets, each with millions of observations, then the estimated value from each dataset would be approximately the same. So the estimand does not change from sample to sample, but the confidence interval does. Indeed, the confidence interval is a function of the data, which are random, so the confidence interval is random. but I struggle to accept the subjectivity of bayesian credible intervals This is a non sequitur for me. What I assume you're referring to is the priors. That Bayes is somehow "subjective" is an old view in my opinion. If I show you my priors, and I describe how I came about them, and they reflect the current state of knowledge about a problem, and you agree that while maybe they not be perfect they are reasonable approximations to what is known about the estimand, then in what sense are they subjective? If I pulled the priors out of my -- ahem, "posterior" -- then that's poor practice but for reasons which are can not be boiled down to "subjectivity" alone. I like this paper on the topic.
