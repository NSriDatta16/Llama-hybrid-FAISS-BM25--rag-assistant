This doesn't directly answer your question, but I have already tried the approach that you propose but would now create a single jar per application (see how to do it with Ant ). That way, no need to include anything in the classpath: java -jar myApp.jar is all you need. I find it cleaner but everything is debatable. It doesn't make any difference from a performance point-of-view since each application is run inside its own JVM. The only downside is that some libraries will be present in each jar file. It only costs more to store on the HD, but these days, MB are pretty cheap :-) I trade simplicity (no external lib folder) and no jar hell (not placing your jars inside the Java ext folder) over storage price any time. If your application doesn't include terrabyte of libraries, I think it's fine. For the Log4j configuration file, I would place one default file inside the jar but provide a sample config file ( log4j-custom.xml.sample) that someone can modify and specify in the command line: java -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j-custom.xml -jar myApp.jar
