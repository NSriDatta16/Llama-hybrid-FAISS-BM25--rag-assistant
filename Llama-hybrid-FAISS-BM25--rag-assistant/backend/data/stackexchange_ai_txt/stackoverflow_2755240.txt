Any ideas on how to implement a 'touchMoveOver' event in Javascript?

I'm faffing around with SVG, specifically for web content aimed at iPad users. I've created a little dial type thingy that I'm calling a "cheese board" that I'd like to use as an interface element. http://appliedworks.co.uk/files/times/SVGTests/raphael.html Clicking on a piece of cheese (to keep the analogy going) will do "something". That bit's easy. However, I'd like the user to be able to drag their finger around the 'cheese board', firing a new event (touchesMovedOver?) every time they their finger moves over a new piece of cheese. But I can't figure out how to do it since there's no 'mouseOver' equivalent for touch interfaces. If the whole thing was made of squares, I could have created some sort of 'rectContainsPoint' method to be called for every 'touchesMoved', but that approach wouldn't work here. If anyone has any idea about how something like this could be achieved, I'd love to hear it.
