Need help with CVD risk calculation: how to calculate baseline survival?

I work in the medical field. I want to calculate a 10 yr risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on a published forumla. That is to say to be able to calculate the same as this page . But I can't figure out how to implement the published algorithm. Here is the source article . And here is a supplemental tab that contains more information . And here is a Word document that gives examples of how to actually calculate it , using examples. Especially look in this document starting at page 33, Table 4. I am unable to post the table here that seems to contain the algorithm here, it doesn't format correctly, but it can be seen here (a cross-post) . I encourage readers to view the table at that link. In Table 4, there is a row stating " Baseline Survival ", and this is use with the other input variables (hypertension values, diabetes etc). I can't see how this is calculated. And the article doesn't expand upon it. So I am assuming it is a standard concept that those who work in the field of medical statistics would immediately understand it without explanation. I guess it has to do with how any population survives over time, with a certain percentage dying off from various causes. And it seems to be different between males and females. So my specific question is how to calculate baseline survival. When I Google this, I am given links to Baseline Hazard functions. But they all seem generic. In the examples from Table 4, the baseline survival of a 55 yr female is "0.9665" and for a 55 yr male is "0.9144". How do I come by these values?
