This is my preference: When writing inline, get rid of code that is irrelevant to the explanation (such as import statements as previously mentioned, but potentially also variable declarations that are "obvious" and the like). The goal of code placed inline should be for easy crossreference with the paragraph describing that code block. Code placed in appendices should be complete (as in - you can put this into your compiler and press go). Don't be scared of placing heavily cut down code in snippets, along with a reference to the appendix containing the full code - the appendix code is for someone to read/run separately. the inline code is for people to glance at and help understand the specific point of that section.
