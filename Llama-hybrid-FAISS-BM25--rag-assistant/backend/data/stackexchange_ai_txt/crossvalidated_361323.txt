Based not on mathematical and statistical considerations, but on professional experience, I disagree with ERT. I work in retail demand forecasting and the procedure you just described is close to the approach that most retailers use for managing their forecasts, it is called exception based forecast management. A retailer typically needs to manage millions of time series forecasts (tens of thousands of products Ã— hundreds of stores) which are generated automatically. It is unrealistic to expect human analysts to be able to validate each and everyone of those. So instead some monitoring process is setup which alerts the forecasters whenever the sales forecast passes one of several thresholds. The analyst will then step in and rescale the forecast according to their business knowledge. The scenario you mentioned occurs, where the automatically generated forecast is possibly too large and needs to be reduced. The reverse scenario is also possible, where the automated forecast produces a reasonable forecast, but the analyst knows that there will be some event or promotion occurring and decide to adjust the forecast upwards. A typical real world example is the following: Based on historical sales data, my model will predict that this summer I'm going to have very high sales of Adidas shoes (they all sold out last year and the year before) - but a retail fashion forecaster with domain knowledge knows that this year the hip shoes are now Vans, not Adidas. We have yet to have reliable ML or statistical models that predict such a shift (and not for lack of trying). So they will go into the system and scale Adidas down and Vans up.
