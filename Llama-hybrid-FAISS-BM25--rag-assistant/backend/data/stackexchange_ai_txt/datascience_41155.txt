In a classification/regression task you can use back propagation and SVM: Backpropagation: use a neural network as feature extractor SVM: use it to perform classification/regression with the features extracted with the neural network In deed, in neural networks back-propagation and other well-known machine learning techniques are used together. For example, when a sigmoid layer is used as the classification layer for a binary classification neural net, a logistic regression is performed and optimized through back-propagation
