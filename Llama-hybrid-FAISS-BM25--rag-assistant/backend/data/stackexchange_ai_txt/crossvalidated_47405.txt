Poisson / exponential distribution

Next weekend you will be participating in 12km cross country race on a mountain.The average time between two successive wild animal sightings on the mountain is reported to be 5 minutes (a) What is the probability that you see at least one wild animal in the 11th minute of the race given that you will see 3 wild animals since the start of the race? (b) What is the probability that it will take more than a quarter of a hour before you see a wild animal after ten minutes of running? Now I have attempted (a) , but I don't know whether my thinking is correct. (b) on the other hand makes little sense to me. My attempt: (a)$ X~ Poisson(\frac{1}{5})$ and $Y~Exponential(\frac{1}{5})$ $Pr(X>4) = Pr(X>1)$ (I am thinking that this is some variation of the memoryless property) $Pr(X>1) =Pr(Y $Pr(Y Perhaps, I was a bit to vague in my attempt of (a). So here goes my attempt of(b).From my understanding of the question , it is asking what it the probability that the time between events(in this case animal sightings) is more than 25 minutes given you have been running for ten minutes Now from what I know the fact that you have been running ten minutes is irrelevant this is due to memory-less property of the exponential distribution so without further ado I present my attempt at (b) let $X $ be exponentially distributed random variable with $\lambda = 1/5$ then $Pr(X >15) = 1 - Pr(X
