The .NET framework uses many of the Gang of Four patterns. Here are just a few examples: Creational patterns Abstract Factory : System.Data.Common.DbProviderFactory . Every member function of this class is a factory method. Builder : The WCF channel construction infrastructure. Factory Method : System.Data.IDbConnection.BeginTransaction() . The type of transaction created depends on the underlying IDbConnection implementation. WebRequest.Create() returns a concrete type that depends on the URL scheme. Prototype - used in framework for cloning and serialization Singleton - used as an activation method in WCF, i.e. a web service may be treated as a singleton by the WCF infrastructure. Ditto for .NET Remoting. Structural patterns Adapter : The ADO.NET providers, eg System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection , System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection etc. Each provider is an adapter for its specific database. Composite : many examples System.Windows.Forms.Control and its derived classes. System.Web.UI.Control and its derived classes. System.Xml.XmlNode and its derived classes. Decorator : System.Windows.Controls.Decorator (in WPF). Some implementations of Stream are decorators around an inner stream (e.g. GZipStream , CryptoStream ). Facade : System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer . XmlSerializer hides a complex task (that includes generating assemblies on the fly!) behind a very easy-to-use class. Proxy : The web service proxies generated by svcutil.exe and deriving from System.ServiceModel.ClientBase Behavioral Patterns Chain of responsibility : System.Web.UI.Control.OnBubbleEvent() and System.Web.UI.Control.RaiseBubbleEvent() . Command : System.Windows.Input.ICommand (in WPF). Interpreter : System.Linq.Expressions.Expression and related classes. Iterator : many examples System.Collections.IEnumerable . System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable . System.Data.IDataReader . Memento : The .NET Serializable pattern is a variation on the Memento pattern. Observer - The .NET event mechanism. Strategy - Sort method in ArrayList Template Method - Render method for custom controls Visitor : System.Linq.Expressions.ExpressionVisitor ( used internally by [LINQ] )
