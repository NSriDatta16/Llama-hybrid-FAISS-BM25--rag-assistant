Interpreting a regression following PCA

I am looking for some help and I am struggling to find any answers. For my course i have completed Principal Component Analysis on my data (a health survey with 8 different variables - smoking, drinking, obesity, fruit and veg intake, activity levels, mental health, self-assessed health and cardiovascular condition). I decided to retain four components as this allowed me to retain 91% of the variance. I am now planning to run some regressions with a variable long-term illness as my outcome variable and the components as my explanatories. I am just really confused on how I actually interpret my data when it comes to using components and was hoping that somebody could point me in the right direction. In an ordinary regression i could use a variable like smoking and drinking to see the effect it has on long term illness and could interpret that easily but this is beyond me. Thanks in advance Mark
