Have you looked into jQuery UI's droppable widget ? I'm wondering (since I haven't played around with your specific problem yet) if you could set your tbody as droppable and your tr as draggable. Or possibly add some classes to each to be able to specify that certain rows (non-title rows) are draggable... UPDATE : more research turned up this SO question , which links to this other article about dragging table rows.
