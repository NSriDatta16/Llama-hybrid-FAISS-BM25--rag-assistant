Why do people strictly rely upon a criteria (ie AIC) to determine the "best" model? Why not use the principle of N.I.I.D and parsimony as the guide instead of a fit statistic? Sure we can compare variance to after that to see who had a better model, but this whole rule based way of modeling is contra to what I believe in. As you may know, N.I.I.D. is what we are first taught in time series analysis that the errors should be gaussian. By using AIC or BIC criterion to build a model you are losing the goal of building a model and more of fitting. I have found that instead of using AIC that focusing on the N.I.I.D. of the errors, significance of parameters and parsimony you will have a better model using an Identification scheme focused on robustified ACF and PACF.
