I am afraid there's a typo in your title: you should not attempt to fit mixed models, let alone nonlinear mixed models, with just 30 clusters. Not unless you believe you can fit a normal distribution to 30 points obstructed by measurement error, nonlinearities, and nearly complete separation (aka perfect prediction). What I would do here is to run this as a regular logistic regression with Firth's correction : library(logistf) mf Firth's correction consists of adding a penalty to the likelihood, and is a form of shrinkage. In Bayesian terms, the resulting estimates are the posterior modes of the model with a Jeffreys prior. In frequentist terms, the penalty is the determinant of the information matrix corresponding to a single observation, and hence disappears asymptotically.
