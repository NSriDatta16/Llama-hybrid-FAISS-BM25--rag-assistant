If you are using the LINQ-to-SQL, then: var(dc = new MyDataContext()) { dc.CreateDatabase(); } should do it, but only if you have all the required data. To be honest, it works better starting from tables (perhaps in SSMS) and dragging them into LINQ-to-SQL. Also; there are a lot of important database concepts (indexing, etc) that is not expressed in DBML.
