When you remove an event, you need to pass the identical function that you used to add it. When you add an event handler you used: function() { stopstretching(watcherObj); } for mouseup and function() { stopstretching(watcherObj); } for mouseout (these two are different) So when you remove, you can't just use stopstretching because it's not the one you added. Maybe you can have something like function stopHandler() { stopstretching(watcherObj, stopHandler); } addEvent(dragWorkspaceObj, 'mouseup', stopHandler); addEvent(dragWorkspaceObj, 'mouseout', stopHandler); And function stopstretching(watch, handler) { watcherObj = null; removeEvent(document.getElementById("dragWorkspace"), 'mouseup', handler); removeEvent(document.getElementById("dragWorkspace"), 'mouseout', handler); The code is untested, but I think that it should work.
