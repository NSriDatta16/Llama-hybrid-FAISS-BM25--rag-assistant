Clearly, you are doing something in your code that causes the assembly to be loaded in your own process. Once there, it is stuck and the file is locked until the AppDomain in which it gets loaded gets unloaded. Which is no doubt the primary one, it's stuck until your program terminates. Pay attention to the Visual Studio Output window, you'll get a debugger notification as soon as it gets loaded. Stepping through your code while watching that window will easily isolate the statement that causes it.
