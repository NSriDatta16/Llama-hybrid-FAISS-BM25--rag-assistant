Passing int array as parameter in web user control

I have an int array as a property of a Web User Control. I'd like to set that property inline if possible using the following syntax: This will fail at runtime because it will be expecting an actual int array, but a string is being passed instead. I can make myintarray a string and parse it in the setter, but I was wondering if there was a more elegant solution.
