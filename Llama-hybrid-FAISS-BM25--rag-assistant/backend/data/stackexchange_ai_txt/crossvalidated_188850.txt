Good question, I actually have built both in my day job as a Data Scientist. Time series models are easy to build (forecast package in R lets you build one in less in 5 seconds), the same or more accurate than regression models, etc. Generally, one should always build time series, then regression. There are Philosophical implications of time series as well, if you can predict without knowing anything, then what does that mean? My take on Darlington. 1) "Regression is far more flexible and powerful, producing better models. This point is developed in numerous spots throughout the work." No, quite the opposite. Regression models make far more assumptions than time series models. The fewer the assumptions, the more likely the ability to withstand the earthquake (regime change). Furthermore, time series models respond faster to sudden shifts. 2) "Regression is far easier to master than ARIMA, at least for those already familiar with the use of regression in other areas." This is circular reasoning. 3) "Regression uses a "closed" computational algorithm that is essentially guaranteed to yield results if at all possible, while ARIMA and many other methods use iterative algorithms that often fail to reach a solution. I have often seen the ARIMA method "hang up" on data that gave the regression method no problem." Regression gives you an answer, but is it the right answer? If I build linear regression and machine learning models and they all come to the same conclusion, what does it mean? So in summary, yes regression and time series can both answer the same question and technically, time series is technically regression (albeit auto-regression). Time series models are less complex and therefore more robust than regression models. If you think about specialization, then TS models specialize in forecasting whereas regression specialize in understanding. It boils down to whether you want to explain or predict.
