A scatterplot matrix with loess curves and correlation values (absolute values) can be a good starting point: We can notice here the possibly quadratic relationship of fuelEconomy plotted against both lineDisplacement and hp , which is also reflected in a Nike swoosh appearance in of the residual plot . It would be interesting to investigate the presence of an interaction between these term. This lack of linearity is also apparent if we run a linear regression of fuelEconomy against linearDisplacement (similar results can be obtained with hp ). Notice the red line... This effect can be partially rectified making the model more complex, and introducing a quadratic model: The new model has an adjusted R-squared value higher ($0.8205$) than the first ($0.7798$). The dichotomous nature of fuelStd and wheeldriveStd simply move the mean of the predicted values down, and in effect are dummy-coded variables or factor. This is also apparent on the initial scatter plot, but can be further visualized with box plots: One final point in the diagnostics is the presence of high leverage points , worth looking into: What to conclude? Nothing categorical. Perhaps just to emphasize the importance of plotting in understanding the data set and any model imposed on it.
