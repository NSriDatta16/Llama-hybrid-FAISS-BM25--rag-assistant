How can I get a list of all mp3 files on the sd card regardless of directory in android?

Using code from open source MusicDroid with the following code that I found during a search for this problem, I can only get mp3 files that are in the root directory /sdcard/ File home = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); if (home.listFiles( new Mp3Filter()).length > 0) { for (File file : home.listFiles( new Mp3Filter())) { songs.add(file.getAbsolutePath()); } ArrayAdapter songList = new ArrayAdapter (this,R.layout.song_item,songs); setListAdapter(songList); } How can I get all the mp3 files from the card (in any directory) into my 'songs' list?
