How can I call Nant scripts from Maven?

I'm working on a mainly Java based project, that also has a couple of components written in C++. The project is currently built using Ant scripts which invoke Nant to build the C++ components. We are in the process of moving to Maven and I was wondering if anyone could recommend the best way to build Nant scripts using Maven. I'm aware that I could just call out to the command line but I was hoping that there might be a more elegant way of doing this.
