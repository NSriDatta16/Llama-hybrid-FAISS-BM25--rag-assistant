(2) Stress-strength models. The use of stress-strength models is popular in reliability. The basic idea consists of estimating the parameter $\theta=P(X where $X$ and $Y$ are random variables. Interestingly, the calculation of the profile likelihood of this parameter is quite difficult in general (even numerically ) except for some toy examples such as the exponential or normal case. For this reason, ad hoc frequentist solutions need to be considered such as the empirical likelihood ( see ) or confidence intervals whose construction is difficult as well in a general framework. On the other hand, the use of a Bayesian approach is very simple given that if you have a sample of the posterior distribution of the parameters of the distributions of $X$ and $Y$ , then you can easily transform them into a sample of the posterior of $\theta$ . Let $X$ be a random variable with density and distribution given respectively by $f(x;\xi_1)$ and $F(x;\xi_1)$ . Similarly, let $Y$ be a random variable with density and distribution given respectively by $g(y;\xi_2)$ and $G(y;\xi_2)$ . Then $$\theta = \int F(y;\xi_1)g(y;\xi_2)dy. \tag{$\star$}$$ Note that this parameter is a function of the parameters $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ . In the exponential and normal cases, this can be expressed in closed form ( see ) but this is not the case in general (see this paper for an example). This complicates the calculation of the profile likelihood of $\theta$ and consequently the classical interval inference on this parameter. The main problem can be summarised as follows "The parameter of interest is an unknown/complicated function of the model-parameters and therefore we cannot find a reparameterisation that involves the parameter of interest". From a Bayesian perspective this is not an issue given that if we have a sample from the posterior distribution of $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ , then we can simply input these samples into $(\star)$ in order to obtain a sample of the posterior of $\theta$ and provide interval inference for this parameter.
