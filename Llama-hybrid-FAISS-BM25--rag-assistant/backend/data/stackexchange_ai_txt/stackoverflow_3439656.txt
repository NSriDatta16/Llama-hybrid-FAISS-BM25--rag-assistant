I'd probably keep using the second option. If you know you're running daily (or any other regular interval), you could just test for all modifications (updates and inserts) based on the datepart / day (depending on interval) value in your timestamp column. This way you'll not have to rewrite your update-testing procedure when your inserts/joins/other requirements change. (Of course, you're vulnerable to changes by other agents). You could also introduce a 'helper column' where you set a unique update value, but that smells fishy.
