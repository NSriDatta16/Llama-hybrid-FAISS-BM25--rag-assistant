You can (and should) take a Bayesian probabilistic approach with either in the sense of putting prior probabilities on node values. It is not a good name because they are not more Bayesian than undirected models. I think the name just comes from the fact that DAGs were used in expert systems and people applied Bayesian techniques to them and called them Bayesian networks and the name stuck. They should really be called directed and undirected graphical models. Most machine learning techniques are based on probability theory. I don't know of any of those that could be called non-Bayesian.
