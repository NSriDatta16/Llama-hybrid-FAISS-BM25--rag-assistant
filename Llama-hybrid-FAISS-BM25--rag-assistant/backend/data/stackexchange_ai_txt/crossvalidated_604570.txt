exponential moving average taking into account different time intervals

i want to calculate the exponential moving average with the following formula EMA t = val t * α + EMA t - 1 * (1 - α) but i don't have all the data, i only have some data with a big gap in time. while there are timestamps. for example timestamps=[43439, 43628, 43753, 43974, 44136] for data=[5, 4, 4, 5, 5] i used default value for alpha - α = 2 / (n + 1) but due to uneven intervals it is wrong. i read about processing incomplete time series - filling with the average, interpolation and so on, but i don't know if it's worth using them - the time intervals are really very large, and the data depends not only on time . i saw this question, but i don't understand how to get α in a similar way for my case
