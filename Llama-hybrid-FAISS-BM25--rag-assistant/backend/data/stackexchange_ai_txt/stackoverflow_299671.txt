Spring-JDBC is fantastic. Consider that for an open source project like Spring the down side of external dependency is minimized. You can adopt the most stable version of Spring that satisfies your JDBC abstraction requirements and you know that you'll always be able to modify the source code yourselves if you ever run into an issue -- without depending on an external party. You can also examine the implementation for any security concerns that your organization might have with code written by an external party.
