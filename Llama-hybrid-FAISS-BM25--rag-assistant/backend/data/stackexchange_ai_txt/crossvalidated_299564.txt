Which test to choose?

As you may have guessed from the title, I am very confused as to which statistical test I should use for my data. So I have 15 individuals, for each of them I have several ( from 1 to 20) measures of the time they spent foraging. I also have two conditions, lets say A and B, under which the individuals foraged. What I need to know is whether the individuals have been spending more time in condition A than in condition B. It would be very nice if I could obtain an overall result, for example, if all the individuals spent globally more time foraging in condition A than in condition B. I would also need a more detailed result, and knowing which individual did spend more time foraging in condition A than B, or if some of them did the opposite. I would be very grateful if I could some advices as to which test would achieve what I aim for.
