Lightbox problem loading in Internet Explorer

I just uploaded Lightbox in my website using the code from this http://www.flashxml.net/3d-carousel-menu.html If I click the images in Firefox, images open fine. But if I try it with IE 8, the images don't enlarge or Lightbox doesn't work. Here is the site: http://www.wikima4.com/index.php?id=423 Error I got in IE: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; AskTbFXTV5/5.9.1.14019) Timestamp: Tue, 30 Nov 2010 13:57:36 UTC Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 42 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/assets/snippets/ajaxSearch/js/ajaxSearch.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 153 Char: 107 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/manager/media/script/mootools/mootools.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 567 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://www.wikima4.com/js/effects.js
