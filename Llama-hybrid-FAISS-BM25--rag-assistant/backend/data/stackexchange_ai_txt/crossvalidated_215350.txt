How should I compare posterior samples of the same parameter from two Bayesian models?

I have run 2 Bayesian regression models and would like to compare the posterior samples of a parameter that is common to both models. For example, if model A is $y=\alpha + \beta_1x_1$ and model B is $y=\alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2$ (This is just an example for a difference between models, other differences could be the priors used, hierarchical vs non-hierarchical regression, ...) what would be the best way to compare the two posterior samples for $\beta_1$ from models A and B, including situations where both posterior samples vary around 0?
