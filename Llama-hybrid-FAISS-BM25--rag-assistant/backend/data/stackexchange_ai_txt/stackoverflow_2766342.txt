C is a language and in its definition, there do not need to be any functions available to you. No IO, no math routines and so on. By convention, there are a set of routines available to you that you can link into your executable, but you don't need to use them. This is, however, such a common thing to do that most linkers don't ask you to link to the C runtime libraries anymore. There are times when you don't want them - for example, in working with embedded systems, it might be impractical to have malloc, for example. I used to work on embedding PostScript into printers and we had our own set of runtime libraries that were much happier on embedded systems, so we didn't bother with the "standard".
