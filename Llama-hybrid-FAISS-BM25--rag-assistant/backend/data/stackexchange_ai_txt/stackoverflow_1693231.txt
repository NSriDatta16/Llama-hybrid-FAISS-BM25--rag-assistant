Well, you can put a view into a menu item, and you can drag from a view, but I don't know whether those two will work together (i.e., whether you can drag from a view that's in a menu item). More importantly, this isn't normal on the Mac, so you need another place to drag the item from regardless of whether you can support dragging from the menu or not.
