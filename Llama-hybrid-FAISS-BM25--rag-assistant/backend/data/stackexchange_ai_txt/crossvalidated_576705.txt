Most Random Forest Features are the same

I have a random forest with let's say 256 trees and say 2000 features. from data processing to actual prediction, it takes several hundred microseconds, I was wondering if there were any ways I could speed this up? Is there anything extra I can do if I find that most of these 2000 features, bar a handful stay the same? ie suppose only 2 features varied, from my last prediction, would it make sense if I looked at a subset of this larger forest ie, the 512 * 2 ^ 2 values the forest could give, if the other 1998 were the same. Is there something out there that sounds similar to this? I guess in theory you might expect since each of those two features will have a 512 potential split points, you might have a continuous curve, however I imagine fitting a curve to these values would in itself be slow too... Or is it possible to rephrase the problem to optimise for this scenario?
