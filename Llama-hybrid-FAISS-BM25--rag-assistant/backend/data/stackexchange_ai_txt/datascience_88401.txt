Remove outliers from a noisy curve

Allow me to present some images so that I may explain my problem. The images on the left contain a smooth curve surrounded by lots of outliers/noise. The image on the right depict the desired curve. Is there any approach that would help in eliminating the noise and retrieving the original curve. Please note, this can be any smooth curve (the image on the right) and equation is not known. No prior knowledge of the curve equation is available. Please note that I had originally published this question on Match stackexchange. Posting to data science based on feedback. Thanks, Sau
