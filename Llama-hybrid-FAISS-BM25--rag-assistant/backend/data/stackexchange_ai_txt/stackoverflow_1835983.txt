While your ActionScript background will help, I find Flash to be a VERY different experience from Flex and that proficiency in one environment does not translate well. Is there a compelling reason not to use Flex? I think you would likely be much more efficient. That aside, the mechanics of a simple drag and drop game could be put together fairly quickly. There are some good examples of basic drag and drop around. It can be a little tricky to get the mouse coordinates right if it is your first time. That aside, there are other hidden costs you need to remember. Connecting infrastructure for example. Are the games connected in some way? Is there a running score or persistence that might imply authentication? Is there a story? Also, If your forte is programming, don't underestimate that challenges of obtaining or creating art and sound assets.
