In what sense did "average" ever come to mean a statistical quantity?

I was researching the etymology of "average" to enlighten the debate as to whether "average" can in fact mean a "median" (or if the presenter was merely trying to sweep up their tracks so to speak). I was surprised by the etymology: unknown possible from Arabic meaning losing an eye , and via Italian/French meaning damage to shipping goods according to wiktionary.org The first use for a statistical sense was 1735 (I am guessing it was De Moivre measures of central tendency). Was there any justification for the use of the word in this sense? The median does in fact have a sampling distribution which tends to normal in most cases, but my suspicion was that this early work focused on arithmetic quantities. My questions are: What is the document attributed to the 1735 usage for the statistical of an "average"? Is the definition "(statistics) Any measure of central tendency, especially any mean, the median, or the mode. [from 1735]" actually reflective of what the 1735 treatise reflected? If not, at what point (if ever) did average start to reflect other statistical quantities than the arithmetic mean? 1: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/average
