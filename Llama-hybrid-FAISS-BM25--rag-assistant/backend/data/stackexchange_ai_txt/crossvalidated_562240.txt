How to compare two groups which have been generated through subtraction of two different control groups?

I am still learning how to apply statistics properly so please bear with me (and point out) if I ask something stupid. I am sure this question has been answered already. However, I don't know the best search terms to find the answer. I have searched both here and google but didn't find anything of use. Please feel free just to point me to the right terminology to ask my question properly. I will soon be trying to do a simple statistical comparison between two groups to find if their means are significantly different. However, these groups are created from subtracting these data from two separate control dataset means. I was planning to simply do a two sample t-test, however, my statistical spidey sense tingled. I feel that this is unreasonable comparison considering that these data have been generated from a distribution who's variation hasn't been taken into account. Could I use a two sample t-test if the two control groups were not significantly different from each other? Assuming this is true please could we assume that the two groups are significantly different. I would like to know if my statistical intuition is correct in thinking this wasn't really a valid way to provide a comparison. I don't know if it makes any difference but $n_{control}$ is 5 and $n_{samples}$ = 8. n is the same for both groups. The all the distributions are expected to be normal. For clarity my data would be: $\bar{C_1} - A_{1i} = X_{1i}$ $\bar{C_2} - A_{2i} = X_{2i}$ Where $C_1$ & $C_2$ are the control data, $A_1$ & $A_2$ are the initial datasets. My aim is to compare $X_1$ and $X_2$ . For clarity the control groups are different datasets. My specific questions on this are: Am I correct that not considering the controls in the t-test is unreliable in this situation? If so, what is the correct way to compare these two groups? If the standard deviation of the control groups are not significantly different could would I use the t-test as is? If the answer to 3 is true could the average of the combination of the data in both controls be used? (some how this feels wrong to me). My apologies in advance that someone may have to change the name of the question. Thank you in advance for your help.
