The simplest way to deallocate all the storage in a vector, without destroying the vector object itself, is vec = std::vector (); Your second variant will have the same effect, but it jumps through more hoops on the way. The "copy and swap" trick deallocates any extra capacity in the vector, and can be useful if it contains some data you want to keep. If there's no data, then there's no need for copying or swapping.
