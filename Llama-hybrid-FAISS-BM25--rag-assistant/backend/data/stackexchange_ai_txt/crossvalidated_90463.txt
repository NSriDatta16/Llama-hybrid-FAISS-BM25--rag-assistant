Under what circumstances is regression discontinuity preferred to differences in differences?

I am looking at the adoption of universal health care coverage for children age 6 and under in a country. The take-up rate was practically 100%. I want to know the impact of having coverage on doctor visits. I have data from the year before the policy came into effect and the year after it came into effect. I can either do differences in differences and see what happened to six year olds and seven years olds in the two years -- or I can create a panel and do regress discontinuity and see what happens to children on either side of the age divide. (using a fuzzy approach). What would you see as the advantages/disadvantages of the two methods? It's unclear to me.
