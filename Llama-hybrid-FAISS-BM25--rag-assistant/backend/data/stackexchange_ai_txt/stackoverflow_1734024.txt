managing multiple software projects

we have an organization that has about 50 different software projects going on (about 90 developers). some big, some small. some are front to back solutions and some are building on top of existing solutions and technologies. some of these projects are new initiative and some are incremental improvements over existing software that we built. our senior management is looking for a sleek way to visualize all the projects going on including: Size of effort in time and resources ROI expected from the work Indicate incremental improvement versus new initiative. the reason is that we probably want to move resources around to ensure top ROI but not all developer are fungible depending on their skill set. in my head, this results in some type of heatmap or dashboard, but i wanted to see if there are any recommend solution or tools out there that attack this area. right now we just have spreadsheets listing out each project and resources and somehow it doesn't really give a good visualization of whats actually happening. any suggestions?
