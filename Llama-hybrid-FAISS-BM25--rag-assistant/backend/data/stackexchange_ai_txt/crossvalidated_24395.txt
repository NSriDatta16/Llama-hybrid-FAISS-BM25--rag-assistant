Visualizing many p-values

I have a dataset, on which I am doing some data mining. My mining method has certain parameters which I can fiddle with, presumably leading to better or worse quality results. I measure the quality of these results with some statistical tests, which gives me a low P-value for "good" results. This generates a lot of P-values over a large range. I want to visualize how the P-value changes in response to my parameter. Currently I do this by plotting the P-value over the parameter, however the plot doesn't come out smooth at all. For my personal use, I tried "smoothing" by doing a moving average of the P-values. I know this is a nonsense method but it helps me see the general trend. I have two questions: What is the "right" way to smooth such a curve, ie. a curve generated by a function f(x)=p which returns a P-value corresponding to each parameter x? Does the answer to 1 change if I was plotting the log of P-values, rather than the values themselves?
