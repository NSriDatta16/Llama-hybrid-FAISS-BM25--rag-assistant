What's the name of this recurrent neural network?

I remember recently seeing or reading a paper about a new type of recurrent neural network that enabled long term memory over sequences by having only part of the neurons active at any given timestep. The timestep unrolled connections looked something like this (possibly not exactly like this) This was done to model time series, and enabled the network to remember events that happened both a very long time ago, and a very short time ago. Does anyone know the name of this type of network architecture?
