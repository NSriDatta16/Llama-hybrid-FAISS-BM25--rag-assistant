You've gotten a few answers dealing with C code, so here's an XOR demo for MATLAB . The demo is written for an older version of MATLAB (ver. 6) and requires the Neural Network Toolbox , but should hopefully still give you some ideas on how to implement the network. EDIT: For more general information on backpropagation algorithms in the Neural Network Toolbox, I would suggest the online documentation at The MathWorks website .
