Feeding clusters to neural network

I have labelled GPS location data (lat,lon) to determine whether a trip is of a certain type. The location data consists of start and end points in the format of lat,lon coordinates. A trip is labelled by bicycle or car, and this is what I'm trying to predict based on a person's previous location habits. For example, the coordinates (lat1,lon1) to (lat2,lon2) have previously always been travelled by car, whereas (lat1,lon1) to (lat3,lon3) are usually travelled by bicycle. Hour-of-day data is also available, which I think could be used to predict. The city in which coordinations are collected in is small, so distance would not be a good indicator of the trip type. I have tried to feed the start location, end location and hour of the day with the label into an NN, but without results. I guess this is because lon, lat coordinates are only useful as a pair and not as independent parameters. (A4,B7) -> Bicycle (A4,B8) -> Car (B7,A4) -> Car Will the network be able to detect patterns in the data? Or is a neural network a bad idea, and should I instead go for an alternative approach?
