The confusion probably arrises because in a linear model there are multiple definitions of degrees of freedom. Depending on which one you use you may get the discrepancy with a definition of degrees of freedom in another model. When a linear model is fitted then the space of all possible observations is split into two parts of dimensionality $p$ and $n-p$ where $p$ is the number of parameters and $n$ is the number of observations. See for instance the question Why are the residuals in $\mathbb{R}^{n-p}$? The linear model fit results in two vectors, each one in one of those two spaces: 1. the modelled estimate 2. the residual If we compute an F-statistic then we compare (using a ratio) the sum of squares of both these vectors divided by the dimensionality of the space. That dimensionality is also the 'degree of freedom'. It is a measure for how many parameters are 'free to vary'. But, depending how you look at it are different things that can be described as the degrees of freedom $n-p$ (in how much ways can the residual vector differ), $p$ (in how many ways can the model differ), or $p-1$ (in how many ways can the model differ relative to an average of the data).
