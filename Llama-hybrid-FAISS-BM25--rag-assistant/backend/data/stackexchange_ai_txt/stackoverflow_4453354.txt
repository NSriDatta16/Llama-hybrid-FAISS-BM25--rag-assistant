The Nexus S is worth the investment. It is the only Android phone with new sensors including: 3 axis GYROSCOPE, Near Field Communication (NFC), Gingerbread Android 2.3, Proximity Sensor, Light Sensor. It is officially endorsed by Google. The Nexus One was an excellent phone, so its likely that the Nexus S will be too. As for fragmentation, the Android market collects bug reports, but they fail to gather machine level data about which device is causing the bug. For this, I recommend http://code.google.com/p/android-remote-stacktrace/
