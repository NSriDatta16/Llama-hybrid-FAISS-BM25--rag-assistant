It's wrong in part because it's based on a mathematical fallacy. (It's even more wrong because it's such blatant voter-suppression propaganda, but that's not a suitable topic for discussion here.) The implicit context is one in which an election looks like it's on the fence. One reasonable model is that there will be $n$ voters (not including you) of whom approximately $m_1\lt n/2$ will definitely vote for one candidate and approximately $m_2\approx m_1$ will vote for the other, leaving $n-(m_1+m_2)$ "undecideds" who will make up their minds on the spot randomly, as if they were flipping coins. Most people--including those with strong mathematical backgrounds--will guess that the chance of a perfect tie in this model is astronomically small. (I have tested this assertion by actually asking undergraduate math majors.) The correct answer is surprising. First, figure there's about a $1/2$ chance $n$ is odd, which means a tie is impossible. To account for this, we'll throw in a factor of $1/2$ in the end. Let's consider the remaining situation where $n=2k$ is even. The chance of a tie in this model is given by the Binomial distribution as $$\Pr(\text{Tie}) = \binom{n - m_1 - m_2}{k - m_1} 2^{m_1+m_2-n}.$$ When $m_1\approx m_2,$ let $m = (m_1+m_2)/2$ (and round it if necessary). The chances don't depend much on small deviations between the $m_i$ and $m,$ so writing $N=k-m,$ an excellent approximation of the Binomial coefficient is $$\binom{n - m_1-m_2}{k - m_1} \approx \binom{2(k-m)}{k-m} = \binom{2N}{N} \approx \frac{2^{2N}}{\sqrt{N\pi}}.$$ The last approximation, due to Stirling's Formula , works well even when $N$ is small (larger than $10$ will do). Putting these results together, and remembering to multiply by $1/2$ at the outset, gives a good estimate of the chance of tie as $$\Pr(\text{Tie}) \approx \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N\pi}}.$$ In such a case, your vote will tip the election. What are the chances? In the most extreme case, imagine a direct popular vote involving, say, $10^8$ people (close to the number who vote in a US presidential election). Typically about 90% of people's minds a clearly decided, so we might take $N$ to be on the order of $10^7.$ Now $$\frac{1}{2\sqrt{10^7\pi}} \approx 10^{-4}.$$ That is, your participation in a close election involving one hundred million people still has about a $0.01\%$ chance of changing the outcome! In practice, most elections involve between a few dozen and a few million voters. Over this range, your chance of affecting the results (under the foregoing assumptions, of course) ranges from about $10\%$ (with just ten undecided voters) to $1\%$ (with a thousand undecided voters) to $0.1\%$ (with a hundred thousand undecided voters). In summary, the chance that your vote swings a closely-contested election tends to be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of undecided voters. Consequently, voting is important even when the electorate is large. The history of US state and national elections supports this analysis. Remember, for just one recent example, how the 2000 US presidential election was decided by a plurality in the state of Florida (with several million voters) that could not have exceeded a few hundred--and probably, if it had been checked more closely, would have been even narrower. If (based on recent election outcomes) it appears there is, say, a few percent chance that an election involving a few million people will be decided by at most a few hundred votes, then the chance that the next such election is decided by just one vote (intuitively) must be at least a hundredth of one percent. That is about one-tenth of what this inverse square root law predicts. But that means the history of voting and this analysis are in good agreement, because this analysis applies only to close races--and most are not close. For more (anecdotal) examples of this type, across the world, see the Wikipedia article on close election results . It includes a table of about 200 examples. Unfortunately, it reports the margin of victory as a proportion of the total. As we have seen, regardless of whether all (or even most) assumptions of this analysis hold, a more meaningful measure of the closeness of an election would be the margin divided by the square root of the total. By the way, your chance of an injury due to driving to the ballot box (if you need to drive at all) can be estimated as the rate of injuries annually (about one percent) divided by the average number of trips (or distance-weighted trips) annually, which is several hundred. We obtain a number well below $0.01\%.$ Your chance of winning the lottery grand prize? Depending on the lottery, one in a million or less. The quotation in the question is not only scurrilous, it is outright false.
