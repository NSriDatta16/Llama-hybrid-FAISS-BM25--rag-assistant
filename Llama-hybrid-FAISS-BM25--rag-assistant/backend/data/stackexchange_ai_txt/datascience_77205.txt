How to know if classification model is predicting 1 or 0

I have used logistic regression to predict whether customer is good(1) or bad(0). I got the accuracy .80 . How do i know whether model predicted 1 or 0 .Is it related to parameter of model1.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1] (the 1 in the end in square bracket).
