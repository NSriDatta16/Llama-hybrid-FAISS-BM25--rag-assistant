I used the hataccess from the codigniter wiki(the same that I had above): RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / # Removes the "/" at the end RewriteRule (.+)/$ /$1 [L,R] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.* RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)$ daniel/index.php?/$1 [L] # If we don't have mod_rewrite installed, all 404's # can be sent to index.php, and everything works as normal. # Submitted by: ElliotHaughin ErrorDocument 404 /index.php With all the same option, only $config['uri_protocol'] = "AUTO"(instead of URI_PROTOCOL) and somehow it began to work (and I have the aplication folder outside of the system folder) Thank You all who kindly replied me!
