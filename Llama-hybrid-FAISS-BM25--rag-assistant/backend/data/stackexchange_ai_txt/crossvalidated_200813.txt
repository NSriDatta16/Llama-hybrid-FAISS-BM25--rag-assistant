Funnel plots have been a tremendous statistical innovation that turned meta analysis on its head. Basically, a funnel plot shows the clinical and statistical significance on the same plot. Ideally, they would form a funnel shape. However, several meta-analyses have produced funnel plots that show a strong bimodal shape, where investigators (or publishers) selectively withheld results that were null. The result is that the triangle becomes wider, because smaller, less powered studies used more drastic methods to "encourage" results to reach statistical significance. The Cochrane Report team has this to say about them . If there is bias, for example because smaller studies without statistically significant effects (shown as open circles in Figure 10.4.a, Panel A) remain unpublished, this will lead to an asymmetrical appearance of the funnel plot with a gap in a bottom corner of the graph (Panel B). In this situation the effect calculated in a meta-analysis will tend to overestimate the intervention effect (Egger 1997a, Villar 1997). The more pronounced the asymmetry, the more likely it is that the amount of bias will be substantial. The first plot shows a symmetrical plot in the absence of bias. The second shows an asymmetrical plot in the presence of reporting bias. The third shows an asymmetrical plot in the presence of bias because some smaller studies (open circles) are of lower methodological quality and therefore produce exaggerated intervention effect estimates. I suspect most authors are unaware of the methods they use to p-hack. They don't keep track of the overall number of models they fit, applying different exclusion criteria or opting for different adjustment variables each time. However, if I had to mandate a simple process, I would love to see the total number of models fit. That's not to say there might be legitimate reasons to rerun models, for instance we just ran through a Alzheimer's analysis not knowing ApoE had been collected in the sample. Egg on my face, we reran the models.
