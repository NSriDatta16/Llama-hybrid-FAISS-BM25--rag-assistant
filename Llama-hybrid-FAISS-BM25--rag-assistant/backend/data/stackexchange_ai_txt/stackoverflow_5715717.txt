Best approach to detect iPad Safari user

What is the best approach to add code for detecting an iPad Safari user. I mean should we use 1. CSS (through link media..) 2. JS (through navigator object) I have heard that using user-agent string is not the best way to detect iPad, because of inconsistencies. Please suggest. Thank you. I also have a follow-up question; Actually the code to detect desktop/iPad is going to be part of JSP (and not static HTML files)...Now in my app, there are 200+ pages..So where exactly should I be adding the code for detection and how exactly should I add it? I mean do I have to update somewhere in the servlet web.xml file.. Sorry for mixing the 2 questions..But just added here as both are related questions..
