How to read name of html helper element

Is there in mvc any opportunity to read a name which will be assigned to html control? For example I use this code: @Html.LabelFor(x => x.Name) @Html.TextBoxFor(x => x.Name) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(x => x.Name) @Html.HiddenFor(x => x.Id) I want to display here a TextBox name And I want to get a name of input name. This code is fragment of partial view. Name of element looks like children[1].Name
