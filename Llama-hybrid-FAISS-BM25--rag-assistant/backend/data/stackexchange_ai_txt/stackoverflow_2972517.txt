You have to dump the database on the original server, then copy it to the other server, and restore it. For each of these actions, there is a "server side" way, and a "PHPside" way. If you can, use the first one. If you can't use the second, but you need to pay extra attention to security. Server side: 1. and 3.: use mysqldump. 2. use scp to transfer the file. PHP side: 1. use a script to dump databases, like this one . 2. Copy the file using CURL, or place it in an available directory, protecting it somehow. 3. Retrieve the file from the second server, and just run it through a mysql_exec to restore the DB.
