Why not mongodb?

I recently used MongoDB for the first time and found it exceptionally easy to use and high-performing. Which leads to my question - why not MongoDB? Lets say I am implementing a Q & A app. My approach would be to implement the User data in a MySQL database and then use MongoDB for the question and answer storage - one collection storing a question and all responses. Is there anything wrong with this approach?
