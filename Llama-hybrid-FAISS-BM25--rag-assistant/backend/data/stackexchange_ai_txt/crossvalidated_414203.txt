Your graph shows a clear violation of model assumptions assumed in linear regression. Your data do indeed appear somewhat heteroscedastic. Funnel shapes are not the only shapes on these plots that are indicators of heteroscedasticity. Recall that in ordinary linear regression, the model assumes that the errors of the model are assumed normally distributed with mean zero and a constant variance of $\sigma^2$ (i.e. $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ ). If you see anything other than an essentially random pattern around of predicted values vs. residuals (i.e. $\hat{\epsilon}$ around the zero line), you likely have non-linearity of the response function and some heteroscedasticity implying the model assumptions for OLS are violated. Putting aside the issue of non-linearity and other potential model assumption violations, you could always check for non-constant error variance with a formal statistical test, depending on how many points you actually have there (for example, the r function ncv.test will perform the Breusch-Pagan test which is a statistical test of the null hypothesis of constant error variance against the alternative that the error variance changes with the level of the response.)
