The primary advantages of defining object literals are not polluting the global namespace and cleaner code organization. Rebecca Murphey explains the advantages in this blog post: http://rmurphey.com/blog/2009/10/15/using-objects-to-organize-your-code/ I prefer to create objects functionally rather than literally because JS functions are first-class objects. Therefore, you can define public methods and properties which can be invoked outside the object, but can also have private variables and functions which are hidden from outside the scope of the object. function Alphabet() { // public property this.letters = 'xyx'; // private variable var letters = 'abc'; // public method this.speak = function(){ say("Now I know my ABCs"); } // private function function say(message){ alert(message); } }
