Infragistics ValueList Sort

Scenatio is as follows: I have a value-list which is of Type "Infragistics.Win.ValueList". and I want to sort the value-list. Let say I have the following values in Value-list. "Value 1" "Value 3". "Value 2" "Value 11" "Value 22" I'm using "value-list.SortStyle = ValueListSortStyle.Ascending;" to sort the value-list in ascending order. The output is as follows: "Value 1" "Value 11" "Value 2" "Value 22" "Value 3". This is becasue the sorting is based on string, where as the desired output is "Value 1" "Value 2" "Value 3" "Value 11" "Value 22". Also, ValueList doesn't expose the SortComparer property, so that I can write custom sort. What should be my approach to get the desired output?
