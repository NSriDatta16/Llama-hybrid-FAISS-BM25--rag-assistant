UISlider Update inside UITableViewCell

I have a custom UITableViewCell that contains a UISlider control and a UILabel which shows the current text value for the slider position. I want to update the label as the slider knob is dragged. Here are the basic elements. cellForRowAtIndexPath: This routine takes data and updates the slider value and the label associated with it. sliderValueChanged: This routine reads the slider value updates the data. It then calls [table reloadData] so the label gets updated. Problem: Somehow the reloadData is interrupting the flow of updates. If I substitute NSLog instead of reloadData I get a nice stream of updates showing the value of the slider. In an attempt to prevent looping I put in tests to not set the slider value or call reloadData unless the value was different. That didn't fix things. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
