The answers above are excellent. After carefully reading your questions, I found there are 2 important facts we might overlooked. You are using linear kernel Your training data is linearly separable, since "There is no error on the training set". Given the 2 facts, if C values changes within a reasonable range, the optimal hyperplane will just randomly shifting by a small amount within the margin(the gap formed by the support vectors). Intuitively, suppose the margin on training data is small, and/or there is no test data points within the margin too, the shifting of the optimal hyperplane within the margin will not affect classification error of the test set. Nonetheless, if you set C=0, then SVM will ignore the errors, and just try to minimise the sum of squares of the weights(w), perhaps you may get different results on the test set.
