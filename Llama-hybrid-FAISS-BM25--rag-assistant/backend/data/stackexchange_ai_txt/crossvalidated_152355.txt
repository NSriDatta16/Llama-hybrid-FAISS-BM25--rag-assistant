The usual definition of limiting distribution is that a Markov chain has a limiting distribution $\pi$ if for every initial distribution $P(0)$, $ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P(0)P^{(n)}=\pi $ It's important to get that quantifier right. A useful example to consider is the Markov chain with $ P=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right]. $ Here, $\pi=[1/2 \;\;1/2]$ is a stationary distribution but not a limiting distribution of the Markov chain. In fact this Markov chain does not have a limiting distribution.
