How to include an interaction term in a random forest model

I'm using the function randomForest in R's randomForest package to do a regression. However, when I'm trying to include an interaction term in the following codes: library(MASS) library(randomForest) Boston_f The result mdl$term does include interaction, but if I peek into the trees that mdl is using, getTree(mdl, 1, T) I cannot find any split variable using interaction term. Does anyone know how to include interaction term using randomForest or other function?
