Hmm... Basing on the fragment of code you posted, I believe that your scene disappears because of what you're doing with your matrices - looks a bit chaotic to me. The approach should look like this: clean the screen 3D: enable lighting, z-test, etc set active matrix mode to projection load identity and establish a perspective projection set active matrix mode back to modelview draw everything 3D 2D: disable lighting, z-test, etc set active matrix mode to projection load identity and establish an ortogonal projection set active matrix mode back to modelview draw everything 2D swap buffers Also, consider switching to shaders (and to a modern OpenGL version in general) if you want to make your life even easier :).
