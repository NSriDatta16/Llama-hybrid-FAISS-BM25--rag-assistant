This sounds like something very similar to a method I have seen Jerry Reiter using multiple imputation for missing data. However I can't quite remember the name of the paper. But these terms will probably be able to get you in the right(er) direction (pardon the pun). So basically you have three variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. the variable $Z$ is your "gold standard" variable, and the variable $X$ is the "bronze standard" variable. You would prefer to have observed $Y$ and $Z$ together. But unfortunately, you only observe $X$ and $Y$ together, and $X$ and $Z$ together. you can set up the model as follows. If you knew $Z$, then $X$ would be irrelevant to making inference about $Y$ (why use bronze when you've got gold?). So you have: $$P(Y|X,Z)=P(Y|Z)$$ But you also have a model relating $X$ and $Z$, $P(Z|X)$. Now use the law of total probability, the product rule, and the above equation to expand $P(Y|X)$: $$P(Y|X)=\int P(Y,Z|X)dZ=\int P(Y|Z,X)P(Z|X) dZ=\int P(Y|Z)P(Z|X)dZ$$ And so you have a "weighted average" of the "gold model" $P(Y|Z)$, where the weights depend on the "error model" $P(Z|X)$ (i.e. how well the bronze standard predicts the gold standard). If the $Z$ can be quite well predicted, then $P(Z|X)$ will resemble a "delta function" and the model will essentially be a "plug in" model: $$P(Y|Z)\approx P(Y|Z)_{Z=X}$$ If $Z$ is poorly estimated from $X$, then $P(Z|X)$ will be quite "flat" and this procedure will "spread out its bets" over many different models. Jerry Reiter's method should give some more details about the actual implementation of this.
