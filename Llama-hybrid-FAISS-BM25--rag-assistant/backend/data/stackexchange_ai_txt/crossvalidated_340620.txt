What is the difference between a non-linear kernel and a polynomial kernel in SVM?

I am relatively new to this field. From my understanding, a non-linear kernel maps the data points onto a higher dimension whereas a polynomial kernel creates a polynomial hyperplane having degree >=2. However, is their any correlation between these two forms of kernel? Please elucidate your answers with examples.
