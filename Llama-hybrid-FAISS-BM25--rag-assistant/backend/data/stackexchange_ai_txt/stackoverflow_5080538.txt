C# Determine if List Has Duplicate

Requirement : In an unsorted List, determine if a duplicate exists. The typical way I would do this is an n-squared nested loop. I'm wondering how others solve this. Is there an elegant, high performance method in Linq? Something generic that takes a lambda or a comparer would be nice. Note : This is different than LINQ find duplicates in List which returns the actual duplicates. I just need to know if one exists or not.
