How to implement Azure table pagination

I would like to know how to implement pagination on Azure table storage? Since Azure table storage does not support "Skip()" LINQ operation, it is impossible to implement pagination functionality straight forward. It seems it could only be done via Continuations tokens. But the problem is I could not find the proper example how to do it most elegantly. Can you provide me such simple Azure table pagination example? In SQL world the core pagination statement would look like: _context.DataTable.Where(r => r.SomeData == data1 && r.SomeData2 == (int)data2 && r.SomeData3 == (int)data3).Skip(10).Take(10).ToList(); Here we get a returned "page". Azure table example?
