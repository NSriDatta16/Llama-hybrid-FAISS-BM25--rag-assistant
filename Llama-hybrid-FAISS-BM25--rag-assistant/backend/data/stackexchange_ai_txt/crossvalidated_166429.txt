Convolutional Neural Network. Constructing C3 layer from S2

In C3 layer of Convolutional Neural Network (LeNet 5) we need to construct 16 feature maps of size of 10*10. In C3 layer a connection map is used (this connection map shows what feature maps from layer S2 connected with S3 feature maps), for example feature map number 9 in C3 is connected with feature maps 3,4,5,6. But for example if we need to construct first feature map of C3, we will use 1,2,3 feature maps of S2 according to table. Also I have read that "As shown in table 1 the choice is made not to connect every feature map of S2 to every feature map of C3. Each unit of C3 is connected to several receptive fields at identical locations in a subset of feature maps of S2". According to this statement unit is a neuron and it is connected to several receptive fields of C3 feature maps. But as we building first feature maps of C3, we will use 1,2,3 feature maps of S2 layer. But in total it will give 3 feature maps, it is wrong. In total we have 100 neurons and 100 receptive fields in order to built one 10*10 feature maps of C3. Even if we will use 3 receptive fields as stated in table (from feature maps 1,2,3 of S2 layer). In total we will have 3 receptive fields of 5*5 size, finally it will give us a 3 neurons and 3 pixels which is ain't enough to build one 10*10 feature map. Could you please say how exactly should a C3 layer feature maps must be constructed? Thank you!
