Assuming you're rendering points (which seems to be what you're describing), the two vertices with the different colors will result in two fragments (one for each vertex) at the same location. What final color will be written to the output depends on the Z values for each, the blending function set and the order in which they are processed (which is effectively random -- you can't count on either order unless you do some extra sync stuff, so you need to set your blend func/Z-culling such that it doesn't matter).
