Discriminant, logistic approach to attrition analytics

I have a few variables for each employee like tenure, age, marital status, certification, working away from home, #of OThours in an year, last promotion, performance rating, etc... I have these variables and few more for employees who had left and employees who are working. If you see my variables, few are continuous and others are categorical, is it possible to run a discriminant analysis on this and identify which variables are discriminating better between a person leaving/not leaving the company and to forecast for existing employees or should I only use logistic regression since DA may not support discrete variables in the equation, or do we have any other method to achieve my goal?
