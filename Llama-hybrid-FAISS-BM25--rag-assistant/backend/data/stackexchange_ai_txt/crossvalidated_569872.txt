It means that the neural network has a high variance . It is prone to overfitting, it sometimes picks the right patterns, sometimes the noise. It can be due to using different training data, random initialization, or both. That is why procedures, as employed by yourself, are useful, if you trained and validated it only once you would never know. What this means for you is that you don't really know how the model would behave at prediction time. You may check the What should I do when my neural network doesn't generalize well? thread for possible solutions.
