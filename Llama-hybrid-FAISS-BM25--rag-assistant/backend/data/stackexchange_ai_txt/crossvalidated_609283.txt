Calculate the output of a Neural Network

I have the following problem: Here is my approach: With the activation function: $F(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3$ , we can calculate the activation of the two units of the second layer by: $a_1^2 = F(w_{13}\cdot x_1 + w_{23}\cdot x_2) = F(2\cdot 1 + (-3)\cdot (-1)) = F(5) = 38$ $a_2^2 = F(w_{14}\cdot x_1 + w_{24}\cdot x_2) = F(1\cdot 1 + 4\cdot (-1)) = F(-3) = 6$ With new inputs, we can now calculate the Output by: $h(x) = F(w_{35}\cdot a_1^2 + w_{45}\cdot a_2^2)$ = $F(2\cdot 38 + (-1)\cdot 6) = F(70) = 5043$ I was wondering whether my approach to the problem was correct or not? I would really appreciate any comments. Thank you all!
