You can take advantage of a Sequence Container. Add a Sequence container to your task flow. Then move (drag and drop will do it) all of your data flow tasks into the container. Now you can create a single precedence constraint from your Execute SQL Task to the Sequence container. Everything in the Sequence Container will not execute until the rules of the Precedence Constraint are met.
