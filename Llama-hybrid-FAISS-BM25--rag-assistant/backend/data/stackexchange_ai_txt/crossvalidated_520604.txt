Is it valid to calculate Spearman/Cramér's V with duplicate values?

I have a dataset that I want to analyze using statistic measures. Because of the nature of the data, it seems like Cramér's V is the correct method (For cases involving (school) grades only, Spearman may be correct. I use both depending on the data). In my scenario here, users assign school grades and write additional evaluative texts. I want to analyze the grades assigned together with the corresponding texts. To do that, I have extracted the sentiment phrases from the texts. I now have: Average school grades assigned by Internet users to certain objects (e.g. to movies), i.e. 1 grade per movie average polarity values of the phrases users write in their texts to asses objects (like a movie), i.e. n sentiment polarity values per movie (sentiment scores are positive or negative, can be seen as 0 and 1) To calculate Cramér's V, I build a table where I have to copy the school grades as often as there are polarity scores: Overall grades Sentiment polarity per phrase 2,7 negative 2,7 positive 2,7 negative 1,5 positive 1,5 positive Is it valid to basically duplicate the overall grades in order to match them with the existing sentiment polarity values or am I overthinking here? How can this question be answered regarding a Spearman Correlation?
