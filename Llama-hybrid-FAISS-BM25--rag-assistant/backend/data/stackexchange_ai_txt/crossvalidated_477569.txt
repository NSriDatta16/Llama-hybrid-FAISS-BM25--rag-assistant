Great question. As A, B, C occur together or not at all, I don't think any of the bias categories are applicable. Regarding logistic regression, if there is an interaction effect between A and B when predicting C, then the value of A would be useful in predicting B - when including C. Logistic regression relies on the linear separability of classes, so if there is no interaction effect, A won't be helpful in predicting B. (I'm not talking about any expansions beyond just using A, B, and C in a new logistic regression model. Whether there's a more effective modeling technique is a separate issue.) Consider the following dataset, where there is an interaction effect (extreme) between A and B on C. C and A predict B. A B C 2 1 40 2 0 20 3 1 60 3 0 30 4 1 80 4 0 40 0 1 10 ... ... ...
