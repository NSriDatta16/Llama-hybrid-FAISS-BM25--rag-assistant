Pushing without a commit in Mercurial or Git

Seems like for both Mercurial or Git, if I don't commit first, then I can't push? So if I don't commit (when not ready yet), I can't push to a remote server to back up my code? The code is in a notebook computer, being carried around, which can be somewhat fragile being carried around.
