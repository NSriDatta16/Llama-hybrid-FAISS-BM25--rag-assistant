I think even this method is also called Ensemble Method. How could I conclude that? You might have heard about this algorithm named Random Forest , what does it do? It take data randomly at row level and column level builds different trees and takes an average of it. It is also considered as one of the best algorithm for Prediction and Classification. Can go through this explanation for better understanding. Random Forest is called Ensemble model(of trees). A suggestion, as you have mentioned in the question that you have very less data, at that time the models cannot generalize well and you cannot achieve good results. If you have any way to increase the dataset size by collecting more data, it could aid you in achieving better accuracy. This is also explained the link attached(explanation). Do go through and let me know if you have any additional questions.
