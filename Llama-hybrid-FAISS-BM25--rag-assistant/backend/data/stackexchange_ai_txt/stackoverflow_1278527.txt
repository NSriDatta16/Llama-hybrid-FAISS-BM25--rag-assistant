Detecting tap to Show/hide UINavigationBar

I am kinda new to iPhone development and haven't done anything yet envolving touches. My view hierarchy like this: UIView - UIImageView - UIScrollView - CustomView How do I detect if the user has tapped anywhere on the screen so I can show/hide the navigation bar accordingly? I don't need user interaction on my CustomView but I'd like to ignore touches on the UIScrollView when the user just wants to drag it. I can already show/hide the navigation bar from my view controller programatically using: [self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES animated:YES]; Thanks in advance!
