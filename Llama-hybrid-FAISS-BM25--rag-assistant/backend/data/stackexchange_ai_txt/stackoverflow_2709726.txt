Elegantly? This isn't elegant but it's how I'm doing it. I just do it manually. At app quit I write this value to user defaults: lastSelectedRow = [outlineView selectedRow] Then at app launch I run this in app did finish launching: [self performSelector:@selector(selectLastNoteOrCreateDefaultNote) withObject:nil afterDelay:1]; Notice I just use a delay because I noticed the same as you that "the outline view seems to not have been prepared yet". Then in that selector I use this. [outlineView selectRowIndexes:[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:lastSelectedRow] byExtendingSelection:NO]; It works but better (more elegant) solutions are welcome from me too.
