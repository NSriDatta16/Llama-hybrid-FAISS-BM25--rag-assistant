Let us firstly distinguish between two sets of parameters: model parameters (e.g. weights for features in regression), and parameters to the learning algorithm (and hyperparameters). The purpose of cross-validation is to identify learning parameters that generalise well across the population samples we learn from in each fold. More specifically: We globally search over the space over learning parameters, but within each fold, we fix learning parameters and learn model parameters. The outcome should be learning parameters that produce on average the best performance in all folds. We can then use these to train a model on the entire dataset.
