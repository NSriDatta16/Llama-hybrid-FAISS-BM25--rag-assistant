Access text currently selected in outlook 2007

I'd like to create C# outlook addin to automate a process of adding mail fragments as comments in my bug tracking system (Jira). To create the comment I need to extract currently selected text. I manage to do that in a tricky way for email window (following this article). But I didn't find any way to access the current selection in the preview window. Any suggestions?
