Multi-Linear Regression with ARIMA errors - Forecasting

I have a time series dataset with 7 independent variables. I have created a multi-linear regression(MLR) using 3 of these independent variables and two lagged variables. When I checked for the normality of the residuals using the Shapiro-Wilk test in R, p>5% (thus confirming normality). Then, the residuals of the MLR are modeled using ARIMA (no xreg since this is for residuals only). My problem is, can I forecast MLR and ARIMA separately and add them to check the test set? ( I did that, the test MAPE is really high) Please kindly tell me how to do this "Regression with ARIMA errors" without auto.arima function in R
