How to store a 250mb database in an Offline Web App

Ok, maybe i'm not seeing the whole picture or something, but i kinda need a brainstorm. So the purpose is to make a webapp (HTML5, CSS, Javascript) that has to search on a 250mb database without any internet connection, so.. yes the database has to be on the client side. The hard part here is, this App has to work on an iPod or iPhone without internet connection. (An initial connection to download the App is ok), LocalStorage has a 5mb limit, couchDB would be great since they have an webapp easily accessed by Javascript (privacy concerns don't matter at this point), so i'm pretty much out of ideas.... Does anyone see an alternative, or solution for the purpose?
