How to interpret normalized coefficients in logistic regression?

I trained a logistic regression model with 5 features per sample. Before training, I normalized the range of my features into [0,1] (MinMax scaler). After training, I received the following coefficients for a logistic regression model: coef_1 = [[-2.26286643 4.05722387 0.74869811 0.20538172 -0.49969841]] In logistic regression the coefficients indicate the effect of a one-unit change in your predictor variable on the log odds of 'success'. But as my features are normalized, I wanted to know the effect of a one-unit change in the original unit. For example, the range of the first feature is [0, 94.5] that of the second is in [0.5, 180], the thrid one is in [12,95] and the last two are categorical variables. So I divided the coefficients of the model by the feature range to get the 'real' one-unit change values and got: coef_2 = [[-0.02393 0.0225 0.009 0.205 -0.499]] I thought that these coefficients would be the same as I would get from a logit model where I did not scale my features before training, giving me: coef_3 = [[-0.04743728 0.04394143 -0.00247654 0.23769469 -0.55051824]] But these are clearly not the same. Although, there is some correlation. For the first two features, coef_2 is the half of coef_3 , and for the last two features, one can say that coef_2 and coef_3 are approximately the same. My question now are: Which of the coefficients (1, 2 or 3) gives me the true change of a one-unit change in a predictor variable and how can I rank the importance of my features? Can I even compare real-valued features with categorical variables?
