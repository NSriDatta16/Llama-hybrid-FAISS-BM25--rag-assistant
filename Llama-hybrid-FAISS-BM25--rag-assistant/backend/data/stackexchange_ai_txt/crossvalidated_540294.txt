How do I characterise the relationship between one variable and many other variables for a complex socio-technical problem?

I am doing a PhD on a socio-technical problem – this is a building physics problem, where I am trying to determine the relationship between one variable (x) which affects a number (up to 20 other) of other variables (a, b, c etc). I have calculated x, which can be characterized as both discrete and continuous. All the other variables (a, b, c etc) are continuous. The relationships are complex, as one key influencer over all variables is (unpredictable) human behaviour, and this behaviour can be seasonal. Due to the seasonal nature of the behaviour, I will likely subset the data based on the seasons and then start to investigate the relationships. What are the different available methods and techniques for determining the relationship between one variable (x) and a number of other variables (a,b,c)? I am aware of the following possible methods, but interested in any comments/observations and if there are any more that i should also consider… Multiple linear (continuous dependent variable) regression. Must have linear relation between dependent and independent variables. Polynomial regression. Nonlinear. Logistic regression. Discrete dependent variable. Correlation. However, this is only for one variable vs another? Thank you for any advice. Edit 16.08.2021 My project is specifically looking at 'The relationship between ventilation practices, indoor air quality, noise and overheating, and their impact on health.' 3-minute video on my project here . Variable x is ventilation, which can be expressed as both a discrete variable (ventilation practices, window open for example) and as a continuous variable (air exchange rate). Other variables are (a,b,c etc): temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, PM1, PM2.5, PM10, (total) volatile organic compounds, noise, nitrogen dioxide. These are all continuous (measurements). A side note, is that I can also express the above variables as a rate of decay (for periods of decay). The relationships here are complex, as human behaviour is the main driving 'force' behind ventilation, by opening and closing windows for example. But human behaviour is also the main driver for the other variables - cooking for example can produce CO, CO2, NO2, VOC, PM etc. Vacuuming, burning candles, heating home, bathing etc all produce pollutants. My data comprises of 5 minute time-series data for all the variables above. But...the hypothesis is that there is a relationship between ventilation and the other variables (or the rate of decay of the other variables). So, I am looking at different ways to investigate this relationship in a number of big datasets (using Python). I am looking for advice on different methods for investigating this.
