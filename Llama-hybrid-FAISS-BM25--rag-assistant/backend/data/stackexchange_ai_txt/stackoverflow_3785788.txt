The only specified parameters for the Content-Disposition header field are filename , creation-date , modification-date , read-date , and size . You may use custom parameters (see ABNF of parameter syntax ), but they are will probably not be supported by user agents unless they are registered with the IANA. So, no, it is currently not possible to set access properties like read only .
