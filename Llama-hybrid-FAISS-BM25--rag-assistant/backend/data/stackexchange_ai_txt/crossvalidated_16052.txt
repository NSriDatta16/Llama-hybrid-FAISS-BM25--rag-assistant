What you are describing is not dimensionality reduction, but rather sampling. If your data is labeled (which I couldn't understand from your question), then most probably you would want to perform stratified sampling - a random sampling that ensures that each label is sampled with a probability that approximately equals to that in the original data set. See this Wikipedia article on sampling techniques. It provides a list of good reading material on this matter
