Struct initialization problem?

I'm using a struct like this: define struct _Fragment{ int a; char *seq; }Fragment; I want to initialize the struct, and using the malloc() method return a dynamic memory like this Fragment *frag=malloc(10*sizeof(Fragment)); Then I would using the frag pointer like this: frag->seq="01001"; Then the problem occurs when I returns a lot of Fragments. the error message said that (using valgrind tool): Uninitialised value was created by a heap allocation who can tell me how I can deal with it. thank you!
