Shouldn't you be assigning to $row here? $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($avg_result); $average = $row['AVG(rating)']; I'd also suggest using an alias when you are selecting the result of a function call: $avg_query = "SELECT AVG(rating) AS avg_rating FROM kicks WHERE userid='$userid'" ... $average = $row['avg_rating']; If this still doesn't give any result it is probably because: There are no rows in that table for that user. There is a row in that table where the rating is set to the value NULL. In the second case you can fix it by filtering out those rows: SELECT AVG(rating) AS avg_rating FROM kicks WHERE userid='$userid' AND rating IS NOT NULL
