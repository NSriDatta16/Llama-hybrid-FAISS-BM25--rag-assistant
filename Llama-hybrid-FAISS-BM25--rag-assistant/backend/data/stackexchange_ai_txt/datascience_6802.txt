Take the cluster centers and project them back to the original feature vector using the inverse transform of your PCA. That gives you an intuition of what the clusters represent. As a second step you can take all original feature vectors that were assigned to one cluster and calculate histograms on each feature dimension. This will give you a feeling of in-cluster variation and cluster boundaries along the original feature dimensions.
