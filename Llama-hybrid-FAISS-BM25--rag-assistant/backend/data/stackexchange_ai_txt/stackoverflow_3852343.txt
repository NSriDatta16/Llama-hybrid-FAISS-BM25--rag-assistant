Create Lists from Character String

Perhaps my brain is not working today but i cant figure out how to create a list from 2 character strings. I've currently got scale_lab [1] "Very Poor" "Poor" "Average" "Good" "Very Good" [6] "Don't Know" and scale_rep [1] "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "9" So what I want to do is combine the two into a list so that 1 = very poor, 2 = poor and so on.
