GUID is a bad choice for clustered index in SQL Server, since due to its randomness of values, the clustered index gets badly fragmented. Also, since the clustered index field(s) are replicated into each of the non-clustered indices, it can also lead to significant waste of disk and memory space in SQL Server. GUID is a great choice from a programmer's perspective - more or less random, almost guaranteed to be unique - but from a database perspective, using them as clustered index in SQL Server is very bad choice. See Kim Tripp's various articles on this - very englihtnening! http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/KIMBERLY/post/GUIDs-as-PRIMARY-KEYs-andor-the-clustering-key.aspx http://sqlskills.com/BLOGS/KIMBERLY/post/The-Clustered-Index-Debate-Continues.aspx http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/KIMBERLY/post/Ever-increasing-clustering-key-the-Clustered-Index-Debateagain!.aspx Marc
