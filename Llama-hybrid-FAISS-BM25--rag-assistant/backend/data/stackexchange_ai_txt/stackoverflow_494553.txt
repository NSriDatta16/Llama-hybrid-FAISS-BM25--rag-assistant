I could suggest you to use Java WebStart , which allow you specific the target J2SE version in the JNLP file. Or; always execute the right version "java.exe" under "Program Files" by absolute path. You don't have to set CLASSPATH for JRE (and should not in modern JRE). JRE have it own bootclasspath automatically. CLASSPATH is used by your application. Usually you won't have to set the JAVA_HOME unless your appliaction is looking for resources from JDK\lib\ (e.g. tools.jar which contains compiler) But I am not sure what's your problem. Are you running client application(swing)? Two Java processes to provide services? or two application sharing same Java application server?
