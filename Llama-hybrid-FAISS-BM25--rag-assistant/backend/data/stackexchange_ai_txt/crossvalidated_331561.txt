Can I incorporate differencing into a (Cox) survival model?

I am predicting college student dropout with a Cox model. I believe that a declining grade point average (GPA) is predictive of dropout, and I want to incorporate this into my model. I'm looking for something analogous to differencing in time series, where you create a new observation, $$y_t^{\prime} = y_{t} - y_{t-1} \ ,$$ from the previous observations. Higher order differencing like $y^{\prime \prime} = y^{\prime}_t - y^{\prime}_{t-1}$ may be helpful, but I do not know if it adds extra complications. Survival analysis is not my area of expertise, but I am familiar with many of the simpler methods, so references to good papers on the topic are appreciated. Toy data: # Generate data -------------------------------------- student = rep(1:3, each = 3) semester = rep(1:3, times = 3) GPA = c(4,3,2, 3.5, 4.0, 3.7, 2.1, 0, 3.1) dat = data.frame(student, semester, GPA) # Create lag ------------------------------- library("dplyr") dat %>% group_by(student) %>% mutate(GPA.diff = GPA - lag(GPA, n = 1)) I would like to use that new variable, GPA.diff, in my Cox regression as a time varying predictor.
