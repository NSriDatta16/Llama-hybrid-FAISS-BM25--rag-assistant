Storing dynamic form in a model

I want to build a system using Django that will allow users to build forms, store them and have their customers use them. I know how I can go about creating the forms dynamically but I'm looking for a good way to still use the form classes and handle many different user's dynamic forms in an elegant way. I'm thinking of storing the form field information as a dictionary in the db. Is there any way in django to re-interpret this dictionary back into a form object? Or do I have to write a routine that will simply interpret and build out a form in html myself? If someone knows where to point me to the info I'd really appreciate it.
