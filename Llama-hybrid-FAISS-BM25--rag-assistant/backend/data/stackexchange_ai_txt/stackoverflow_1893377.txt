Checking with HttpFox, I am not seeing further http requests - when clicking around - for your background images after the initial load. If I hit "refresh" then the images are reloaded. I think this is correct and what you'd expect. However be aware that reloading of a page and its assets like images, css etc on a page refresh is dependent on both response headers and any over-rides for these specified in your browser/plugin tools. Take a look at pragma: no-cache and W3C Cache-Control (Section 14.9) Edit: With firebug on, I am seeing reloads when I click around. This is presumably an artefact of Firebug. Turn off firebug and you wont have the reloads.
