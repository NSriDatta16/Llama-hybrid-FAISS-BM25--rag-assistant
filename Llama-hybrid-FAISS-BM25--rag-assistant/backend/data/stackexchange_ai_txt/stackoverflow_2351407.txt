I don't see how being web-based will affect things, so long as the web server has access to the LDAP directory - you'd use classes under javax.naming . If you want to access a directory which the browser has access to but not the web server, you'll need to write code to run on the client instead - possible a JNLP application with appropriate access to make network connections.
