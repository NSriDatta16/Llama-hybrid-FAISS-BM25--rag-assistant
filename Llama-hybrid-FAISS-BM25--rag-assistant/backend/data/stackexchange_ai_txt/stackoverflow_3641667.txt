How do I set attributes in an ActiveRecord Callback?

this seems like a really simple Question...but behold :) Geek name:string Laser geek_id:integer, power:integer Geek has_one :Laser end Laser belongs_to :Geek end simple enough, right? Now I want to create the laser, after a geek gets created, so the new Geek Model looks like this Geek has_one :laser after_create :create_laser end This works really nice, but I also like to pass a default value for the power attribute of the laser, so how do I do that? after_create :create_laser(:power => 5000) doesn't work :( but it looks nice :) does anyone have a nice and elegant solution for this?
