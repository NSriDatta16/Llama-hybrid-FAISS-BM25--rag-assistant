What criteria should I take into consideration when allowing users to enter rich text on my website?

I've worked with several different types of "user-generated content" sites: wikis, a message board, blogs... These systems can differ greatly: a blog post editor allows more control over presentation than that for comments on the blog post, a wiki topic editor encourages wiki links over raw URLs, etc. However, one key design decision is common to each: should I provide the user with a simplified markup language such as Wikitext, Markdown or BBCode, forcing users to learn that, or should I give them a WYSIWYG editor like CKEdit or TinyMCE and filter or transform the resulting HTML behind the scenes? There was a time when I thought this was a simple matter of identifying my intended audience: tech-minded users get markup, non-technical get WYSIWYG. In practice, this hasn't worked out all that well, occasional users struggling with markup and the WYSIWYG editors providing at best a leaky abstraction for the underlying HTML. So with my initial confidence throughly crushed, I come looking for advice: What factors should I be taking into account when making this decision? Have simple markup systems become commonplace enough that I can rely on most users having at least some familiarity with them? ...Or should I abandon them as merely a relic of the past, and work on finding ways to make WYSIWYG work more effectively...? I'm not looking to go back and tear apart what I've already done. For better or worse, these systems are working, their few users comfortable or at least competent by now. But it would be nice to have some better guidelines when putting together future designs.
