Relying on SPSS is quite limiting. If both Y and the Xs are ordinal and the Xs contain more than 3 categories there is only one completely satisfactory solution in my opinion. Use a Bayesian ordinal semiparametric regression model (and here ) in a way that also takes into account the ordinal nature of the Xs. This is elegantly implemented in the R brms package as described here . See also this . In brms if an R variable is an ordered factor I think the fitting function automatically handles the ordinal nature of the predictor. The principled approach to handling ordinal Xs makes full use of the X ordering and does not require a degree of freedom to be spent for each X category. It is roughly described as follows: Assign an indicator variable to each level of each ordinal X other than the first level. Use a Bayesian prior using the outside information about ordinality of Xs by penalizing the regression coefficients of each indicator variable to make the effect monotonic (ever increasing or ever decreasing over levels of that X). Examples: a binary predictor (which is also ordinal) will get a whole parameter (effectively one d.f.) an ordinal predictor with 3 levels will get 2 parameters but their standard errors will be smaller because of the ordinal (monotonicity) restriction; the effective d.f. might be 1.4. an ordinal predictor with 20 levels will get 19 parameters but might have an effective d.f. of 3.3. Predicted values as you increase the values of one X will be monotonic in that X. Bayesian inference will be exact (no approximations to the likelihood function and no approximations related to the penalization to ordinality). This is the only approach I know that fully respects the ordinal nature of X and that requires no arbitrary metric to represent X.
