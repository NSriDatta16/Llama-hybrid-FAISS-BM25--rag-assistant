jsTest can be run command line or as an eclipse plugin. However, be careful, you will not get 100% code coverage using a tool like this if you need to support multiple browsers. Each browser implements JavaScript differently (i.e.: IE). Therefore, the only way to fully test your JavaScript is to run the tests in all browsers that you support.
