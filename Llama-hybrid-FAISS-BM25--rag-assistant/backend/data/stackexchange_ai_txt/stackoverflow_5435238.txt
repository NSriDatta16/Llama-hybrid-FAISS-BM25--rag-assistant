data.table and character vectors

In my work, I often refer to lists of variables as just one character vector. A Whenever possible, I want to use vecvar rather than enumerate the variables, as this makes my code more robust to future applications to slightly different lists of variables. I recently discovered data.table , and as much as I love the general elegance of the syntax and the efficiency gains, I find that it clashes a bit with my inclination outlined above. Indeed, A[, vecvar] won't work. I am undecided as to the best way to work around this. A[, vecvar, with=F] will work, but is not always convenient (e.g. A[, list(vecvar, var1+var2), with=F] won't work). A[, sapply(vecvar, get)] won't work, though A[, sapply(vecvar, function(x) get(x))] will. I am not stuck, as I have ways to deal with it -- I just want to know what the best way to work with this is, before I pick up bad habits!
