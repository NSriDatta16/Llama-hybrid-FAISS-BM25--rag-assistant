vi editor query

I use vi quite often to edit files. Usually I need the file to appear on screen with line numbers. For this I do set nu in edit mode. What a drag! Can I automate this? Is there any way where vi will directly open the file with line numbers visible immediately? If so, are there any other tips that will make my experience with vi more efficient? FYI, I don't have Vim.
