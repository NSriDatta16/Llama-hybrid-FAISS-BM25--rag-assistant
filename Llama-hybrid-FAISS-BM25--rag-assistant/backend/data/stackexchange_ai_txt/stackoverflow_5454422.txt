Creating a MIPS machine in Java/C/C++

Hey everyone I'm in an Assembly Language and Computer Organization class. Recently I got an assignment that requires that I create a program that emulates a MIPS machine in Java, C, or C++. The program reads hex from a ASM file and stores the lines in an array. Then it is supposed to emulate the MIPS machine. I've been searching all around but have no idea how to even start. Does anyone have some ideas or even pseudo-code to get me on the right path? An example of the file to be read: 24080019 2409001e 240a0023 01094020 010a4020 00082021 If anyone can just get me started down the right path that would be fantastic, thanks!
