If you can force your users into IE (can't believe I'm suggesting use of IE!) you can do this trick. Try running this from the command line "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" -k This will force IE into kiosk (or full screen mode), similar to pressing F11 when in a usual browser session. PS. I agree with the other answers suggesting this should be discouraged but there are instances (such as when the end user really can't be trusted) that this is a good solution.
