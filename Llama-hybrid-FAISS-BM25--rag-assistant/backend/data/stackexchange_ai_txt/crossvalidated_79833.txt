PACF and ACF for AR and MA

I once heard the following statement: The PACF (partial autocorrelation function) for MA processes behaves much like the ACF for AR processes; the PACF for AR processes behaves much like the PACF for AR processes. How to understand the logic underlying this statement? In addition to the strict mathematical proof, are there any approaches to understand this statement, the inherent relationship of AR, MA along with their PACF/ACF, from time series properties, statistics, or any other high-level thoughts?
