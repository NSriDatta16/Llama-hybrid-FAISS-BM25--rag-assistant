How to calculate the area of a polygon on the earth's surface using python?

The title basically says it all. I need to calculate the area inside a polygon on the Earth's surface using Python. Calculating area enclosed by arbitrary polygon on Earth's surface says something about it, but remains vague on the technical details: If you want to do this with a more "GIS" flavor, then you need to select an unit-of-measure for your area and find an appropriate projection that preserves area (not all do). Since you are talking about calculating an arbitrary polygon, I would use something like a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection. Set the origin/center of the projection to be the center of your polygon, project the polygon to the new coordinate system, then calculate the area using standard planar techniques. So, how do I do this in Python?
