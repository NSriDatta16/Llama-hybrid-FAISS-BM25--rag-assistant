For the record, I posted a similar question to the Stan users mailing list, which you can find here . I was answered by one of the authors of the original PSIS-LOO paper and by other contributors of Stan. What follows is my personal summary. The short answer is that there are no known general methods to prevent PSIS-LOO from failing. If PSIS-LOO fails, it is usually because the model has issues , and fixing it is necessarily left to the user. Specifically, the reason why PSIS-LOO may fail is usually because one or more LOO distributions are shifted and/or broader than the full posterior, likely due to influential observations, and the importance sampling distribution collapses to one or a few points. I was thinking that you could try to adopt some form of parallel posterior tempering approach to solve this issue. The idea is not necessarily wrong, but it was pointed out to me that: textbook posterior tempering would still require a lot of case-by-case fiddling to find the right temperature level(s), as there is no obvious nor known way to do that (incidentally, for this reason Stan does not include parallel tempering); if you use more than two temperature levels (as it may be required to have a robust approach), the final computational cost approaches that of K-fold cross validation, or of running MCMC on the problematic LOO distributions. In short, if PSIS-LOO fails, it seems to be hard to get a method that is as robust and general as other simple patches; that's why Vehtari, Gelman & Gabry suggested those methods as per the quote I posted in my original question.
