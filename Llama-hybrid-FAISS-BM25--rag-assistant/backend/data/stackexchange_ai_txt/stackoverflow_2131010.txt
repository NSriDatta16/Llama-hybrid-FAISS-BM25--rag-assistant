You're concatenating the strings and then trying to convert that one result into a double. So for results of 75.6, 92.1, 56.3 78.2 and 72.3 you'd end up trying to parse "75.692.156.378.272.3". Parse each value and then sum them. However, I would strongly recommend that you use decimal for this instead of double . You should also consider using TryParse instead of Parse so that you can handle user input errors gracefully. Here's the solution sticking with Parse : public decimal AveragePercentage() { decimal sum = decimal.Parse(tbEnglish.Text) + decimal.Parse(tbUrdu.Text) + decimal.Parse(tbPhysics.Text) + decimal.Parse(tbChemistry.Text) + decimal.Parse(tbMaths.Text); return sum / 5m; } Out of interest, in your original code why are you dividing by 500 and then multiplying by 100? Why not just divide by 5 (as mine does now that I've noticed what was going on)? As a side note, it's very important to differentiate between compile-time errors and execution-time errors. It wasn't the compiler saying that the input string wasn't in the correct format - it was the Convert.ToDouble method, at execution time. In this case it was relatively obvious, but in other situations we could have been chasing our tails for a while trying to find a compile-time problem when it was actually failing at execution time.
