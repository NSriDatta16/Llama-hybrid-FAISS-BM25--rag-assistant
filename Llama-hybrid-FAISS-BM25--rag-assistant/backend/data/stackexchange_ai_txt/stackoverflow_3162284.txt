USB modem device software in cisco routers using C

HI all, I am a final year computer science student; my project for final year is to develop a software using C or Tcl, for a CISCO router. In the latest series of routers, cisco has given a USB port for mass storage. Now I want that if I plug-in a wireless modem like Idea netsetter (a modem available in India with this name), the router should connect to the internet. Tell me any basic ideas regarding this project. Also, if there is any other language in which it can be developed more easily, please suggest.
