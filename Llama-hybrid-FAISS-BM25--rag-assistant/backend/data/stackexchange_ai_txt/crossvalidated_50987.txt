Building the dataset for Random Forest training procedure

I should use the bagging ( bootstrap aggregating ) technique in order to train a random forest classifier. I read here the description of this learning technique, but I have not figured out how I initially organize the dataset. Currently I first load all the positive examples and immediately after the negative ones. Moreover, positive examples are less than half of the negative ones, so by sampling from the dataset uniformly, the probability of obtaining a negative example is greater than that of obtaining a positive example. How should I build the initial dataset? Should I shuffle the initial dataset containing positive and negative examples?
