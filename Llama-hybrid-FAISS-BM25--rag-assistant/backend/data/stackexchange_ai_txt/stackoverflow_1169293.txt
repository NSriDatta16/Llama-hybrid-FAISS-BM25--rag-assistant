The fields pragma was an interesting experiment, but in my opinion, a failed one. It's most useful feature, compile time checking of attribute hash keys, was removed in 5.10. There are a number of decent class composition modules on CPAN, as well as the heavyweight but steadily growing in popularity Moose ("A postmodern object system for Perl 5"). That said, if you wanted to make an effort to add multiple inheritance support, it would probably be welcomed; note that fields is now maintained independently from perl as part of the "base" distribution . You'd have to make it work with both the pseudohash based (pre-5.9.0) and restricted hash based (5.9.0+) implementations, though.
