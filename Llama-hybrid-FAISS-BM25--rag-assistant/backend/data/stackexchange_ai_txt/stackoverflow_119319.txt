Changing the filename will work. But that's not usually the simplest solution. An HTTP cache-control header of 'no-cache' doesn't always work, as you've noticed. The HTTP 1.1 spec allows wiggle-room for user-agents to decide whether or not to request a new copy. (It's non-intuitive if you just look at the names of the directives. Go read the actual HTTP 1.1 spec for cache ... it makes a little more sense in context.) In a nutshell, if you want iron-tight cache-control use Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate in your response headers.
