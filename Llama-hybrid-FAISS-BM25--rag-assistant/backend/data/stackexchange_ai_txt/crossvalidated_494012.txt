I think it might be helpful to recast the problem (and change the notation slightly) in order to focus on the Bayesian framework and avoid confusion with the frequentist framework. Suppose there are two possible models for how an observation is generated: $M_1$ and $M_2$ . (There is no notion of null and alternative: there are just two models.) Given an observation $y$ , what is the probability it was generated by $M_1$ ? The answer is provided by Bayes rule: \begin{equation} p(M_1|y) = \frac{p(y|M_1)\,p(M_1)}{p(y|M_1)\,p(M_1) + p(y|M_2)\,p(M_2)} . \end{equation} Note that $p(y|M_i)$ is the value of a density ; it is not a tail probability such a a $p$ -value. So if $y \sim \chi_{2K}^2$ according to $M_1$ , then \begin{equation} p(y|M_1) = \textsf{Chi-square}(y|2K) = \frac{1}{2^K\,\Gamma(K)}\,y^{K-1}\,e^{-y/2} . \end{equation} The analyst must specify the two remaining components: the prior model probabilities $p(M_i)$ and the distribution for the observation given the other model $p(y|M_2)$ . The prior model probabilities $p(M_i)$ cannot (and must not) be computed from the current observation $y$ . They are derived from "non-sample" information, which includes what has be learned from other experiments. You must say what they are. You must also specify $M_2$ . In the Bayesian framework, it takes a model to beat a model. It is not sufficient to say " $M_2$ is not $M_1$ ". It is possible that $M_2$ is quite complicated, being (for example) and average of a number of sub-models. That's fine; but in the end you must be able to say what the density $p(y|M_2)$ is. You might simulate $y$ according to $M_2$ and use a kernel density approach to approximate $p(y|M_2)$ . One way or another you must come up with $M_2$ and $p(y|M_2)$ . One final comment: The posterior odds ratio can be expressed as the Bayes factor (BF) times the prior odds ratio: \begin{equation} \frac{p(M_1|y)}{p(M_2|y)} = \underbrace{\frac{p(y|M_1)}{p(y|M_2)}}_{\text{BF}} \times \frac{p(M_1)}{p(M_2)} . \end{equation} This expression shows the contributions of the sample information and non-sample information. The Bayes factor is the ratio of two densities. You can compute it without saying what the prior model probabilities are.
