Is your class myObj Serializable? From experience if it's not then no error will be thrown it simply isn't added to IsolatedStorage. You can use the DataContract and DataMember attributes in your class to enable this as follows. [DataContract] public class myObj { [DataMember] public string Name { get; set; } [DataMember] public string Id { get; set; } [DataMember] public string Phone { get; set; }
