Forcing to download a file using PHP

I have a CSV file on my server. If a user clicks on a link it should download, but instead it opens up in my browser window. My code looks as follows Click here to download an example of the "CSV" file It's a normal webserver where I have all of my development work on. I tried something like: Click here to download an example of the "CSV" file Now the contents of my csv.php file: header('Content-Type: application/csv'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=example.csv'); header('Pragma: no-cache'); Now my issue is it's downloading, but not my CSV file. It creates a new file.
