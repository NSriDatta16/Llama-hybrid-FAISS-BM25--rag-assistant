Try this.. Query all city with state, order by state first then by city: SELECT id, alphaname, state FROM regional ORDER BY state ASC, alphaname ASC Organise your dataset into 2 dimension array: $states = array(); while($thearray = mysql_fetch_array($list)) { $states[$thearray[state]][$thearray[id]] = $thearray[alphaname]; } Now contents of your $states should look something like: Array ( [AK] => Array ( [id_1] = Anchorage [id_2] = Juneau ) [CA] => Array ( [id_3] = Los Angeles [id_4] = San Diego [id_5] = San Francisco ) ) Generate your HTML presentation: NOTE: Add anchor to reflect proposed question. foreach($states as $state_name => $cities) { echo ' '.$state_name.' '; echo ' '; foreach($cities as $id => $city_name) { echo ' '.$city_name.' '; } echo ' '; }
