Detecting structural breaks in multivariate time series data

I have a dataset of daily sales data (day 1 to day 365) with a number of factors influencing sales. I would like to identify structural breaks in sales data to group them in a sensible manner (day 1 to 60, day 61 to 200, etc) based on a) only univariate time series excluding features b) including features. The groupings should be meaningful, so not a black box model! I would like to this analysis in R as I don't have SAS or STATA or Python at work place. We have a total of 3000 stores globally, so need an approach that is scalable. We only plan to do this exercise once every 6 months, so not too concerned about time it takes to run.
