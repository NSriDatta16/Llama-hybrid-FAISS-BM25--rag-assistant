Robust estimator of parameters of a mixture distribution

I have a random variable taking one of three values in a arithmetic progression, $a$, $a+b$, $a+2b$, with probabilities $1/4,1/2,1/4$, where $b\approx 0.5a$ to $2a$. It is perturbed by a little noise (say Gaussian with deviation equal to a tenth of $a$), and there can be a small proportion of outliers, say $10\%$. I would like to build a robust estimator of $a$ and $b$ from a sample of $N$ values, where $N$ is of the order of $50$. I could for instance try and find three modes in the histogram, then classify the values by assigning them to the closest mode and estimate the class averages. I also assume that the median would be a good estimator of $a+b$. (And the distribution of $|v-\overline{a+b}|$ would be bimodal.) Can you advise an approach for $b$ ? Following the comments by @whuber, I can recast the question as estimating the means of a three membered Gaussian mixture, knowing that these means are equidistant, the variances are equal and there is a good separation between the members (but a few outliers).
