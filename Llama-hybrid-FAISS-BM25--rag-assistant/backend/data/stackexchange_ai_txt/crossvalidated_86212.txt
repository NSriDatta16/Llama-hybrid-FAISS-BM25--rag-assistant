Best data series to teach time series econometrics?

I will be teaching a short course on time-series econometrics to third-year undergraduates. It will be part theoretical, part applied (students using econometrics software). I am looking for great examples of data series which will fascinate (inspire?!) the students and engage them with time series econometrics. Topics of the course will include: Autoregressive models Autoregressive distributed lag models Non-stationarity (basic unit root testing) Engle-Granger type cointegration analysis Structural breaks Have you come across great example data sets with interesting properties and interpretations that you can recommend for some of the above applications? I would much appreciate it! Thank you!
