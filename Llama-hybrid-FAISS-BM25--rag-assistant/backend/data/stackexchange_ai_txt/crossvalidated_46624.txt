Generally speaking, the "nonparametric" in Bayesian nonparametrics refers to models with an infinite number of (potential) parameters. There are a lot of really nice tutorials and lectures on the subject on videolectures.net ( like this one ) which give nice overviews of this class of models. Specifically, the Gaussian Process (GP) is considered nonparametric because a GP represents a function (i.e. an infinite dimensional vector). As the number of data points increases ((x, f(x)) pairs), so do the number of model 'parameters' (restricting the shape of the function). Unlike a parametric model, where the number of parameters stay fixed with respect to the size of the data, in nonparametric models, the number of parameters grows with the number of data points.
