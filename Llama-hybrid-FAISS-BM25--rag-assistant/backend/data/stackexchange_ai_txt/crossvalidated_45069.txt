Multinomial regression with categorical choice and predictos and factor analysis

I have a non-ordinal categorical dependent variable with 3 choice outcomes and 20 ordinal categorical predictors and want to do a multinomial logistic regression. However, I want to reduce the predictors to just a few variables with factor analysis. SPSS gives regression factor scores as variables for each of my cases. Do I replace my original 20 predictors with these 5 regression factor score variables, or do the factors need to be on another format before using them as predictors?
