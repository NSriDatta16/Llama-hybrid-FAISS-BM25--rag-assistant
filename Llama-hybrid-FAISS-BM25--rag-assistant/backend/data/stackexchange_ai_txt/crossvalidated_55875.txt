No, a sample cannot be too large for an ANOVA or a t-test. You will almost invariably get statistically significant results because you have a great deal of power; however, this does not mean that you detect differences that are false. Indeed, regardless of how many cases you have, an effect that does not exist will not become significant. This is a common misconception. A lot of power means that you might detect differences that are almost meaningless in terms of size, however. For example, maybe you find that two races are on average of different heights, but the difference is only half a millimetre. Make sure to interpret the effect size associated with your statistical test. In this case, the p value is worth less than the effect size (as it often is)!
