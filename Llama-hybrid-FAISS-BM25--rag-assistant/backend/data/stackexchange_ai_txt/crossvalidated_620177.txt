The definitions you mention are imprecise and wrong. Others already commented on this, so I won't be repeating what was said just add my three cents. One can say that a prediction model is one that you obtain an equation to predict values. In such a case, every SVM or neural network is a prediction model, because they produce "equations to predict values". Moreover, the same applies to many other models like the naive Bayes algorithm, but even something like a decision tree may be rewritten as a complicated equation. Under this definition every machine learning model is a prediction model.
