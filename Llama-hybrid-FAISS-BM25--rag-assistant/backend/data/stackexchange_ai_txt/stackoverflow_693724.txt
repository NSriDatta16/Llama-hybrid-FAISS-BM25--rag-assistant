Renaming .cpp files to .mm would mean they'll be treated as Objective-C++ code rather than C++ code. I don't think that'd be a good idea, even if it should still work. Besides, FreeType is written in C, not C++. Google for "compiler linker" and you'll find quite a few documents on how they work. That should help for documentation. It's entirely possible to compile static libraries for the iPhone; what you can't do is compile dynamic libraries or frameworks - you could, but it's not encouraged. Open your project In the source/target browser, select the "Targets" node (with the little red and white target icon). Right-click on the node, and in the popup menu select "Add", followed by "New Target". A dialog opens. On the left hand side, there's an iPhone OS and a Mac OS X section. The iPhone OS section should already be selected; if not do so. You should have three choices of targets, one of it is a static library. Select it, click OK. Give the library a name in the next page. Click finish. Your "Targets" node has includes a child for your static library now. You can add sources either via the file menu, or by dragging it onto the "Compile Sources" child node. Hope that helps.
