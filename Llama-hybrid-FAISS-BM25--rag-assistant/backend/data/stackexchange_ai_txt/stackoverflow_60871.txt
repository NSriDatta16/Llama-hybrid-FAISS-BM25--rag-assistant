How to solve Memory Fragmentation

We've occasionally been getting problems whereby our long-running server processes (running on Windows Server 2003) have thrown an exception due to a memory allocation failure. Our suspicion is these allocations are failing due to memory fragmentation. Therefore, we've been looking at some alternative memory allocation mechanisms that may help us and I'm hoping someone can tell me the best one: 1) Use Windows Low-fragmentation Heap 2) jemalloc - as used in Firefox 3 3) Doug Lea's malloc Our server process is developed using cross-platform C++ code, so any solution would be ideally cross-platform also (do *nix operating systems suffer from this type of memory fragmentation?). Also, am I right in thinking that LFH is now the default memory allocation mechanism for Windows Server 2008 / Vista?... Will my current problems "go away" if our customers simply upgrade their server os?
