I found and am using a different approach now, more RCP-ish IMHO. I define a fragment to override the database props and replacing a dummy query file in the host plug-in. Then i define two features - one for the testing with the fragment, and the production feature without the fragment. And then use the features in different products - one for production, one for testing. Works fine
