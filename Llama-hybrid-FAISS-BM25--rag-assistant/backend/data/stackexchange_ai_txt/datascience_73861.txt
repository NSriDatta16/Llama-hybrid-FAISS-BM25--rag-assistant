Machine learning on classifying speech

So, I have 9k of 1 second wav files of a person speaking. These are labeled by whether the person speaking is wearing a face mask or not. I am supposed to come up with a machine learning model to classify these criteria. So far I tried using KNN on the mfcc feature of the audio. This gets around 56% accuracy on test data. I also tried to convert the wav files to jpg spectograms and apply a CNN. This one gets 60% accuracy on test data. But I don't have that much experience, I am not sure which features of audio would best help to this problem. Also, if you could recommend a machine learning model for this particular problem.
