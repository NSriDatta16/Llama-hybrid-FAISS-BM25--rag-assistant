Keeping models as simple as possible(but not too simple) is very important. There is absolutely no proof that one should incorporate seasonal differencing into a reasonable model for your data. Some analysts believe that complicated models will yield higher consulting fees. Differencing is a form of a transformation(complication) and like other transformations (drugs/alcohol) can have consequences. Early references (before Intervention Detection ala http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf ) not being aware of the need for seasonal pulses often incorporated seasonal AR or seasonal differencing when a few seasonal indicators night be sufficient. The ACF of the original series is devoid of any need for seasonal differencing. The acf of lag 12 is induced by a few months have year-to-year similarities BUT this is atypical as only three months exhibit similarities (March +22, April +12 and August +35). . A useful model which includes 3 seasonal pulses and 3 pulse effects (one-time only) is as follows. . The acf of the residuals suggests sufficiency which is visually supported by a plot of the residuals . The actual/fit and forecast plot is as follows which provides forecasts that are much more pleasing to my eye than others presented here. Note that my forecasts for Y are based upon the expected X for next year using the most recent year's values as a typical baseline. Different forecasts for X will translate into different forecasts for Y. . Notice that the forecast pattern for AUTOBOX and auto.arima are "somewhat similar but have a different level". Also note the "false forecast" of a high July next year from auto.arima as it believes the July 1992 value as the basis rather than challenging the 1992/7 value as being exceptional as AUTOBOX does. AUTOBOX senses that July 1992 is significantly higher than expectations (52 versus 21 and 33 for prior two years) thus contains an an "outlier" by a magnitude of +22.8623 . Adjusting that July value by subtracting 22.8623 yields a forecast that is not flawed by the unusual. In contrast the values for August are 22 and for the last two years a confirming 62 and 65 thus the estimated August effect is a plus 35.698. In the absence of an ARIMA effect the adjustment for August would have been [(62+65)/2] -22 or 41.5 . Finally software availability often limits what some researchers can do or even know about what can be done as they personally don't have access to innovative methods. The advantage of Stack_Exchange is the free openness and exchange of ideas and approaches. The example comes from the 1982 book by Abraham and Ledolter. http://tinyurl.com/mxurcxy See page 70 where they analyze this time series. They find that there are lag effects of advertising while auto.arima does not. Notice that AUTOBOX includes an AR(1) structure for the noise which translates to a lag structure on both Y and X thus generally supporting the textbook solution of lagged dependence. The problem with auto.arima is that if you don't treat the anomalies the error variance is enlarged thus the necessary AR structure is missed due to the downward bias in the acf as the acf is partially based on the (inflated) error variance. To answer Whuber's question I present here exactly how the forecast is made for time period 37 .
