I believe there's nothing you can do at the moment to fix this issue. The /_ah/ URL path is reserved for features that you typically cannot modify. In this specific case you can't add the P3P headers embedding the "Compact Policy" that IE needs to work. My suggestions are pretty simple: File a new issue asking for this feature Switch to a self-made OpenId solution (a la Tipfy for example)
