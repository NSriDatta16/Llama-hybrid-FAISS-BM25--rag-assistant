Sample size calculation for estimating 0 probability in finite sample binary data

Nuclear storage containers were deposited some 20 years ago. Some may have a special plastisol coating left in place in areas which are to be welded. The plastisol was used for temporary storage/protection and was intended to be completely removed prior to welding. We don't have any confirmation that it was completely removed. We have a population of 29 containers. What sample size will we need to determine (yes or no) was any platisol left in-place on any of the 29?
