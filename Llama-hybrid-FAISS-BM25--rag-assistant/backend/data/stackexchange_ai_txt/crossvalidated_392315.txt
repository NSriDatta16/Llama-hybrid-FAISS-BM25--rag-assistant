Generating vector image from a hand drawn picture. Machine Learning

I am new to machine learning! I need a way to generate vector image out of hand drawn sketch. I dont need to trace bitmap like it is usally done because it gives you exactly what you drawn. I need to generate "simplified" drawing. eg. When human hand draws something with strait lines, the lines are not true. When a human writes a text I want it to be recognised as such and converted to some existing font that best matches the text. I would like somone to just guide mo to where and about what should I start research! Thanks very much !
