Outliers in a PCA score plot

I have this dataset of 104 tissue samples from two different types of tumors (B and C) along and 182 observations (gene expression profile). I do not need to understand the underlying biological theory for this but I do have to carry out a PCA to see if I can reduce the data to make reading it easier. I standardized the data first and carried out my PCA. Having done so, I got the following score plot: I noticed the 6 samples not grouped together and using factoextra , I was able to find out which samples these are: ind I then opened the data frame and sorted according to highest contribution to PC1 first and found out that samples 71 to 76 (which are all C type tumors) are the, for lack of a better word, outliers. What can I do from here? What steps can I take and what inference can be made from this? I can't just remove them from my dataset as it would completely change the analysis.
