Hypothesis testing: Frequentist vs Bayesian

I'm performing some A/B split testing. Typically, I use a pairwise proportion test to determine if the difference between Control and Treatment(s) is statistically significant. I am researching Bayesian analysis on this topic. Specifically, I'm using bayes.prop.test from the Bayesian First Aid package in R. As an example, a test I did compared Control with 2 Treatments. The chi-squared test returns a p-value of 0.351 so we fail to reject the null. The Bayesian analysis, though, will suggest that the Treatment 1 has a 87% and 90% probability of being less than the Control and Treatment 2, respectively. I would say that saying something has close to a 90% probability is significant and so I feel the Bayes test is more compelling. My first question is do you agree with my thought process about the strength of the Bayesian inference? Secondly, should I expect this to always happen when performing both tests? I ask because if the answer is yes, it seems somewhat pointless to use both.
