How to use principal components as predictors in GLM?

How would I use the output of a principal components analysis (PCA) in a generalized linear model (GLM), assuming the PCA is used for variable selection for the GLM? Clarification: I want to use PCA to avoid using correlated variables in the GLM. However, PCA gives me output like .2*variable1+.5*variable3 etc. I'm used to just putting variables 1 and 3 into the GLM. So since PCA gives me a linear combination, should I for example put that into the GLM as a new variable (to account for systematic variation in the response by variables 1 and 3)?
