As with any software engineering practice there is never one definitive solution to any situation. So you should never rule out static methods , static classes and singletons. The aim of TDD is to make your life easier, and you will notice that as you work more with TDD your code will be modular which means even if you are using static methods (... etc) your code will still be testable. Rule I like to live by is : Use anything you want as long as your code is easily readable and your design is elegant. How you achieve these 2 is up to you. Heck you might as well use GOTOs if you still can deliver elegant code.
