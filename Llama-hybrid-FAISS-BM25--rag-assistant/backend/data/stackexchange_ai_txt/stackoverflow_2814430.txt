You can tell Make to ignore the error by putting a '-' at the beginning of the command (after the tab). If this were your own code I'd advise you not to ignore a symptom, but I'm guessing you don't want to debug this code. You say that you can compile rtmp_wext.o with a forest of warnings. I agree with derobert's comment; there may well be an error in there. If there is then there's no guarantee that rtmp_wext.o will actually work, and whether it works or not you should find the error message and tell whoever wrote the driver.
