How to 'transform' a String object (containing XML) to an element on an existing JSP page

Currently, I have a String object that contains XML elements: String carsInGarage = garage.getCars(); I now want to pass this String as an input/stream source (or some kind of source), but am unsure which one to choose and how to implement it. Most of the solutions I have looked at import the package: javax.xml.transform and accept a XML file (stylerXML.xml) and output to a HTML file (outputFile.html) (See code below). try { TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = tFactory.newTransformer(new StreamSource("styler.xsl")); transformer.transform(new StreamSource("stylerXML.xml"), new StreamResult(new FileOutputStream("outputFile.html"))); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } I want to accept a String object and output (using XSL) to a element within an existing JSP page. I just don't know how to implement this, even having looked at the code above. Can someone please advise/assist. I have searched high and low for a solution, but I just can't pull anything out.
