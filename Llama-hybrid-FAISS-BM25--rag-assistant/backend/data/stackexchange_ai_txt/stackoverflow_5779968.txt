Here's another vbscript implementation of quicksort. This is the in-place, unstable approach as defined in wikipedia (see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort ). Uses much less memory (original implementation requires upper and lower temporary storage arrays to be created upon every iteration, which can increase memory size by n terms in the worst case). For ascending order, switch the signs. If you want to sort characters, use Asc(ch) function. '------------------------------------- ' quicksort ' Carlos Nunez, created: 25 April, 2010.
