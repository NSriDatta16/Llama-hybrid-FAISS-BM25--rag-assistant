The code related to your problem should be a little bit modified as follows: estimates So you don't double-count weights, and you don't assign the wrong weight to a given component: in other words, you don't assign the weight $w_i$ to the sample $x_j$ for $j \neq i$ . You'll get the following histogram: Now, as you can see and as we might expect, the distribution of averages is slightly skewed to the right. In your previous graph, the distribution is perfectly symmetrical, as if the weighted mean distribution converged to a normal distribution, which does not conform to the "classical" central limit theorem, see this topic .
