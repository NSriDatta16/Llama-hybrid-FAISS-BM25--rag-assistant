Not exactly what I wanted, but I found a workaround. In Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede), go to Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Content Assist and check the checkbox for Use static imports (only 1.5 or higher) . This will not bring in the import on an Optimize Imports, but if you do a Quick Fix ( CTRL + 1 ) on the line it will give you the option to add the static import which is good enough.
