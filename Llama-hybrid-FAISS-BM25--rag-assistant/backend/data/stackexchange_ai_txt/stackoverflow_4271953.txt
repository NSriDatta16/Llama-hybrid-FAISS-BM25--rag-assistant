What is the best programming language for operationalizing research questions with large data sets?

I have completed my graduate public policy program but it was not at all tech heavy - some economics and econometrics but not requiring any CS knowledge. A good portion of the research jobs in DC require a basic level of programming knowledge. Mostly they want people who can perform advanced search and retrieval functions with large datasets and save stuff in different formats within their servers. And, they want STATA/stats knowledge, which I have some of. My question is this: where is the best place to start learning some programming to get to this level? For instance, is Java, SQL, VBA or something else the best thing and most useful for these purposes? And, how much math do I need to write and run simple requests? Thanks
