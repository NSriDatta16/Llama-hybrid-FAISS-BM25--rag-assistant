The most straight forward solution is to open the document in Word and access the object model. This is traditionally done using VBA, but you can also use .NET (e.g. C# og VB.NET) by using VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office). Personally I find C#/VB.NET much better languages than VBA. Once you have access to the object model you will have to enumerate paragraphs in the document. When you find a heading (perhaps defined by the style) you will have to figure out the formatting of the heading.
