There's also Yahoo YUI (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) though I believe they only host YUI itself. Make sure you pay attention to Michael Safyan's answer, too - who you're willing to trust with your users' code should be a carefully made decision. Beyond that, if you're looking for generic JS hosting you should make sure you really need it - a minified version of jQuery or MooTools is incredibly tiny, and shouldn't make any real difference either to your server's CPU usage or bandwidth expenditure. It also doesn't meaningfully affect the maintainability of your HTML or JS, and it introduces another point of failure in your implementation.
