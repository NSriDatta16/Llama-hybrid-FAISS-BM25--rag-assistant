Time Series, Point Detection Python

I have time series data generated from the sensor. Now I know the the actual point I need to find is at the 11:50, as you can see in the graph this point dooes not hold any statistical property which I can give to detect this point. Any idea how to find this point as process is getting completed at this point? What library or the algorithm I should use to find this point in time series? The data I have provided is the historical data, I need to provide this data to algorithm, which can detect such point when streaming data is given to this algortihm. I needed any ideas hoe can I build this algorithm for the point to detected. enter image description here
