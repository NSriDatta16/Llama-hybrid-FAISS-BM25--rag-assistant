You've probably lost the hidden ".svn" folders used to keep track of changes. Tortoise has an "export" feature. Right-click-and-drag the top level of you modified project to a safe place, choose "Export all here" from the menu. The check your project out again to a new location, and drop the exported copy on top of it. Delete any files/folder that shouldn't be there using Tortoise's "Delete" right-click menu item. It should then be OK to check in, then clean up the mess we've made! :)
