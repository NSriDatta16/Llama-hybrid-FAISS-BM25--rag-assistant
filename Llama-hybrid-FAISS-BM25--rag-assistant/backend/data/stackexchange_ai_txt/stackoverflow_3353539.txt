I would say 'a' is the option you mostly want to stick with. It's much easier to keep consistent templates server side (you can reuse them in non AJAX scenarios). Client-side Templating isn't super elegant (if you're going to do it i suggest this: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/ ) In terms of the styling I would include a minified stylesheet when the page loads not when loading the content.
