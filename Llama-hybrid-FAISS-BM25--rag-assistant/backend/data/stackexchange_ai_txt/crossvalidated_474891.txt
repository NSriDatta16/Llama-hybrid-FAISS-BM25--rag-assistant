Manually calculating `false negative risk` (using Likelihood ratio and Bayesian analysis)

The question is with reference to this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04888.pdf and https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.171085 It give clearly how to calculate false positive risk or false discovery risk . A real life example is also given on page 17-18 However, how can false NEGATIVE risk be calculated manually? What exact formulae can we use?
