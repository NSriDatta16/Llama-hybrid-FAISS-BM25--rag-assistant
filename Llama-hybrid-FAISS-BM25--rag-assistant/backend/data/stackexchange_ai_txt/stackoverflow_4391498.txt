Similar to the answer by Ish Kumar , but with a correction: The Preappform (parent) Model should "act as Containable". When I added the following line to the Preappform model: var $actsAs = array('Containable'); ... the 'contain' conditions in the following code started working as expected: $the_form = $this->Preappform->find('first', array( 'conditions' => array('Preappform.id' => $id), 'contain' => array('Agent' => array('conditions' => array('Agent.hash =' => $hash))) ) ); Thanks!
