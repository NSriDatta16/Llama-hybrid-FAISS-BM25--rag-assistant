Extracting a Date from "the meeting is on 12-DEC-2009 at 13:00" with Groovy

As the title states I have a string similar to: "lorem ispom 12-DEC-2009 fsasdfsd 12:00" OR "the meeting is on 12-DEC-2009 at 13:00" And I need to extract a Date with time from this. What is an elegant and robust way of doing this in Groovy
