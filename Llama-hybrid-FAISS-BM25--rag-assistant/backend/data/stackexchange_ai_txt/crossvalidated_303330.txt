Optimization with concept drift, changing location of the optimum over time

Is there any research/literature on the topic of optimization where the location of the optimum changes over time? Nonetheless I am interested in an optimal solution at any given time. It's hard for me to find anything, maybe because I don't know the specific terms. I am especially interested in bayesian-optimization/model-based optimization. In my prefered scenario the location of the optimum changes in a continuous way. Edit : To put my question more precise I imagine it like the following At any moment $t$ I want to have the solution (or an approximal solution) for $ x_t^* = \arg \min f_t(x) $ We can assume that $f_t(x)$ is deterministic for a fixed $t$. To find the optimization I can try various parameter for $x$ but I don't have any influence on the $t$ as the time continuously progresses.
