The existence of an optimal policy is not obvious. To see why, note that the value function provides only a partial ordering over the space of policies. This means: $$\pi' \geq \pi \iff v_{\pi'}(s) \geq v_{\pi}(s), \forall s \in S $$ Since this is only a partial ordering, there could be a case where two policies, $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$, are not comparable. In other words, there are subsets of the state space, $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that: $$v_{\pi'}(s) \geq v_{\pi}(s), \forall s \in S_1$$ $$v_{\pi}(s) \geq v_{\pi'}(s),\forall s \in S_2$$ In this case, we can't say that one policy is better than the other. But if we are dealing with finite MDPs with bounded value functions, then such a scenario never occurs. There is exactly one optimal value functions, though there might be multiple optimal policies. For a proof of this, you need to understand the Banach Fixed Point theorem. For a detailed analysis, please refer .
