Is it possible to reconcile forecasts that are not only at different levels of an organizational hierarchy, but also measured in different units?

Consider the following scenario: I have a top line revenue forecasts in dollars for each of my corporate divisions or business units. I have capacity forecasts for each of my regional manufacturing and distribution centers, measured in resource utilization (labor shifts × resources needed × ...) I have unit demand forecasts, measured in number of units sold per product category/sales location. I would like to reconcile these forecasts using an optimal reconciliation approach , but how do I do that given that these forecasts are not described in the same units of measure? Simply using a multiplicative constant (e.g. taking an average unit retail $ and multiplying it by the sum of all units for the whole division) seems a little bit too simplistic. Is there a better approach?
