I don't think a good language should have ANY level of access except private--I'm not sure I see the benefit. On the other hand, also be careful about getters and setters at all--they have a lot of pitfalls: They tend to encourage bad OO design (You generally want to ask your object to do something for you, not act on it's attributes) This bad OO design causes code related to your object to be spread around different objects and often leads to duplication. setters make your object mutable (something that is always nice to avoid if you can) setters and getters expose your internal structures (if you have a getter for an int, it's difficult to later change that to a double--you have to touch every place it was accessed and make sure it can handle a double without overflowing/causing an error, if you had just asked your object to manipulate the value in the first place, the only changes would be internal to your object.
