To say something about the math of it rather than the programming: it would be useful to think about whether you can actually avoid the repeated simulations altogether in this case by using elementary properties of the Gaussian normal distribution. In this toy example it doesn't matter, but in general it's vastly more efficient to exploit an analytic solution if it exists. In this case here, the code for the solution becomes much shorter than even chl's example. Hint 1: What is the distribution of the average of 100 normal random variables with a mean of 69.5 and SD 2.9? Hint 2: Apply hint 1 to the average of 1000 instantiations of random variable X - Y, for which the closed form is also elementary (if X and Y are normal).
