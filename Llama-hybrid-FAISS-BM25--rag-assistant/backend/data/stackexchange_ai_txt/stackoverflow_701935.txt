A very similar question was asked and answered here: How do I determine whether it's a mobile device with PHP? Traditionally mobile devices have been detected by comparing the HTTP User-Agent header against a list of well known mobile UA strings. A novel approach instead tries to detect the presence of a desktop OS - anything which is found to not be a desktop OS must then be mobile. This results in far less false positives. I've written a post with sample code in Python here: http://notnotmobile.appspot.com Detect whether a device is a desktop - if it is not then redirect to your mobile site! Cheers, John
