By nature, Java programs are usually interpreted by a JVM. The Java process you see is that JVM instance in fact. To make what you want, you have to encapsulate the JVM in your own program so that you have apparently only one executable (and no JVM dependencies for your users). I recommend you to have a look to these free projects: http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/ http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ Doing a query like "java to exe" in Google can also helps to find the latest news. Looking into gihub could also help to find latest tools. Note that if you do that, you loose one nice feature of Java which is cross-platform portability. There are alternatives like JNLP and others.
