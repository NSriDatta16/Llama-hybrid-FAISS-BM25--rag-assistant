JDBC URL for Oracle XA client

Using the JDBC driver oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource, what is the correct format of the JDBC URL? The thin format of jdbc:oracle:thin:@host:port:sid does not work. WebSphere is reporting that the given url (which is otherwise correct) is invalid. The test connection operation failed for data source Oracle MyDB (XA) on server nodeagent at node MY_node with the following exception: java.sql.SQLException: Invalid Oracle URL specifiedDSRA0010E: SQL State = 99999, Error Code = 17,067. View JVM logs for further details. There is nothing in the JVM logs.
