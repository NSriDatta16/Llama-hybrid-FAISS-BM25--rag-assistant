As @SpyrosP suggested, one option would be to use a session. To clarify, the session should be a server-side session. If you're using cookie sessions, you should consider another storage method. Rails cookie storage sessions should be secure, but even the docs suggest using another method if you don't want the user to see the data (http://apidock.com/rails/ActionDispatch/Session/CookieStore) If you use server-side session store (http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/SessionStore) your risk is reduced considerably. The only thing stored on the client browser is a cookie that maps to a record on the server side. Rails does all the heavy lifting to avoid session hijacking and fixation attacks.
