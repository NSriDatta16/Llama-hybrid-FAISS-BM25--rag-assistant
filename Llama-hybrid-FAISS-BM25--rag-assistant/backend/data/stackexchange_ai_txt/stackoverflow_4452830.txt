Firstly, you'll need to add your newly created PeopleOrganization to the collection on both entities ( Organization and People ). Then if you add a Cascade.All() to your HasMany chain, the saves should propagate (cascade) down to the PeopleOrganization and subsequently to Organization . As a purely semantic suggestion, I'd recommend encapsulating the PeopleOrganization creation into a method on Person . Something like this: class Person { public void AddOrganization(Organization org, string details) { var link = new PeopleOrganization { ... }; LinkToOrganization.Add(link) org.LinkToPeople.Add(link); } } That way you never have to deal with creating the intrim entity yourself.
