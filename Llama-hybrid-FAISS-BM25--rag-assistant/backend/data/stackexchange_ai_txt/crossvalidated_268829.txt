I don't think you're using normalize to mean what it normally means, which is typically something like normalize the mean and/or variance, and/or whitening, for example. I think what you're trying to do is find a non-linear reparameterization and/or features that lets you use linear models on your data. This is non-trivial, and has no simple answer. It's why data scientists are paid lots of money ;-) One relatively straightforward way to create non-linear features is to use a feed-forward neural network, where the number of layers, and the number of neurons per layer, controls the capacity of the network to generate features. Higher capacity => more non-linearity, more overfitting. Lower capacity => more linearity, higher bias, lower variance. Another method which gives you slightly more control is to use splines. Finally, you could create such features by hand, which I think is what you are trying to do, but then, there is no simple 'black box' answer: you'll need to carefully analyze the data, look for patterns and so on.
