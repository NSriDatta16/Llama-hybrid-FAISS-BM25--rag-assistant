Other answers say that traditional regression models, like linear or logistic regression, already does this, as regression is to model conditional expectations (or conditional probability, conditional hazard, conditional ...). As soon as you are calculating a prediction interval with some regression model, you are entertaining some kind of probabilistic forecasting. See also Definition and delimitation of regression model But that term seems to be more used when probability distributions are forecasted/predicted in some more flexible or nonparametric way. That is a far too large topic for one answer, but in the following a few links: Probability Distribution Forecasts of a Continuous Variable Predicting Probability Distributions for Surf Height Using an Ensemble of Mixture Density Networks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_forecasting Demand Forecasting of Individual Probability Density Functions with Machine Learning
