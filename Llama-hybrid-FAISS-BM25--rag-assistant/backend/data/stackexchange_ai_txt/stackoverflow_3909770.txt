So, the first issue that you have here is that you are using the address of individual Nodes of one of your vectors. But, over time, as you add more Node objects to your vector, those pointers may become invalid, because the vector may move the Nodes. (The vector starts out at a certain pre-allocated size, and when you fill it up, it allocates a new, larger storage area and moves all of the elements to the new location. I'm betting that in your case, as soon as you add the second Node to nodes, it is doing this move.) Is there a reason why you can't store the indices instead of the raw pointers?
