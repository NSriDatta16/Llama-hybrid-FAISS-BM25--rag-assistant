The answer must be more boring than you would like it to be. "Observations have been made which are consistent with the person having the disease." In the normal way of thinking about things, you cannot use probabilities to say he has a 99.9% chance of having the disease, for the fact that he has the disease or does not have it is typically assumed to be a statement that has a single truth value. He has the disease, or he does not, we are merely trying to obtain evidence to defend a hypothesis one way or another. When we say "he has a 99.9% chance of having the disease," that is actually just a lazy way of saying "if we were to observe an arbitrary member of our society as having these symptoms, 99.9% of the time that person would have the disease." We have to make sure we're talking about some hypothetical person that doesn't actually exist, or random variables just plain don't work out. Philosophically, one would state that whether he has the disease or not is not dependent on whether an outside person has observed it. The issue you mention about false positives is a real one, though it's far more of a mathematical one than a philosophical one. False positives are a huge issue in detecting unusual events, such as terrorist attacks. If you have a detector operating in an airport which detects terrorists and has a false alarm rate of 0.001%, you will still flag 3740 people, of which most likely none are terrorists. Using Bayesian inference, if you had an existing hypothesis about whether the person had the disease, you could update that hypothesis using the new evidence in a statistically rigorous manner. However, that also is a mathematical approach rather than a philosophical one.
