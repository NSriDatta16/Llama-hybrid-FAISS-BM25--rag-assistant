How do I handle multiple file drag/drop from Finder in Mac OS X 10.5?

I need to get the URLs of all files dragged/dropped into my application from Finder. I have a Cocoa app running on 10.6 which does this by using the new 10.6 NSPasteboard APIs which handle multiple items on the pasteboard. I'm trying to backport this app to 10.5. How do I handle this on 10.5? If I do something like below, I only get the first URL: NSArray *pasteTypes = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: NSURLPboardType, nil]; NSString *bestType = [pboard availableTypeFromArray:pasteTypes]; if (bestType != nil) { NSURL *url = [NSURL URLFromPasteboard:pboard]; }
