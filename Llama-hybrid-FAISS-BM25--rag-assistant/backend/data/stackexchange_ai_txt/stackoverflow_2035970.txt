.NET Click Event (WinForms)

I am building a minesweeper and was having difficulties with the mouse event. In the original Windows Minesweeper, the user may click and drag the mouse while pressing. The new tiles that the user enters while still pressing change to a cleared tile and the previous tile restores back to what it was if it was not clicked. On VB.Net, when I click and attempt to mouse over another tile while still pressing, the other tiles I am on do not appear empty like in the original minesweeper. Any idea on what I could do to fix this issue? Sorry about that John Saunders, I am new at this site. Thanks for advising me.
