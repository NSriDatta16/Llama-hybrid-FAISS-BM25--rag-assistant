Maven and Eclipse code organization

I'm new to Maven, and after having read the docs on the maven site and Sonatype's online Maven book, I'm still not clear on how to best organize things. I have two apps, A and B which share code from mylib. Different developers work on apps A and app B, they are released independently. Before we started with maven, in Eclipse, I'd have a workspace with apps A and B and mylib. The classpath for app A contained mylib. If I made a change in mylib, pressing run within Eclipse, contained my latest changes. In Maven, I can create a parent pom.xml, which references app A and mylib. But this makes mylib a subdirectory of app A. How can I keep one instance of mylib and not link the building of apps A and B? We use SVN for our SCM Thanks
