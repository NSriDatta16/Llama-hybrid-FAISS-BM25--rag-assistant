I created a page to load jQuery Corners to see if I could get it to work at all: .Section { border-color: #000; border-width: medium; border-style: solid; } $(document).ready(function () { $('.Section').corners(); }); Corners Here is some text in my soon to be rounded corner paragraph. What I found in my tests is that the Corners plugin loaded, but using jQuery 1.4.4 and testing with Chrome 8.0.552.224, Safari 5.0.3, Firefox 3.6.13, and Internet Explorer 8 that only Safari and Fireefox showed the corners. Chrome produced CSS errors in the console, IE just ignored the JavaScript. With that in mind, I recommend you give CSS3 PIE a try for IE and use a bit of combo CSS for your other elements: .Section { -moz-border-radius: 20px; -webkit-border-radius: 20px; -khtml-border-radius: 20px; border-radius: 20px; } The CSS above is from an example produced in a blog post by Jon Raasch .
