One interesting idea is the following: Of all distributions on $[0,2\pi]$, the uniform distribution maximizes entropy. So you could try to prove that the averaging operator cannot decrease entropy, then it becomes natural to guess that there exists an fix-point for this iteration of the averaging operator, which should be the maximum entropy distribution. The point of the information that these are not lattice-distributions would be to ensure that we cannot get caught by a fix-point with lower entropy. Google for "entropy central limit theorem" there is even a book with that in the title! This ideas are related to what physicists call re-normalization theory.
