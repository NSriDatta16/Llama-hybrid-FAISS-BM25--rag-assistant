It is straightforward: You can apply standard MI combining rules - but effects of variables which are not supported throughout imputed datasets will be less pronounced. For example, if a variable is not selected in a specific imputed dataset its estimate (incl. variance) is zero and this has to be reflected in the estimates used when using multiple imputation. You can consider bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals to incorporate model selection uncertainty, have a look at this recent publication which addresses all questions: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016794731300073X I would avoid using pragmatic approaches such as selecting a variable if it is selected in m/2 datasets or sth similar, because inference is not clear and more complicated than it looks at first glance.
