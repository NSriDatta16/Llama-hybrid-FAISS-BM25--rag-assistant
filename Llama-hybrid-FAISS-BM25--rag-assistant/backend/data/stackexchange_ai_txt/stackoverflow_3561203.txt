Here is one way to do it: use strict; use warnings; use XML::Twig; my $xfile = q( a b c d y y y ); my $t = XML::Twig->new( twig_handlers => { 'address/p' => \&addr} ); my $pcnt = 0; my $wcnt = 0; $t->parse($xfile); print "Address has $pcnt paragraph tags with $wcnt words.\n"; sub addr { my ($twig, $add) = @_; my @words = split /\s+/, $add->text(); $wcnt += scalar @words; $pcnt++; } __END__ Address has 2 paragraph tags with 7 words. XML::Twig has a dedicated website with documentation and a Tutorial to describe the handler technique used above.
