Almost. In kernel SVM, the hyperplane $\mathbf{w}$ exists only in feature space. What is being calculated is the inner product in feature space , i.e.: $$\langle \mathbf{w}, \varphi(\mathbf{x})\rangle,$$ where $\varphi(\cdot)$ is the (possibly unknown) embedding function from input space to feature space. In terms of kernel evaluations with kernel function $\kappa(\cdot,\cdot)$, this becomes: $$\langle \mathbf{w}, \varphi(\mathbf{x})\rangle = \sum_{i\in SV} \alpha_i y_i \kappa(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}),$$ with $\alpha$ the support values and $y$ the vector of labels.
