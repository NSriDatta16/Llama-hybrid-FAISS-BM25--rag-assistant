Version control for version control?

I was overseeing branching and merging throughout the last release at my company, and a number of times had to modify our Subversion pre-commit hooks to enforce different requirements on check-in comments and such. I was a bit nervous every time I was editing those files, because (a) they're part of a live production system, albeit only used internally (and we're not a huge organization), and (b) they're not under version control themselves. I'm curious what sort of fail-safes people have in place on their version control infrastructure. Daily backups? "Meta" version control? I suppose the former is in place here as part of the backup of the whole repository. And the latter would be useful as the complexity of check-in requirements grows...
