You certainly seem to be doing the right things (but like a lot of people seem to assume that sending a 'Pragma: no-cache' response header has some effect on browser side caching - it should not). What do you mean its getting cached? It will not (usually) be fetched again from the server if the user clicks on the 'back button' and was retrieved using a GET operation.
