Yes, it's possible that the filtered index will be helpful. If you have a common filter, such as "WHERE MyColumn IS NOT NULL" to get the 140 million rows, then that may be the way to create the index. The index will be built with keys that match the criteria, which makes for a much smaller set of index data. The date key (3-byte storage) may also be better than datetime (8-byte storage) when you are dealing with large amounts of data. But, it only helps if you don't need the precision (time) you get from the datetime data type.
