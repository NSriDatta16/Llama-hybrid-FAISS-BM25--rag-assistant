mysql-connect error beginner

I finished a web page in my computer and it was saved in my pen drive. Now I uploaded the files .html and .php to the server, and I exported the database of my pen drive and imported it on the web address using phpmyadmin. Seems like I'm having the following problem: Warning: mysql_connect() [function.mysql-connect]: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2) in /home/t1g01/doador.php on line 40 The files in my pen drive are working fine. But not in the server. Can anyone help me please? When I explore the tables in the http://address.com/phpmyadmin/ there are normal, with data. I read something in another topic about restarting the mysql by typing /etc/init.d/mysql restart or ln -s /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock /tmp/ . If that's solve my problem, where am I supposed to type this ? I'm new at this server stuff. Sorry for any mistake in English, and thanks in advance for the attention.
