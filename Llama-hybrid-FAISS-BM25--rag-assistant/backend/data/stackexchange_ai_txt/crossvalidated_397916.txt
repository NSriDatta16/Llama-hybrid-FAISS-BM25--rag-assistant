Why losses are so big? It seems that the model you specified isn't very good. It could mean that these features aren't good predictors. It could mean that the neural network could be improved in some way. Setting up a good neural network is a task-specific problem that usually involves some trial-and-error. See: What should I do when my neural network doesn't learn? What does label/mean and preddiction/mean mean? I'd consult the documentation or ask the maintainer of the package/software. What is the difference between steps and epochs? Most neural networks don't use all of the data at once. Instead, at each step, a small sample of the data are used to update model parameters. An epoch is comprised of steps, so that each sample is used exactly once in each epoch.
