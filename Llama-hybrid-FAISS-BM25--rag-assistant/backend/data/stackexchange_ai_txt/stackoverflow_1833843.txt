Is debugging complex HTML/CSS/JavaScript pages feasible?

Consider a complex rich internet application with lots of user interaction. I'm thinking of extensive drag-drop support, server-side user input validation, custom drawn UI controls such as an Outlook-like calendar, real-time UI feedback, etc... Would such an application be debuggable? I mean, can you easily step through the source code, place breakpoints, view the contents of variables, see the current call stack, use a profiler to pinpoint performance issues, etc...
