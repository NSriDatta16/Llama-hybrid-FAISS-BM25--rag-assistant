Generate random data for logistic regression with a categorical independent variable

I am trying to generate a data frame of fake data for exploratory purposes. Specifically, I am trying to produce data with a binary dependent variable (say, failure/success), and a categorical independent variable called 'picture' with 5 levels (pict1, pict2, etc.). I am following the answer provided here , which allows me to successfully generate the data. However, I need each level of 'picture' to occur the same number of times (i.e. 11 repetitions of each level = 55 total observations per subject). Here is a reproducible example of what has worked so far (code from user: ocram): library(dummies) #------ parameters ------ n However, as you can see from the output, each level of the factor 'picture' does not occur the same number of times (i.e. 200 times each). > summary(data) picture choice pict1:200 Min. :0.000 pict2:207 1st Qu.:0.000 pict3:217 Median :1.000 pict4:163 Mean :0.559 pict5:213 3rd Qu.:1.000 Max. :1.000 Moreover, it is not entirely clear to me how to manipulate the initial beta values as to determine the probability of success/failure for each level of 'picture'. I cannot comment the original question because I do not yet have the necessary reputation points.
