The first option involves potentially two string compares. The second option involves a parse each time. The third option does a simple hash of the string and then a hash table look up, which is the most efficient in this case, in terms of the amount of work that needs to be done. The third option also scales better than the other two as more alternative strings are added, because the first two are O(n) and the third is O(1) in the average case. If we want to talk about which option is prettier / more maintainable, that's a whole separate conversation.
