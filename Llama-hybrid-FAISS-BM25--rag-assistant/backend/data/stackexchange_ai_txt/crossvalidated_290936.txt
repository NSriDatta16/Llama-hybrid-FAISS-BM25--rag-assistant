H2O: Can I use the h2o for time series predictions?

I understand that there is not a specific model for time series modeling in H2O. Is there a workaround in order to use Deep Learning or/and GBM? Is some kind of data transformation necessary? are there any examples? Are there any plans for ARIMA or LSTM?
