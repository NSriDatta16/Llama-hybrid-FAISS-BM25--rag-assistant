TCPDUMP is one of my favourite tools for analyzing network, but if you find difficult to cross-compile tcpdump for android, I'd recomend you to use some applications from the market. These are the applications I was talking about: Shark: Is small version of wireshark for Android phones). This program will create a *.pcap and you can read the file on PC with wireshark. Shark Reader : This program allows you to read the *.pcap directly in your Android phone. Shark app works with rooted devices, so if you want to install it, be sure that you have your device already rooted. Good luck ;)
