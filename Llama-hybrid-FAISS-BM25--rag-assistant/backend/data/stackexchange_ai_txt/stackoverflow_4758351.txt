The most elegant solution to this problem is here . Original answer remains, but this is a messy solution: If you want to change the PYTHONPATH used in a virtualenv, you can add the following line to your virtualenv's bin/activate file: export PYTHONPATH="/the/path/you/want" This way, the new PYTHONPATH will be set each time you use this virtualenv. EDIT: (to answer @RamRachum's comment) To have it restored to its original value on deactivate , you could add export OLD_PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH" before the previously mentioned line, and add the following line to your bin/postdeactivate script. export PYTHONPATH="$OLD_PYTHONPATH"
