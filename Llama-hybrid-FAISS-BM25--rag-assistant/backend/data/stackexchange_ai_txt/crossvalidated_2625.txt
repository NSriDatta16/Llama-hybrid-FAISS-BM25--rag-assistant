Interpreting your question as asking for the "inverse probability transform," as ars has indicated and you have confirmed in comments to the question, gives a simple solution: perform a sort to rank all the $z$ values in ascending order from $1$ to $N$ (the amount of data), then convert each $z$ into $2 Rank(z)/(N+1) - 1$. If you want to be really careful, scan over the ranked $z$'s to look for ties and assign each value within a group of tied values the average of their ranks.
