I doubt you'll find what you're looking for if "official" means "standards-based." What you describe is a user-agent scripting language to be parsed and executed during a style-sheet parsing. If your aim is to simplify XSLT by doing the dirty work in Javascript, you may be better off trying to generate the XSLT in javascript and then using a class wrapper to parse the result in via the browser's own XSLT parser. This is of course a lot more work than you probably signed on for, but if you're convinced you want to do so, I'd take look at John Resig's Javascript Micro-Templates to dynamically store template-friendly XSLT in your javascript.
