Choosing between weekly and monthly data is called time binning not sampling. Oversampling has its merits when looking for signals or time series. In signal processing, oversampling is the process of sampling a signal with a sampling frequency significantly higher than the Nyquist rate. Theoretically a bandwidth-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed if sampled above the Nyquist rate, which is twice the highest frequency in the signal. Oversampling improves resolution, reduces noise and helps avoid aliasing and phase distortion by relaxing anti-aliasing filter performance requirements. The Nyqvist rate is essentially the minimum sampling frequency to reconstruct a signal of frequency $1/T$, where $T$ is the period of the signal. So, the minimum sampling frequency would be $F_s = 2/T = 2*B$ In this case, oversampling will be done on a random signal. If multiple samples are taken of the same quantity with uncorrelated noise added to each sample, then averaging N samples reduces the noise power by a factor of 1/N. This means that time binning your data will reduce noise. First, hypothesize how small the signal is then decided whether is better to sample weekly data or monthly. Source I am a hobbyist statistician so maybe someone else can give a better answer.
