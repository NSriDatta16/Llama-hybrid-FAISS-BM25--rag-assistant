You need replace all data insert by ? and save each data to replace this ? in an Array @search_condition = "" if !search_text.nil? search_field = search_text.split("-") if search_field.length == 1 @search_condition = "( address_books.organization_name like ? or address_books.business_name like ? or address_books.federal_tax_id like ? or address_books.city like ? or address_books.zip like ? ) " @search_condition_datas = ["#{search_text}%", "#{search_text}%", "#{search_text}%", "#{search_text}%", , "#{search_text}%"] if search_text.include? "-" if search_field.length And after you can search with User.find(:all, :conditions => [@search_condition] | @search_conditions_datas) This code can be refactor after. It's really ugly.
