Forecasting Intermittent Demand with zeroes in times series

I am trying to forecast intermittent demand (slow movers and extreme slow movers). Here's the type of data I am working with weekly data so I cannot really group it has zeroes in time series not sure if seasonal (at least not visibly) Based on some research, I think I can use Croston's method for this type of data, but I want to know what the general approach is for handling this type of lumpy data with zeroes in it. Burning questions for now would be- How to handle zeroes in data What models are generally used for Intermittent data How to model seasonality if it's present I am using R for my analysis. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_yfz1q9d0tih5WRmfzRWpedkeQvF3ctB/view?usp=sharing
