Normalization by decimal scaling

I came to this normalization technique Normalization by decimal scaling normalizes by moving the decimal point of values of attribute A. The number of decimal points moved depends on the maximum absolute value of A. A value v of A is normalized to v’ by computing: v’ = ( v / 10powerj ) where j is the smallest integer such that Max(|v’|) So if we have matrix e.g. [1 3 5 7] j should be 1 I believe and when matrix is [ 1 3 5 99 ] j will be 2 ?? Is this method superior over min-max scaling e.g. for SVM ?? Obviously this method doesn't scale to range 0-1 as commonly suggested. Is any MATLAB code for this method available somewhere ??
