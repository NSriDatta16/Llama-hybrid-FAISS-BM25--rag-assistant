In the original version of this post, it was mentioned that there are multiple frequency components in the signal. I'm assuming this means that there are multiple seasonalities present in the time series. If that is indeed the case, then ARIMA won't work, as in practice an ARIMA model can handle at most one seasonality (using seasonal ARIMA). You might want to use the TBATS method from Hyndman's Forecast library instead. Or you might be able to use Facebook' Prophet library - which is very intuitive and easy to use - but it won't be possible unless your time stamps are formatted to a very specific calendar type of data. (If not then just stick with TBATS).
