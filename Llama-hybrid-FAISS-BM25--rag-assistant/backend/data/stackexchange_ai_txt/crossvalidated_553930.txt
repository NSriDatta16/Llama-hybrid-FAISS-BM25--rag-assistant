From the plot you provide I do not see a significant trend of body weight over time. You can try to fit a regression to see if the coefficient of time is significant statistically (p value) or practically (effect size compared to outcome scale). My guess is it won't be, so you can just proceed to calculate average treatment effect. If your no-treatment group is not randomly assigned, and it's not a good natural experiment setting to begin with, you should consider using causal inference techniques such as propensity score matching to reduce the bias from the assignment mechanism.
