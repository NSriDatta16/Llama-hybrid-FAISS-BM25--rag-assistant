A self-organising team is one in which every member of the team is working towards some shared goal. Team members collaborate to reach the goal, valuing the team's output over their own individual productivity. A self-organizing team tends to be: trusting of each other's motives and motivation helpful, respectful, communicative and transparent collaborative with other teams interested in delivery and feedback goal-focused instead of productivity-focused. The project manager's roles in a self-organising team tend to be: making sure that the team has people with sufficient skills to succeed helping them be aware of and understand information coming from elsewhere in the company reporting the team's progress, successes, risks and obstacles to other audiences getting stuff out of the team's way wherever possible (see Servant Leadership). A self-organizing team is usually pretty good at getting things done, blasting through obstacles, communicating issues outside of their control and generally provides a great project experience for anyone using them.
