Let us consider the following model, $$z=\beta_xx+\beta_yy+\alpha.$$ Bayesian hypotheses are combinatoric. The possible hypotheses are $$z=\alpha,$$ $$z=\beta_xx+\alpha,$$ $$z=\beta_yy+\alpha,$$ and $$z=\beta_xx+\beta_yy+\alpha.$$ If $\beta_x=0,$ that is equivalent to removing $\beta_xx$ from the equations that are possible. In addition to a prior for the parameters, you would need to create a prior for each possible model. Because parameters are random variables, for those on a continuum such as the real numbers, $\Pr(\beta_x=0)=0$ since it is a countable point in an uncountable set. There is no direct method to test a no association hypothesis in Bayesian methods.
