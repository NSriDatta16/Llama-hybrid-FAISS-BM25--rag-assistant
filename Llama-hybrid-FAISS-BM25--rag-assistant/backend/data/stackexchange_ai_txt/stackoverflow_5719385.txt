How to edit or add a UIView underneath a UITableView bounce area (top) ? Like Twitter's - Updating etc

The main Twitter app uses a UITableView for all your tweets and when you drag the UITableView from down from the top it exposes the bounce area underneath which has a UIView that says "Updating..." etc. How does one access this area underneath to customize it, and how does one detect where the TOP bounce area has been exposed? I know there is the scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView delegate method which I have already implemented. This method basically always fires off if the user drags and scrolls into the top bounce or bottom bounce areas since the table needs bounce back into position. I don't see how one can detect whether they hit the top or bottom area? I suppose you could check content offset at start of drag and compare with the offset at end of drag? How do you actually EDIT or add a subview to the bounce areas though like Twitter / Facebook Feeds? I thought it would be by just adding a UIView subview underneath the UITableView, which would then expose it when the TableView is dragged too far but this didn't work? Any tips?
