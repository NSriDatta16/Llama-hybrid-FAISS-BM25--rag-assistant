How to make an app without titlebar?

I'm quite new to developing on the Mac, I've only done iPhone programming until now. I'm trying to make an app that doesn't have a titlebar. I'd still like to allow the user to move the window around by clicking anywhere within the window and dragging. Is this possible, and if so, how can I get started on something like this? Thanks!
