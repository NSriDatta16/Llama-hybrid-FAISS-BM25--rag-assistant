I was wrong before. You need to accept the drag operation on dragEnter event handler if you want the "red cross" to disappear. Event if you try to display a different feedback, without accepting the drag operation the cross (meaning no operation) will still appear. So leave the check for the matching out of dragEnter handler and put in dragDrop event handler, and accept the drag for all your images. Method hideDropFeedback is defined in the list components (List, DataGrid etc.), and it hides a certain line that appears when dragging items in those controls. This one doesn't matter in your particular case.
