Yes it is possible. You just need to define/select a neural network with two neurons(for θ1 and θ2) in the last layer and define a custom loss function which can include both of these neuron values. The classification problems of neural networks tend to select the correct class by using something like argmax in the last layer. Both the classification and regression neural networks will get trained in the same way. For binary classification models we can use single neuron at the last layer just like regression problems.
