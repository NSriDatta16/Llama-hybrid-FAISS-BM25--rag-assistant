What if you want to apply the replace task recursively ? How would you do that? Well, I just found the answer myself. Not the most elegant solution, (also tries to rename files that do not comply with the condition) but it works. (BTW, in my case I needed to rename the files with '%20', not with an underscore) #!/bin/bash find . -type d | while read N do ( cd "$N" if test "$?" = "0" then for file in *; do mv "$file" ${file// /%20}; done fi ) done
