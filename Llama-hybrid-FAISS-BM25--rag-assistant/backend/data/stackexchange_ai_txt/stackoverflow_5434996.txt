Magento: how to merge two product collections into one?

if i have two product collections is there a way to merge them into one? for example (my final intent isn't to actually just get a collection of 2 cats, this is just to illustrate the issue): $collection1 = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load(148)->getProductCollection(); $collection2 = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load(149)->getProductCollection(); $merged_collection = merge_collections($collection1,$collection2); any help would be appreciated!
