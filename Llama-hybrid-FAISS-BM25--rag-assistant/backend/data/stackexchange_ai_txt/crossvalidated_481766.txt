Bayesian hierarchical model - exercise

I have to solve a bayesian statistics problem like a follows $y_i$ distr as $Bin(n_i, \theta_i)$ conditional on $\theta_i$ I observe several $n_i$ and $y_i$ and Iâ€™m interested in $\pi(\theta_i|y)$ for any $i$ Moreover I know that $logit(\theta_i)= \alpha_i$ and $\alpha_i$ distr $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ Moreover $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are not constant but r.vs. themselves (hierarchical model). The prior $\pi(\mu, \sigma^2)$ is proportional to $1/ \sigma^2$ It seem me that the main trick here is to discover the distribution of $\alpha_i$ given $y_i$ that probably have no usual form. So we have to simulate from it with MCMC procedure. So we have a chain for $\alpha_i$ and is easy to compute the related chain for $\theta_i$ , so we have the posterior distribution of interest. Is the correct procedure? What is the distribution/kernel for $\alpha_i$ given $y_i$ ?
