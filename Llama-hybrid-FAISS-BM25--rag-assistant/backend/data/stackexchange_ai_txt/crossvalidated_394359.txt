How do I calculate a Bayesian Posterior Distribution from an Exponential Prior and Sample Data

I have a dataset where each observation is a length of time (e.g. 50 days, 70 days, 105 days) and I am trying to utilize Bayesian statistics to calculate a posterior distribution in light of new data. Based on my research it seems like an exponential distribution is the right type of distribution for this type of data. I used python to fit an exponential distribution to my data and got a lambda of 93. My question: what is the process of generating a posterior distribution from my prior in light of new data. For example, let's say I generate three new observations of 10 days, 30 days, and 40 days - how would I use bayes' rule to update my prior and generate a new posterior distribution? Thanks!
