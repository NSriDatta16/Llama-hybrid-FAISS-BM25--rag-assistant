I think what your trying to do is a drag scroll for a div. Check this site out. This is a demo to a Jquery Plugin that allows you to use mouse down events to drag your scroll area. Simular to that of an Ipod touch or Iphone, but instead of a finger you use your mouse down http://hitconsultants.com/dragscroll_scrollsync/scrollpane.html
