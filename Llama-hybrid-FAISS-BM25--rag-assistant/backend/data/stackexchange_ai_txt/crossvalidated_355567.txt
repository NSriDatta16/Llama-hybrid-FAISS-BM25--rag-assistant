Stephan's answer gives you an intuitive explanation of why minimizing the absolute average error gives you the median. To answer which of the MSE, MAE or MAPE you should minimize: The MAE is robust , meaning it is less sensitive to outliers. Imagine a series of $n$ points with an error a million times greater that what it should be. The MSE will pull the forecast a million / $n$ times, while the MAE will only be pulled by 1 unit (fig. 1). Unfortunately, minimizing the MAE can lead to multiple solutions (fig. 2). So my recommendation is: Fit a model using the MSE. Start an MAE-based regression with the fitted parameters. Compare both forecasts. If they are very different, your data may have anomalies.
