One of the standard inference tasks in Bayesian networks (BNs) is to compute the conditional probability distribution function (cpdf) of some nodes ( $Y$ ) in the BN, given the value of some other nodes ( $Z$ ). In this case, one observes (i.e. "fixes") the values $z$ of a set of nodes $Z$ and infers the probability $P(Y|Z=z)$ of other nodes $Y$ . Because the values of $Y$ are not observed, they are called "latent". E.g., you could have a BN of binary ( $\{0, 1\}$ ) nodes $(X_1, X_2, X_3,X_4)$ : and you are interested in the probabilities of both values of $Y = X_2$ under the condition that $Z=X_4=0$ , i.e. you are interested in the cpdf $P(X_2|X_4=0)$ , which consists of the two values $P(X_2=0|X_4=0)$ and $P(X_2=1|X_4 = 0)$ .
