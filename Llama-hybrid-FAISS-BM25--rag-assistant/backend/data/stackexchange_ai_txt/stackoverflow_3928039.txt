The FormShow event firing more than once in your application is a sign that the handle of the form is destroyed and recreated at least once, most probably because you change one of the properties that requires the window handle to be recreated. Changing the stay-on-topness is one example. If the handle is recreated then the new one will of course not receive any messages the previous handle was registered to receive. What you need to do is to call DragAcceptFiles() after the final handle has been created, or (as that may be hard to do) indeed multiple times.
