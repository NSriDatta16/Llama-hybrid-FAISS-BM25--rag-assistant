First of all, it should be ar , not Ar . I don't think the values you supplied to Ar are doing anything. It's probably just generating a white noise process. To answer your question, arima.sim allows you to simulate from an ARMA model, and the inputs are regression coefficients (using ar and ma ) corresponding to the model here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive%E2%80%93moving-average_model#ARMA_model You will get an error if the model you specified is not stationary. All of this information is in the help file (type help(arima.sim) ).
