Embedding youtube video in webpage for both desktop and iphone/ipad

I'm surprised I just put object to embed youtube in a wordpress blog and surprise it did play also on ipad. Why does it work ? I thought I would need to serve some special code for Ipad ? I have used real ipad and then Safari with user-agent ipad to get the source code above: how can application/x-shockwave-flash be interpreted as html 5 video ?
