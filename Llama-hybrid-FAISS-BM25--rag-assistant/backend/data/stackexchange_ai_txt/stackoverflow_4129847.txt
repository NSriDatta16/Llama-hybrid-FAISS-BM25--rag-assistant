Um, just to second EboMike, what are you talking about exactly? If you have an image that is 1360 x 768 pixels, its real image size is... 1360 x 768 pixels. Density doesn't affect the image size in pixels, it affects its physical size on the display. For example, on a 240 dpi (hdpi) Android display, a 1360 x 768 pixel image will appear as 5.67" x 3.2" (1360/240 x 768/240). On a mdpi display (160 dpi), this 1360 x 768 pixel image will appear as 8.5" x 4.8" (1360/160 x 768/160).
