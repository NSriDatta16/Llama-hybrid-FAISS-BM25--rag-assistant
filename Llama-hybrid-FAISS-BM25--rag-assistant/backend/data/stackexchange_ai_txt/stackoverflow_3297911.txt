Since the amount of output is indeterminate, it doesn't make sense for bash to store it for you for re-display. But there's an alternate solution to your problem: The tee command allows you to duplicate an output stream to a file. So if you're willing to use a file for temporary storage, you can do something like this: make | tee output.txt grep "warning" output.txt This solution avoids running make twice, which could be (a) expensive and (b) inconsistent: the second make may be doing less work than the first because some targets were already made the first time around. Note: I haven't tried this. You may need to fiddle with joining the error and output streams, or such.
