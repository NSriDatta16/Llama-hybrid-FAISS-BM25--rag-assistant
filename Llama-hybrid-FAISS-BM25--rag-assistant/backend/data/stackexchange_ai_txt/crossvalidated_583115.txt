I say it's fine. Logistic regression estimates $P(Y = 1\vert X = x)$ . $$ P(Y = 1\vert X = x) = \dfrac{ P(X = x\vert Y = 1)P(Y = 1) }{ P(X = x) } $$ $P(Y = 1)$ is the prior probability that $Y = 1$ . If we only use an intercept in our model, no matter what features we have, then the probability predicted by the logistic regression model is the proportion of $Y$ -values with $Y = 1$ . This is $P(Y = 1)$ , so the prior probability that $Y = 1$ .
