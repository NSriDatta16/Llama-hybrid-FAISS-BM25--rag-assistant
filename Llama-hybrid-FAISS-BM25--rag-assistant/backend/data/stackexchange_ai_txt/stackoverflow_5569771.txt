How to organize data environment for JUnit tests?

I'm creating a data-intensive Java EE web application, which keeps its persistent data in a relational database. Now I want some JUnit tests to validate the application behavior in certain "data environments". Some objects should be created before tests and destroyed when tests are finished. Tests should be able to control their data setup configuration. Typical situation, huh? Now my questions are: What tools to use for it? DBUnit looks rather old and is not JUnit-4 oriented. Where to place and how to name object creators? How to pass configuration details to them? Java call params? XML configs? Shouldn't I use ExternalResource JUnit rule for convenience? I'm interested to know what are the best practices. How do you solve this problem?
