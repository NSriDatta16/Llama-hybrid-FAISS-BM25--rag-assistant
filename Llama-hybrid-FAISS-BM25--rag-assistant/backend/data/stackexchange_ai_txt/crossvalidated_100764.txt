I'm puzzled why you would want to prove that using the same data with the same procedure -- except for window width -- would give similar results. Why would you expect anything different? I must be misunderstanding somewhere... If my understanding is correct, you could do something like a mathematical proof by induction on the size of the window (W), with a difference between a window of size W and W-1, D. I don't think you actually need any statistical test or even any real data. (If you use a statistical procedure, you also need to account for the fact that time series are usually autocorrelated, which can fool you.)
