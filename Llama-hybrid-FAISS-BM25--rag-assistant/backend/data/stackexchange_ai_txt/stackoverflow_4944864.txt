There are several "tags" systems which allows that (there is one bundled with emacs, there is GNU global which isn't bundled with emacs but integrate well with it and has some advantages). Compared with Eclipse, you'll need to build the tags file. Then there is semantic/EDE which is now bundled with emacs which should provide a solution without needing to build a database explicitly. I've not tried to use it recently. When I did, it has performance problem and I found the set up was painful. (Both possibly due to the fact that I'm working on a big -- several 10's millions lines -- and old -- some things date back to the mid 80's -- project without the possibility of reorganizing it).
