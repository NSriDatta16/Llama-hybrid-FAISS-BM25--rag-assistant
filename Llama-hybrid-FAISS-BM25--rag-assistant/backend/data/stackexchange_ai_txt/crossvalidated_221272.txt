Effect of an auditor's experience on client size and client complexity

I am working on a dataset containing a list of auditors, collected in four different years: 2008: 650 auditors 2009: 646 auditors 2010: 635 auditors 2011: 620 auditors (A possibly large number of auditors may appear in two or more different years.) Each individual auditor in each year comes with the following information: His number of years of experience (as of that year) Total number of client companies that he has audited in that year Average asset of the client companies that he has audited in that year Other information about the client companies, such as risk, ROA, etc... I am asked to find out how the experience of an auditor can affect the number of clients he has as well as the the size and the complexity of his clients . For example, I have to find the answers to the following types of questions: Do older auditors have fewer clients than younger auditors? Do older auditors have larger and more complex clients than younger auditors? etc... (By "older" I mean "more experienced", i.e. "more years of experience"). I have several questions to ask (I don't know where to start, really :( ): Should I combine the four years to get a big data matrix and consider each row (i.e. each auditor) as an independent data point? Or should I treat each year separately? How should I divide the auditors into groups of experience? Should I: a) First divide the auditors into groups based on the number of auditors in each year of experience, and then find other results (on the clients' characteristics) for each group? If yes, then how? Below is the histogram of auditors in each year of experience (for all 2008-2011 combined). or b) First find the results and then divide the auditors into groups based on the obtained results? For example, if I plot the number of clients, and the average client assets for each auditor then I got the following results (where each point of the scatters is an individual auditor). I can observe that the results are somehow correlated, and by observation (with the eyes) it is reasonable to divide the auditors into 3 groups: Young (e.g. 35 years). Is this a good way to do? Or is there a method for doing that better, not "by the eyes"? Thank you very much in advance for your discussions!!
