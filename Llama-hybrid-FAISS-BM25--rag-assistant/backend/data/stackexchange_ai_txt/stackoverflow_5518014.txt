Problems with http post method, HttpServletResponse and cookies on java

At the beginning i was sending a redirect with the cookies set on HttpServletResponse but later i decided to not redirect and only get the information gave from the servlet but the problem is i can't set the cookies on this post method. So i would like to know how to set cookies with postmethod and if there is a way to process the cookies that are in HttpServletResponse String temp=null; HttpClient client = new HttpClient(); client.getParams().setParameter("http.useragent", "Oauth Data Requester"); BufferedReader br = null; PostMethod method = new PostMethod(ADDRESS+"/SampleProvider"); //Aqui ainda enviamos o XML inteiro como parametro method.addParameter("p", "\"java2s\""); try{ int returnCode = client.executeMethod(method); if(returnCode == HttpStatus.SC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) { System.err.println("no post method found"); } else { temp=method.getResponseBodyAsString(); } } catch (Exception e) { System.err.println(e); } finally { method.releaseConnection(); if(br != null) try { br.close(); } catch (Exception e) {} } return temp; }
