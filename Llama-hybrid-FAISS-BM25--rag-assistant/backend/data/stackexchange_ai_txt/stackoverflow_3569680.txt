Is it possible to choose Datagrid grouping order in WPF?

I've just started to learn WPF/C# and I picked a project which would actually be useful to me instead of variations of "Hello, World!" programs. It's a small app that polls a game server for player information and binds it to a DataGrid . The data is grouped by team, which can be one of four values: Blue, Red, Spectator, or None. I've got the Linq query working fine, and the DataGrid grouping is almost good, except for one small problem: the order of the four teams groups is different every time. Sometimes Red is first, sometimes None, etc. Is there any way I can force the groups into the order above? Here is the Linq query (addr is the server ip): private void get_server(string addr) { var loc = "http://ukcs.gameme.com/api/serverinfo/" + addr + "//players"; XDocument doc = XDocument.Load(@loc); var server = new ObservableCollection (from player in doc.Descendants("player") orderby player.Element("rank").Value select new Player { name = player.Element("name").Value, team = player.Element("team").Value, frags = player.Element("kills").Value + ":" + player.Element("deaths").Value, rank = int.Parse(player.Element("rank").Value) }); server.OrderBy(p => p.rank); ListCollectionView collection = new ListCollectionView(server); collection.GroupDescriptions.Add(new PropertyGroupDescription("team")); player_list.ItemsSource = collection; } A second problem is that neither of the OrderBys seem to have an effect. Any help would be appreciated!
