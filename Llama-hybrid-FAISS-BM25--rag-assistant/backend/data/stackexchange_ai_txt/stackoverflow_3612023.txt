AllowDrop needs to be enable for the control/object you intend to drop on. You also need to update the DragDropEffects in either the Enter or DragOver event. This allows you to validate and provide feedback for supported or unsupported drop items. Private Sub UserControl11_DragEnter(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles UserControl11.DragEnter e.Effect = DragDropEffects.All End Sub
