Zero inflated and right skewed dependent variable â€“ is the Tweedie distribution a good solution?

We are conducting a variance decomposition using a hierarchical linear random effects Bayesian model to investigate the variance in a DV that is affected by three nested layers. Because the DV is right skewed and zero inflated we have used a Tweedie link function (e.g.). Is this a good approach given our setting?
