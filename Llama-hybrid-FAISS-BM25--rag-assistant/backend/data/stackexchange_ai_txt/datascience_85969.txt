Since Invoice analysis comes under trend analysis. It's better to take a look at the data from a statistical point of view. Plot graphs, manually check the relation and so on. if there is a trend which is not monotonic, or if it's recurring weekly it's better to take a look at (Recurrent Neural Network)RNN's to predict based on the day or week.
