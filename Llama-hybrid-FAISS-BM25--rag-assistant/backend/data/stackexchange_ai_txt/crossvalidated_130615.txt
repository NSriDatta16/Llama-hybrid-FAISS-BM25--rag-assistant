The problem you face is called "zero inflated data." Most approaches to this are through either the negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson distributions. Whether or not you can do a transformation depends on why you have zeros in the first place. There are discussions at http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/zero-inflated-poisson-models-for-count-outcomes/ and http://www.ualberta.ca/~bhumphre/class/zeros_v1.pdf . (Although the math is scary, read at least section 3.4 Discussion.)
