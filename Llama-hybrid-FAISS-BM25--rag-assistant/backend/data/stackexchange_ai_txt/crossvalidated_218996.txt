TOO low estimated SVM probability for most of the negative test examples?

I am using LIBSVM (as well as the fitcsvm and fitSVMPosterior of Matlab ) to train SVM models and get probability estimates. I noticed that the estimated probability for the vast majority of negative test examples are TOO low (e.g. ). I am puzzled as to what could explain this? One fact that may provide an explanation is that there is a good reason to believe that some negative training examples are in fact positive ones. This would push the classification boundary away from the negative examples and, hence, the too low estimated probability. The relatively low recall achieved also points towards this direction. [Note that the test datasets are more accurate and have less label noise]. Does this explanation make sense? If not, what could be the explanation?
