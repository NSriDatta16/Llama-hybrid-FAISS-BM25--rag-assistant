Are all (non-explosive) time series either stationary around a deterministic trend or random walks? No. All non-explosive AR(1) processes with unit roots are random-walks, but this doesn't generalize to other processes or even AR processes with longer lags. Any AR process where the characteristic equation has a unit root is non-stationary. For example: $y_{t} = 1.5 y_{t-1} - 0.5 y_{t-2} + \epsilon_t$ is non-stationary. Because $1 - 1.5z + 0.5z^2 = 0.5(z-1)(z-2)$ so z=1 is a root. But only $y_{t} = y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ is a random walk. In particular, if I run the ADF after detrending a series but it still gives me non-stationarity, does it imply that the series is a random walk or may I just have misspecified the trend? You could have mis-specified the trend, but it may not be a random walk even if you have correctly specified it.
