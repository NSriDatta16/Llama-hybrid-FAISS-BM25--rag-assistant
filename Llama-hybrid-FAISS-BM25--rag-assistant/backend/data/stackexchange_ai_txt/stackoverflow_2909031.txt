I'm using the net tab daily as my preferred traffic sniffer and using Firebug 1.5.4 on Firefox 3.6.3 under Linux. While enabling the net tab is important, please pay attention to also request Firbug show All requests and not just HTML or similar requests. I'd also suggest clearing all the requests from the panel before you start sniffing for actual AJAX requests.
