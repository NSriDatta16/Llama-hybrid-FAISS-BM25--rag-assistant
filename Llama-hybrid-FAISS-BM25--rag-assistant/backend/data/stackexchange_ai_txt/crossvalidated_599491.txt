My advice is to start by spelling out the data generating process, or a model of the situation at hand. For example, are the underlying data normally distributed? How (why) does the standard deviation change over time? Is the mean constant, but unobservable, or does it change over time? If so, what is the dynamic equation for the mean? This model should then guide your choices of statistical methods. For example, if the mean is constant over time, but unknown and you want to gradually learn it from the data, you can easily calculate predictive distribution in closed form via Bayes rule. The best prediction (in terms lowest mean-squared error) is the conditional expected value of the mean, conditional the information so far. If I understand your question correctly, this is kind of a state-space situation here. The true mean of the process is unobservable, but it changes over time (you want to forecast it), possibly an AR(1) process, and you have access to some measurements of this mean. The measurement is subject to error with a given SE. This seems like a filtering problem to me, take a look at my other answer regarding state-space models, Kalman filter and predictions here If, on the other hand, the std. dev. itself exhibits time series patters and is of separate interest to you (you want to forecast it as well), take a look at stochastic volatility models. The Stan manual has a good TLDR here Update Based on your comment, it seems that the model you have in mind is as follows. You are after the "true" mean, $\mu_t$ . But, you can only see an imperfect measurement of it, say $y_t$ . The two are linked as follows, $$ \begin{eqnarray*} y_t &=& \mu_t + \varepsilon_t, \qquad& \varepsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon}), \\ \mu_{t+1} &=& \rho \mu_t + \nu_t, \qquad& \nu_t \sim N(0,\sigma_{\nu}) \end{eqnarray*} $$ This is a Kalman filtering problem. See my answer linked above to learn how you estimate $\rho$ , and both "sigmas" by maximum likelihood estimation. Once you know those, you can show that the optimal (in the squared error sense) predictive density is $$ \mu_{t+1} \sim N(a_{t+1},P_{t+1}) $$ where the mean and stdev can be calculated recursively as $$ \begin{eqnarray*} a_{t+1} &=& \rho a_t + (P_t/F_t) (y_t - a_t), \\ F_t &=& P_t + \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2,\\ P_{t+1} &=& P_t(1-P_t/F_t) + \sigma_{\nu}^2 \end{eqnarray*} $$ For some initial $a_0, P_0$ . Since you have the whole distribution of your predicted mean, $N(a_{t+1},P_{t+1})$ , you can easily compute confidence intervals.
