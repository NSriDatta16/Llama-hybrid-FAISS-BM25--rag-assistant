PHP mySQL retrieval issue

I am having a problem retrieving some data from tables in my database. I have user profiles on my site and you can add other users to your friends list, The friends table has 2 collumns, the user_id of the user who added the person and the 'friend_id' the user_id of the person added. There is also a user table with the details of each other. 'user_id' is contained in both of these tables, this is how the tables are linked together. I want to be able to retrieve all of the friends one user has. The problem is that my query just returns the main users name instead of the friends of that user The current query is SELECT * FROM users, user_followers WHERE users.user_id = '$userset' AND user_followers.friend_id = users.user_id` $userset contains the user_id of the main user logged in Any help would be greatly appreciated.
