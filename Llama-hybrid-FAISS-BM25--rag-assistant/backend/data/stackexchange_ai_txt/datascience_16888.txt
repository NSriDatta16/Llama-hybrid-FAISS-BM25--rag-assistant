Libraries for Bayesian network inference with continuous data

Is there any good libraries that allow me to: Construct a Bayesian network manually Specify the conditional probabilities with any continuous PDF, not just Guassian Perform inference, either exact or approximate I looked at the following libraries so far, none of them meet the 3 requirements: pgmpy: only work on discrete distribution or linear Guassian distribution bnlearn: same as pgmpy gRain: only discrete distribution Huggin: only discrete distribution and Guassian deal: no support for inference abn: same as deal libpgm: only discrete distribution and Guassian
