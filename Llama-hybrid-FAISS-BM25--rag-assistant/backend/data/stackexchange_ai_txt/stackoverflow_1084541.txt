Artificial intelligence is a pretty big field. I'm not sure that there's one "engine" that encompasses all of AI. Do you mean a Rete rules engine? Try Drools. Do you mean a neural network approach? Support vector machines? Active or passive learning? There's no one approach. I really like what I see in "Programming Collective Intelligence". A nice variety of techniques, written in Python.
