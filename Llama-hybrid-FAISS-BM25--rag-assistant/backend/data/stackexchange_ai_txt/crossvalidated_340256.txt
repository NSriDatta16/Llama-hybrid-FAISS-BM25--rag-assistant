The final layers in a convolutional neural network could be seen as sorting neurons. The initial convolutional layers have 'picked out' features form the image, in the first convolutional layer, and combinations of those features (in the second convolutional layer). This is great but the layers haven't decided anything about what class (category) these features belong to. The final layers take the features that the convolutional layers have identified and piece them together to give a conclusion as to what class they are representing. The final layers 'make sense' of what the convolutional layers are 'seeing'.
