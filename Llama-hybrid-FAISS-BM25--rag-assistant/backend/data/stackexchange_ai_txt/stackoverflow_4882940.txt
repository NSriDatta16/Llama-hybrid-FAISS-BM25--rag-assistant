See Iterators . There's an important difference between the foreach method on iterators and the same method on traversable collections: When called to an iterator, foreach will leave the iterator at its end when it is done. So calling next again on the same iterator will fail with a NoSuchElementException . By contrast, when called on on a collection, foreach leaves the number of elements in the collection unchanged (unless the passed function adds to removes elements, but this is discouraged, because it may lead to surprising results). ... As you can see, after the call to it.map , the it iterator has advanced to its end.
