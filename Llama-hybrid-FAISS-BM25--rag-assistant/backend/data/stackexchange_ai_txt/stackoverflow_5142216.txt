It looks to me like the problem is in your save method - it looks like you are maybe appending the settings each time you close - to overwrite your existing settings, you need to ensure that you delete your existing file and create a new one. To help debug this, try using http://wp7explorer.codeplex.com/ - this might help you see the raw file "on disk" As an aside, for settings in general, do check out the AppSettings that IsolatedStorage provides by default - unless you have complicated needs, then these may suffice on their own.
