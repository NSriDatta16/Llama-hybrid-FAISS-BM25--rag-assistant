This question is better suited for the Quantitative Finance Stack Exchange, but I'll answer it anyway. Excellent answer . Take a read on the answer. Now, let me explain further. What you're talking here gives us the Geometric Brownian Motion for stock price. GBM is a very powerful tool as this is what we use for Black Scholes model for option pricing. While powerful, every single QF practicioner knows this is not right. Anybody who believes lognormal is appropriate is crazy. So, why are we using it? GBM is simple, it gives us a good analytic solution for option pricing. A simple approximating model is generally better than a super complicated model. After all, modelling is about approximation (close enough is sufficient). Most options models other than BS model don't have an analytical solution. Lastly, any "realistic" model for reality require something like time-dependent multidimensional stochastic process; they are very complicated . Trust me, you don't want to work with complex roots. Another reason. Our financial market is actually driven by supply and demand. Nothing you're studying make any sense as traders don't care about anything like lognormal distribution. It's just about supply and demand. The BS model is used as a statistical tool to work out the volatility from market option price. Please pay attention to what @Matt wrote in the link. Very important for your understanding! Gold. BS is merely a translation tool, nothing more, nothing less. What is really priced by the market is implied volatility. What is traded, however, is the option price. Hence, as long as the market agrees on one standardized model it does not matter what exact model we are talking about.
