iPhone - Wheel tracking finger jumps to same starting position?

I am trying to implement a selection wheel in an iphone application. I have got the wheel to track the users finger but now for some reason when the user touches the screen the wheel jumps so the same section of the wheel tracks the finger each time. How would I get it so the wheel rotates like the user is dragging it from any point? -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; int tInput = [allTouches count]-1; UITouch *touch =[[allTouches allObjects] objectAtIndex:tInput]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; float theAngle = atan2( location.y-imageX.center.y, location.x-imageX.center.x ); CGAffineTransform cgaRotate = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(theAngle); imageX.transform = cgaRotate; } Any suggestion?
