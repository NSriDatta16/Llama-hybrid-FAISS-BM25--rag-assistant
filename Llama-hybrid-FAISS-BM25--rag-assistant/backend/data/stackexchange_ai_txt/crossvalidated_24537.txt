Priors for hierarchial Bayesian binomial model

I intend to use a hierarchical binomial model which would look like the following in BUGS language : model{ for(i in 1:I){ y[i] ~ dbin(theta[k[i]],n[k[i]]) } for(j in 1:J){ theta[j] ~ dprior(alpha, beta) } alpha ~ dhyperprior.alpha beta ~ dhyperprior.beta } I wonder about the choice of the prior on $\theta$ and the hyperpriors. Do you know how to do this choice in order that: 1) There's no need to use MCMC (classical simulations suffice) and/or 2) This is a good "noninformative" choice, in the sense of the frequentist-matching property (the frequentist coverage of the posterior credible intervals is close to the credibility level)
