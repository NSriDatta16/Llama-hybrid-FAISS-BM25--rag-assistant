Is it possible to get strings, ints, etc in binary format? Yes. There are several different methods for doing so. One common method is to make a MemoryStream out of an array of bytes, and then make a BinaryWriter on top of that memory stream, and then write ints, bools, chars, strings, whatever, to the BinaryWriter. That will fill the array with the bytes that represent the data you wrote. There are other ways to do this too. Can I store the above binary not as a string, but in the actual format with the bits. Sure, you can store an array of bytes. is it actually possible to store less than 8 bits. No. The smallest unit of storage in C# is a byte. However, there are classes that will let you treat an array of bytes as an array of bits. You should read about the BitArray class.
