RFC 2396 (Uniform Resource Identifiers URI: Generic Syntax) says: Many URI include components consisting of or delimited by, certain special characters. These characters are called "reserved", since their usage within the URI component is limited to their reserved purpose. reserved = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | "," 2.4.3. Excluded US-ASCII Characters The angle-bracket " " and double-quote (") characters are excluded because they are often used as the delimiters around URI in text documents and protocol fields. The character "#" is excluded because it is used to delimit a URI from a fragment identifier in URI references (Section 4). The percent character "%" is excluded because it is used for the encoding of escaped characters. delims = " " | "#" | "%" | Other characters are excluded because gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify such characters, or they are used as delimiters. unwise = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "[" | "]" | "`" I think that covers all that you mentioned. The star " * " is not reserved and may be used. Paste this in a browser: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ *
