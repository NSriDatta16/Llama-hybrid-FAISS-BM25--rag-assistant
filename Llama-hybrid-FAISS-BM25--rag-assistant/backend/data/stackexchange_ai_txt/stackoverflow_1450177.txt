Java servlet mappings can also be by file extension. Much like many non-Java frameworks, you could map all requests to a single servlet that then processes them but that tends to be discouraged in Java. It's certainly possible though. If you want more REST-style URLs where you declare the mapping of path elements, you might want to look at the Spring MVC setup in Spring 3.0.
