As indicated by the previous post LoadRunner is performance and load testing. Performance center (which includes LoadRunner) is supposed to be a complete performance management solution. Performance center is HORIFICALLY expensive and from what I can see a number of the so-called features simply address some of the licensing restrictions in LoadRunner. It also appears that not a lot of organisations use Performance Center so HP don't have much expertise. If you just want performance and load testing without all the hassles then Borland SilkPerformer is a better option.
