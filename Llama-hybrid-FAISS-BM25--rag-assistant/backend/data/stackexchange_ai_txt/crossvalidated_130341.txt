Which distribution to choose when modeling variance of a normal distribution?

I have a simple time series model where there is a single hidden variable $\lambda_t$ which changes over time: $\lambda_{t+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\lambda_t,\sigma)$. The $\lambda_t$ is then used as a parameter for a Poisson distribution from which observations are made. Since $\sigma$ here is also unknown, what distribution should be used to model it?
