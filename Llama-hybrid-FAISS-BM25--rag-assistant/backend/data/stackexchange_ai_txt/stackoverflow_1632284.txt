Assuming that your intention is to pull down a subset of the data on the server dependent on client queries for local storage then for reasons of security and control you probably ought to be looking at using web services rather than exposing your database directly to the internet. There are a large number of options for creating services - WCF being the principal method for new .NET applications and straightforward to implement at both server and client ends - in this case I'd also probably take a look at ADO.NET Data Services as providing a shortcut to a rich set of services.
