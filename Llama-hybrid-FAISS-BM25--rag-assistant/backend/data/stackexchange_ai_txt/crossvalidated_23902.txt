Objective function in linked prediction models

I would like to use R “optimize” function to estimate the model: $\hat{Y_{t}}=a\cdot \hat{Y}_{t-1}+b\cdot X_{t}+c\cdot X_{t-1}$ Important thing is that the predition $\hat{Y_{t}}$ (let’s say prediction of Y on Tuesday) is calculated on the basis of former prediction $\hat{Y}_{t-1}$ (not real value of $Y_{t-1}$ ) in time t-1 (Monday). What is key word to google to find out more on this class of models? I mean time series models where prediction is based on former prediction, not actual value like in ARIMA models. With an objective function I would like to minimize the sum of the squares of the errors between ${Y_{t}}$ and $\hat{Y}_{t}$ . The objective function in one equation would look like endless spaghetti. How to write objective function in R?
