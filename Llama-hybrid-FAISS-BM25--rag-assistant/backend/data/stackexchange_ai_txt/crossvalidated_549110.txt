Why is a 2nd order derivative optimization better for no hidden layer neural networks?

I was reading in this blog . That first order derivative SGD optimization methods are worse for neural networks without hidden layers and 2nd order is better, because that's what regression uses. Why is 2nd order derivative optimization methods better for NN without hidden layers?
