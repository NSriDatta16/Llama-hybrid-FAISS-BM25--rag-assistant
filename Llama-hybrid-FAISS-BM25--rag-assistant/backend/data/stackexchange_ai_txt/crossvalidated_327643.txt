How can I train my deep learning model on another similar yet different dataset

I am doing semantic segmentation (multi-class classification of image pixels) using convolutional neural networks (CNN) in Keras. In particular, I am applying this to aerial images of crops (vegetation). In Keras, I successfully developed a workflow to segment/classify different crops for one specific dataset (let's call this dataset rural area #1 ). Can I apply my Keras weights trained on rural area #1 for initializing the training of another dataset rural area #2 ? Such as: model = load_model("weights_ruralarea1.hdf5") Then I will proceed to model.fit in Keras. The rural area #2 dataset has a little amount of training images for training the CNN. The images in this 2nd dataset, although it has similar crop content on the images to the 1st dataset, it also has different image resolution, and is not exactly the same visually as the 1st dataset. So would using my weights for rural area #1 be a form of transfer learning? or will it be a form of fine-tuning?
