Why is mAP (mean Average Precision) used for instance segmentation tasks?

I understand why this metric is good for object detection tasks but for instance segmentation tasks it does not give any clue about the quality of the predicted masks. Shouldn't it be combined in some way with IOU between predicted and ground truth masks like it is done for semantic segmentation with mIOU ?
