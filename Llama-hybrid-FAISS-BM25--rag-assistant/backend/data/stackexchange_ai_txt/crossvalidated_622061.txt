Mixed logistic regression with glmer on R: better to use summary(model) or Anova(model) with 3-level factor as predictor?

I'm running a mixed logistic regression on a dichotomous variable in R with glmer , with two fixed effects in interaction: one is a factor with two levels , and the other is a factor with three levels . I wonder if there is any theoretical reason why to use "summary(model)" or "car::Anova(model)" to interpret the output, as I get different results from the two functions. I copy the code and the outputs of interest here below. Thank you very much, and please excuse me if this question has been already asked! I have not found anything specific on mixed logistic regression. model Chisq) factor1 93.4021 2 |z|) (Intercept) 2.4340 0.4137 5.883 4.03e-09 *** factor1levelB -2.0577 0.4190 -4.910 9.09e-07 *** factor1levelC -3.5702 0.4476 -7.976 1.51e-15 *** factor2levelB -0.8429 0.5352 -1.575 0.1153 factor1levelB :factor2levelB 0.4332 0.5467 0.793 0.4281 factor1levelC:factor2levelB 1.2098 0.5683 2.129 0.0333 *
