How to balance PCA and LDA in subspace learning?

PCA is a generative model, by which input images or data can be reconstructed. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) is a discriminative model, which extracts better features for classification. How to make subspace learning that fulfils both aspects or at least balance between the two aspects ? Mathematically formulate the problem (i.e. objective function) that learns the subspace for reconstruction and discriminative features at the same time ? I tried to answer above by combining 2 part via $\ \lambda$ $\ J(w) = W^TS_TW + \lambda \frac{W^TS_BW}{W^TS_WW} $ The first term is reconstructed focus part and the latter is discriminative part. Note that $\ S_T = S_B + S_W $ Actually this is different from Fisherfaces (I attached its formula below): But I feel this is wrong in some ways because the weight W in PCA and LDA is not the same. Also, I also have to provide the mathematical solution that optimises the defined problem (could be Lagrange multiplier formulation, gradient-based optimization, eigenvector-eigenvalues ...) Any help since I'm not so good at math here. Thank you
