Hinge loss in siamese network

I'm trying to implement method of comparing images' patches using siamese neural networks described here http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05970v1.pdf Authors propose using siamese CNN and they define hinge loss as $$ max(0;m + s_{-} - s_{+}) $$ where $s_{-}$ is the output vector of the network for negative pair(two images in the pair is different) of images and $s_{+}$ is the output vector for positive pair (one image from each pair is the same). They use $cos$ function to get the similarity between two outputs ($A=\{a_{i}\}, B=\{b_{i}\} $) of the network. So suppose we define $s_{+,-}$ as $ \cos(A,B) = {A \cdot B \over \|A\| \|B\|}$ where $norm$ is $L2$ Now I'm trying implement gradient descent using this loss function. And my misunderstanding here (because i'm pretty new in NN): what would be the gradient of this loss function (or subgradient)?
