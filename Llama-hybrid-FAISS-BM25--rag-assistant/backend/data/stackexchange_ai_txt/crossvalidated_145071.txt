Why do we need PCA whitening before feeding into autoencoder?

In the UFLDL tutorial, we saw that autoencoder can not compress data with uncorrelated random variables. 'If the input were completely random---say, each variable comes from an IID Gaussian independent of the other features---then this compression task would be very difficult.' But, it is suggested to apply PCA whitening before feeding the data into autoencoder. Using PCA, the data can be represented using new orthogonal variables, which are uncorrelated. Can the autoencoder compress the data using hidden layer after PCA preprocessing?
