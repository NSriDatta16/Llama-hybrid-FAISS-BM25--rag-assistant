All the __attribute__ mechanism is a gcc specific extension. So in consequence this is not standardized. C by itself doesn't have the concept of dynamic constructors of variables with static storage or things like that. The only thing it has is initialization of such variable with compile constant expressions. There are a number of tools in POSIX threads that work around this. R.. already mentioned pthread_once . pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t have macros that evaluate to a constant expression. By that they can thus be used as initializer for variables in global scope.
