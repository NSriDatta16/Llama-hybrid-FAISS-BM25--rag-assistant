Well - as long as you know the basics of programmatically transforming displayObjects, this shouldn't be too tough to do I might go about it like this: Create the graphics for your different elements. You are essentially going to be controlling the rotation property of these objects, so your translation points need to be set correctly at the point of rotation. Once that is set up, its as simple as adding a mouse down event listener to the tiller, and testing for the delta change in mouseX until mouse up is registered. During the animation cycle (while the mouse is down), just apply varying degrees of rotation (based on mouseX delta change) on your three objects. IE: If the mouse is dragged left, rotate the tiller to match, the rudder in the opposite direction, and the parent (the boat) also to the left. This, obviously is very rudimentary, but should create a reasonable analogue of your intent... Hope that helps
