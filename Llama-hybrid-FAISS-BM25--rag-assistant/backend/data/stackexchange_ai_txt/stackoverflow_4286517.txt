GWT application generating IE insecure item warning

Our service runs over HTTPS and we're currently experimenting with running a compiled GWT-application within it, only client side, no RPC:s. It is included within an IFRAME, which seems to be recommended (here for example: http://developerlife.com/tutorials/?p=231 under the heading HTTPS and HTTP). When doing certain operations within the GWT-app, IE it generates an insecure item warning. http://bagonca.com/insecure_item.png You may ask yourself why I don't use some nifty Firefox plugin to see what request might be over http. Or why I don't use HTTPWatch in Internet Explorer for the same reason. I have. There are no insecure requests that I can find, anywhere. What I have read about on the other hand is that Internet Explorer throws this warning for iframes without the src attribute set. And that a potential fix is using src="javascript:false" for any iframe that is populated dynamically. As I've said, the whole app is included via an IFRAME, and within it GWT itself generates a hidden IFRAME that looks like below. I've tried hard coding the src attribute above to a blank page that actually exists and is called with HTTPS on the same domain. I've tried the javascript:false; approach. No luck. The app works like a charm, but IE throws the useless, and false warning. The warning turns up when I do certain actions within the app, not when it is loaded. Actually when dragging and dropping appointments within the http://code.google.com/p/gwt-calendar/ component. Has anyone tangled with a similar issue before? Any clues?
