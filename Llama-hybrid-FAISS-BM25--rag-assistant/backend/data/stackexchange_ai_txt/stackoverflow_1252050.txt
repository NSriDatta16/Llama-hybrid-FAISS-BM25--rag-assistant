Because InnoDB is a transactional storage engine, the exact count is subject to interpretation. For example, some rows may exist in storage but the transaction that created those rows has not committed yet. So the rows should not be included in the count. Even more confusing, your transaction may be REPEATABLE READ isolation level, which means only rows that were committed before your transaction began are visible. Some rows may be committed, but more recently than the start of your repeatable read transaction. So those rows also should not be included in the count. But the same rows are included in a count done by another transaction that was started later, or in READ COMMITTED isolation level. This is why this table statistic for InnoDB can only be approximated. An accurate count requires a scan of all stored rows, to see if they are visible to the current transaction.
