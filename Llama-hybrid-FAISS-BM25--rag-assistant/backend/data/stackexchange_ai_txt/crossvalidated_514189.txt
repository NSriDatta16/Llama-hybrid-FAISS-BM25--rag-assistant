OLS biasedness in AR(1) model

I am trying to show why the OLS estimator in time series models is not conditionally unbiased when using a zero-mean strong AR(1) model. From what I've read so far, this can be done through a Monte Carlo simulation as in here , here , and here . Is this the only way we can prove it?
