Getting Error 3007 when I add my Entity Model

I am getting an error 3007 when I add my entity model to my solution. I found these links: Good explination Short answer About this error: Error 1 Error 3007: Problem in Mapping Fragments starting at lines 89, 94: Non-Primary-Key column(s) [Person_ID] are being mapped in both fragments to different conceptual side properties - data inconsistency is possible because the corresponding conceptual side properties can be independently modified. Their Answer: I agree with their conclusion that by simply deleting the Scalar Property Person_ID and leave the Navigation Property my problem is fixed. However this is not very scalable since I am dynamically building my database and my entity is updated very often. I dont want to have to go through and clean up my entity every time I update it. My Question: Is there a way to fix the error by correcting the way EF builds the entity? Or is there a way to remove the Scalar Property through code? Perhaps there is even a few options that I am overlooking.
