there is a log4j.properties in the cobertura jar files. If you log with log4j, maybe this file is used for logging configuration (log4j takes the first log4.properties from the classpath and uses this). you could remove this file from the lib OR make sure, that your logging configuration is first in the classpath. If you supply -Dlog4j.debug=true log4j will tell you, which logging configuration file it uses.
