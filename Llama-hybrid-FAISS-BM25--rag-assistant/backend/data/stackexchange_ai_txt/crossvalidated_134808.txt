Best way to visualise impact distance against launch speeds and angle

I am modelling the trajectory of a projectile, incorporating atmospheric drag. I am calculating the distance from the launch point for when the projectile impacts the ground. I have generated this impact distance data using the Monte Carlo method (a range of randomly selected speeds and angles), so I have impact distances with corresponding launch speeds and angles. What is the best way to visualise these data? What graph would be the best to use? I am currently using a 3D graph to explore the 3 variables, but I was hoping there was a better alternative.
