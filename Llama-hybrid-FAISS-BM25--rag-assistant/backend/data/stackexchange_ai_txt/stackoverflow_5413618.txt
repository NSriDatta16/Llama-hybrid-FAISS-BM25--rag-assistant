Cleanly uninstall Rspec and use vanilla Unit::Test in Rails 3.x

I was reading the Rails Tutorial and following along like a good drone installing everything the way it said and doing everything it told me. Then I realized I didn't like the book any more for a number of reasons and quit reading it. But I had already created my own project with Rspec installed as it told me to. Then I find out that Rspec is quite a bit more complicated than the built in Test::Unit and every other book I read is telling me how to use Test::Unit, including the excellent 'Rails Test Prescriptions' by Pragmatic. (I wish I'd started with them first.) Anywho, the book does teach Rspec a little bit but not until after you get past Test::Unit. Now I can't scrape Rspec out of my project. There is a 'rails generate rspec:install' but no uninstall and my tests now default to Rspec. I can force a unit test with 'rake test' but if I use 'rake' it goes to Rspec. There are other remnants of Rspec too, like in the --help for 'rails generate'. My concern is that as I get more involved with vanilla Test I'll find more problematic areas. I removed or renamed the files / folders generated by the installation. I also looked for changes to my config files but couldn't find any. I intend to consider Rspec down the road but for now I'd like to have a clean project to work with.
