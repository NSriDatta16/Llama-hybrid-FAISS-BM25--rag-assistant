If you are trying to see whether the survey had made any positive effect on the people, modeling a relationship between before and after with correlation is a fair approach while avoiding some edge cases. Correlation looks whether $X's$ and $Y's$ are linearly correlated or how one variable is influenced by other. But I guess what you might be looking for is just something simpler like average increase in rating after the activity. For example import numpy as np from scipy import stats ratings_before = np.array([1,2,1,3,4,5]) ratings_after = np.array([5,5,5,5,5,5]) print "P.Corr: ",stats.pearsonr(ratings_before, ratings_after)[0] print "Avg.Increase: ",np.mean(ratings_after-ratings_before) which gives Nan 2.333 And assume that your activity went so good that everyone rated you a 5-star. Then correlation turns as $NaN$ as denominator goes to zero as no $Y$ can be explained by $X$. Hope this helps.
