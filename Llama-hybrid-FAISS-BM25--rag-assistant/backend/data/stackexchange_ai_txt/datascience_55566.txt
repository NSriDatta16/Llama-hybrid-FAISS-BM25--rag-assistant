Tool for labeling audio

I have few thousand audio signals to label into 2 different classes and save them to numpy array for further training of models. MATLAB recently released Signal Labeler for their Signal Analyzer , that could help to label time series, but for certain reasons, I can't use it. Is there any specific tool for analysis and labeling of time series for Python? It is not necessary to save data and labels into numpy arrays, .csv format or anything similar is suitable as well. Will appreciate any help!
