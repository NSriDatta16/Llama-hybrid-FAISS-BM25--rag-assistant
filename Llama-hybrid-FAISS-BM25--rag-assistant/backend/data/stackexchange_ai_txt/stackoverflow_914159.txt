I think you'll need to do a lot of swizzling . Try swizzling tryToPerform:with: first; if that doesn't work, you'll need to swizzle such methods as mouseDown: , mouseUp: , the drag event methods, keyDown: , keyUp: , and the undocumented gesture methods . One complication in the latter solution is that you'll need to swizzle those methods on not just NSResponder, but on several of its subclasses, because many view classes provide their own implementations, which may or may not call up to their ancestors' implementations.
