Jon, Have a look at this link for additional ideas: http://www.webappers.com/2007/09/05/smooth-and-clean-fastfind-menu-jquery-plugin/ FastFind Menu Script is a javascript menu created by ActiveSpotLight under the BSD License. It pulls a content feed as data to populate the menu, this can be static or dynamic. The version they use internally uses JSON/XML as data feeds. This script allows for nested menus, based on dynamic Ajax responses. The menu can also be dragged/dropped by using the jQuery Interface Library.
