Chris, Honestly depending on your needs, I would look at doing this a different way, as this is going to be very fragile with each DNN upgrade that happens in the future. I'd look more towards using the "bulk install" option that DNN already has. Have your service upload the module zips to the /install/modules folder, then from there, call /install/install.aspx?mode=installresources and you are done! If you need a third party solution to parse the results, have your windows service go through and pull the HTML response and parse it to validate success.
