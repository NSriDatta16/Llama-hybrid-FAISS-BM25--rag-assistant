P-value and Bayesian Inference

I know the technical definition of a p-value , but that definition is at face value useless. I want to know how to adjust my beliefs given the evidence presented. Does p-value relate to any of the terms in Bayesian inference? $P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}$ I had previously thought that p-value could corresponded to the P(E|H) term, but not sure if that's true. EDIT: H is hypothesis, E is evidence
