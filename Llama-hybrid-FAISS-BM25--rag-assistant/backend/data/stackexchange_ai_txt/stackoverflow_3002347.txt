Search SQL Question Between Related Two Tables

I am writing some kind of search engine for my web application and i have a problem. I have 2 tables first of is projects table: PROJECTS TABLE id int(11) NO PRI NULL auto_increment employer_id int(11) NO MUL NULL project_title varchar(100) NO MUL NULL project_description text NO NULL project_budget int(11) NO NULL project_allowedtime int(11) NO NULL project_deadline datetime NO NULL total_bids int(11) NO NULL average_bid int(11) NO NULL created datetime NO MUL NULL active tinyint(1) NO MUL NULL PROJECTS_SKILLS TABLE project_id int(11) NO MUL NULL skill_id int(11) NO MUL NULL For example: I want ask this query to database: 1-) Skills are 5 and 7. 2-) Order results by created 3-) project title contains "php" word. 4-) Returned rows should contain projects.* columuns. 5-) Projects should be distinct(i don't want same projects in return of query). Please write sql query that ensure these conditions. Thank You.
