Querying files stored in eXist-db with XQuery

I've used one XML database eXist-db to do some XQuery testing. I have an xml collection called "media_data_101109.xml", and I've put it in direcotry /db/wb/portfolio/media_data_101109.xml Then I went to the eXist Sandbox, which is a GUI for doing XQuery, and type in the following XQuery: let $mediaNodes := doc('db/wb/portfolio/media_data_101109.xml') return $mediaNodes//media[contains(@product,"wb")] but it failed to retrieve any results back. However, if I prepend the server name in front of the URI string like: let $mediaNodes := doc('http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/portfolio/media_data_101109.xml') Then it worked fine (though a bit slow). As I remembered, the first XQuery worked perfectly fine in the past, but since yesterday, it failed to retrieve any thing unless I specify the server name in the URI string. Could anybody give me some idea on where things might went wrong here? I thought there might be some problems with my port settings? So the eXist-db might not be normally rnning?Thanks in advance.
