Neural Network: Handling unavailable inputs (missing or incomplete data)

Hopefully the last NN question you'll get from me this weekend, but here goes :) Is there a way to handle an input that you "don't always know"... so it doesn't affect the weightings somehow? Soo... if I ask someone if they are male or female and they would not like to answer, is there a way to disregard this input? Perhaps by placing it squarely in the centre? (assuming 1,0 inputs at 0.5?) Thanks
