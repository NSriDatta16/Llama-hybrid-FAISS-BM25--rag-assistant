You are using relative, not absolute paths. Your pages now think you are in a path ~name/. You can set in your pages. You could possibly simplify this by using 'DirectoryIndex index.php' to map /whatever to /whatever/index.php This may help: How to use apache's mod_rewrite rewriterule without changing relative paths EDIT: Short answer. You should consider using absolute paths for your menus and php includes to prevent issues when you start nesting deeper. Your relative paths are only valid while you are two levels deep (ie, ~laborfa2/search/) Frankly you links are mess so you're getting confused. I strongly recommend creating a very simple test site to get you paths organised properly. Use absolute paths and relative paths as appropriate. Remove the base href as it's just confusing you more. Once you have it running try out rewrite again keeping in mind your relative paths may need to be updated if the path depth is changed by the rewrite..
