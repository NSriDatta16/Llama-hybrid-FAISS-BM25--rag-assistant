That seems unnecessary to me. I'm not sure what the middle section might be, but I can't see any benefit to aliasing the pointers like that -- unless you're modifying storage_p (for example, incrementing it to iterate). In fact, having two aliased pointers could make it more difficult to keep track of the allocated memory.
