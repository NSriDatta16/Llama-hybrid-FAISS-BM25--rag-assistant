Predict Probability Distribution with Neural Network or Monte Carlo

Let's say we would like to predict price of Microsoft Stock. We have historical data and interested in predicting price distribution for future time t+1 , like shown on the image. We can use classical Neural Network approach to predict the price, but it would be a single number , not distribution. Question - is there a way to make Neural Network to output the price distribution (CNN for sequences as a Neural Network)? Question - as far as I know it's possible to do such thing with Markov Chain Monte Carlo. You run it a lots of times, collect the outputs, the predictions and then calculate the distribution. Could Monte Carlo approach be used with Neural Network , instead of Markov Chain (CNN for sequences as a Neural Network)?
