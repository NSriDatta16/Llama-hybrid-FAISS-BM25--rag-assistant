How should I use Recurrent Neural Network to model this problem?

I am using Keras to do a machine learning task: Let's say I want to predict the time that a user spends on a product page. Each training case is a partial user visit session. One single user may have multiple sessions. The lengths of sessions are variable. The figure shows a user session. Xn is the feature vector of the n th product page, while yn is the user's reading time on the product page. Given the previous time steps, I want to predict the time that the user will spend on the current page. For example, in the test dataset, given X1 , X2 , and y1 , I want to predict y2 . Then after observing actual y2 , given X1 , X2 , X3 , and y1 , y2 , I then predict y3 . The key here is that this is like an online prediction: At t=3, the actual y1 and y2 is already observed. So the observed values, not the predicted ones, are used to predict y3 My question: Given this tutorial , I am not sure whether my case should be 'many to one' or 'many to many'. If 'many to one', there is nowhere to put y1 and y2 . I think y1 and y2 should be able to partially determine y3 . It is possible to add y1 and y2 as one input feature in X1 and X2 . But there is no way to build X3 because y3 is the prediction. Onthe other hand, for 'many to many', I do not need the prediction of y1 and y2 because they should be known when predicting y3 .
