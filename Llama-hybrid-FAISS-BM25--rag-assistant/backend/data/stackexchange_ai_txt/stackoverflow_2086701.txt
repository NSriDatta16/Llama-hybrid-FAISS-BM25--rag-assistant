I don't understand why you would use Levenshtein for this, it appears that you would get much better results from simple calculations. To find the difference in angle of the lines, you could simply find the angle for each line (arctan((x_1-x_2)/(y_1-y_2))) and subtract them. To find the average distance of the lines, you could simply use the distance formula with the first point of each line and the second point of each line and average those distances together. Other than that (unless your lines are in 3D), there's nothing else to really "compare" them with. Perhaps I've misunderstood. Are you looking to compare the string values for the lines?
