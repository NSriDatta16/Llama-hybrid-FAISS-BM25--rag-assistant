Regarding bank payments, no that much datasets are publicly available. You can have a look at customer complaint databases like the CFPB one where some of the complaints related to bank transfers (Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service (check cashing service, currency exchange, cashier's/traveler's check), are catalogued as Fraud or scam : The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily. Regarding credit card, you can also use this dataset available (after registration) at the " European Data Incubator " website: Existing fraud prevention mechanism in banks are mostly based on manpower-based rules. These rules evaluate the fraud risk of credit card transactions and inform the fraud operation team according to the risk scores of rules. This process is daily reported to the credit cardholders by operation team by considering the daily call capacity. This challenge is about forecasting fraud transactions of credit card users of YKB with machine learning technics instead of traditional rule-based systems. Credit card fraud means a transaction that is not intentionally performed by the card holder. Dataset Description: The dataset is anonymized with PCA method and balanced at card level to reduce the high-class imbalance. Half of these credit cards are selected based on the criteria of having at least one fraudulent transaction in the given time frame. Accordingly, the remaining half consist of credit cards that do not have any fraudulent transaction in the time frame. This dataset can be used to train models but should not be used to evaluate their performance. For the evaluation please use the unbalanced dataset that is also provided. Balanced Training Dataset Time of the transaction -- Datetime Amount of the transaction -- number Unique anonymized card identifier Label - 1: fraud, 0: legitimate Unbalanced Test Dataset Time of the transaction -- Datetime Amount of the transaction -- number Unique anonymized card identifier Label - 1: fraud, 0: legitimate
