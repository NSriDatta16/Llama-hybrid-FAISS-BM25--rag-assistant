Should I standardize (z-score) features that are already in [0,1] range?

I have a dataset which I would like to use to train SVM models. The dataset contains binary variables as well as variables that are in the range [0,1] (i.e. they represent proportions calculated by dividing a ratio-type of measurement by another ratio-type of measurement). Since the values of all variables/features fall in the range [0,1], do I still need to standardize (z-score) them (i.e. any/both of the binary and proportion ones)?
