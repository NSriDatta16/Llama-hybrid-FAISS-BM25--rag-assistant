I don't know of a built-in function that does what you want, but this does: (defun string-all-caps-p (string) "Return non-nil iff STRING is all capital letters." (save-match-data (let ((case-fold-search nil)) (string-match "\\`[A-Z]+\\'" string)))) Edit: Changed to use ` and ' as per Eli Barzilay 's feedback. This one lets there be non A-Z chars (not what you asked for, but perhaps interesting): (defun string-has-no-lowercase (string) "Return true iff STRING has no lowercase" (equal (upcase string) string))
