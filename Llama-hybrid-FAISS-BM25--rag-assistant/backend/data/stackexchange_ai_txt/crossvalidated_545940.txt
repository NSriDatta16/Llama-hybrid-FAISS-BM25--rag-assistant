Sample size and a study design: AI in shadow mode vs physicians

My research group has a group of patients where we are comparing the performance of a Random Forest classifier for acute respiratory tract infections. We are designing a study where we compare the output of the classifier to a physician. The patients first answer questions before meeting with the physicians and we get the rest of the data needed from the text note from the consultation. The outcomes are the rate of antibiotic prescriptions and chest x ray orders (and if they are positive vs negative). My questions are on sample size and on which kind of study would fit best. With an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, how would one calculate a sample size? I am guessing a type of observational study design would fit best to be able to reject the null hypotheses presented regarding the performance of the classifier vs the physicians. I already found a reference for how to calculate the sample size if we were to observe two groups with different risk factors and measuring the outcome ( http://njppp.com/fulltext/28-1567942207.pdf ) but wouldn't it make more sense to have a single group and have the classifier work in "shadow mode"? EDIT: We have done a retrospective analysis which shows that antibiotic prescriptions are prescribed in 25% of cases which can be reduced to mean 18% and the chest x-rays are at 12% and can be reduced to mean 9% (without missing a positive x-ray). EDIT: The ground truth/gold standard for the antibiotics will be a panel of 5 physicians which will go through each case in the validation set. They will estimate if there was a need for antibiotics or not (by a majority vote). With each patient we have a binary value indicating if an antibiotic was prescribed or not. The ground truth for the chest x rays are if the x-ray is positive for pneumonia specific changes as per description of the radiologist. EDIT: The study concludes by comparing the rates of chest x-rays orders and antibiotic prescriptions recommended by the classifier vs the physician who originally saw the patient. These are binary values. We also look at the results of the chest x-rays to determine if the image was positive for pneumonia or not which is also a binary value.
