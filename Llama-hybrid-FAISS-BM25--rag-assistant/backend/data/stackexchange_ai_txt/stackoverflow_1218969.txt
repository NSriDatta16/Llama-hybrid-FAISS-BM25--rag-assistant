Error stopping a Windows Service

I am using PowerShell 1.0 on Windows Server 2003 x64. When executing the following statement, there is error below. Not every time this error occurs, and if this error occurs and I execute this command again, there is no error again! It is so weird. Any ideas what is wrong? Stop-Service "SQLServerAgent" -Force -ErrorAction:stop WARNING: Waiting for service 'SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER) (SQLSERVERAGENT)' to finish stopping... out-lineoutput : The OS handle's position is not what FileStream expected. Do n ot use a handle simultaneously in one FileStream and in Win32 code or another F ileStream. This may cause data loss. thanks in advance, George
