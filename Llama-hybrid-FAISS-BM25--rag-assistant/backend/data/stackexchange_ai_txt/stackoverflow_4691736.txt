You're right, 3 cascades is impossible in Magento theming. So you could choose to create new theme by copying previous one and customizing it. One more solution - to create custom blocks, which extends standard ones but with custom selling templates - I think you have not so much places where you want to put new graphics over. After sale is finished switch off the customized blocks and previous design will be back.
