If the images are just static files on disk, then Beepcake is right that IIS will already be caching frequently used images and serving them from memory. Using separate caching servers shouldn't be any quicker than IIS serving an image from memory - it's got more to do with scalability. Once you have a large server farm, it means you have a group of servers just dealing with your code and a group of servers just dealing with static images. Also, if you have too much content for one server to cache it all then you you can route requests so that each of your ten servers caches a different 10% of your content. This should be much better than just having each server cache the same most-used 10% of the content.
