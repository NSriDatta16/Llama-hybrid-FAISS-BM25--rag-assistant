Read fixed width record from text file

I've got a text file full of records where each field in each record is a fixed width. My first approach would be to parse each record simply using string.Substring(). Is there a better way? For example, the format could be described as: And an example file with two records could look like: SomeData0000000000123456SomeMoreData Data2 0000000000555555MoreData I just want to make sure I'm not overlooking a more elegant way than Substring(). Update: I ultimately went with a regex like Killersponge suggested: private readonly Regex reLot = new Regex(REGEX_LOT, RegexOptions.Compiled); const string REGEX_LOT = "^(? .{6})" + "(? .{16})" + "(? .{12})"; I then use the following to access the fields: Match match = reLot.Match(record); string field1 = match.Groups["Field1"].Value;
