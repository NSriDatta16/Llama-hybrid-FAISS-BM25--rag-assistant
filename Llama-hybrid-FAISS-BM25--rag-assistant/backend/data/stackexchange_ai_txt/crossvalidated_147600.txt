Metropolis-Hastings MCMC for Bayesian Regression in R

I am looking for a teaching example of a multivariate (not bivariate) implementation of Metropolis-Hastings for MCMC in R. I know several packages implement the algorithm more generally, but the code is difficult to follow and typically includes all sorts of other things besides this particular example. How do I implement Metropolis-Hastings for Bayesian multivariate regression like in this bivariate example?
