Are seasonal differencing and polynomial trends interchangeable?

Even though the title suggests just a simple question, it's a two-part. First, can a repeated seasonal differencing filter also remove a polynomial trend? In which conditions? I would guess only when the degree of the trend is a multiple of the lag used in the filter. Second, are both the seasonal differencing and the simple (repeated) differencing interchangeable? Is working with a time series by first taking out the trend and then seasonality the same as working with a t.s. by first taking out the seasonality and then the trend? Any help would be appreciated.
