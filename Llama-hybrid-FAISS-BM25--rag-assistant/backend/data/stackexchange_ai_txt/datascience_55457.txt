How to transform stock data for LSTM-based neural network

I am trying to classify stock returns using an LSTM-based neural network. I would like to use closing price and volume as features (see below), but am unsure of whether I need to transform these (e.g., by differencing) before feeding them into the network? If anybody has done this sort of thing before and could give me some advice, or could refer me to any papers, I'd be very grateful. Thanks, Jack
