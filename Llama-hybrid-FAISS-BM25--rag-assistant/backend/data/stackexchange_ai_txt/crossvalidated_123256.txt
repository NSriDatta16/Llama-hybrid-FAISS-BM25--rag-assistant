Determine size of quadrat by point pattern analysis

I'm working with a considerably large spatial point dataset that is irregularly spaced. As I want to average the data based on a particular quadrat size (essentially square grids) I was wondering if there is a general rule to determine the raster/grid size. After reading a few articles I ended up finding a formula which states that in 2 dimensions (2D), for square quadrats/grid/raster, the length of the side of a quadrat would be: âˆš(2A/N) where, A= area, & N = number of points. If my data is scattered in 3D, say for example data collected from ocean has X, Y coordinates as well as depth, Z, what rule of thumb should be applied? Reference to a R statistical package to do such analysis would be appreciated. I tried "spatstat" package where functions like quadratcount(), quadrat.test() exist, but I'm looking for something that would suggest quadrat size based on the nature (distance, number of samples, denisty, etc.) of the data.
