How do I get around the IE CSS percentage rounding problem?

I'm trying to create a dynamic site where I have three floating boxes next to eachother. They are 33.33% in width each. The container div around them is 75% in width. I've found an article about the problem here: CSS: Jumping columns I've also found an example of the same problem here: Jumping columns example Drag the window size to see the jumping in IE7 or earlier. Anyone knows if it's possible to get around this? (without Javascript)
