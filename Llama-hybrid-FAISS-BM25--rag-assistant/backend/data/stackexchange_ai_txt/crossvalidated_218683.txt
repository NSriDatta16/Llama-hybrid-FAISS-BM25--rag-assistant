Is it possible to create a SURFACE PLOT with this dataset?

I am new at software programming and I am starting to program some 3D graphs. I have this dataset ÏƒA Leverage PDPV 18.27% 35.78% 0.04% 3.10% 93.53% 1.07% 12.17% 50.15% 0.03% 2.99% 93.94% 1.56% 7.96% 75.61% 0.08% 18.37% 30.97% 0.00% 15.99% 41.97% 0.05% 8.72% 68.19% 0.27% 2.63% 91.55% 0.13% 16.24% 41.68% 0.02% 9.16% 63.56% 0.02% 21.47% 50.97% 5.16% 18.97% 15.03% 0.00% 8.91% 70.24% 0.14% 7.44% 74.18% 0.08% 8.55% 72.90% 0.32% 13.55% 37.98% 0.00% 21.62% 14.15% 0.00% 9.69% 62.92% 0.02% 14.64% 50.47% 0.16% 17.12% 55.80% 2.64% 14.25% 63.05% 1.15% 10.34% 74.29% 0.67% 10.05% 71.27% 0.55% 16.28% 30.83% 0.00% 9.94% 80.67% 6.47% 31.07% 32.35% 2.69% I would like to know if it is possible to use a 3D Surface Plot for these three variables. If it is not, can you please give me explain why not and provide a suggestion? Thanks a lot
