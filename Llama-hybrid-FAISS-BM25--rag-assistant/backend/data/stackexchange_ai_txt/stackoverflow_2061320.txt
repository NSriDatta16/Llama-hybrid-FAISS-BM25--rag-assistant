The queue management on the Netflix web site is one of the best UI's for re-ordering lists that I've seen. I also like the way it handles deletion. Unfortunately, I don't think you can see it unless you have a Netflix account. Here's a screenshot. You can edit the "List Order" text fields, but most people just drag and drop entire rows at a time, with target rows moving out of the way to make room. The "Top" button is also handy, since a new movie you might want to see soon will be added to the bottom of your queue. When you delete a row by clicking the X, a placeholder grey row stays behind with an undo button, until you leave the page. (source: thedigeratilife.com )
