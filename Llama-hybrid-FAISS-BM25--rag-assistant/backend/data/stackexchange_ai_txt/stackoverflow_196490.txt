I would look at the coverage report. Double check my tests. Notice that the code really is getting covered and not worry about hitting 100%. Code coverage is best used to find areas that you may have neglected to hit with your tests, but just focusing on getting 100% coverage as a goal is bad habit that can lead to you skipping tests that need to be written just because your tool shows 100%. Use the tool for what it can do but don't fall into the trap of letting the tool define what you do.
