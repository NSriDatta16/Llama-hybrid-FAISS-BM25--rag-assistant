A Packet Blocker Software

Can any one suggest me a packet blocking software ?? My requirement is to block packets within the LAN.(Internet does not come into picture). Supposing CLIENT_A communicating to CLIENT_B in the same network(LAN). I want a CLIENT_C (who is in the same network) to capture(I can use jpcap library's sniffer for this purpose) and block packets sent by CLIENT_A to CLIENT_B. How do i block packets over LAN..? Thank you in advance. Regards, Veenit Shah
