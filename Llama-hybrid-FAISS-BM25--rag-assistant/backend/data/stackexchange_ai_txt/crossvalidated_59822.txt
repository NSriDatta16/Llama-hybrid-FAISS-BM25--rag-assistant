SVM with quadratic loss

I've seen some statement where I got the impression that SVM with a quadratic loss is no more than having a kernel matrix where a multiple of the unit matrix is subtracted from the kernel. It was shown that in the dual problem the L2 loss constant can be merged into the kernel. But it wasn't clear to me. So the question: Are L1 and L2 loss for SVM substantially different? (Is L2 loss for SVM convex?) Or does L2 loss correspond to L1 loss with a shifted kernel? Or anything else?
