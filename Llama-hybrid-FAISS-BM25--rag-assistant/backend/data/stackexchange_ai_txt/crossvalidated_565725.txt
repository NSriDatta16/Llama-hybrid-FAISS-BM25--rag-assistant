Use K-means clustering on SVD/PCA of data

In an assignment I was suppose to perform K-means clustering on the MNIST dataset (just the 0's and the 1's) and then use SVD/PCA to visualize the data in two dimensions. I missunderstood this and performed the K-means on the SVD of the dataset and was told that this is not something one is supposed to do. However when I look at the result of the K-means clustering on the SVD of the data I get a very similar result (atleast I can't tell the difference from the 2-dim plot). What is the reason why you don't want to do this?
