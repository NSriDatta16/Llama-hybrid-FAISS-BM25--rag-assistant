Is one-hot encoding required for categorical variables in R (logistic regression)?

I created a logistic regression model in R and fit the model using the MumIn package. I have several categorical variables that were coded as factors. For example, season (summer, fall, winter, spring), and color (brown, tan, white). The regression seemed to work fine - I didn't have any warnings or errors, but I recently stumbled across one-hot encoding, and I am wondering if I need to re-code the factors. Is one-hot encoding necessary for all non-ordinal categorical variables? How would one-hot encoding change how the variables are analyzed in the model?
