Several of the free (or at least inexpensive) certifications (Coursera, etc.) have small projects that can get you a lot of practice. You can do them quick and dirty, or you can do them in way more detail than is asked for. The advantage over doing it alone is there is a forum where you can discuss your results and often community experts who can offer advice as well. And of course they are well tested with beginners so there are no insurmountable obstacles which can discourage learning. The Practical Machine Learning from Johns Hopkins comes to mind. But also the Stanford ML course from Andrew Ng is another possibility, and there are many more.
