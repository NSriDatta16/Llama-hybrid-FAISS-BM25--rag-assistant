Can we extract the non-significant variables by using stepwise algorithm?

In my logistic regression model, I want to remove all the significant variables and keep only the non-significant ones. Because I want to have only the variables that are not distinguished between « presence » and « absence » observations. I have to automatize this procedure in many cases. So I’m thinking to use the opposite of the results given by the Stepwise Algorithms and I want to know if it’s a good way to do this.
