Automatic reserved word escaping for Hibernate tables and columns

I am trying to use one Hibernate mapping for several different databases: H2, Oracle, MySql. Each database has a different list of reserved words. I would like Hibernate to automatically escape the reserved words. I know I can: use backticks to force escaping (escape everything just to be safe) change all identifiers so they are certainly not keywords in any database (make them ugly) tie the schema to a specific set of databases, escaping the union of keywords (will break if I add new database to the mix) Is there a more elegant solution?
