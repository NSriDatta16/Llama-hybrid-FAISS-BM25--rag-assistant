Just thinking of things to try here: The path to your file is within the CRMWeb directory? Do you have a virtual directory set up or anything? Does the /folder/index.html work in an IFRAME on the same form? Maybe try something you know will work just to make sure: http://stackoverflow.com or http://google.com . Also note that MS recommends putting all customizations in the /ISV/ folder. It shouldn't cause 404 errors, but I'm not sure if they'll consider this unsupported. Are you really calling a html extension? I believe you need to use prependOrgName (see SDK) for aspx and asmx extensions. I'm not sure if it would cause a 404 or just use your default organization off hand though.
