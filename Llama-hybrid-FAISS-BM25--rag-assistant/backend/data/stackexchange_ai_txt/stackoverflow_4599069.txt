Simulating actions by Overloading POST vs Embedding in the URI

I am currently reading Restful Java & Restful Web Services and have a style question about REST where these two books seem to disagree. Specifically what to do about changing the state of the resource. Restful Java has an example of an order that can be cancelled. It presents adding cancelled=true to the representation in a PUT request to make a state transfer. So you would have something like this. PUT /orders/333 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/xml true Then it proposes instead doing it as a separate uri embedded in the order (or as a Link: http header) PUT /orders/333 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/xml This made sense to me, until I read the Restful Web Services book which seems to fall on the side of posting the cancelled=true to an overloaded POST. I tend to like the /orders/333/cancelled because I can easily expose that there is a way to take this action using links, I am just curious as to if this is a good practice or if there is a better way? Thanks, Ransom
