As Oregonghost already hinted - The VectorC compiler might help. It does not really parallelize the code though, instead you can use it to leverage on extended command sets like mmx or sse. I used it for the most time-critical parts in a software rendering engine and it resulted in a speedup of about 150%-200% on most processors.
