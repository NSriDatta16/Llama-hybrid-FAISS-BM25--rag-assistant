If Binary feature is (0,1) type, then that can be used directly in the linear regression model. If by Binary feature, you mean having two levels for example ("yes","no"), then you can map ("yes","no") to (0,1) or you can create dummy variable. We never create dummy variables for continuous features. Ff you are making a prediction for continuous response variable then use the linear regression but if the response variable is binary then you should try logistic regression.
