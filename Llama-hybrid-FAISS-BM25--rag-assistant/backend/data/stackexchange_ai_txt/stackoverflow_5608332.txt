Sorting lines with numbers and word characters

I recently wrote a simple utility in Perl to count words in a file to determinate its frequency, that's how many times it appears. It's all fine, but I'd like to sort the result to make it easier to read. An output example would be: 4:an 2:but 5:does 10:end 2:etc 2:for As you can see, it's ordered by word, not frequency. But with a little help of :sort I could reorganize that. Using n , numbers like 10 go to the right place (even though it start with 1), plus a little ! and the order gets reversed, so the word that appears more is the first one. :sort! n 10:end 5:does 4:an 2:for 2:etc 2:but The problem is: when the number is repeated it gets sorted by word — which is nice — but remember, the order was reversed! for -> etc -> but How can I fix that? Will I have to use some Vim scripting to iterate over each line checking whether it starts with the previous number, and marking relevant lines to sort them after the number changes?
