what is asp's Request.ServerVariables("AUTH_USER") jsp equivalent?

well, on a IIS web site with integrated windows authentication and no anonymous access, I can retrieve the logon username of the user, something like like domain\user... is it possible to achieve this with jsp on tomcat? (or any other container) I've tried with request.getHeaderNames (on tomcat) but I only get host, user-agent, accept, accept-language, accept-encoding, accept-charset, keep-alive, connection, cookie, pragma, cache-control Hey, in asp and in php I get a lot more info!!! is there some way to enable that??? thanks a lot...
