Midpoint imputation is not a valid form of imputation in any survival model. That's because the midpoint has no statistical property that is justified for survival analyses. If I know that an event occurred between time $a$ and $b$ , then I highly doubt that the distribution of that time is symmetric (survival times are nearly always skewed), so $(a+b)/2$ is not a good estimator of the median or the mean. The ideal approach is to actually use an estimator of the hazard function to perform simulations of possible event times and pool multiply imputed datasets to obtain unbiased and efficient estimates of the effects. If the goal, on the other hand, is to have a pragmatic imputation, then I would prefer to impute the maximum $b$ since, barring any informed guess as to when an event may have occurred, it is most valid to simply use all "known" data at a given time. For a subject who is seronegative for Hepatitis B at survey Wave 1 and seropositive for Hepatitis B at survey Wave 2: to the best of my knowledge they were at risk for Hepatitis for the entire ellapsed period between survey waves.
