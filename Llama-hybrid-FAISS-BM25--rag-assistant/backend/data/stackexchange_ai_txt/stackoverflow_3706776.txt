There is no such thing as "the best NN structure". If you are lucky, you will find a structure that does the job, but that doesn't mean that that structure is the "best". I highly recommend you reading Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran . This book has a chapter on neural network. It explains many other artificial intelligence algorithms in a clear and concise way. You may find additional wide reviews on neural networks here and here There is a lecture course on iTunes-U called "Informatics for Nursing" that contains several lectures dedicated to ANN's UPDATE June 2019: the iTunes-U course is no longer available and I couldn't find it elsewhere Good luck
