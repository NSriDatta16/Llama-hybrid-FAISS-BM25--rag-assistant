Contrained coefficient in lm regression in R

I have a question about regression in R. I want to realise some OLS with this equations. But I don't know how to constraint to one the coefficients associate with the y and y(t-1) in the first equation. I would like to use lm equation but I don't know if is possible with this constraint. Thank's for your attention and your asnwers! Have a nice day!
