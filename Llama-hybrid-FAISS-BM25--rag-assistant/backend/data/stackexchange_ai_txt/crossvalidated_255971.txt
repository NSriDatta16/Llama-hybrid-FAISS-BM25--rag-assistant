The cropping is indeed performed for data augmentation (i.e., cropping is one data augmentation strategy), since if one applies two different crops to the same image, one obtains two different images. E.g., from {1}: For data augmentation, we randomly crop input images into 24 Ã— 24 pixels. As a side note, the CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. This means that 24x24 cropping keeps most of the image.
