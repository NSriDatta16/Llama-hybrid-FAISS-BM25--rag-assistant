Z-test with a lot of null values

I have a question concerning the validity of my email tests. I'm testing different email variations (between 2 and 4 variations usually) with different groups of members (hundreds of thousands members per group) and I'm measuring the revenue per member. I know the average revenue per member and the standard deviation for each group and use a Z-test to assess if the differences are significant or not. There are between 1 and 2 % of buyers within the groups which means that 98% of the members have a revenue of 0. My question is, is the Z-test still valid in this case as there are only few different data points?
