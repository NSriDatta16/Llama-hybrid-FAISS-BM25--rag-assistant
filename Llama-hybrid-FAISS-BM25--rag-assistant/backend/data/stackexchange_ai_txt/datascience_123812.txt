PCA for correlated variables

I have a question about PCA. I know that if you have correlated variables (x1, x2, x3, x4), its good to go do the PCA so that you can have new uncorrelated variables (pc1, pc2) used instead of the original correlated variables. My question is that if you have pc1, pc2 (for example), the loadings do not have to be influenced by the most highly correlated variables (letâ€™s say highly correlated variables are x1 and x2). You can have high influence from x1 and x3 for pc1. The highly correlated variables do not need to have high influence for pc1, pc2, pc3, or pc4. can you please confirm?
