Rate at which a Gaussian random variable is the maximum in a set of independent Gaussian random variables

Assume a random vector $X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$ where the random variables are independent and Gaussian distributed. At the same time, they are not identically distributed; they can have arbitrary means and variances. What is the probability that $x_k > x_i \forall i \neq k$? In other words, what is the probability that a realization of the random vector will yield $x_k$ as the maximum value in the vector? I'm looking for a closed form solution if one exists. Here's as far as I got addressing this problem. Assume $k=1$ without loss of generality. $P\left(x_1 > x_i \forall_{i > 1}\right) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p(x_1)P\left(x_1 > x_i \forall_{i>1}|x_1\right)dx_1$ $P\left(x_1 > x_i \forall_{i > 1}\right) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p(x_1)\prod_{i=2}^n P\left(x_1 > x_i|x_1\right)dx_1$ $P\left(x_1 > x_i \forall_{i > 1}\right) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p(x_1)\prod_{i=2}^nF_i(x_1)dx_1$ where $F_i(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function for $x_i$. I'm honestly not sure where to go from here. Any suggestions on whether there is a way forward or whether there is a better approach? Numerical integration is an option to move forward but I'd prefer a closed form solution if possible as it would open up other options for investigation in a larger problem I'm attacking. Thanks! UPDATE: The previous question-answer pair marked as providing an answer to this question is not for two reasons. (1) The question is seeking the probability that $x_k$ is the minimum, not the maximum and (2) no closed form solution is offered. If a closed form solution was derived, there might have been a similar approach in the answer that could have been leveraged here. But that is simply not present. UPDATE-2: There is now a closed form solution proposed to the related problem for the minimum that provides the basis for solving the question posed here.
