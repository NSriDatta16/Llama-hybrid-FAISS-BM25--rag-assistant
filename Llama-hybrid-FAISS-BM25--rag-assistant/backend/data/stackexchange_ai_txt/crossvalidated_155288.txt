It's almost certainly not the sample size. There are various things it might be The variables. In a comment, you asked about ways to improve them. The biggest thing is probably to get more variables that are more related to risk. But, if you are stuck with the ones you have, you can explore non-linear relationships e.g. with spline models. The model. You say you are using "logistic regression" so I am guessing it's binary logistic with values something like "paid" and "defaulted" but there are surely more levels than that. You might need ordinal or multinomial logistic with levels such as "paid on time", "paid late", and so on (I don't know the credit industry but you can surely have more levels) Another possibility is that the model should include the amount of credit in the DV. This might call for a hurdle model or something similar
