Academic studies which look at the probability of automation of different occupations or task do not think that statisticians will be soon substituted by computers. See for example the controversial Frey & Osborne (2013) study which ranks occupations according to their probability of computerization, statisticians are ranked low 213 out of 702 with a probability of 22% (see table in the appendix). If you are further interested, see also the Slate article here . Arntz et al. (2016) ( here an The Economist article) look at tasks rather than occupations for the European Union and come to a similar conclusion: Doing "Complex Math or Statistics" is statistically significantly negatively related to job automatibilty (see Table 3). But some caution is advisable, academics and/or economists have not always been very good in predicting the future (the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas for example concluded in 2003, a few years before the financial crises, that the "central problem of depression prevention as been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades." ). Both studies appear to be working paper, which are widely discussed but have not been published in standard peer-reviewed journals. Regarding the academic debate, here you can find an overview article about the state of research about automation.
