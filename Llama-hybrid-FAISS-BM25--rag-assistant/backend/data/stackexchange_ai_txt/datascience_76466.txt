Machine learning to predict pollution at a single location

I have 2 months of air pollution measured data for a location of interest. I am highly interested to play with machine learning algorithms to predict pollution at the same location (let say, for the next two months). Since air pollution is a geographic problem, does it make sense to apply and predict pollution at a single location using machine learning? Could someone shed a light on prons and cons of this?
