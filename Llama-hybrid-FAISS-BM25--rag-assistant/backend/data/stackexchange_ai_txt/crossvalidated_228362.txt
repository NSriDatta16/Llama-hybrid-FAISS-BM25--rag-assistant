Setting average as baseline rather than a dummy variable in a glm

I have binomial data (meaning k successes out of n trials) for a set of conditions. I would like to fit a glm in order to quantify the effect of each condition on the success. Since the data are overdisperesed I thought of using a negative binomial glm ( glm.nb from the R MASS package does that). Code snippet (though not really overdisperesed): set.seed(1) df Obviously cond A will be set as baseline and all effects will be relative to it. However, this makes interpretation very difficult for me. Therefore my question is how do I fit a glm.nb model where the effects are relative to the mean across all conditions rather than the dummy variable set as baseline?
