Testing a hypothesis about the size of coefficients in a linear relationship

In the project, I was asked to determine whether $0.5(\text{Father's Height} + \text{Mother's Height}) +6.5$ correctly predicts the height for boys. To do this, I've collected 50 male students' height and their parents'. $n=50$ However, I am not sure how to run my hypothesis test. I used confidence interval to classify Tall, Average and Short with 90 percent of the sample are classified as average height.(Actually I'm not sure about the percentage too, is 90% a good choice?) Here the problem comes. Now, I have 2 tests in my mind that can be used, chi-square goodness-of-fit test, and binomial test. By using chi-squared test, I'm going to test whether the formula correctly predicts the category a person falls into(eg. Short,Average). If I use binomial test, I am going to test whether the probability of success prediction, $p\geq0.85$, and a prediction is considered as success if the predicted height differs from the actual height within 2.5cm. But, I don't know which are better. Or, can anyone suggest a better test?
