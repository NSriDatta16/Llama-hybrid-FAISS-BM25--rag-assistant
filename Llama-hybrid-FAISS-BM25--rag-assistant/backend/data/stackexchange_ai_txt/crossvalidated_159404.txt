Implementing bayesian networks in python for gaze estimation using visual saliency

I am developing an appearance based gaze estimation system based on opencv and python. I have currently developed a prototype which can estimate the gaze based on active calibration, which is cumbersome at times. The following paper presents a technique based on visual saliency map for implicit training of the system based on bayesian networks- http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~cvrl/chenj/1669.pdf I have already obtained saliency map for a couple of images from MIT archives but am unaware on how to implement it in the algorithm mentioned as it involves indefinite integrals. And as far as Bayesian networks are concerned I am a noob. I already tried looking for similar implementations but could not find any, will anyone be kind enough to point me to some material to understand and start implementing the system myself? I am pretty new to machine learning, so forgive me if the question is trivial
