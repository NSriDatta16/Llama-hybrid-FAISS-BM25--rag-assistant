Can the difference between the means of two groups lie outside the confidence interval for the difference?

I received this question from a colleague which left me with a desire to find out a bit more about it. If you have two groups A and B with means--for example, 7.9 and 5.8--is it possible that the confidence interval for the difference between the groups can be such that it doesn't encompass the current difference? In this case the 95% CI is 0.9-1.79 when the difference is 2.1. (Edit: For clarification this was from an M.Sc. statistics question where 150 angina pasients were divided into two groups (A and B) and treated with differing combinations of physical activity and medication. Cholesterol levels were measured after the intervention: Group A had an average of 7.9 +/- 4 mmol/l and group B 5.8 +/- 2.9 mmol/l. The CI stated is for the difference between the group averages) I believe this is possible but I would like to be able to give him a concrete example (preferably with some data that he can process in R) to show him where this can occur. Cheers!
