upcase in rails

This is very basic but not working. I want to add a callback (after_save) to upcase a field input. In my model I have: after_save :upcase_tax_label def upcase_tax_label self.tax1_label.upcase! self.tax2_label.upcase! end So when I edit it should upcase the value and render in CAPS. but not. What's wrong? Thanks for your help
