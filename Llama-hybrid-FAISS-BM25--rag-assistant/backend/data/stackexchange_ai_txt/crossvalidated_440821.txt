I would say that the whole tree (or, in 14.5 the two dimensional space) is a model. I'd say it's analogous to logistic regression. We call a logistic regression one model, not two (for binary logistic) or some higher number (for ordinal or multinomial logistic). All the parts of the tree go together. Calling it one model seems to me to account for this.
