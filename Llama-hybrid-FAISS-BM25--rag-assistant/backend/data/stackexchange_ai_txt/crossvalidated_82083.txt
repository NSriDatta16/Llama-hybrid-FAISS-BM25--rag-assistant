You say "have exactly the same characteristics". So, if you can enumerate these characteristics that are important for you and the application at hand, then you can deploy a test for each one of those. Probably you would need to specify some tolerance level for each metric. You can decide that two distributions are the same if they pass all the tests. From a pair of distributions you can easily generalise to a set. If you are after a single metric for comparing distributions you can go for the standard Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence . Pay attention that the simple measure is not symmetric - although there is a symmetric form discussed in the wikipedia article.
