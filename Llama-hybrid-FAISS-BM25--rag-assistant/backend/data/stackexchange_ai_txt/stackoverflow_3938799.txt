I tried GWT Designer, http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/tools/gwtdesigner/index.html , but I think for now I'll stick to code the guis myself by hand. The main reasons are: Sometimes, it takes a little while (longer than I can wait) to load the design mode. Sometimes it breaks after you modify code underneath. Sometimes, does not do what you expect it to do. I would suggest you giving it a try and see if it works out for your needs. In my opinion, the experience using it has been frustrating than encouraging.
