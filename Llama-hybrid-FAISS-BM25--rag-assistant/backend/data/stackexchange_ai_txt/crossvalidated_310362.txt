I'm posting my own answer here because I think it is probably correct, but feel free to please input ideas. @MossMurderer brought my attention, in the comments to the original question, an interesting proof . That is, ${n \choose k}$ is maximum at $k=n/2$. This means that if I choose my resample size $k$ to be $n/2$, I will be maximizing the number of unique draws $x_i$. This is desirable for a very simple reason: to preform the bootstrap, I compute the statistic $m$ for each realization $x_i$. Let's call the results of that calculation a vector $M = [m(x_1),... m(x_{1000})]$. The estimated error in the statistic $m$ is then something like $\sigma(M)$. Of course, you only ever use the standard deviation $\sigma$ as a statistic if you can safely assume your limiting distribution to be gaussian. If we ensure that we maximize the number of unique $x_i$ by setting $k = n/2$, then we have sampled the $M$ space as well as we possibly can, and therefore $M$ will be as close to gaussian as is possible. In this way, the measure $\sigma(M)$ will be most reliable when the length $k$ of each $x_i$ is $n/2$. I apologize if this is difficult to read - please edit if you feel you are more eloquent than I.
