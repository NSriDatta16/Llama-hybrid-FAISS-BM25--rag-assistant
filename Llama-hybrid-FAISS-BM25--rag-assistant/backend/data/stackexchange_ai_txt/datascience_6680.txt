Sequence of numbers as single feature

Is it possible to use a sequence of numbers as one feature? For example, using libsvm data format: : : +1 1:123.02 2:1.23 3:5.45,2.22,6.76 +1 1:120.12 2:2.23 3:4.98,2.55,4.45 -1 1:199.99 2:2.13 3:4.98,2.22,6.98 ... Is there any special machine learning algorithm for this kind of data?
