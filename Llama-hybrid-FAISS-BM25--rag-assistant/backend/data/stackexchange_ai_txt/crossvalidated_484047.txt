Question about unit root testing and non-stationarity of time series with a trend using ADF test for further making regression

I am new to time series analysis and I have the following question The purpose of my research is to build a regression between two time series. The length of my sample is 21 observations. I have a situation like this: The ADF test with trend and constant shows that the time series is stationary (although it has a trend). The question that interests me: Do I need to take the first differences of such a time series? Or can a regression be done with the original time series values (i.e. without the first differences)? If yes, then if there is a trend in the time series, then it is necessary to use the ADF test without a trend?
