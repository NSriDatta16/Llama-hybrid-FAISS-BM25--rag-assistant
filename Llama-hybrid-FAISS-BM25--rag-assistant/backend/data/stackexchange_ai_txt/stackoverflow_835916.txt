Unit/Integration Testing code that uses HttpCurrentContext

Trying to get Nunit working in ASP.Net. The problem is, I'm testing a custom control - which references a Global Resource. When I try to unit test it /// [Test] public void TestSetAndGetNumber() { PhoneNumber phone = new PhoneNumber(PhoneNumber.NumberType.Business, "", true, ""); string expectedString = "1-800-Goat-Phone"; string resultString = "1-800-Goat-Phone"; resultString = phone.Value = resultString; Assert.AreEqual(expectedString, resultString, "GetNumberMatch method returned unexpected result."); Assert.Fail("Create or modify test(s)."); } I will get "cannot load App_GlobalResources". Trying to figure out if maybe I should attempt to simulate HttpContext Using You've been Haacked blog post but nobody has verified this is do-able.
