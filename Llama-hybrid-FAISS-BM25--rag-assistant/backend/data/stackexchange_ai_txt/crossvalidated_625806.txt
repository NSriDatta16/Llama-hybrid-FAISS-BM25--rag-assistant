VAR on I(1) and I(3) time series

I want to analyze the effect of interest rate to exchange rate with VAR. After some unit root and stationarity tests (ADF, PP, KPSS), all of the exchange rate time series are I(1) series, whereas interest rates are I(3) series (the attached graph shows the interest rate series). Is it still possible to use VAR with the 1st difference of exchange rate and the 3rd difference of interest rate? Feel free to give any suggestions. Thank you
