Is it possible to apply Blend behavior using style or template?

I'm very happy with my small collection of Blend behaviors, actions and triggers - they are easy to use and powerful. But I still can't figure out how to avoid applying them on per element basis. For example, if I have a behavior as such: and I have a few draggable rectangles in my Window, each of them has to have the above markup to be draggable. What I would like to do is to be able to write something like this: It could be style, template, or some other way to avoid behavior or action markup repetition. The best solution I came up so far is creating a special behavior for the container (when attached, it enumerates children attaching to the children events). Any ideas?
