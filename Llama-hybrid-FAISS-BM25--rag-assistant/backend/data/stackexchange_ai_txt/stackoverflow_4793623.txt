Clone all 'observe' of a cloned element using Prototype

I have a sortable list (done using prototype and scriptaculous): you can sort its elements or drag them into another list. When I drop the element (let's call it ELEMENT_1) of a list into another one what I do is a 'clone' of the dropped element and then I insert (appendChild) it into the new list. ELEMENT1 had some 'observe' (clicking on it do something, double-clicking on it do something else) that are of course lost when I do the cloning.. I want the cloned element to have the same 'observe' of ELEMENT1. How can I do that? Thanks in advance
