I guess you can approximate the likelihood by how many simulations match the real data and could then try to get a handle on observed Fisher Information, alternatively you could try to get some likelihood ratio test (either is a bit tricky and your approximation to the likelihood may need some smoothing out). If you are willing to be Bayesian, then you can consider Approximate Bayesian Calculations.
