Why model data using parametric distributions instead of empirical?

I've been wondering why the use of empirical distributions in research is not as prevalent as I think it should be given my understanding (likely misinformed) that an empirical distribution would give the most accurate representation of a data set as opposed to a parametric model. I think I do recognize the risk of over fitting using empirical distributions but I would also like to think that this risk can be mitigated via bootstrapping methods. Clearly though, my assumptions must be wrong as I've yet to chance upon any journals that made use of empirical distributions for modelling and deriving conclusions. The question is why is this so? For example, if the black-scholes model fails because the log normal assumption of stock price behavior is not representative, why not use empirical distributions to model stock prices instead of funky jump-diffusion models and so on, which are not always entirely representative as well. I also wonder if industry practitioners, regardless of background, do actually utilize empirical distributions for their analyses? Hoping to hear your thoughts.
