I read an article saying that, to avoid ANR, service is sometimes not enough. Thread is needed. See: http://blog.elsdoerfer.name/2009/06/03/writing-an-android-widget-what-the-docs-dont-tell-you/ "you are encouraged to use a service to perform your widget updates if you are doing anything that might take a little longer, in order to avoid Application Not Responding (ANR) timeouts. However, this will usually not be enough. ...... The solution is to have your service start a separate thread. For an example, see Jeffrey Sharkey's android-sky Widget." Any thoughts?
