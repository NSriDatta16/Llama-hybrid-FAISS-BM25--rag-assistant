Elegant way to go from list of objects to dictionary with two of the properties

i seem to write this code over and over again and wanted to see if there was a better way of doing it more generically. I start out with a list of Foo objects Foo[] foos = GenerateFoos(); I think want to create a dictionary where the key and value are both properties of Foo for example: Dictionary fooDict = new Dictionary (): foreach (Foo foo in foos) { fooDict[foo.Name] = foo.StreetAddress; } is there anyway of writing this code generically as it seems like a basic template where there is an array of objects, a key property a value property and a dictionary. Any suggestions? I am using VS 2005 (C#, 2.0)
