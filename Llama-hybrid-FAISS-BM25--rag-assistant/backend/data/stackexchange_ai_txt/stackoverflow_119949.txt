When to use test scripts over unit testing?

I am currently working on a project that has been in production for over two years. The project makes extensive use of unit testing and scripted UI tests. Initialy unit tests covered the system framework, business rules and state transitions (or workflow). Test scripts are used for black box testing. However, over time the cost of maintaining our full set of unit tests has become increasingly expensive especially those relating to state. After a bit of investigation we have found that test scripts are more effective (that is, provide better coverage) and are cheaper to maintain than unit tests relating to workflow. This isn't to say the value of unit tests has been completely negated but it does raise this question whether some classes of unit tests can be dropped in favour of test scripts. Our project is run on an iterative incremental model.
