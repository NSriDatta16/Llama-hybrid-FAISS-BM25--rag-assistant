Use This will allow you to use your @RequestMapping annotated handlers along with your XML configured handlers. This was taken from the API docs: If you define custom HandlerMapping beans in your DispatcherServlet context, you need to add a DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping bean explicitly, since custom HandlerMapping beans replace the default mapping strategies. I would not use the namespace directives (e.g. mvc:annotation-driven) when attempting to mix and match Spring MVC XML config and Annotation config. In fact, I try and avoid namespace directives all together. They are not well documented, and always less powerful than simply defining the beans directly in your XML config. Also, namespace directives tend to promise a lot ("just put this in your XML config and everything will work") but do not deliver because it's not always clear how they work and this makes debugger very difficult. Here's an example of what I'm talking about in the above paragraph. Say you want to use some interceptors on your annotation configured controllers. This is pretty easy as long as you want to use the same interceptors for every controller. But if you want to use different interceptors for different controllers (when using annotation-based configuration), you cannot do this.
