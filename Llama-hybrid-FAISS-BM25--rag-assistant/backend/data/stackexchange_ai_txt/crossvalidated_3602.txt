Another way to solve such a problem is to impute the missing data for the shorter series using a time series model which may or may not make sense in a particular context. In your context, imputing the stock prices into the past would mean that you are asking the following counter-factual question: What would be the stock price for company X had it gone public n years in the past instead of when it actually went public? Such a data imputation could potentially be done by taking into account stock prices of related companies, general market trends etc. But, such an analysis may not make sense or may not be needed given the goals of your project.
