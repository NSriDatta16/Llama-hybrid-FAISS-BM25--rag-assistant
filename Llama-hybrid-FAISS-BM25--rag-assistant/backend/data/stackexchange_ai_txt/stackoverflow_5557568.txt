You already got a few Java answers, but in C++, when you create an array with automatic storage duration (I guess what's what you mean by "off the heap"), you can pass arguments to the constructors of each element: std::string array[] = {"foo", "bar", "baz"}; or, if there is no implicit conversion std::complex another[] = { std::complex (1.0, 1.1), std::complex (3.0, -1.1) }; But this is not possible when the array is created with new[] . However, std::vector is the standard C++ approach for dynamic arrays, which of course allows this: std::vector vector(100, "foo"); // 100 elements, each set to "foo"
