Checking trained CNN on the images

I trained my CNN (model) classifier and want to check it on some new images. I have image x, so this syntax works for me for one image: torch.argmax(model(x)) What if I want to classify 2 more images (different classes), let's say images y and z? Should I for every image write a new line or is it possible to put in the code above 3 together?
