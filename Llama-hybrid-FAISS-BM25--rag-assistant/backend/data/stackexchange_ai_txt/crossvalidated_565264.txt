How to determine if the binary response was just randomly assigned and not due to any of the predictors

I am practicing fitting models to data sets that I could find on Kaggle but I don't know how these data sets were generated. I remember there was a data set I played around with in order to fit a classifier. I tried lgbm because one of the categorical predictors has large cardinality and I did not want to do one-hot encoding. I also tried just fitting lgbm to numerical features only. I also tried catboost and simple linear regression. After trying these algorithms, I noticed that the logloss on the test data was more or less the same for each algorithm and for each specification (deciding which features to include/exclude, etc.). I also found out that if for each sample in the test set, if I assign the predicted probability of being in class 0 and class 1 to be the proportion of samples in the data set belonging to each class, the logloss of this model without any predictors is roughly the same as the logloss I obtained with the machine learning algorithms taking into account various predictors. This is telling me that the features may be insufficient to explain the output since I'm doing as well without them. At the same time, since I don't know how the data set was generated, I am unsure if the response was just randomly assigned. Is there any other way to verify this?
