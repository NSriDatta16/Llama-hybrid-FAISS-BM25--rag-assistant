A caching solution for iPhone application

What I'm building is simply an application that fetches data over the web and displays them on the iOS views. Data are text and, sometimes, images / music files / movies. I'd like to use some caching solution for the media. What it needs to do is: get an url of the file check if it's alredy downloaded in the cache storage, if it is, serve it if not, download it while also checking how much of the storage the current cache uses, and, if it's over the quota, delete oldest files Best would be to have a simple interface for this - so I can just give an url and get the file of it (while files can change over time and reside on the same URL, so this should be handled too, in a perfect case). Anyone knows a library to do it, on iPhone/iPad application?
