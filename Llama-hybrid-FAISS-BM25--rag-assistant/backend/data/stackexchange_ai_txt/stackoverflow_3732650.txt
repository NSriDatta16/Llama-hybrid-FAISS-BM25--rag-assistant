I don't know which DBMS you're using, but some will get upset that you are using .avg (because avg is reserved) and require you to escape it. Try changing it from avg to average , just as a test: SELECT comp_table.average FROM (SELECT column_1, avg(column_2) as average FROM table_1, GROUP BY column_1) comp_table
