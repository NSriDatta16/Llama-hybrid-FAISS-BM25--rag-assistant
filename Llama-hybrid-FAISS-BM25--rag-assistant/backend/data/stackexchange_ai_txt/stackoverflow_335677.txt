Is there a DBI proxy that handles SQL restrictions and transactions?

I am looking for a DBI (or similar) proxy that supports both SQL restrictions and transactions. The two I know about are: DBD::Proxy DBD::Gofer DBD::Proxy The problem I have found with DBD::Proxy is that its server, DBI::ProxyServer , doesn't just restrict queries coming in over the network (which I want), but it also restricts queries generated internally by the database driver. So, for example, with DBD::Oracle , ping no longer works, as well as many other queries it issues itself. I can't just allow them, because: That is quite a bit of internal knowledge of DBD::Oracle and would be quite fragile. The whitelist is query_name => 'sql' , where query_name is the first word of whatever is passed to prepare . DBD::Oracle has a lot of internal queries, and the first word of many of them is select (duh). So, it doesn't seem I can use DBD::Proxy DBD::Gofer I haven't tried DBD::Gofer, because the docs seem to tell me that I can't use transactions through it: CONSTRAINTS ... You can’t use transactions AutoCommit only. Transactions aren’t supported. So, before I write my own application-specific proxy (using RPC::PLServer ?), is there code out there that solves this problem?
