Non Linear transformation of Random Variable

I have a pdf say $p(x)$ . Now, I apply some transformation (may be linear or non-linear) to the variable $x$ say $g(x)$ . Let the new pdf be called $p(y)$ . For, a small change in $x$ say $dx$ , there will be some change in $g(x)$ or $y$ say $dy$ . Since the area under the curve has to be same, $p(x)dx = p(y)dy$ . I was studying Bishop Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition and on page 18, it says under nonlinear change of variable, a pdf transforms differently from a normal function. I think it will also change differently for a linear transformation. Secondly, in the book it says, $$p(y)=p(x)\left| \frac{dx}{dy} \right|$$ I also don't understand the mod. $p(x)$ , $p(y)$ , $dx$ , $dy$ can't be negative.
