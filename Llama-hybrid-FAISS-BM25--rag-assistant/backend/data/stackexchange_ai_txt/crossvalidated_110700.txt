The decision boundary for 1-NN algorithm is the union of the Voronoi cells of each training instance. As for SVM, when you use RBf kernel and if there is no regularization, the decision boundary will also be an approximation of the union of the Voronoi cells. So in this case, these methods are the same in terms of performance, but depending on the structure of the dataset, their complexities could be very much different. If the number of suport vectors in SVM is high, then both training and testing complexities of SVM will be much higher than 1-NN. The power of SVM, however, will become clear when you do regularization.
