There are various algorithms that fall into the category of "machine learning", and which is right for your situation depends on the type of data you're dealing with. If your data essentially consists of mappings of a set of questions to a set of diagnoses each of which can be yes/no, then I think methods that could potentially work include neural networks and methods for automatically building a decision tree based on the test data. I'd have a look at some of the standard texts such as Russel & Norvig ("Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach") and other introductions to AI/machine learning and see if you can easily adapt the algorithms they mention to your particular data. See also O'Reilly, "Programming Collective Intelligence" for some sample Python code of one or two algorithms that might be adaptable to your case. If you can read Spanish, the Mexican publishing house Alfaomega have also published various good AI-related introductions in recent years.
