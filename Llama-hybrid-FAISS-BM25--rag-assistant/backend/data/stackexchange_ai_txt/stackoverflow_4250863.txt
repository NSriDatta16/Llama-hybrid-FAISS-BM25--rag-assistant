App data security on jailbroken iPhones

If I'm not mistaken (and if I am mistaken, here or in what I say below, please correct me), non-jailbroken iPhones provide two broad areas of storage space: for apps (and data that comes bundled with apps); for user-managed files. I understand that the former is protected storage, meaning that data bundled with an app and stored in that area is not accessible to the user except via the app. On a jailbroken iPhone, does this protected area still exist? If so, what protections remain; i.e. is data stored within it still inaccessible to the user?
