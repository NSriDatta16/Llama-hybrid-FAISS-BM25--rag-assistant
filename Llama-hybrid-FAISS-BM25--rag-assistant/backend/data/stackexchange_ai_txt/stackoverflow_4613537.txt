I think you didnt understand what i mean. If i want to parse some musical album info from XML and save it into Data Storage should make something like Album* album = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Album" inManagedObjectContext:context ]; to create object where i will save data from XML or i have to create some another Album class not inherited from NSManagedObject to work with it while parsing
