There is no single correct way to deal with missing values when calculating an average, however, it would certainly be wrong to divide one single value by 100 (if there are 99 missing values). Taking the average of the non-missing values The simplest option would be to just average the numbers based on how many non-missing values you have (i.e. the missing values are null). However, the problem with this is that it might not be very representative and thus would be misleading. You may wish to set a threshold of how many values are present before you average them, and the rest are not reported. Replacing the missing data There are various techniques to replace the missing values, for example single or multiple imputation. You could replace missing values with the previous value, or a randomly selected value from the same metric, or every missing value could be replaced by the mean value for that metric. If the data you have fits a model, you could replace the missing values based on what the model predicts. Another consideration is that perhaps the missing values have something in common. For example, if one of your metrics measured how well the company was doing financially, it would make sense if companies who are doing badly would be more likely to not give you that value!
