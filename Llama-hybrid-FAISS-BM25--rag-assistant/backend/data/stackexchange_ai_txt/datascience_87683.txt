feature importance with CNN

I can use shap to extract important features for Dense NN. However, for CNN, I encountered two problems: the feature order may be messed up or combined after the filtering and pooling. Can I still use shap or other approach to show the important features for CNN? I tried to use shap , but the shap_summary_plot shews the bar plot to the left and the plot_size does not help to adjust it.
