Is there any way to define custom entities in Spacy

1) I have just started working on NLP the basic Idea is to extract meaningful information from text. For this I am using "Spacy". As far as I have studied Spacy has following entities. ORG PERSON DATE MONEY CARDINAL etc. But I want to add custom entities like: Nokia-3310 should be labeled as Mobile and XBOX should be labeled as Games 2) Can I find some already trained models in Spacy to work on ?
