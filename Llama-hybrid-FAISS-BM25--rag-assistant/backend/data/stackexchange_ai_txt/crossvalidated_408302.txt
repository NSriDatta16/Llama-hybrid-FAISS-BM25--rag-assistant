Where does the prior distribution $p(z)$ for adversarial autoencoders come from?

I am trying to understand how an adversarial autoencoder works. The discriminator takes as an input the aggregated posterior $q(z)$ generated from the decoder and matches this against the prior distribution $p(z)$ which is the true distribution from the input data. What I do not understand is how the prior distribution $p(z)$ is calculated. The original paper repeatedly refers to it as an 'arbitrary prior distribution' a term I'm not familiar with. Looking at implementations of AAE on github, it seems people generally assume $p(z)$ follows a normal distribution. I cannot understand why we would have this assumption, and furthermore why we would want to impose this onto the network.
