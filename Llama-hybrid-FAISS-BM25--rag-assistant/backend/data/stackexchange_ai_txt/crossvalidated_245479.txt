Iff you know what $n_j$ is for each $j$ subgroup of $N$ subgroups you can by working backwards to calculate $RSS= \sum_{k=1}^N (y_k - f(x_k))^2$ for the whole population piecewise, and then calculate the group standard deviation. That is, in detail, as follows. For the whole population, $RSS$ is the sum of the $j$ individual $RSS$ values. $RSS= \sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{j}} (y_{i,j} - f(x_{i,j}))^2=\sum_{j=1}^{N}RSS_j$. Note that calculated standard deviations are $\text{SD}_j=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{j}} (y_{i,j} - f(x_{i,j}))^2}{n_j-1}}=\sqrt{\frac{RSS_j}{n_j-1}}$. Thus, $RSS_j=(n_j-1)SD_j^2$, then total $RSS=\sum_{j=1}^{N}(n_j-1)SD_j^2$. Since the sum total number of samples is $n_{all}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}n_j$, our group SD is finally $\text{SD}_{all}=\sqrt{\frac{RSS}{n_{all}-1}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}[(n_j-1)SD_j^2]}{n_{all}-1}}$ Note also, that the calculated standard deviation generally underestimates population standard deviation when $n small number bias , and only gets to about 1% error when $n$ is approximately $100$. Thus, the last thing you want to do is use some averaging technique other than that suggested above.
