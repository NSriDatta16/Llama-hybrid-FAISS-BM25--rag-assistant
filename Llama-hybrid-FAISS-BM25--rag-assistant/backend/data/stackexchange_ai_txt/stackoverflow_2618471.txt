I think you should be manipulating the underlying NSTextStorage for the text view, rather than invoking the view's event-related methods directly. This is a pretty classic example of a Model-View-Controller architecture: the NSTextView is the view and the NSTextStorage is the model. Whenever possible, you want to manipulate the model directly and let the controller/view layers deal with updating the view as they see fit.
