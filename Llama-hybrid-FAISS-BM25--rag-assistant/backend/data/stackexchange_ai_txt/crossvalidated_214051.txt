Some answers for your updates: Yes, there are in general multiple local minima. (If there was only one, it would be called the global minimum.) The local minima will not necessarily be of the same value. In general, there may be no local minima sharing the same value. No, it's not convex unless it's a one-layer network. In the general multiple-layer case, the parameters of the later layers (the weights and activation parameters) can be highly recursive functions of the parameters in previous layers. Generally, multiplication of decision variables introduced by some recursive structure tends to destroy convexity. Another great example of this is MA(q) models in times series analysis. Side note: I don't really know what you mean by permuting nodes and weights. If the activation function varies across nodes, for instance, and you permute the nodes, you're essentially optimizing a different neural network. That is, while the minima of this permuted network may be the same minima, this is not the same network so you can't make a statement about the multiplicity of the same minima. For an analogy of this in the least-squares framework, you are for example swapping some rows of $y$ and $X$ and saying that since the minimum of $\|y - X\beta\|$ is the same as before that there are as many minimizers as there are permutations.
