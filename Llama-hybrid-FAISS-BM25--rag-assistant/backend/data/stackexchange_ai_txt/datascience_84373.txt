Because sklearn uses the CART algorithm it cannot accept categorical data as-is (as you have pointed out). There is an existing ticket out to change this. The issue really should be rephrased as supporting categorical splitting on Decision Trees - not Random Forest, as Random Forrest is simply the ensemble method using these decision trees as fitters. I don't know of a python package that supports this functionality but I do suspect that it would help increase performance because it would avoid a common pitfall of using random forest on hot-encoded data; see One-Hot Encoding is making your Tree-Based Ensembles worse, hereâ€™s why? In the meantime - I use TargetEncoder when I know I need to use Random Forrest. It allows the categorical data to be encoded in a "smart" fashion without needing to use one-hot encoding.
