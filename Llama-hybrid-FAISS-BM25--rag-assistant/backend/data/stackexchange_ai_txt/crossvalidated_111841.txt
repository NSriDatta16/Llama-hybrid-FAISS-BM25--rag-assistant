Interpreting ordinal regression result and calculating individual percentage contributions of independent variables

I ran an ordinal logistic regression in R using the polr function on a survey analysis dataset. The responses of the dependent variable range from Poor to Excellent. The responses to the independent variables range from 1 to 5 (1 being Poor and 5 being Excellent). I obtained the following result: I want to measure the individual percentage contribution of my independents (R1, R2,...,R17) to the dependent variable. Is there a way to do this. Thanks for any help.
