Moving Items on a PDF Document

I have been charged with working on a feature for certificates my company prints out for clients when they completing specific training course. Currently we provide them with a basic PDF file that looks like the average Joe award but many of our customers want to be able to add and reposition content on the actual PDF and then print them. I began using an open source C# .NET code solution called PDFSharp and found that had a lot of great features but I am unsure as to how I would make newly placed items (let's say a user imported their own certificate ribbon or seal graphic) movable. Is there any C# features I should take a look at or any third-party software that will do all of this for me? I am open to either route. Thanks in advance!
