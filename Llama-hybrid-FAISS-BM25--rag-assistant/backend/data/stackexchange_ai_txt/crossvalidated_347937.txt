An important difference between methods like PCA and SVD with tSNE is that tSNE is using a non-linear scale. This often makes for plots that are more visually balanced but be careful interpreting them in the same manner as you would for PCA. This difference likely accounts for the difference between the plots shown above. See the following article for more detail on interpreting the non-linear scale of tSNE: https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/ (Wattenberg, et al., "How to Use t-SNE Effectively", Distill, 2016. http://doi.org/10.23915/distill.00002 ) It is not unexpected that the tSNE data will be mixing up the "clusters" as they are not that distinct in the PCA data. Some points within clusters 2 and 4 are more distant from the cluster centroid than the difference between the clusters for example. You would get very different clustering results with a different k-parameter. Unless you have a specific biological rationale for using 5 clusters, I would recommend using a graph-based or unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach.
