There is no real issue with using a self signed certificate in private use, that is use when you control all of the systems that need to trust the homebrew root certificate. You manually install your root cert onto each of the systems that need to trust it. You can do this in production as well for browser use - for example within an organisation where the root ca can be rolled out via software distrubution method - there is no reason to go to the expense of paying a Certificate Authority that Microsoft happens to trust. [edit] In terms of secruity the issue is one of containing the private key for your root certificate, as long as you can ensure that stays private then you can validate any certificate off that root.
