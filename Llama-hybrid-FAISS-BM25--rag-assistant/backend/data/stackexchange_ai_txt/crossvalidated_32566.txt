Generalized estimating equations output in SPSS

I am hoping to confirm that I have a suitable way to analyse the different proportions of people who are categorized as left lateralised on the one hand, or bilateral/right lateralised on the other in two different tasks. I cannot use an ordinary logistic regression (or chi square test) as the conditions are repeated measures. I have used the Generalized Estimating Equations option in SPSS to allow for the within subjects individual intercepts to vary as for repeated measures, but am wondering how best to interpret the output to show that the proportion of those in each category differs between the two tasks. Is it correct that I need to re-estimate the model but remove condition from my fixed effects and then compare measures of model fit in each estimation for a significant difference (e.g.using the AIC)? Or should I just stick to looking for a significant Wald statistic and leave it at that? My final question is how to interpret the pairwise comparisons from this type of analysis. This shows a significant difference between my two conditions, but as I understand it to be a log odds value I'm not quite sure where to go with it. I do apologise if I haven't made my problems clear, I am quite new to this.
