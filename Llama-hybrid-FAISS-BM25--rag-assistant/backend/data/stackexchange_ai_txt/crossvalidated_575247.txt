$Y_{k+1}=AY_{k}$ where any general $\ Y_{i}=[Y_{1} \ Y_{2}\ Y_{3}\ Y_{4}\ ...... \ Y_{p}]^{T} $ and I want to estimate the optimal A in MSE sense. So you have an exact, deterministic, linear relationship. The only thing that is missing is the coefficient values in $A$ . Then equation-by-equation OLS will return you exact estimates, and they will be MSE-optimal. I am trying to figure out a problem where this is perhaps not even $ Y_{k+1}$ but rather maybe just an estimate of it. If you change your problem by making $Y_{k+1}$ only observable with some error while $Y_1,\dots,Y_k$ are observable without error, you get a multivariate multiple regression. There is no MSE-optimal estimator for that. If you were to restrict your attention to linear estimators and the error variance were given, it would be a form of ridge regression (a univariate case is discussed in Dave Giles' blog "A Regression "Estimator" that Minimizes MSE" . But that is perhaps too restrictive.
