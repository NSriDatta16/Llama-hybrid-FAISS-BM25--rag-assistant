I don't believe Flash supports copy and paste like this. I've looked into this a number of times. I believe your best bet is to go down the same road we went down when trying to solve this problem. We use DotNetNuke as our CMS and we created a MetaWeblog bridge for DotNetNuke so you can manage your content using MetaWeblog clients like Windows Live Writer. This has worked really well for us, since the end users can edit their web content in a Windows application rather than a web-based editor which gives the user more stability and a much wider range of features, like the ability to drag and drop images. if you're interested in using DotNetNuke, you might want to check out our product. It's called metaPost and there's a free community edition you can download and try. There's a link on the main page of our site to the product page as well as some examples of some of the features available in the Professional Edition of the product (see the tabs). http://www.itcrossing.com/ HTH, Don
