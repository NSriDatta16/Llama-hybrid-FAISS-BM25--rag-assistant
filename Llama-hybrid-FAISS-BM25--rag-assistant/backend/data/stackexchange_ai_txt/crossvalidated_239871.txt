In this situation, queue length will depend on the number of processors for queued events. Assuming there is one server: Events arrive at $N$ events per hour: so $\lambda =\frac{1}{N}$ Average processing time of $t$: so $\mu = \frac{1}{t}$ the probability, $p$, that the server will be busy is therefore: $\frac{t}{N}$ We can use the properties of the exponential distribution to make observations on the queue length $L$ which is $$L = \frac{p^2}{1-p} = \frac{\left(\frac{t}{N}\right)^2}{1-\frac{t}{N}}.$$ Here's a link to introductory queue theory
