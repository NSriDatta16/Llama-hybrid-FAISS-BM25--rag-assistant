Best way to "parse" survey data for predictive value?

Straightforward question. Kind of like bucketing too. Say you have a customer survey. The customer rates 1-10, or 1-5. Say you want to use this to predict other behaviors. Reorder rate, refund rate, whatever. I know data science is a massive field but -- Is there a specific art, or methodology, whereas --- you may discover --- encoding the input variable differently might offer greater predictive value? For instance instead of looking at 1-10 .... bucketing 1-5 and 6-10 turns out to have more predictive power. Or some other formula. Does that make sense? And is there a way to discover some useful encoding besides trial and error? Is it simply a -- re-run the predictive model with hold-out sets and see what generally performs better?
