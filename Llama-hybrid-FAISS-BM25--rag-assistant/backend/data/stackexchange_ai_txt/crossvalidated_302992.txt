You cannot fit the normal distribution to oil prices, or for that matter any prices. The normal distribution is sometimes applied to the returns on prices. The reason is thatccc prices are not stationary generally due to inflation and growth. You need the stationary series (atcvcvcvc least) to apply the probability distributions, such as normal. You cannot predict future oil prices without time series analysis. So, wait until you get to this topic. Even then you won't be able to predict them, but at least you'll see why. Otherwise, there is a reason why in the textbooks the example are chosen the way they are. It may frustrate you that the examples are useless, and you'll want to apply the classroom knowledge to real life, practical examples. However, it usually doesn't work while you're on introductory levels of statistics, because the world is very complicated and asks for sufficiently complicated analysis
