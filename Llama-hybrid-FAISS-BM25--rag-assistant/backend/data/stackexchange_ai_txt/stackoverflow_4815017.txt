Try using REE (Ruby Enterprise Edition) instead of ruby 1.8.7. It uses 33% less memory on average, and is 100% compatible with 1.8.7. Without looking at the code, it sounds like a garbage collection problem, which REE + passenger might be able to solve. From what I've heard, ruby 1.9.2 has a lot of the same enhancements, but switching an app over to run on REE would probably be a lot easier than upgrading to 1.9.2.
