Avoiding the ecological fallacy

My question is about how to handle misalignment between the levels of the data and outcome. In this case suppose I have Household income (Level 1) County median housing value (Level 2) County median household income (Level 2; aggregate of #1) I am interested in estimating house value (Level 1) but I do not have direct measurements. As mentioned I do have the county median housing value and household income -- but I want to avoid making the ecological fallacy. Given my data (or lack thereof) are there any methods to validly estimate the value for a given house? (even if the estimate is relatively wide) So far the best I have come up with is to assume the value of a given house is equal to the county average plus/minus household income times some scale factor.
