Calculating the value at the beginning and end of a trendline - Time Series

I am working with R on a linear regression, time series. I have a dataframe that is looking like in the example, daily recordings from 1st of January 1993 until 31st of December 2010. Date AT31102 1 1993-01-01 46.609 2 1993-01-02 42.273 3 1993-01-03 56.000 4 1993-01-04 63.348 5 1993-01-05 72.565 6 1993-01-06 70.174 . AND . SO . ON 6569 2010-12-26 57.664 6570 2010-12-27 62.428 6571 2010-12-28 66.436 6572 2010-12-29 54.697 6573 2010-12-30 66.665 6574 2010-12-31 52.835 I have done a plot, that looks like this (red trend line). I have also made a summary of the linear regression: summary (lm(df[,2] ~ df[,1])) Call: lm(formula = Stations[, 7] ~ Stations[, 1]) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -49.051 -14.889 0.005 13.740 97.316 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 23.201826 1.599414 14.51 Now I want to calculate the trend values, the value at the beginning of the trend line and the value at the end of the trend line. I know that I have to do something like this: ** Trendvalue* Year+ Absolute Term 0.001912 * 1993 + 23.201826 = 27.01244 ** But the result is wrong, as you can see on the plot. I think I might add the wrong value for the date/year? What I am doing wrong?
