No reason why you can't in principle. Stuff goes up, stuff goes down. That said, did you plot your data? Just because it's statistically "significant" (that's really an evil term) doesn't mean it's substantively significant. And even if there's a curve, does it make sense to fit the curve? Does it make sense to fit a quadratic curve? You have one time series over 33 points. Plot the thing.
