I found a different solution to my problem. I configured TeamCity agent to run under custom windows account. I needed to log in to this account, and set both: git config --global user.email some@email.com git config --global user.name TeamCity With this set up, the command: sh "git commit --author='TeamCity ' -v -m #{version_tag}" still generates the weird: "The system cannot find the file specified." error. However, having account settings set up globally I could remove the --author option from the commit statement, leaving it with: sh "git commit -v -m #{version_tag}" and that produces the desired effect.
