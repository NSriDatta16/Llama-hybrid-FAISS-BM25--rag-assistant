is it okay if r-square and RMSE for the lasso be worse than normal linear regression?

I am comparing three regression models, simple linear regression, Lasso and Bayesian Lasso then the R-Square and RSME for them are r2 score for Bays model is 0.10171034421952285 rmse score for Bays model is 0.7888288293573854 r2 score for regression model is 0.3303114752643104 rmse score for regression model is 0.6811001935995461 r2 score for Lasso model is -0.009865062766038157 rmse score for Lasso model is 0.8363850259509928 You can see that for Baysian Lasso and Lasso the R-Square and rmse are not good. Can I still say the results for those two is valid or how can I argue them?
