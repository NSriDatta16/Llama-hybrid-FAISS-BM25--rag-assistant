Troublesome coldfusion union query in CFC with mySQL database

This works with a mySQL backend In the form... in the cfc SELECT organisationID, organisationName, acceptsReferral, metadataTemplate FROM organisations WHERE acceptsReferral ORDER BY organisationName ASC; but if I try SELECT '0' AS organisationID, 'Select' AS organisationName, false AS acceptsReferral, 0 AS metadataTemplate FROM organisations UNION (SELECT organisationID, organisationName, acceptsReferral, metadataTemplate FROM organisations WHERE acceptsReferral ORDER BY organisationName ASC) to try and get a select leading row to the query, I get this AJAX error in firebug " JSON serialization failure: Unable to serialize binary data to JSON." Henry's suggestion resolved the above, but I'm again slightly foxed by the next bit , trying to get two selects linked. This works... Select ...but if i try to pass in the DSN with the bound field I get "error parsing bind" from this Select
