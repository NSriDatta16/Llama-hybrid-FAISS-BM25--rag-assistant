Propel ORM: Calculating Average of a column

I have a product object and I have rating Objects, which represent a rating about a product. A rating has a property named "value", which is an Integer from 1 to 5. For a given product I would like to get the average of the values of all ratings. I know how to get all ratings: $product->getRatingsRelatedByFromProductId(); But how can I get the average of the values of all rating
