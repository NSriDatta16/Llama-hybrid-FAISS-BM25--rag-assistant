EXT JS - adding a listener on any element added to a container

HI, I have a ExtJS parent 'container' type, whereas i need to add a 'contextmenu' listener to any element that is added to this parent container, via Drag/Drop. Can someone guide me as to the best way to do this? I have tried this below but can't get the function to fire. myContainer.on('added', function(obj1,obj2,index){ alert('added'); }); this may not be the 'best practice' to do it this way anyway...? thanks for the help !
