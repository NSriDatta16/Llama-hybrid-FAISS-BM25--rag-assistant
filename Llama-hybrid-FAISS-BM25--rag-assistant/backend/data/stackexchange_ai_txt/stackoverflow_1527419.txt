Here's the constant function you're looking for: sub constant { no strict 'refs'; shift->(); # Call the supplied function by name } # end constant Just add that to the code in your question, and it will do what you asked for.

Here's a more advanced one that still works even if you're calling it from a different package: sub constant { my $constant = shift; $constant = caller() . "::$constant" unless $constant =~ /::/; no strict 'refs'; $constant->(); # Call function by name } # end constant
