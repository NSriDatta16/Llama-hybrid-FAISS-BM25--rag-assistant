grails test-app -xml -coverage attempts to resolve XML URIs and times out

I'm behind a proxy, and I need grails test-app -xml -coverage to NOT resolve whatever XML field it's trying to resolve and not connect to the internet. Any idea how to get this working? I need the proxy to not be set for the tests to work.
