This is a bug with Visual Studio 2010 which defaults to using the wrong Microsoft.Web.Deployment assembly ( 7.1.0.0 ). To overcome this issue an edit needs to be made to VS 2010's configuration file to force it to use 8.0.0.0 : C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe.config The xml fragment above should be added to: /configuration/runTime/assemblyBinding This was confirmed with Microsoft's PSS group. Apparently Visual Studio 2010 SP1 will address this issue. Obviously you need MS WebDeploy 2.0 installed on the deployment computer. This can be obtained via the Web Platform Installer or by installing Web Matrix 1.0 RTM which incidentally does the right thing.
