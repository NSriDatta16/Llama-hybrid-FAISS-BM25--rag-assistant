Javascript Not Firing after Dir Reorganization

Ok, so here's the situation. I'm working on a site that allows people to upload things to a database that are then pulled to the frontpage so people can see them. It is a pretty straightforward site and I had it working real well but i was developing everything at ../html/backend for the sake of simplicity and to make sure nothing was spidered before it was ready to go live. So once i finished i changed the dir structure to have everything in the /html root, except for the form that allows people to enter info, which i kept at /backend. this is where i hit the problem, the form is obviously in html and it collects the info, then i have a jquery java script fire on button press that does an ajax PUT to a php file that does the actual INSERT. (don't worry i also do validation in the php file) but ever since the move the script does not fire. yes i changed the paths to the scripts and to the jquery file and i can confirm the scripts are being loaded correctly. i have been struggling with this for days and im sure its something stupid that im overlooking...any ideas? thanks a lot
