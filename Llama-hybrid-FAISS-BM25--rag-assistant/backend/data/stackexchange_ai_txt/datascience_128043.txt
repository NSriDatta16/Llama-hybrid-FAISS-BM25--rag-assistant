What ML model is best suited for an intelligent search assistant?

I'm working on my thesis project, and want to make an intelligent search assistant that understands context and, of course, processes and repsonds in natural languaje. The data I want to train this model on is from the Virtual Observatory and a python library that can be used to retrieve data from it. I thought on Open AI's GPT-3 API, but the knowledge to which it has access to is outdated. The I thought about IBM's Wattson Discovery, but I feel that using their solution would limit the response type or the training process very much. What ML model(s) would work better in my case? Or what software/solution would be useful?
