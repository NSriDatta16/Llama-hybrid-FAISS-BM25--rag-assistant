Well you wouldn't put it all into one table. You need to read up on normalizing data and joins. (And never store anything in a comma delimted list.) No database worth it's salt would have the slightest problem handling a million records, that is a tiny database. You need tables for functions, courses, locations, people, organization and possibly some joining tables to accommodate many to many relationships. But none of this is hard or even beyond very basic design. I recommend that before you do anything, you get a book on your chosen database and read up on the basics.
