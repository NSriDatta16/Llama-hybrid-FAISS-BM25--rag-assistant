Your answer, following Glen's suggestion, is correct. Another, less elegant, way is just to condition: \begin{align} \Pr\{X_1\geq X_2\} &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \Pr\{X_1\geq X_2\mid X_2=k\} \Pr\{X_2=k\} \\ &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \sum_{\ell=k}^\infty \Pr\{X_1=\ell\}\Pr\{X_2=k\}. \end{align} This will give you the same $1/(2-p)$ , after handling the two geometric series. Glen's way is better.
