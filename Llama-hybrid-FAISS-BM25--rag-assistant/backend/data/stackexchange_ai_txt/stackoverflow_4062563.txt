I have exactly same issue. I actually opened the UI sample in Xcode, then added MyViewController : TTViewController, I added a new Nib file to the project, but could not set the nib's class ID to MyViewController in InterfaceBuilder. Already tried reloading all class file in IB, didn't work. I guess IB could not recognize TTViewController, so MyViewController is not recognized as a class. Is there anyone experienced this issue before? UPDATE: Here's the solution: Just drag n drop all relevant Three20's header files to IB's xib window. IB will now recognize Three20's classes
