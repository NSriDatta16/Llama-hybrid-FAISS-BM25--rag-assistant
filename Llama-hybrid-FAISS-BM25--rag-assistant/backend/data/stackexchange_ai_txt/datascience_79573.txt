The aim of dimensionality reduction is to preserve as much of the significant structure of the high-dimensional data as possible in the low-dimensional map. Dimensionality reduction yields a more compact, more easily interpretable representation of the target concept, focusing the userâ€™s attention on the most relevant variables when you don't know anything about data. Having said that Dimension Reduction will not help if you have a less features and only some are highly correlated as you can just use that correlated features for model so it all depends on data. Unlike PCA, t-sne uses the local relationships between points to create a low-dimensional mapping. This allows it to capture non-linear structure. T-sne also solves the Crowding Problem making the optimization "spread-out" the medium distance points to prevent crowding. To understand more about t-sne plot refer here
