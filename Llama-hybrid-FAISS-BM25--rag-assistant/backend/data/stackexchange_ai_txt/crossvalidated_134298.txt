What's the model representation for the first difference of a local level model?

This is my first exercise for space state models and I've a few questions I'd need to resolve before I actually start doing the exercise. Unfortunately, I'm self teaching (I have no professor to ask) and I'm afraid there's no solution companion for Durbin and Koopman (2012)! Exercise 2.13.1 from Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods Second Edition Consider the local level model (2.3). (a) Give the model representation for $x_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$ , for $t = 2, ..., n$ . (b) Show that the model for $x_t$ in (a) can have the same statistical properties as the model given by $x_t = \epsilon_t + \theta \epsilon_{t-1}$ where $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_{\epsilon}^2)$ are independent disturbances with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^2 > 0$ and for some value $\theta$ . (c) For what value of $\theta$ , in terms of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^2$ and $\sigma_{\eta}^2$ , are the model representations for $x_t$ in (a) and (b) equivalent? Comment. For the record, the local level model (2.3) is given by: $y_t = \alpha_t + \epsilon_t \quad\quad \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma_{\epsilon}^2)$ $\alpha_{t+1} = \alpha_t + \eta_t \quad\quad \eta_t \sim N(0, \sigma_{\eta}^2)$ Doubts about (a) First of all, the model proposed in (a) looks like noise (which makes perfect sense since it's the first difference of a random walk). Is the following representation correct? $$ x_t = y_t - y_{t-1} = \alpha_t + \epsilon_t - \alpha_{t-1} - \epsilon_{t-1} $$ $$ x_t = \alpha_{t-1} + \eta_{t-1} + \epsilon_t - \alpha_{t-1} - \epsilon_{t-1} $$ $$ x_t = \eta_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t} - \epsilon_{t-1} $$ This makes me doubt. First, state disturbance $\eta_{t-1}$ is now part of the observation equation. Second, what does the state equation mean now that the observation equation doesn't relate to the unobserved states $\alpha_t$ ? Third, and somehow related, what's the mean unobserved state now that $\alpha_t$ isn't anymore on the formula? Zero? Doubts about (b) Additionally, I wonder how to show that models have the same statistical properties. What do you have to prove to say they're the same? Same expected value and variance of observation $x_t$ , unobserved state $\alpha_t$ , prediction error $v_t = x_t - a_t $ , filtered unobserved state, updated unobserved state, etc.? Since all random variables are Normal, I guess showing the first two moments match is enough, but a) what distribution (marginal, conditionals, conditionals on what?) of b) what variables (observed, hidden state, prediction error, etc.) should be equal? Any comment is much appreciated! Update This is where I got after the hints provided by @Glen_b and @javlacalle. (a) $$ x_t = \eta_{t-1} + \epsilon_t - \epsilon_{t-1}$$ (b) Respect to model $x_t$ given in (a) $$ E[x_t | x_{t-1}] = 0 $$ $$ \gamma(0) = Var(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \sigma_{\eta}^2 + 2\sigma_{\epsilon}^2 $$ $$ \gamma(1) = Cov(x_t, x_{t-1}) = -\sigma_{\epsilon}^2 $$ $$ \gamma(2) = Cov(x_t, x_{t-2}) = 0 $$ $$ \rho(1) = \frac{-\sigma_{\epsilon}^2}{\sigma_{\eta}^2 + 2\sigma_{\epsilon}^2} $$ $$ \rho(2) = 0 $$ Respect to model $x_t$ proposed in (b), which I renamed to $z_t$ to avoid confusion $$ E[z_t | z_{t-1}] = 0 $$ $$ \gamma(0) = Var(z_t | z_{t-1}) = \sigma_{\epsilon}^2 (1 + \theta^2) $$ $$ \gamma(1) = Cov(z_t, z_{t-1}) = \theta \sigma_{\epsilon}^2 $$ $$ \gamma(2) = Cov(z_t, z_{t-2}) = 0 $$ $$ \rho(1) = \frac{\theta}{1 + \theta^2} $$ $$ \rho(2) = 0 $$ (c) $$ E[x_t | x_{t-1}] = E[z_t | z_{t-1}] = 0 \quad \qquad (c.1) $$ $$ \gamma_{x_t}(0) = \gamma_{z_t}(0) \leftrightarrow \sigma_{\eta}^2 + 2\sigma_{\epsilon}^2 = \sigma_{\epsilon}^2 (1 + \theta^2) \quad \quad (c.2) $$ $$ \gamma_{x_t}(1) = \gamma_{z_t}(1) \leftrightarrow -\sigma_{\epsilon}^2 = \theta \sigma_{\epsilon}^2 \rightarrow \theta = -1 \quad \quad (c.3) $$ $$ \gamma_{x_t}(2) = \gamma_{z_t}(2) = 0 \quad \quad (c.4) $$ $$ \rho_{x_t}(1) = \rho_{z_t}(1) \leftrightarrow \frac{-\sigma_{\epsilon}^2}{\sigma_{\eta}^2 + 2\sigma_{\epsilon}^2} = \frac{\theta}{1 + \theta^2} \quad \quad (c.5) $$ $$ \rho_{x_t}(2) = \rho_{z_t}(2) = 0 \quad \quad (c.6) $$ Equations c.1, c.4 and c.6 imply no restrictions for $\theta$ , but equations c.2, c.3 and c.5 are clearly not consistent.
