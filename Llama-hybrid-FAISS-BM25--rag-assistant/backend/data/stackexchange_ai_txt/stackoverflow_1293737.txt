I think a lot of people will argue that "tabular" data, or data that can best be expressed in rows and columns, should be kept in a table, but that divs were invented to replace tables as large layout elements. In my personal opinion, tables were always used as layout elements in a way that went beyond their intended purpose. That's not to say that people don't still misuse divs, for example To replace a tag I'd say check out A List Apart, specifically Their section on layout for tips on how to use modern compliant css-based design. edit : My point was that this is the INCORRECT use of a div tag. In this example, you would use a style such as "text-align:center" or apply that style to the tag itself, but in this case there is no reason to wrap your text in a block-level element, because text by default is inline, so you would be better off with something more like this... This is a centered paragraph and then in your stylesheet .center { text-align:center; } Thus, the following: Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday Work | Work | Work | Work | Play May be compliant but it looks terrible, and you'd be better off doing : Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Work Work Work Work Play
