How to create an roc plot and calculate AUC for an svm (that does not return probabilities)?

I have some SVM classifier outputting final classifications for every sample in the test set, something like 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 and so on. The "truth" labels is also something like 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 I would like to run that svm with some parameters, and generate points for the roc curve, and calculate auc. I could do this by myself, but I am sure someone did it before me for cases like this. Unfortunately, everything I can find is for cases where the classifier returns probabilities, rather than hard estimations, like here or here I thought this would work, but from sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve is not found! anything online that fits my case? Thanks
