I found the Pragmatic Programmer's Pragmatic Guide to Subversion extremely helpful with this exact scenario. http://www.pragprog.com/titles/svn2/pragmatic-version-control-using-subversion There are a number of integration tools - TortoiseSVN is a good one for file system level control. I didn't get too into Visual Studio integration, but I hear good things about AnkhSVN. Using an existing server is probably fine for now. The SVN server can run on any Windows platform. Highly worth the time to learn to get away from SourceSafe. Good luck!
