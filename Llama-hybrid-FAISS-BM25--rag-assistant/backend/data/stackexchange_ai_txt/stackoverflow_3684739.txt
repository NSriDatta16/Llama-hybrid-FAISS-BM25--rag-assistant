As others have said here, you cannot use PHP to read the height/width of a div already rendered. However, aside from the javascript options already presented keep in mind that you can use PHP to set the height/width of a div before it is sent to the browser. This would be in the form of an inline style of course. This is not the most elegant solution and to be honest I would avoid it, but you did not state what specifically it is that you want to do, and why. Not sure if that info will help you in your implementation but it wasn't mentioned so far and thought I would contribute it.
