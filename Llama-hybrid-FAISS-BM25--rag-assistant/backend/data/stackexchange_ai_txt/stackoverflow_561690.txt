You can't prove tests are correct, and if you're trying to, you're Doing It Wrong. Unit tests are a first screen - a smoke test - like all automated testing. They are primarily there to tell you if a change you make later on breaks stuff. They are not designed to be a proof of quality, even at 100% coverage. The metric does make management feel better, though, and that is useful in itself sometimes!
