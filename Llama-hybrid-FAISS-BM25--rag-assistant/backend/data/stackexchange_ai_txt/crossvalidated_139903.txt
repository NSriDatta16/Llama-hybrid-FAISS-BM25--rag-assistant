Distributed Datasets and MLE

Suppose I have a very large dataset of size N, evenly distributed over M computers so that each computer has N/M data points. Suppose I want to fit a model using MLE that requires an iterative method. Also, the N datapoints cannot fit on one computer (hence why they are distributed). What are the disadvantages of the computing the MLE on each computer, and averaging over the parameters of each M to get a new, final set of parameters? Some pros and cons I've thought of: Pro: it's similar to a bootstrap procedure if M is large, so I can get confidence values quite easily. Con: if my MLE is biased, my average will still be biased (and I can't rely on consistency either) What are some other considerations I should think about?
