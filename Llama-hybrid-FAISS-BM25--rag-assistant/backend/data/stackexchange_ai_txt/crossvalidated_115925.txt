Persistence in GJR-GARCH (asymmetric GARCH)

Consider the standard GARCH model: $$ \sigma^2_t = \omega + \alpha\varepsilon^2_{t-1} + \beta\sigma^2_{t-1}.$$ The so-called persistence parameter is defined as the sum $\alpha+\beta$. Now consider the GJR-GARCH model by Glosten et al. (1993): $$ \sigma^2_t = \omega + (\alpha+\gamma \mathbb{I}_{t-1})\varepsilon^2_{t-1} + \beta\sigma^2_{t-1} $$ where $\mathbb{I}_{t-1}$ is the indicator function: $\mathbb{I}_{t-1}(\varepsilon_{t-1})=\varepsilon_{t-1}$ for $\varepsilon_{t-1}>0$ and $\mathbb{I}_{t-1}(\varepsilon_{t-1})=0$ otherwise. Question: What is the persistence parameter in the GJR-GARCH model? Could someone provide some references where this is explained? My guess is that the persistence parameter equals $\alpha+\gamma/2+\beta$, but I am not sure. The guess is based on the material in V-Lab and the similarities between the standard GARCH and the GJR-GARCH model. References Glosten, L. R., R. Jagannathan, and D. E. Runkle, 1993.
