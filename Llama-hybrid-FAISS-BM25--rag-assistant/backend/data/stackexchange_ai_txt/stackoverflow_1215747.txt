If your program runs in milliseconds, and if your are running on Linux, Make sure that your timer frequency (on linux) is set to 100Hz (not 1000Hz). (cd /usr/src/linux; make menuconfig, and look at "Processor type and features" -> "Timer frequency") This way your CPU will get interrupted every 10ms. Furthermore, consider that the default CPU time slice on Linux is 100ms, so with a nice level of -20, you will not get descheduled if your are running for a few milliseconds. Also, you are looping 101 times on fn(). Please consider giving fn() to be a no-op to calibrate your system properly. Make statistics (average + stddev) instead of printing too many times (that would consume your scheduled timeslice, and the terminal will eventually get schedule etc... avoid that).
