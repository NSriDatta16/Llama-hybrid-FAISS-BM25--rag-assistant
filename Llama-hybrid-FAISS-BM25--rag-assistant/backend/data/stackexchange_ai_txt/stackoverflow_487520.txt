Unfortunately, this feature isn't provided by g++. In VC++, you could use #pragma warning to disable some specific warnings. In gcc, the closest you can have is diagnostic pragmas , which let you enable/disable certain types of diagnostics for certain files or projects. Edit : GCC supports pushing/popping warnings since 4.6.4 (see changelog )
