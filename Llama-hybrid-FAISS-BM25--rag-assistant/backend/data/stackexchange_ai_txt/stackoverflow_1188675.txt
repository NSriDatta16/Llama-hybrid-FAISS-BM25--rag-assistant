Is there a way to read a Hibernate Session as RDF triples?

I need to query my local Hibernate managed datastore for persisted objects based on criteria where the relevant data for the WHERE clause is in the Linked Open Data cloud. Is there a way to read a Hibernate Session as RDF? If so, I can at least use the combined Dataset to decide what objects to retrieve from Hibernate. Preferably the solution would expose the Hibernate Session as inside Jena as I'm familiar with it. In addition I'll need support for RDFS inferencing and SPARQL for retrieval.
