Github and Non-Ignoring files in the .gitignore

I had a file I needed to edit in my .gitignore file. I edited .gitignore, committed it, and still my file was unavailable to commit. I deleted the file, readded it, and once it has the same name, its still unavailable to commit. I tried -f, which then added an empty version of the file to my repository. And the worst apart about that is that if I deployed, it would break my entire application at this point. Update: The file I want to add is : public/javascripts/ckeditor/config.js my .gitignore file says : public/stylesheets/*.css *.swp *.pid .idea config/database.yml log/*.log db/*.sqlite3 tmp/**/* doc/api doc/app doc/plugins public/system/* coverage.data coverage/* .DS_STORE .DS_Store solr/data/**/* solr/pids/**/* config/initializers/mail_delivery_override.rb Git status reveals this : # On branch testing # Changed but not updated: # (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed) # (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in working directory) # # modified: public/javascripts/ckcustom.js # no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a") That ckcustom.js is a compiled file form the ckeditor suite that is made by other changes. But I can't just edit that file, I had to edit its inner workings.
