I'm worried that this question is a duplicate, but I'll answer it anyway. What you are describing can be called "supervised classification". There are a wide range of tools that you can use to solve such a problem, and each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here is a brief summary of your options, borrowed shamelessly Multinomial logistic regression: the crux of what is discussed here Multinomial probit regression: similar to multinomial logistic regression with independent normal error terms. This is a nice R package for that. Multiple-group discriminant analysis: My personal favorite, but it does have some limitations (assuming multivariate normality of the errors for one). See this post on how to perform it in R. The article lists a few other options for you to explore. Beyond their options, Random Forests via Classification Trees is also very powerful, but can be too "black box" for some people.
