The simplest way is to use the WPF PasswordBox hosted inside an ElementHost. You can drag the ElementHost control from the ToolBox, or do the whole thing in code: public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost host = new System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost(); System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox pb=new System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox(); host.Child = pb; this.Controls.Add(host); } Of course this does not use the DevExpress control, but I can't see any reason for using a Rich Text Editor as a password box when there is a simple alternative.
