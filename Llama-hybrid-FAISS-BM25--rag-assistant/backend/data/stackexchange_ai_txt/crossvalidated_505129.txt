Logistic regression - what is the example interpretation of standardized odds ratio?

Let's have an example: The model is used to classify outcome (won, lost). variable_1 is having std_coefficient of 1.610 and std_odds_ratio of 5.003 variable_2 is having std_coefficeint of -2.675 and std_odds_ratio of 0.069 My interpretation is as follows: for every +SD change in variable_1 the likelihood of winning is equal to (5.003 - 1) * 100 = 400.3 % increase for every +SD change in variable_2 the likelihood of winning is equal to (1 - 0.069) * 100 = 93.1 % decrease From my understanding as std_odds_ratio is calculated by exp(std_coefficient) it cannot be negative. How come one could have 400% increase but not 400% decrease in likelihood of outcome (won, lost)? I there a symmetrical metric that would allow to have a consistent interpretation of in likelihood % change? This is the reference .
