You get different results because you are asking different questions and the computer has no way of knowing that these are mirror images. I don't think chi-square is appropriate here, as you have two independent variables (area and year). What you are testing here is not anything about pass or fail rates, but about whether year is independent from area. I suggest logistic regression with pass as the dependent variable and area and year as independent variables.
