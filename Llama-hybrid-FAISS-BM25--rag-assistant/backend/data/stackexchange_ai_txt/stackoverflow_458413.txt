Text-shadow for position: static

Is there any way to do text shadow for Position static with somewhat decent crossbrowser support? The CSS3 text-shadow is ultimately what I'm after, but of course only Safari/Opera/(not yet released FF3.1) out of the major browsers support it. All javascript/css techniques I've seen forces the text into position:absolute, which will not work for my mid paragraph shadows. Are there any that I haven't seen, or is there some other option I should explore? Forcing font downloads on the viewer? Ugh. :( Thanks.
