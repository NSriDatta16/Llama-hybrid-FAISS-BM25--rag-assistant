How do I extend the built in configuration providers in .Net to add custom storage?

We have a configuration XML database. Rather than access this directly through the database API I'd like to extend .Net's configuration classes to add a custom storage provider. I'm not sure where to start. I've seen the Configuration Application Block but this seems to have been deprecated. I'm using .Net 3.5. Which classes should I look at? Which interfaces do I need to implement? Has this been done elsewhere? Thanks
