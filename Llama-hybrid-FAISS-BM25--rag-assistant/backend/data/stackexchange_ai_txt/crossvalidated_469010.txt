Survival Analysis for predicting next car's maintenance

I am working on a predictive maintenance project. To simplify I want to predict for a car the next time it will have to change for example the oil filter (and then extend to other parts like wipers). In facts, cars manufacturers used to give a predefined maintenance plan like "change oil filter every 15.000 kilometers". But it is not always the case. (We want to know if there is a big chance that a part will drop out soon, to replace it by anticipation, rather than having to be faced with the facts). I have a complete database about a lot of cars including features like energy, brand, rolling law(number of kilometers used to do per month), etc. I also have historical data about the car: I know when it changes his oil filter (durations of oil filter) I look for machine learning concepts that can be applied to my project and then I find Survival Analysis. I have three questions : 1) Can I use Survival Analysis for my project? Because in general we look to ONE individual and this individual has one birth event and one death event if it is not censored. But here as you can see a car can have multiple oil filters change. But I see that sometimes we can apply to like "how many times between two pregnancies?" 2) Is adding time features or maybe for a given oil filter the number of times it has been changing before will improve my model? Because if I want to do survival regression and want to predict death event for censored individuals (like for example car A has changed 3 time his oil filter and duration of oil filters are 12, 11 and 10 months and I want to predict in how many time it will have to change again), I think it will give me same durations as previous oil filters for the same car as it is same features vector 3) Is there other machine learning which will be suitable for my project? EDIT : for example this is the Andersen-Gill format for my project's data. The first two rows concern car A, the third and fourth car B and the last 2 car C. start_event : oil filter in place end_event : oil filter changed observed for censorship
