Getting Problem TargetVersion from 1.6 to 1.5 in Android?

I have developed an application with Target build as API 4. It supports Normal Screen and all Densities. But Now i would need to set the App's Target as API 3. In Eclipse Environment, I changed the Build Target to API 3. But I get the Following Error. R file gone Automatically. So i get Can not Resolved error allover my app where R is present. drawable-ldpi , drawable-mdpi , drawable-hdpi , value-long ,etc are not supported. How to Downgrade my app to Android 1.5 and It should can accessible on up to Android 2.1? Any Idea?
