They add wizards, dialogs, editors, and other extensions to the IDE that help specifically with GWT tasks. For example, rather then creating a new GWT project from scratch using the command line, or creating an eclipse java project and then creating all the necessary files yourself, the plug-in adds a wizard that lets you type in the name of the project, and it creates all the necessary files for you. Other additions can be large stuff like a local server, or minimal like a source code formatter. The sky is the limit with plug-ins. I know the GWT adds a GUI editor to eclipse so you can drag and drop controls rather then manually entering them all.
