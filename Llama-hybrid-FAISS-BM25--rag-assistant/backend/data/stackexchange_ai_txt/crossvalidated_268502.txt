LASSO CV monotonically decreasing in lambda?

I am using Matlab's lassoglm function to select the best logit specification from a set of 25 covariates. I am using time series data and have around 500,000 observations. My CV plot shows the error decreases monotonically with lambda (graph below). Any idea why this could be? My covariates are significant predictors in the literature, and all (or most) are significantly correlated with my dependent variable. Is a univariate specification really the best model? I am struggling to believe that. The coefficient path is below for reference. I would appreciate some thoughts.
