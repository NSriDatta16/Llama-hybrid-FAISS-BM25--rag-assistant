The difference between the three performance wise is negligible. The bottleneck is moving the data from the DB to your app, not a trivial cast or method call. I would go with: int? id = (int?)command.ExecuteScalar(); if(id.HasValue) { // use id.Value } It fails earlier , if one day people change the command to return a string or a date, at least it will crash and you will have a chance to fix it. I would also just go with a simple int cast IF I always expected the command to return a single result. Note, I usually prefer returning an out param than doing the execute scalar, execute scalar feels fragile (the convention that the first column in the first row is a return value does not sit right for me).
