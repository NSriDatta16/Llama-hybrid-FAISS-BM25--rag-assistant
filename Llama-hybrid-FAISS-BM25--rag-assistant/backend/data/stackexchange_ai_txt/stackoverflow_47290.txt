Along the lines of what I mentioned in this post . I recommend you use the SIGAR API . I use the SIGAR API in one of my own applications and it is great. You'll find it is stable, well supported, and full of useful examples. It is open-source with a GPL 2 Apache 2.0 license. Check it out. I have a feeling it will meet your needs. Using Java and the Sigar API you can get Memory, CPU, Disk, Load-Average, Network Interface info and metrics, Process Table information, Route info, etc.
