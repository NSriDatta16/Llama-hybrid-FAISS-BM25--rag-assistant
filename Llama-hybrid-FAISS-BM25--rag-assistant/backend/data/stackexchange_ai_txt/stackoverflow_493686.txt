I think the answer is more to do with the application you're pasting into rather than the browser's copying process, and this is actually the right thing for the browser to do? Hopefully you're providing semantic HTML and thus wouldn't copying the OL be the desired result? What if the user was copying and pasting a set of paragraphs or text that contained a link or an image? Wouldn't you suspect that the user would want to be able to copy the paragraph and paste it with semantic layout intact?
