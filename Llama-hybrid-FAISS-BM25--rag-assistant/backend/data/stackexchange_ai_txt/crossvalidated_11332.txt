You can use Poisson regression and in more general form, Poisson process when data is following a Poisson distribution. In terms of Bayesian inference, you can make your own likelihood model, and then by conjugating your Poisson prior by likelihood, derive your posterior distribution. Here I borrow an example from glm function in R: ## Dobson (1990) Page 93: Randomized Controlled Trial : counts Also, some slides about Poission Rregression with some example are here and here
