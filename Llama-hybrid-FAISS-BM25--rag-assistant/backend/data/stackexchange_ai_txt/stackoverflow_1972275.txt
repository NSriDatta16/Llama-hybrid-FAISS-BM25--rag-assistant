Javascript Array Key Retrieval

My JavaScript code stores a lot of data in arrays. I want to retrieve a key using something similar to what I wrote below. It key that should be retrieved is based on variables that are page-dependent . The following code doesn't work. Can anyone give me a solution to this problem? This is part of a script that does automatic conjugation. (looks for SUBJECT in a div and then looks for VERB in another div and then conjugates the verb by retrieving the conjugated form from the array) function getarray(Array,Key) { return Array[Key]; } Example of how it should work: verb = innerhtmlfromdiv; subject = innerhtmlfromotherdiv; function getarray(Array,Key) { return Array[Key]; } conjugatedverb = getarray(verb,subject); htmltextbox.value = conjugatedverb;
