Bayesian inference - Pi notation

I often see people use $\pi(\theta|y)$ and $\pi(\theta)$ for posterior distribution and prior, respectively. e.g. $\pi(\theta|y) \propto f(y|\theta)*\pi(\theta)$ sometime, the notation is simply written as $p(\theta|y) \propto p(y|\theta)*p(\theta)$ I would like to know when $\pi(x)$ and $p(x)$ can be used interchangeably. ps. I believe that there is no significant difference between $p(x)$ and $f(x)$ . It only depends on one's preference; however, $p(x)$ might be more precise since it explicitly states that it is a probability distribution.
