Cauchy. The reason for the the strange histogram from Cauchy data is precisely because you are getting many extreme values in the tails--too sparse and too extreme to show well on your histogram. A data summary or boxplot might be more useful to visualize what's going on. set.seed(999) x = rcauchy(10000) summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -5649.323 -0.970 0.021 -0.037 1.005 2944.847 x.trnk = x[abs(x) The standard Cauchy distribution (no parameters specified) is the same as Student's t distribution with DF = 1. The density function integrates to $1,$ as appropriate, but its tails are so heavy that the integral for its 'mean' diverges, so its mean doesn't exist. One speaks of its median as the center of the distribution. Student's t, DF = 10. There is nothing particularly unusual about Student's t distribution with DF = 10. Its tails are somewhat heavier than for standard normal, but not so much heavier that it's hard to make a useful histogram (no truncation needed). And its mean is $\mu=0.$ y = rt(10000, 10) summary(y) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -5.988219 -0.698855 -0.006711 -0.005902 0.685740 6.481538 dt(0,10) [1] 0.3891084 par(mfrow=c(2,1)) hist(y, prob=T, br=30, ylim=c(0,.4), col="skyblue2") curve(dt(x,10), add=T, col="red", n=10001) boxplot(y, horizontal=T, col="skyblue2", pch=20) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) The distribution $\mathsf{T}(10)$ is sufficiently heavy-tailed that samples from it as large as $n=10\,000$ tend to show many boxplot outliers---as seen above. In a simulation of $100\,000$ samples of size $10\,000,$ almost every sample showed at least one outlier and the average number of outliers per sample was more than 180. [This simulation runs slowly because each sample of $10,000$ needs to be sorted in order to determine its outliers.] set.seed(2020) nr.out = replicate(10^5, length(boxplot.stats(rt(10000,10))$out)) mean(nr.out) [1] 188.5043 mean(nr.out>0) [1] 1
