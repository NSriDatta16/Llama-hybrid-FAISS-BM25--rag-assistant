They answer is that you cannot do this directly. Processes are either 32-bit, or 64-bit. A 64-bit process cannot load a 32-bit code. Yes, you have to run the 32-bit code in a 32-bit process and use some type of interface between it and your 64-bit process. Depending on your code, this could be a lot of work. The best way to do this is likely to wrap your 32-bit code in a set of COM APIs and run it as an our of proc COM server for your 64-bit process. COM will then do all the work of marshaling information from one process to another. No matter what you do; be acutely aware that there is a LOT of overhead to do this. Error handling is another significant concern. I encourage you not to develop your own shared memory interface. This can be quite challenging to get corrects unless the interfaces are really simple. You could also use RPC directly: see this link .
