1) To start, i'd recommend you to test your app's core logic. 2) Then, use code coverage tool in vs to see whether all of your code is used in tests(all branches of if-else, case conditions are invoked). This is some sort of an answer to your question about testing 1+2 = 3, 5 + 6 = 35: when code is covered, you can feel safe with further experiments. 3)It's a good practice to cover 80-90% of code: the rest of work is usually unefficient: getters-setters, 1-line exception handling, etc. 4) Learn about separation of concerns. 5) Generation unit tests - try it, you'll see, that you can save a pretty lines of code writing them manually. I prefer generating the file with vs, then write the rest TestMethods by myself.
