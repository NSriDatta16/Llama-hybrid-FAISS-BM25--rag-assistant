From design point of view your should create method List getList() in Generator class then call it in main and pass the result to Processor. Pay attention that in this case Generator and Processor are independent and do not "know" each other, so they can be modified independently. Moreover method returns List (not ArrayList), so the interface does not depend on list implementation too. And the last point. The list is parametrized ( List ) that makes it safer.
