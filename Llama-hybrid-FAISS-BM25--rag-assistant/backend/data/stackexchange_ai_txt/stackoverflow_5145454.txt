Clojure programs are always going to have extra runtime baggage which may make them unsuitable for extremely low-resource situations (like Android). But if you don't mind taking a few extra megabytes along for the ride, you can always achieve Java-level performance by throwing convention out the window. Alex Osborne has a great example of optimizing a Clojure program until it blew the Java competitor away: http://meshy.org/2009/12/13/widefinder-2-with-clojure.html (of course, the same level of attention could have sped up the Java version as well.)
