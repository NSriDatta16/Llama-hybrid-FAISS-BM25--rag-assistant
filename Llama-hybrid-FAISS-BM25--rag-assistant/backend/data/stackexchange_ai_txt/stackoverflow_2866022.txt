Sum and average over null values SQL Server 2008 Analysis Services

I have a simple problem, I think, but I have googled and can't find the solution. I have a cube that has MeasureA, MeasureB and MeasureC. Not all three measures have values for each record, sometimes they can be null, it's depending if it was applicable. Now for my totals, I need to average but the average must not take nulls into account. Any help will be much appreciated. When I view the measures, the null values show as zeros.
