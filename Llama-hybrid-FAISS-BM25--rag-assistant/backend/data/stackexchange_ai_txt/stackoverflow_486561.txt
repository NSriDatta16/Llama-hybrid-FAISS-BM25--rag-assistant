Unfortunately the .Net CF doesn't support IL emit, or compilation (via CSharpCodeProvider or such). The better mocking frameworks use IL emit, the older ones use CSharpCodeProvider - both of which are not in the CF. I would venture to say that it is impossible to write a CF mocking framework (unless someone ports Cecil to CF and uses that to create assemblies on the storage card, and then loads those up dynamically).
