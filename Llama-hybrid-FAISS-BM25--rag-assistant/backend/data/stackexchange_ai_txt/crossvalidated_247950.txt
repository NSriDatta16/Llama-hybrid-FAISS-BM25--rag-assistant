In case you're more concerned about having a model than learning the intricacies of deep learning a good idea could be to follow this tensorflow tutorial, using python as your tag mentions. Between installing tensorflow and following the tutorial it will probably take you around 2-3 hours, you will not have to code anything. Under the hood this does the following: First a huge network is trained on ImageNet (a very big dataset of images) and the network learns lots of interesting features in its intermediate layers. Then it chops of the last layer of the network (which is useful only for that particular dataset). It adds a new layer on top of the chopped network to predict your examples. Using your images it trains the weights of this last layer. You end up having a very powerful model even if you have very few images (you probably need at least 100). It also handles the different resolutions for you.
