Difficult to say without the big picture, what you're trying to achieve etc. But the immediate thing to check based on that is indexes - do you have suitable indexes (e.g. on t1.v3 / t2.v3)? If you do have appropriate indexes, are they indexes fragmented/statistics out of date? What does the execution plan say?
