Training xgboost model with more data having different characteristic

I have trained my model for ECG data which has 8528 ECG files having length 30s and sample rate 300 so total file length in csv is 9000 . Data has four classes i.e. A , N , O and ~ This model is working fine. Now I want to retrain the model using few more ecg files. Which has length 42s and sample rate 360 . So total csv file of this ecg signal has length 15127 . I trained model with A file having length 15127 , then I tried to predict same file with trained model, but it predicts class value N . Can anyone visualie how Xgboost will learn with added such file having signal length more? Does such file encountered as outlier? If I train model with more A having lenth 15127 length will model be able to predict it correctly? Let me know if any information required. Here is sample training code :; dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(train_data,label=train_labels) # cross_validate(dtrain) print('training model.....') param = {'num_class':4,'objective':'multi:softmax','eval_metric':['merror'],'max_depth':7,'eta':0.04,'subsample':0.8,'min_child_weight':0.5,'max_delta_step':7,'gamma':2,'lambda':10,'colsample_bytree':0.5} model = xgb.train(param,dtrain,420,[(dtrain,'train')],verbose_eval=20) print('saving model....') model.save_model('xgb_model.bin') print('done!')
