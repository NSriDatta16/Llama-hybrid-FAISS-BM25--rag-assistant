Since this is plugin specific, your best bet is to look at the source code on its github repo and override the drag-and-drop event. It also looks like it is possible to override the onSubmit functionality through options but I assume you've already tried that. var uploader = new qq.FileUploader({ // pass the dom node (ex. $(selector)[0] for jQuery users) element: document.getElementById('file-uploader'), // path to server-side upload script action: '/server/upload', // events // you can return false to abort submit onSubmit: function( id, filename ){ // do something } });
