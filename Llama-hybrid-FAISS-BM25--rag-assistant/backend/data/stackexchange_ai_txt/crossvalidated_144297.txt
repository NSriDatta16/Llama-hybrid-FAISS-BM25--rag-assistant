For what you describe, I highly recommend "Foundations of Machine Learning" by Mohri et.al. It is an undergraduate text, but it is for really good undergraduates. It is readable and it is the only place I have found what I would call a mathematical definition of machine learning (pac and weak pac). It is worth reading for that reason alone. I also have a math Phd. I'm familiar with, and like, many of the books mentioned above. I'm particularly fond of ESL for a broad spectrum of techniques and ideas, but it's a statistics book with lots of mathematics.
