creating static frame and changing content pages in flex

I need to create a static frame and a changing content... currently envisaged as frame containing the side panel and header and footer content. The content panel will call mxml based on the content sought. Two questions a) how is the frame paradigm- with static frame "containing" other content done. I dont want to repeat the header and footer logic in every 'content section' code? b) how is the hyperlinking between content sections done- using 'states' seems convoluted Any guidance around this will be appreciated Raghu
