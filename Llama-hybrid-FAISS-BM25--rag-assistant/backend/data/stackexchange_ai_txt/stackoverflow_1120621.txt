Help building an E-commerce site

Guys, I want to build an e-commerce site on asp.net. My query is: when two users simultaneously buy something, how would the two records get inserted in my database? Would there be a lock? Can anyone explain how this would be or can be handled. Also, I want to handle peak traffic and also control the average data allotted to each user. I am thinking of using a plug-in. Any suggestions here?
