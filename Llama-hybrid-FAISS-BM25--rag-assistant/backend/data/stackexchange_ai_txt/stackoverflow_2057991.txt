How do I schedule a SQL Server Full-Text rebuild in SSMS2008?

I have a question about scheduling a rebuild and reorganize of a SQL Server 2008 Full-Text Catalog. When I go to the catalog's Properties then Population Schedule, the wizard seems pretty straight forward except for I don't see a way to specify that I want a rebuild rather than a reorganize. I wanted to schedule a reorganize to be more frequent with a rebuild at a longer duration. Could someone assist me in the best way to handle this? I thought SSMS would be a piece of cake in this regard but I'm clearly missing something and Google hasn't been my friend this time. Below is a link to the picture of the SSMS schedule I created and you can see when I select from the Population Type, my only choice is "Catalog - optimize". (I'd embed the image in the post but I guess I need more reputation points, sorry) https://i.stack.imgur.com/G65y5.png
