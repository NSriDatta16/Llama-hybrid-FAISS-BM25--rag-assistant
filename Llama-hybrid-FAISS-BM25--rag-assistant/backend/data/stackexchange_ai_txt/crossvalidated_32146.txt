One straightforward way to do multi-label classification with a multi-class classifier (such as multinomial logistic regression) is to assign each possible assignment of labels to its own class. For example, if you were doing binary multi-label classification and had 3 labels, you could assign [0 0 0] = 0 [0 0 1] = 1 [0 1 0] = 2 and so on, resulting in $2^3 = 8$ classes. The most obvious problem with this approach is you can end up with a huge number of classes even with a relatively small number of labels (if you have $n$ labels you'll need $2^n$ classes). You also won't be able to predict label assignments that aren't present in your dataset, and you'll be making rather poor use of your data, but if you have a lot of data, and good coverage of the possible label assignments, these things may not matter. Moving beyond this and what was suggested by others, you'll probably want to look at structured prediction algorithms such as conditional random fields.
