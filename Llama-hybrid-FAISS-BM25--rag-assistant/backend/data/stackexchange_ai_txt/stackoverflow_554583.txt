Your problem is the way html is rendered. If you look in the source code, the first example will have the two lines on separate lines, but the browser does not see line breaks as breaks that should be displayed. This allows you to have a long paragraph in your source: rghruio grgo rhgior hiorghrg hg rgui ghergh ugi rguihg rug hughuigharug hruauruig huilugil guiui rui ghruf hf uhrguihgui rhguibuihfioefhw8u beruvbweuilweru gwui rgior That would only wrap as the browser needed it to, allowing it to be easily editable at the right line length, but displayed at any resolution.
