Linking Named-Entity Recognition tagged files to Google maps using Google Geocoding API

I have text files which are tagged using NER and I need to link them to a Google map. Gardai|NNP|O fear|VBP|O a|DT|O 28-year-old|JJ|O man|NN|O ,|,|O missing|VBG|O from|IN|O his|PRP$|O Dublin|NNP|I-PER home|NN|O for|IN|O a|DT|I-DAT week|NN|I-DAT Although locations are not tagged correctly ie. Dublin is tagged as a person, I want to use the Google Geocoding API, to feed in the location which is identified as being NER tagged and find the location! Is this possible? I was thinking of creating a regex to extract any information which is tagged as a location, organisation or person and give it to Google and see if it has a latitude and longitude co-ordinatea that corresponds to it. Or take the 2-3 words in a row that are tagged as NER and add them as an entire address. I'm just not sure about how I actually give this information to Google!? Then I'm going to use the Json response to link the text file to the map using the address Google Geocoder matched. Any insight or ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thanks
