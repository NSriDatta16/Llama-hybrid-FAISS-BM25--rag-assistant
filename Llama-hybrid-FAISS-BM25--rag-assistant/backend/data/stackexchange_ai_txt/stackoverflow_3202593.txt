Multidimensional arrays - what's the most convenient way to work with them in Objective-C?

I'm a beginner in Objective-C and I'm trying to find the most convenient way to work with multidimensional arrays in Objective-C. Either I am missing something or they are very ugly to work with. Let's say we have a classic problem: read input from file; on the first line, separated by space(" ") are the width and height of the matrix (eg: 3 4 ) on the following lines there is the content described by the values above Eg: 3 4 a b c d e f g h i j k l The first solution I thought of was: NSMutableArray *matrix = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity: x]; //x = 3 in this specific case NSMutableArray *cell; for(cell in matrix) { cell = [NSMutableArray initWithCapacity: y]; for(int i = 0; i This was the first thing I had in mind when thinking about how I should get my values read from file in a multidimensional array. I know you can use C arrays, but since I will store NSObjects in it, I don't think is such a great idea. Nonetheless, from my point of view is easy to work with C arrays rather the solution I got with Objective-C. Is there another way you could build a multidimensional array in obj-c and easier than the one above? How about looping them? I know I can do something like NSArray *myArray; for(int i=0; i But that is still more complicated than your average C multidimensional array loop. Any thoughts on this?
