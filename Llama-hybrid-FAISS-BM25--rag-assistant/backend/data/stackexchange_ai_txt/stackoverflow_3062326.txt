1 . Your second program wont compile. You are trying to assign a JFrame to a JPanel. It should have been JFrame frame = new Bar(new JFrame("CIT Test Program")); 2 . It works. What you want is there. But not as you want it, because you have not told java how you want it to display. Try using a LayoutManager like GridBagLayout . If you are in a hurry to create a GUI, try a IDE like NetBeans that makes your job easier via drag and drop. EDIT: An Example: public class TestN extends JFrame { private JLabel label ; private JComboBox combo; private JButton button; public TestN() { label = new JLabel("Label:"); combo = new JComboBox(); combo.addItem("Item 1"); combo.addItem("Item 2"); combo.addItem("Item 3"); setLayout(new GridBagLayout()); GridBagConstraints c1 = new GridBagConstraints(); c1.gridx = 0; c1.gridy = 0; c1.weightx = 1; c1.weighty = 1; add(label, c1); GridBagConstraints c2 = new GridBagConstraints(); c2.gridx = 1; c2.gridy = 0; c2.weightx = 1; c2.weighty = 1; add(combo, c2); button = new JButton("Ok"); GridBagConstraints c3 = new GridBagConstraints(); c3.gridx = 2; c3.gridy = 0; c3.weightx = 1; c3.weighty = 1; add(button, c3); setTitle("Test"); setSize(200,100); setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); setVisible(true); } public static void main(String[] args) { new TestN(); } } Disclaimer: This is a basic example just to give an example. Not meant to be production code ;-)
