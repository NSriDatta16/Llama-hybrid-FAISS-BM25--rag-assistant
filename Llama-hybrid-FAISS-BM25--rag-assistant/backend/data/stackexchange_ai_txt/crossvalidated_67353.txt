This is a comment, but my reputation isn't high enough to comment yet lol. Anywho, how did you build this existing logistic regression model? how large was the sample? I am assuming that Class 1 is that the given action will take place whereas Class 2 would be that the action would not take place? My first impression is that the model is modeling better for the average of the predicted probabilities for all individuals on a given day to predict the proportion of people in each class better than it does for individuals by mere chance (ie. if you were to use this on another 20 samples, this would likely not be the case, as the model was created to predict class membership for individuals). I just wanted to clear up some questions that others and myself have in regards to your question to speed up the process of you receiving the answer you are looking for!
