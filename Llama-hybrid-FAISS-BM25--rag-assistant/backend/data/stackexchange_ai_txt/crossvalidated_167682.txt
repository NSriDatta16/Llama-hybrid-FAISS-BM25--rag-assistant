Getting distance of points from decision boundary with linear SVM?

I posted this originally in Stack Overflow but realize it might be more of a statistics question. I am using SKLearn to run SVC on my data. from sklearn import svm svc = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=C).fit(X, y) I want to know how I can get the distance of each data point in X from the decision boundary? Essentially, I want to create a subset of my data which only includes points that are 1 standard deviation or less away from the decision boundary. I'm looking for the most optimal way to do this.
