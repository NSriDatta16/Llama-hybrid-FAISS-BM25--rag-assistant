Raphael canvas (background) onclick event

I have been working with Raphael to create drag and drop shapes on a canvas. I do this using the .drag() function (supplied in the Raphael framework) along with my event functions. I have no issues doing this. I also have a function that creates a new shape onDblClick , the problem is, I can only attach the event to a shapes, or other elements I create. Adding events to a shape works like so: R = Raphael("canvas", "100%", "100%"), R.rect(100, 100, 25, 50).attr({fill: fillColor}).dblclick(myDblClick); Using the same principle on the canvas doesn't work : R = Raphael("canvas", "100%", "100%"), R.dblclick(myDblClick); Does anybody know a way to attach click events to the canvas, i.e. I can click anywhere in the div (excluding shapes) and the event will be triggered.
