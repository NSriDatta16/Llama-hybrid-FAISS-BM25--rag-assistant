SSIS has always been a source of irritation for me. Personally, I'd write the job up in TSQL, then schedule it using the SQL Server Agent. It feels lighter weight to me in the sense that if I need to edit the job, all I need to do is open up SQL Management Studio and make the change. Just my 2 cents.
