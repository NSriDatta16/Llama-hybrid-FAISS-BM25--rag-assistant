Good references for time series?

I am wondering if anyone has book references for time series. I would like something comparable (in popularity) to the 'ESL' or to 'Machine learning' from Murphy in the machine learning field. Does anyone knows what are the most complete (in term of methods scope) books containing all about exponential smoothing (all of them), arima, sarima , arch, garch, neural network for time series, kalman filters, ... etc ?
