Possible mistake in youtube video explaining p-value

I am wondering if there's a mistake in this video in the slide at 3m3s. Should the "less" in "the probability of getting a mean of 68.7 or less from a sample of this size is 0.18" actually be "more"? In this example 0.18 is the p-value, and H0 is that the mean weight of peanuts in chocolate bars is 70 grams. Assume "0.18" was actually "1", then the probability of getting a mean of 68.7 or less would be 100%. Then wouldn't the null hypothesis clearly be rejected: chocolate bars do in fact on average have less than 70 grams of nuts?
