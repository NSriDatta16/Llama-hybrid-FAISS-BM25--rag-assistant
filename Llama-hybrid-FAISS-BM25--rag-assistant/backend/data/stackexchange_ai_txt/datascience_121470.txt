Deduplication using NLP

I have a product catalog. The user can add a new product to the catalog. The user can enter some attributes (such as color, weight, etc.) in the text boxes. The user can also mention the description of the product separately. Each product will have a set of attributes explicitly mentioned by the user and a description. I want to check if there are any duplicate products in the catalog based on the attributes and descriptions provided by the user. I want to perform the deduplication of records in the product catalog using the attributes and descriptions provided by the user. Which NLP techniques can be used to perform the deduplication?
