Relationship between CDF and MGF?

Suppose $X$ is a random variable $\in (0,1]$ $f(x)$ is the CDF of this random variable $g(t)=\operatorname{mgf}(-t)$ where "mgf" is the moment generating function . Can we infer the behavior of $g(t)$ at $t=t_0$ from behavior of $f(x)$ for $x\approx 2/t_0$ ? Theorem 2.3 in Coqueret's "Approximation of probabilistic Laplace Transforms and their inverses" paper gives us the following characterization for $t_0\approx \infty$ : $g(t)\sim t^{-k}$ for $t\approx \infty$ , implies that $f(x)\sim x^k$ for $x\approx 0$ More precisely: It appears the simpler relation holds for other values of $t$ : behavior of $g(t)$ at $t=t_0$ depends on behavior of $f(x)$ for $x\approx \frac{2}{t_0}$ . Can this be made rigorous with some extra assumptions? (might need pdf of $X$ to be bounded from below by $\epsilon>0$ ) Here's a a toy $f$ , $g$ where the above appears to hold: Notebook Motivation: neural network training loss over time $f(t)$ appears piecewise linear on log-log plot (Figure 1 of "broken neural scaling laws" paper ). I want to model $f(t)$ as a mixture of exponentials with random scale $X$ and get a testable hypothesis on the shape of its CDF
