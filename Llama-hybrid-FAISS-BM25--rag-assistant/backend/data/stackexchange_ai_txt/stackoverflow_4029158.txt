I'd suggest taking a good look at Hibernate Search so you can leverage the power of Lucene. If you relatively simple requirements for search initially, perhaps implementing it yourself won't be so bad, but as you want to add features and scale up your search, this will require you to write more and more code and make the feature more complicated. Why not reuse a powerful, well-known library that already does all of this (and more)?
