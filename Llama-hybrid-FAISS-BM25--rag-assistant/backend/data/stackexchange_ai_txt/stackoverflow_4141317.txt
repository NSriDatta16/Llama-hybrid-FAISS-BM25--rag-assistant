How to convert byte array into Human readable format?

I am using "Blowfish" algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the contents of the text. I am embedding the encrypted contents in the image but while extracting I am getting the byte array which I am passing it to method update of class Cipher . But the method returns me byte array which I want to convert back into Human readable form. When I use write method of FileOutputStream it is working fine when a filename is provided. But now I want to print it on the console in the human readable format. How to get through this? I have tried for ByteArrayOutputStream too. But didn't work well. Thank you.
