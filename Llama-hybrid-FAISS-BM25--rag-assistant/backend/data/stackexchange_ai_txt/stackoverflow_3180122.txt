Store it in the database. It would be a waste of regular disk space if you don't do it. If you talk about "some catagories will be added from time to time", there is no real gain in data amount. Keep in mind that the databases of big companies/sites/applications/... store billions of rows of data so it will be no problem, if you store your categories. This way, it will be easier for the app to "just" work with SQL for data retrieval as if there will also be XML or alike.
