the behaviour of top: auto; bamboozles me

Hi I'm really confused about some basics with absolute positioning. #containingBlock { position: relative; background: green; } #abs { position: absolute; background: blue; top: auto; } foo bar With the markup arranged as above, div#abs does not overlap the foo paragraph. I know I could make it do this by giving top a value of 0 rather than auto, but since div#containingBlock has no padding, I thought auto and 0 would do the same thing. However, if the paragraph and div#abs are switched in the source order -to make bar come before foo -top: auto; works exactly as I expected. Any explanations appreciated!
