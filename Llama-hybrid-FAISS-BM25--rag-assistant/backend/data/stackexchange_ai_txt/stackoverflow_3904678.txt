How to 'warm up' EC2/EBS storage?

I have seen advice to 'warm up' EC2 to overcome a first write penalty:- Warm up data partitions - There is one drawback to using disk IO in EC2: a “first write” performance hit when initially writing to new partitions. To avoid this penalty, you can “warm up” the partition by executing a sort of throw-away command that accesses it. For example, you can use the Linux dd command to write to the disk. While the penalty still occurs and cannot be avoided, at least the first write to your databases will not suffer the effects.

Can anyone recommend the 'dd' syntax that will perform this warmup and how to ensure that all blocks are 'warmed'?
