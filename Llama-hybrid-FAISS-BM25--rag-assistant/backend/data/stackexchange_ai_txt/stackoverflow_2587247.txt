Just make the column 'text' and you won't run into any length restrictions. Once you're done importing, scan the column for values > 8000 characters and see what that is about. Sometimes a line in the IIS file doesn't write properly and you get missing columns or overlapping columns and that could be causing an issue. But using 'text' will certainly eliminate the data truncation issue. After the import you can always setup a new column called [cs(User-Agent)varchar] that is varchar(8000) and copy the data into it using convert(varchar(8000),[cs(User-Agent)])
