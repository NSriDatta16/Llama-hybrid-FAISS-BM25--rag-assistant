We use 2 build agents on the same machine at work, since we only have one build machine. The first one handles our CI builds, and is tag with CI. The build definition for the CI build is set up to only use agents that have the CI tag. The second one is for manually queued builds, mostly for the release branch builds. I specialized the CI build agent, because it was not uncommon when we were preparing a new build for QA to have several developers check into the development branch, which would slowing down being able to release the build to QA.
