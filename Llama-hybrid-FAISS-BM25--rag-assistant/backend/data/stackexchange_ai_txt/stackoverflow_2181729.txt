Which C# 4.0 Book would you purchase, and why?

I'm currently looking at purchasing a few C# 4.0 books, namely: Essential C# 4.0 by Mark Michaelis or C# 4.0 Unleashed by Bart De Smet. I am aware that both books are yet to be released, but would you consider purchasing either of these books, or would you recommend another? Thanks for your time. Clarification: I'm not a .NET Ninja, but I do have 8+ years experience with the framework & related languages. So I'm generally looking for in-depth books. I also train/instruct the rest of my organisation generally 6 - 12 months after each .NET release. Each of the developers I train has the same or more .net experience than myself. Once again thank you all for your time. Update: Thank you everyone for your responses. I've decided to purchase both books along with Visual C# 2010 Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach, as suggested by Waleed Al Balooshi .
