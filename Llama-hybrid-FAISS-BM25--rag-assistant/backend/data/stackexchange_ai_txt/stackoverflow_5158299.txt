Catch all exceptions and do...nothing?

I have just inherited code that has over 300 occurances of this: catch(Exception ex) { string s = ex.Message ; } The next time I come across the person that wrote this, what should I do to them? But seriously... This is obviously a coding horror and one of the worst things a programmer can do. Should I go through and just remove all of these and see how bad things really are when I run the app? How would you go about righting this wrong? This is a WinForms application that is run internally in my organization by about 2 dozen users.
