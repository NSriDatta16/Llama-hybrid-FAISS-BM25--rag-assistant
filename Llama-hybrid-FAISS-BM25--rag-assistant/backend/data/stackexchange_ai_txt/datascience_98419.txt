ML algorithm for high dimensional time series forecasting

I'm trying to make a forecasting model for goods prices in an economy (trying to forecast inflation). Dataset: has 300 goods prices % monthly variations for last 6 years. And also added $n$ macroeconomic variables time series. Desired model: Input: Last 12 variation of 300 goods prices + 12 variations of $n$ macroeconomic variables Output: Next variation for 300 goods prices (only one step). I was thinking about using a LSTM model, but I don't know if the dimensionality will be a problem or if there are better models or some kind of recommended data pre processing.
