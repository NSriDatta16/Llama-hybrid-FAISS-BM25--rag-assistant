SVM gamma parameter influence : 2moons data set

I'm working on the two-moons data set, in which we can achieve a perfect discrimination, the classes are separable. I'm using the RBF kernel, and as a consequence, i have to tune the gamma parameter. I noticed that, when gamma is very small, the number of vector support is very important, and the separation will be linear. On the contrary, when gamma will be high (10 for instance), there will be less vector support, and the seperation will fit quasi perfectly. Let me show you what i get : I made some researches. I found that for small values of gamma = high variance (vice versa). "When gamma is very small, the model is too constrained and cannot capture the complexity or “shape” of the data. The region of influence of any selected support vector would include the whole training set. The resulting model will behave similarly to a linear model with a set of hyperplanes that separate the centers of high density of any pair of two classes." I'm not sure understanding everything. Does it say that, for small values of gamma, we will have a lot of vector support, then they will all have the same influence, and tend to "repulse" each other, to create a linear separation? "If gamma is too large, the radius of the area of influence of the support vectors only includes the support vector itself and no amount of regularization with C will be able to prevent overfitting." Again, not sure to understand. I read that when we have a large value of gamma, the vector support will have a strong influence on point which are close to them. No? I'm a bit lost. Moreover, i kind of see the overfitting, but ... Thank you for your help. I read a lot of post about that, but it's still not clear enough.
