Efficient ways of clustering for big data

I have a task which is customer segmentation with 120k users and a record of their purchases which is +3 million records of data, the approach I want to use is to use clustering algorithms like kmeans or pca and then analyze the clusters . I have 2 questions here: what are the ways to analyze and interpret clusters ? most of clustering algorithms that i want to fit raise the MemoryError exception, due to 3M record of data, what should i do?
