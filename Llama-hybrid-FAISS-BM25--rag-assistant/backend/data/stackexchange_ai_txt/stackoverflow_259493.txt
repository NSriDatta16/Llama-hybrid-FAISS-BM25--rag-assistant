Yes, it probably should be given more consideration, and at some places it is. As a part of the new curriculum at the university I attended all programming projects are required to include test cases. There's no way to enforce a particular methodology, like TDD, but I think this is a step in the right direction. There are even tools available, like Web-CAT , that allow for automated evaluation of test coverage. The students submit their code and their tests, and the system tells them how they scored against a set of instructor-accepted tests.
