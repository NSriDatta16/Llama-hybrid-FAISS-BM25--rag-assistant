Can perl.exe handle unquoted paths containing spaces on the command line? Try quoting the path: myProcessStartInfo.Arguments = @"""C:\Documents and Settings\test_perl.pl"""; Since command-line arguments are delimited by spaces, unless the file path is quoted, the application (perl.exe, in this case) will see three arguments: C:\Documents and Settings\test_perl.pl Perl will likely try to open the file "C:\Documents". This doesn't exist, of course. The solution is to quote file paths that contain spaces (or all file paths, to be consistent). You mention that notepad.exe handles unquoted file paths fine. Likely, that's just notepad being smarter than the average bear, and merging its arguments for you. And verify that a file exists at that path, of course. That's actually a slightly unusual path; normally, you'll see user files in something like C:\Documents and Settings\myusername\Documents\file.ext , or such.
