This really isn't specific to GLMMs, or even to GLMs. It's a basic issue with model testing in any kind of models descended from linear models (i.e. [G]LM[M]s ...) Ideally, you wouldn't use AIC/BIC to "test the effect of a parameter" - while the answers often go in similar directions, they are not designed for hypothesis testing. Let's take a look at an example with a strong interaction: beta The question is: what do you mean when you say "test the main effect"? Whether the main effect of $x$ is significant, and in which direction, depends entirely on what value of $y$ you decide on. If you use R's defaults, you are implicitly testing the effect of x at the baseline level of y ("a" in this case) ## helper function pp |t|) ## (Intercept) 0.0249 0.0236 1.05 0.29 ## x 1.0242 0.0255 40.23 So in this case, x is strongly significant (slope=1.02 with SE of 0.0255). If we change to "SAS-style" contrasts where the last level ($y$="b") is the baseline, we get a strongly negative effect (-0.98 with SE of SE 0.03). pp(contrasts=list(y=contr.SAS)) ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) ## (Intercept) -0.00889 0.02892 -0.31 0.76 ## x -0.98022 0.03098 -31.64 Or, if we use sum-to-zero contrasts, we get the average of the slopes when y=a and y=b - about zero (slope = 0.02, SE = 0.02) pp(contrasts=list(y=contr.sum)) ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) ## (Intercept) 0.00801 0.01867 0.43 0.67 ## x 0.02201 0.02005 1.10 0.28 ## y1 0.01690 0.01867 0.91 0.37 ## x:y1 1.00223 0.02005 49.99 The question here is whether "halfway between conditions" means anything at all; if my levels were (e.g.) "male" and "female", is looking at the halfway point sensible? Another reasonable choice would be to test the combination of the main effect and its interaction (i.e. the total effect of x) by comparing models with and without x: anova(lm(z~x*y,dd),lm(z~y,dd)) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: z ~ x * y ## Model 2: z ~ y ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(>F) ## 1 96 3.208 ## 2 98 90.748 -2 -87.541 1310 The bottom line is that when you want to test main effects in the presence of interactions you have to decide what you mean . This is why some old-school statisticians start to foam at the mouth and mutter about the principle of marginality when this topic comes up ...
