In a simplified way of putting it, we substitute the category id with the mean value of the training set target for this category. CatBoost implements some tricks like only using the preceding values when encoding the train set, but transforming the test set will use the whole train statistics anyway ( https://github.com/catboost/catboost/issues/838 ). What happens when a previously unseen category is encountered in the test set? According to https://towardsdatascience.com/categorical-features-parameters-in-catboost-4ebd1326bee5 unseen categories receive a value based upon prior (controlled by CTR arguments). In other words, same as https://catboost.ai/en/docs/concepts/algorithm-main-stages_cat-to-numberic with countInClass being zero. ( category_encoders implementation of CatBoostEncoder() seems to just use the average train target value.)
