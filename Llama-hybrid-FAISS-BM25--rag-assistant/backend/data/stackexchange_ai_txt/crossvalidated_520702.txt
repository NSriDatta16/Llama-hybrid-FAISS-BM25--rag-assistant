Independent of software, for logistic regression, if you mean-zero standardize any covariates using the relationship $z_{ij}=\frac{x_{ij}-\bar{x}_j}{\sigma_j}$ , then you can recover what the coefficient, $\beta_j$ , for variable $\mathbf{x}_j$ would have been, by dividing the coefficient, $\beta_j^*$ , from regression based on $\mathbf{z}_j$ , with the s.d. of $\mathbf{x}_j$ , as in $\beta_j = \frac{\beta_j^*}{\sigma_j}$
