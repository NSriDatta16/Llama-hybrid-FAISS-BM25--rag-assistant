The Java agent is loaded early in starting the JVM (for obvious reasons) and has its own "classpath", so it isn't actually loaded by the (historically named) system class loader. That is why you have a 'jarpath' as part of the command line argument. SO you will need something like System.getSystemClassLoader , URLClassLoader.newInstance (with java.class.path ) or Thread.getContextClassLoader depending upon your circumstances.
