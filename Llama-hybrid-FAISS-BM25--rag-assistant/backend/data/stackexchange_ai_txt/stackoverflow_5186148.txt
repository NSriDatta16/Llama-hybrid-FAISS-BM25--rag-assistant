I assume your 'state' is a 2 letter abbreviation. If that's the case, try setting 'languageEmbedding="never"' in the web.config for your LinkManager. I had similar problem. It tries to interpret your 2 char state as the language, ie: en, sp etc. At least, this is what I think. It fixed the issue I had.
