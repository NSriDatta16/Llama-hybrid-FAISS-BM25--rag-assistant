Are you, for whatever reason, targeting a Mac OS X version before 10.4 as your minimum requirement? If so, no Core Data for you. Are you going to allow the user to manually order things in a list? If so, no Core Data for you—it doesn't allow ordered relationships. (Supposedly you can create a numeric “sequence” property that you can order by, but keeping that consistent sounds like a tremendous hassle.) Are you going to be working with a specific file format as your native format? (For example, TextEdit's native format is RTF.) If not, you won't be using Core Data for on-disk storage, so you may not want to use it at all. (You could , but I'm not sure there are enough other reasons.)
