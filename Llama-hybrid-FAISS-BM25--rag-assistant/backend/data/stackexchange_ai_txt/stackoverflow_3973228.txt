You're getting syntax errors because you don't have quote marks correct in the string concatenation. You need to change upload.uploadfile("192.168.0.210", "muruganp", "vm4snk", "/home/media/Desktop/FTP Upload/+date+"_RB.zip"", "/fileserver/filesbackup/Emac/+date+"_RB.zip""); to upload.uploadfile("192.168.0.210", "muruganp", "vm4snk", "/home/media/Desktop/FTP Upload/"+date+"_RB.zip", "/fileserver/filesbackup/Emac/"+date+"_RB.zip");
