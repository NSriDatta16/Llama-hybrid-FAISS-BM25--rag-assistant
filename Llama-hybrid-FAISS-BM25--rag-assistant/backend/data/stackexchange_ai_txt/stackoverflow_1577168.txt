Lossless PDF rotation

is there a way to rotate a PDF 90 degrees losslessly , with Python or using the command line? I'm looking for a REAL rotation, not just adding a "/ROTATE 90" inside the PDF, because afterwards I have to send the PDF via Hylafax and it looks like that it ignores those commands. I tried with ImageMagick's convert but the quality of the resulting PDF is quite low. (Python 2.6.2, Xubuntu 9.04) Thanks for your attention!
