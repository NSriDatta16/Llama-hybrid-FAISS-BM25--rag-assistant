I have tried to implement the algorithm so elegantly described by Jason above; unfortunately while working though the mathematics in the debugging I found many cases for which it doesn't work. For example consider the points A(10,10) B(20,20) C(10,1) D(1,10) gives h=.5 and yet it is clear by examination that these segments are no-where near each other. Graphing this makes it clear that 0
