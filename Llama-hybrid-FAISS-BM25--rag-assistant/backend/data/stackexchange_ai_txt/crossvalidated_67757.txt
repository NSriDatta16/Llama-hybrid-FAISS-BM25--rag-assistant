do these results contradict each other? Your results do not necessarily contradict each other. Consider this [bad] example, I am trying to guess a person's weight from their height. I know their exact height (in whatever measurement system you like) and I have a rough estimate of their height (i.e. short, medium, tall). While I might be able to make a good guess from the rough estimate, if I have the precise measurement then I wouldn't expect the rough categorization to add anything new (no new information). This isn't a great example, but I wanted it to be more obvious. In your case, it is likely that some of the variables do not account for additional variation in the logistic regression model (i.e. no new information). So it is perfectly acceptable for variables to look associated in a bivariate setting, but often not associated when in a multivariate setting.
