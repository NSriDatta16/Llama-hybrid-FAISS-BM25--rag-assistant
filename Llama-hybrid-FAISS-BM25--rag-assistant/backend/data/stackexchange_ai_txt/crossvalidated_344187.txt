Consine similarity using word embeddings & other metadata

I have a use case where i need to find two similar documents. Each document has some (long) description and some metadata. I can go with TF-IDF representation but i want to take advantage of glove embedding (e.g. "woman is playing" and "man is playing" is same). I have derived array of embedded vector for documents (firstly i converted document to padded sequences of same length, then replaced each word with corresponding embedding) & metadata vector ------------------------------Glove Emb----------------------------- --metadata--- [[[-1.2555, 0.6999, ..., 0.0000], ..., [2.6958, 0.6999, ..., 0.0120]], 0, 0, 1, 2, 5] How can i calculate consine similarity from it? EDIT: I have glove embedded sequences for each document. i.e. vector of embedding. I don't have any idea about calculating cosine similarity from it
