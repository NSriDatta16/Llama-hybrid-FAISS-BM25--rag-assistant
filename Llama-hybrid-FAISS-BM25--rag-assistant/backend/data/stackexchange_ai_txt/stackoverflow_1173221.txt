cin is grossly inelegant but easy for the forgetful to derive: { char c; std::cin >> c; } That holds the window open until you type a character /* edit */ and hit enter. std::cin.get() will close the window the moment you type a character, which, depending on how easily you become habituated, runs a marginally greater risk of "whoops, I wish I hadn't closed that!" than the two-keystroke operator>>(istream &) . Both differ from a system("pause") in that they return in a program-accessible way the value of the character you typed, so, if as not infrequently happens, one kludge leads to another, you can write a switch statement based on what you typed to (for example) exit immediately, write some values to a log, run it again, etc.
