Can stationarity occur over different time periods?

According to what I've read on stationarity it seems like it is either an all or nothing property. Basically, if we have a time series with a unit root then it progresses as a random walk with no stable mean or variance. But is it possible for a time series to be stationary but only over long periods? Could it have periods of nonstationarity followed by stationarity? If so, how could this be detected? Thank you for your help.
