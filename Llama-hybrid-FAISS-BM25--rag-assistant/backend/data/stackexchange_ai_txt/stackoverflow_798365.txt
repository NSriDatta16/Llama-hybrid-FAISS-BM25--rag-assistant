CVS: update a file with its ancestors but without their brethren

I have a file in CVS under x/y/f.txt . In my local copy, I have x/ , but no x/y/ and I want to fetch f.txt from the repo. Is there any combination of CVS command-line switches which can make it pull only x/y/f.txt with all of its ancestors (in this case x/y/ ) but without any collateral files (such as x/y/g.txt or x/z )? The only way I've found so far is: cvs up -d -l x/y # ... but be careful not to pass -P (``prune'') implicitly via your ~/.cvsrc # ``-l'' means act locally, i.e. no recursion # Do the above for every missing ancestor directory, in left-to-right order # And ultimately: cvs up x/y/f.txt However, it would be rather inelegant for a shell script to split a path and iterate through the ancestors, so I'm still looking for a good solution.
