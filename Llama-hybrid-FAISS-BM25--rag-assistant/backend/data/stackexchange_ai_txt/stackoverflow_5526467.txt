Voting system questions

I'm having some trouble approaching a +1/-1 voting system in PHP, it should vaguely resemble the SO voting system. On average, it will get about ~100 to ~1,000 votes per item, and will be viewed by many. I don't know whether I should use: A database table dedicated for voting, which has the userid and their vote... store their vote as a boolean, then calculate the "sum" of the votes in MySQL. A text field in the "item" table, containing the uids that already voted (in a serialized array), and also a numeric field that contains the total sum of the votes. A numeric field in the "item" table, that contains the total sum of the votes, then store whether or not the user voted in a text field (with a serialized array of the poll id). Something completely different (please post some more ideas!)
