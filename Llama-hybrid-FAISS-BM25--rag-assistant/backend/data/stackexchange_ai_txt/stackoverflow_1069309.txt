You are correct about the query, but I want to find the car make/model that gets cheaper the next year ;) You should find cheapest (or average) make/model per year and compare with the cheapest (or average) from previous year (for the same make/model). Then you can see which of them gets cheaper the next year (I suppose most of them)
