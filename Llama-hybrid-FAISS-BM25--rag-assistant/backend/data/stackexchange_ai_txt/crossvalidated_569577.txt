The discriminator is classifying everything as fake. What does it mean?

I am using a conditional GAN with a relativistic loss function for both generator and discriminator ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00734 ). Before I added the relativistic part, the discriminator converges very fast to always classifying right, which got me thinking that maybe the gradients were not changing anymore, and the generator was not learning anymore. After adding the relativistic loss, the discriminator converges to the state of classifying everything as fake. Should I worry about this, even if the generated images look pretty good? What does it mean in terms of training and learning?
