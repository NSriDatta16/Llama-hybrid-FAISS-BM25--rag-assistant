Here is a simple easy way which works if your projects are organised in a nice heirarchal way - open Windows File Explorer at the root of the solution, and do a search on file suffix, once the search is finished the count of files will be in the Explorer status bar at the bottom. For classes that used C#, i could do a whole solution search for the text : MyBaseClass , in the Find window this would return all the classes which derived from whatever MyBaseClass i happened to nominate. I'm not sure of the syntax for R# but you should be able to do something similar. Lastly, i believe ReSharper has a function for this, but it might be only available in the paid version.
