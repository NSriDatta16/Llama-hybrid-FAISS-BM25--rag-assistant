Why are PCA eigenvectors orthogonal and what is the relation to the PCA scores being uncorrelated?

I'm reading up on PCA, and I'm understanding most of what's going on in terms of the derivation apart from the assumption that eigenvectors need to be orthogonal and how it relates to the projections (PCA scores) being uncorrelated? I have two explanations provided below which use a link between orthogonality and correlation but fail to really explain it: ONE , TWO . In the second picture it says that the condition $a_{2}^{T}a_{1}=0$ is imposed to ensure that the projection $y_{2}=Xa_2$ will be uncorrelated with $y_{1}=Xa_1$. Can someone provide an example to show why orthogonal vectors ensure uncorrelated variables? What would happen in PCA if I chose vectors which are not orthogonal; is this even possible? I have read elsewhere that orthogonality is just a by-product of the covariance matrix being symmetric which would suggest that it's not possible to have non pairwise orthogonal eigenvectors. However in the first picture in search of the most 'suitable' matrix it almost seems as we are choosing $p_{1},\ldots,p_{m}$ to be orthogonal to give us a more convenient matrix $\textbf{P}$ one which has nice properties. I've read other posts on this topic but have been unsatisfied with incorporation of the intuition with uncorrelated variables. I really appreciate any help in understanding this confusion!!
