It is well known that if you use non-Gaussian distributions, the conjugacy of the model is lost, see: http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/wordpress/WSFiles/technicalreports/0610.pdf Then, you need to use other MCMC methods, such as Metropolis within Gibbs sampling or some adaptive version of it. Fortunately, there is an R package for doing so: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spBayes/index.html The recommended acceptance rate is 0.44 but, of course, there are some assumptions behind this number, similarly as in the case of the 0.234. Are you THE Dimitris Rizopoulos?
