New answer to an old Q: Definition 1. A statistic is a function that maps each sample to a real number. Every estimator is a statistic. But we tend to call only those statistics that are used to generate estimates ("guesses") some parameter an estimator. So for example, the t-statistic and the sample mean are BOTH statistics. The sample mean is also an estimator (because we often use it to estimate the true population mean). In contrast, we rarely/never call the t-statistic an estimator, because we rarely/never use it to estimate any parameter. In the example below, $P$ is a statistic, but not an estimator. While $Q$ is both a statistic and an estimator. $$$$ $$\underline{\text{Example}}$$ Suppose our parameter-of-interest is the average outcome $\theta$ of a die-roll. $\theta$ is some fixed real number that is perhaps known only to God. Nonetheless, we can try to estimate it. Here's one possible method. We roll a die 3 times. A sample is any $\textbf{s}=\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)$ , where $x_1$ is the outcome of the first roll, $x_2$ that of the second, and $x_3$ that of the third. Here are three examples of samples: $\textbf{s}_1=\left(5,4,1\right)$ , $\textbf{s}_2=\left(4,1,6\right)$ , and $\textbf{s}_3=\left(6,3,2\right)$ . Here are two examples of statistics $P$ and $Q$ (remember that a statistic is simply a function). Define $P$ and $Q$ by: For any $\textbf{s}=\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)$ , $$P(\textbf{s})=\frac{x_1}{\ln(x_2+x_3)},$$ $$Q(\textbf{s})=\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3}.$$ The statistic $P$ is a rather-bizarre statistic and is probably not very useful for anything. Nonetheless, it is a statistic all the same, simply because it satisfies the definition of a statistic (it is a function that maps each sample to a real number). $Q$ is also a statistic. But in addition, it is also an estimator for the parameter $\theta$ . (We could, of course, claim that $P$ is also an estimator for $\theta$ . But it would be a very poor estimator that no one would want to use.)
