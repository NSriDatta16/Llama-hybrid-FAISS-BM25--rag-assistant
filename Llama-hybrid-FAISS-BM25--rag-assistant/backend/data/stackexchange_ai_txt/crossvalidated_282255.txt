Critique 1 in the original question covers the biggest drawback - that it is difficult for someone reading the heat map to decode the quantitative information that is conveyed. Consider an xy-scatter plot or dot plot, where the underlying quantity is directly related to the distance on the chart - very straightforward for interpretation. In a heat map, on the other hand, the person reading the chart is at liberty to interpret 10% 'redder' or 'darker' to their own satisfaction. On top of that is the problem of differing abilities of people to discern colour and shade to begin with. These are genuine disadvantages, but they are not universally fatal. The third critique, by contrast, seems to inadvertently identify an occasion when heat maps are especially useful - when the data is clustered on a 2D plane so that similar values in a third dimension show as patches of a particular shade or colour. So while heat maps are ineffective at some things, they are useful for others, and they should stay in your bag, in the same way that golfers often carry pitching wedges or similar despite their being useless for driving or putting, or carpenters don't disregard hammers because they are no good for cutting wood. In general visualising data should be seen as iterative activity that will take some time as you try a number of visualisations that bring out the important features of the data, including trying more than one kind of visualisation, and then experimenting to find the best settings within particular choices. Nor should it be assumed that the result will be one visualisation - sometimes a number of visualisations of data will needed to highlight multiple important features of the data. In this context, there will be times where for particular features of particular data sets, the heat map will be the most effective, and communicating clusters as described may be one of those times. Overall, there will be frequent occasions where a single visualisation cannot do everything, and more than one will be required.
