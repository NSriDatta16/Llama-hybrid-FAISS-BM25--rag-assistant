Best practices for Magento Deployment

I am looking setting up a deployment process for a highly customized Magento site, and was wondering how other people do this. I will be setting up dev, UAT and prod environments. All the Magento files will be in source control (SVN). At this stage, I can't see any requirements for changing the DB, so the 3 databases will be manually maintained. Specifically, How do you apply Magento upgrades? (Individually in each env, or on dev then roll out, or just give up on upgrades?) What files/folders do leave alone in each environment (e.g. magento/app/etc/local.xml) Do you restrict developers to editing specific files/folders? Do you restrict theme designers to editing specific files/folders? How do you manage database changes? Theme Designer Files/Folders Designers can restricted to editing the following folders- app/design/frontend/your_interface/your_theme/layout/ app/design/frontend/your_interface/your_theme/template/ app/design/frontend/your_interface/your_theme/locale/ skin/frontend/your_interface/your_theme/ Extension Developer Files/Folders Extension developers can edit the following folders/files- /app/code/local /app/etc/modules/ _ .xml Database environment management As the store's base URL is stored in the database, you cannot just copy databases between environments. Options include- Overriding the base url in php. Blog article on setting up dev and staging databases Changing the base url in the database after copying. ( Where is this stored? ) Doing a MySQLDump or backup, then doing a replace on the URL in the SQL file.
