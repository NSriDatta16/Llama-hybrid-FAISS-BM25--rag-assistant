I didn't look through the whole API but XmlDocument : XmlNode : IXPathNavigable And it seems most functions of XslTransform have overloads that accept IXPathNavigable . So, check if this covers what you need but returning IXPathNavigable could be an elegant solution. The XDocument family is not very XSLT friendly.
