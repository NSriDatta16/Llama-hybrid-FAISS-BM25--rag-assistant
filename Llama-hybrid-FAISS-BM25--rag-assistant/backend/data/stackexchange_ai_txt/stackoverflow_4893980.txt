Stream myStream = new FileStream(@"c:\Users\[user]\Desktop\myfile.dat", FileMode.OpenOrCreate); Your FileMode may differ depending on what you're trying to do. Also I wouldn't advise actually using the Desktop for this, but that's what you asked for in the question. Preferably, look into Isolated Storage .
