If you're going to be using C# for your development, then here is one big thing that the next version of the framework and C# will have; Dynamic Types: From Scott Hanselman's blog : C# 4 (not 4.0, the marketing folks say it's .NET 4, etc.) adds the dynamic keyword. I've explained this saying: "There's no way for you or I to know the type of this now, compiler, so let's hope that the runtime figures it out." The key point here, in bold, because it's significant is: having the type dynamic means “use my runtime type for binding” . This is something quite different from the current version of C# and could have some pretty signifigant ways in which code is written. So hidden in all of the hoopla, the new framework does have some added value compared to the current frameworks. Hope this helps some.
