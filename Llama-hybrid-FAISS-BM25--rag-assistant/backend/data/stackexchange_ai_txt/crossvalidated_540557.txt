Clustering machine learning algorithms

I am looking for a clustering algorithm that can separate my data into clusters. The data has three different variables and there are approx 500k samples. I need some control over the number of samples in each cluster - preferably the two clusters should be approximately equal in size. Does this exist in a python package?
