Time Series Intervention Analysis with armax function

My aim is to quantify the effect of an intervention on a time series of outcome-measures. For that, I tried to follow this blog post: https://www.r-bloggers.com/time-series-intervention-analysis-wih-r-and-sas/ This is the dependent time series rate I tried to identify the arima processes and estimated the model. As it is yearly data, I am not assuming any seasonality. acf(rate) pacf(rate) auto.arima(rate) mod.1 As I am assuming a step change (from a theoretical point of view), I created a step transfer function. The Intervention happens after 11 years: intervention Now when it comes to estimating the intervention analysis, I am struggling, especially because I am not entirely sure I understand the components of the arimax function. mod.2 gives me the following error: Error in stats::arima(x, order = order, seasonal = seasonal, fixed = par[1:narma], : wrong length for 'fixed' Where does the error come from? What does the transfer=list(c(1,0)) part specify? I am also not entirely sure how to interpret the outcome: What information quantifies the effect the intervention had on the dependent variable? Could I add other possible confounding variables through xreg? And one general question: Are there enough data points to justify this type of analysis? Thank you very much!
