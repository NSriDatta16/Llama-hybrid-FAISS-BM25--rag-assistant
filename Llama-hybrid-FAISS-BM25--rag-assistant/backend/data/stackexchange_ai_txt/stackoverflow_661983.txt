I did a lot of study recently regarding memory management and this is the most informative and helpful article I found on the net. http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-memory/ Based on that paper the best and fastest result you will get is to divide your 64 MB into equal sized chunks. The size of chunks will depend on your object size. And allocate or deallocate a full chunk at a time. It's Faster than incremental garbage collection. Simpler. And solves that "too much fragmantation" problem by some amount. Read it, you will find excellent information on every possible solution there is and merits and demerits for each.
