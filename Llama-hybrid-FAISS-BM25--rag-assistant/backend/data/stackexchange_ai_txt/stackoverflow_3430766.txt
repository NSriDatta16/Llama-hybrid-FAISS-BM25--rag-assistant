What about leaving the MouseClick event handler as it is and just add another obj.Selected = Not obj.Selected to the DoubleClick event handler? That of course results in a select unselect sequence (or other way around) for the double click and I don't know if the blinking will be recognized by the user but I guess it's worth a try and it's much easier without the timer. edit: This rather pragmatic solution doesn't work if there is any event handler attached to the SelectionChanged event of the target object because it would trigger twice where it shouldn't trigger at all.
