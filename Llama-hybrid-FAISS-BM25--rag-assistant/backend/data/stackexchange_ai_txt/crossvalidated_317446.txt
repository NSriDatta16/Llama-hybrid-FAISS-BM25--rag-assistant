Area Under Curve for Anomaly Detection

I am performing Anomaly Detection using a CNN with a skew ratio of 1:9, and am using auc of the roc curve for evaluation of the model. The output of the CNN is a list of probabilities of positive and negative class. For predicting the label, I am also using a threshold of 0.1 for probabilities. For example, if P(negative class) To incorporate this threshold and evaluate the model, how should I call the roc_auc_score function of scikit-learn as it needs y_score parameter? What should the y_score parameter be? roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score, average=’macro’, sample_weight=None)
