Guidelines for building Data Acces Layer with SQL

There are a lot of information on building DAL with ORM ((N)Hibernate, LINQ to SQL). But I can't find any recomendations on doing it with plain SQL or mixed (ORM + SQL) approach. I wonder, are there any resources (sites, books) on this subject? Besides common best practices I've got a few points of interest: how organize storing of sql strings dynamic generation of sql strings transforming queries resultsets to domain objects querying associated collections minimize boilerplate data access code
