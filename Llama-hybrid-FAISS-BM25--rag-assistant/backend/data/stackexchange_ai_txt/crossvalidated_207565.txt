Loss function calculation in "Multiple Object Recognition with Visual Attention"

In the paper Multiple Object Recognition with Visual Attention the author has described a way to calculate loss function using REINFORCE algorithm. Could anybody explain how to empirically calculate loss given the following inputs: L = [l1,l2,l3, ..., ln] y_pred = [y'1,y'2,y'3,...., y'n] y_true = [y1,y2,y3,...., yn]
