Quoting the " Read and learn " page of the symfony-reloaded website : Please note that Symfony 2 is not yet ready for production . The final release is planned for late 2010 and will only support PHP 5.3.2. In the meantime, we highly encourage you to use the current symfony 1.4 stable release for all your projects. If the authors of Symfony themselves say that Symfony 2.0 should not be used now -- well, I suppose you shouldn't use it ;-) Especially if your project should be finished something like 6 month before the date when SYmfony 2.0 stable will be released !
