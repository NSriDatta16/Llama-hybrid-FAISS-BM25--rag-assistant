If voting happens only from logged in (known) members then you shouldn't have any problem. If, on the other hand, everyone can vote then you need to store all user vote events: timestamp poll poll_vote ip user agent user uniqueness cookie So you'll need a random hash sent out as cookie. This will ensure that you don't accept another vote for the same poll from the same person. If the user deletes his cookies you fallback to plan B, where you don't allow more than (say) 10 votes from the same IP and user agent combination for 24 hours. The system is not perfect since users can change IPs and (more easily) user agents. You'd need advanced pattern detection algorithms to detect suspicious votes. The good thing about storing all user vote events is that you can process these later on using a scheduler, or outsource the votes to someone else who can process them for you. Good luck
