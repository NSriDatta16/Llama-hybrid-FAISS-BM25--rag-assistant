I am sure that we all have experienced a time when a seemingly small change to the system under test caused dozens of unit tests to fail. Here's your trouble. The problem isn't maintaining tests, the problem is you have a brittle codebase. If one change causes dozens of failures you either have a codebase with a lot of fragile couplings, or a test suite with lots of pseudo-integration tests that are testing too much. If one change is breaking dozens of tests then you probably need to take some spike time to refactor the heavily coupled sections of your code OR you need to break out your tests and eliminate duplicated test conditions.
