It's never advisable to loop through records when a SQL Update can be used. It's not clear from your question what database interface layer you are using, but it is possible with the right interfaces to insert data from a source outside a database if the interface being used supports both types of databases. This can be done in the FROM clause of your SQL statement by specifying not just the table name, but the connect string for the database. Assuming that your web host has ODBC drivers for Jet data (you're not actually using Access, which is the app development part -- you're only using the Jet database engine), the connect string should be sufficient. EDIT: If you use the Jet database engine to do this, you should be able to specify the source table something like this (where tblSQLServer is a table in your Jet MDB that is linked via ODBC to your SQL Server): INSERT INTO tblSQLServer (ID, OtherField ) SELECT ID, OtherField FROM [c:\MyDBs\Access.mdb].tblSQLServer The key point is that you are leveraging the Jet db engine here to do all the heavy lifting for you.
