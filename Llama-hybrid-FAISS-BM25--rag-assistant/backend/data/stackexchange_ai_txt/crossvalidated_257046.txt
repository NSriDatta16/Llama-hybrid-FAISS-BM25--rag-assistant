EM steps for a hidden Markov model when observables are aggregate of individual states

Given several Markov chains running in parallel, suppose one doesn't know which chain is moving from one state to another at each time, but instead observe the aggregate amount of chains in each state at each time. How can one find the Hidden Markov Model in this setting? Example : Take two individual chains and two states $s_1,s_2$: At time $t=1$, $|S_1|=1, |S_2|=1$ which means there is one individual chain in each state At time $t=2$, $|S_1|=2, |S_2|=0$ which means both chains moved to the first state and none to in the other At time $t=3$, $|S_2|=0, |S_1|=2$ hence both chains moved to the second state and none remained in the other More related questions : What if some states do not commute? What if transition probability is changing over time?
