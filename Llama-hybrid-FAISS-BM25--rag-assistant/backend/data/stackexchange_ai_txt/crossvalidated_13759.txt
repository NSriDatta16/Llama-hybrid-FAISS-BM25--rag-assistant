Here is a simple element of answer A simple way to decide whether or not having filled in the form is related to explanatory variables is to perform a logistic regression where the binary response variable is 1 if the person answered and 0 otherwise. If it turns out that having filled in the form is not related to explanatory variables then your sample of respondents may be seen as a random sub-sample of your sample, and hence as a random sample of the original population. Of course, the power of your tests will be affected... You will find more if you look at the missing data problem. Edit The previous technique requires a special framework --- see Whuber's comments.
