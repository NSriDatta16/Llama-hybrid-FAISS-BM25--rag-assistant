#pragma is a directive to the compiler. In this case, it asks the compiler to put a "comment" into the final object file, and this comment is then used by the linker to link against the library. Then it initializes the SDL library. Then it registers SDL_Quit function to be executed at program exit. Then pause, otherwise the program quits immediately.
