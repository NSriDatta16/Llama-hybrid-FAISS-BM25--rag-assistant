Preventing access to fonts with .htaccess

My client ask me to use an especial font with @font-face on his website. But, that font is an asset to his organization, and he's afraid people would steal it. So, is there any way to make that .ttf file accesible by the browser, but prevent direct access (right now, you can read the url within the .css file, and download the font with any browser). I know there's no absolute solution, and the font would still be available for someone with the right skills set. But I just want to make it harder to steal for the non-experts. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! How I solved this? Reading this . Typekit's team did a GREAT job on this one. It's really impossible to prevent the robery, but you can make it hard. I did two things: With FontSquirrel Generator, I removed all the desktop glyphs, making the font unusable on a desktop. Encode with Base64 all my TTF directly on my CSS file. (ie. src: url(data:font;base64,jdslajdsaljdlsajdsa)) EOT fonts, for IE, can't be converted to Base64. But, you can load those v√≠a a php script that checks the referer, and prevent the direct access. You still can reassemble the font having the base64, and yes, you can fake the referer and download the .EOT. But it would take someone with the right skills-set. People who steals fonts are regulary designer who doesn't know how to trick apache.
