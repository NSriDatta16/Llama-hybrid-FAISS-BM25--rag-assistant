Simple WPF UI databinding

I'm trying to write a simple WPF app that has two ellipses, joined by a line, like you might see in a network graph. When the ellipses are animated, I just want the joining line to automagically 'stick' to the canvas locations of the two ellipses that the line joins. The XAML is just a canvas: ...and I'm just doing some really simple stuff in the constructor here: using System; using System.Windows; using System.Windows.Controls; using System.Windows.Data; using System.Windows.Media; using System.Windows.Media.Animation; using System.Windows.Shapes; namespace UIDataBindingDemo { /// /// Interaction logic for Window1.xaml /// public partial class Window1 : Window { public Window1() { InitializeComponent(); // create 2 ellipses, one next to the other, and add them to the canvas Ellipse el1 = new Ellipse(); Canvas.SetTop(el1, 100); Canvas.SetLeft(el1, 100); el1.Width = 20; el1.Height = 20; el1.Fill = Brushes.Red; el1.Stroke = Brushes.Black; Ellipse el2 = new Ellipse(); Canvas.SetTop(el2, 100); Canvas.SetLeft(el2, 200); el2.Width = 20; el2.Height = 20; el2.Fill = Brushes.Blue; el2.Stroke = Brushes.Black; cnvExample.Children.Add(el1); cnvExample.Children.Add(el2); // create a line that connects the 2 ellipses. Bind the two points that define this line to the // locations of our ellipses, so the line always connects them, through animations, drag and drop // operations, whatever. Line line = new Line(); line.StrokeThickness = 3; line.Stroke = Brushes.Black; line.SetBinding(Line.X1Property, new Binding("(Canvas.Left)") { Source = el1 }); line.SetBinding(Line.X1Property, new Binding("(Canvas.Top)") { Source = el1 }); line.SetBinding(Line.X1Property, new Binding("(Canvas.Left)") { Source = el2 }); line.SetBinding(Line.X1Property, new Binding("(Canvas.Top)") { Source = el2 }); cnvExample.Children.Add(line); // animate the second ellipse, so it moves down and to the right, nice and slow var moveTheBlueOne = new DoubleAnimation(300, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); el2.BeginAnimation(Canvas.LeftProperty, moveTheBlueOne); el2.BeginAnimation(Canvas.TopProperty, moveTheBlueOne); } } I'm pretty new to WPF, and I'm sure I'm missing something simple. Why am I not seeing the line?
