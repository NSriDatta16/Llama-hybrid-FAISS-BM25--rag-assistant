This is a lot of work but it creates form level storage For each of your shared variables convert it to a property on the WebForm. Then store the values in the ViewState 'default to 0 if blank, else convert to int Public Property IsAreaSelected() As Integer Get Return If(ViewState("IsAreaSelected") Is Nothing, 0, Cint(ViewState("IsAreaSelected"))) End Get Set(ByVal value As Integer) ViewState("IsAreaSelected") = value End Set End Property This way the values stay with the page. Please note I coded this up on the fly and not in VS so you may have to tweak it.
