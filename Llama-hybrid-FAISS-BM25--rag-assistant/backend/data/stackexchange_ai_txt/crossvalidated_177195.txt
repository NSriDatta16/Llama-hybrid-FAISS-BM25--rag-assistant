Cross Validation is typically used to search hyper parameter space to find an optimal value. In your case you are using cross validation to get a better estimate of the error. If the variance of error between different folds is low then you are doing ok on the technique. The test error is average cross validation error. I will typically give the final model by training it again on the entire data set.
