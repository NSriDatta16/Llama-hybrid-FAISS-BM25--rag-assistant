How to filter the dropdown list by using other dropdown list in asp.net MVC web-application

everyone, I encounter a problem when I try to filter the drop down list. The situation is I wish to filter the Agent dropdown list by using the Company dropdown list in same view/form. Since I need to display the Agents that only belong to the selected Company. But I have no idea to do that. Any solution, please?
