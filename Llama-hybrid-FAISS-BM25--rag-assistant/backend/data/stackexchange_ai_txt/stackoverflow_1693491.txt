I would recommend that you set up a test yourself. Why ? CouchDb and MySql are very different beasts, and how you would choose to organise data in each would be very dependent on your problem domain. Consequently how you query them will differ as well. I think that some dummy data in each and some benchmarking by yourself will be more worthwhile than looking at the results of some arbitrary test. I realise this will take some time in itself, but I think it's the best way forward.
