MySQL doesn't care if it's PHP or Ruby. Yes , there are potential issues with multiple clients accessing the database simultaneously , though. There's a lot possible to go wrong. Just one random example: Client 1 intends to a) subtract 10 from integer column_x (= 10), and then b) add this 10 to integer column_y. Imagine Client 1 is done with step a), but before it manages to do b), Client 2 comes, intending to do something only if either column_x or column_y value is positive. And erroneously does nothing, as far as the 10 has not arrived to column_y yet. Basically, you're getting all the problems of multiple execution threads with a shared state . To address such issues, transactions exist. MySQL provides several transaction isolations levels , which depend on the storage engine of your tables. Thus, all the modifications (and reads for REPEATABLE READ & SERIALIZABLE isolation level) must be executed within a database transaction, starting with START TRANSACTION , and ending with COMMIT SQL statement. If there's a problem in the middle of your routine, and you can't finish the transaction as a whole, execute ROLLBACK to undo all the changes made since the START TRANSACTION call.
