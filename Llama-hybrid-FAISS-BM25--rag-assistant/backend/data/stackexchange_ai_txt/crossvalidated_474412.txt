How to change priors in Bayesian estimation, if we get to know previous work was wrong?

Assuming we are doing a task to find how runs will be scored some match and for that, we have assumed some prior, now what if we find out midway through the process on which we built our priors was inaccurate due to various factors. How should we the strategize for the further process and at the same time not dump the previous work done so far though the initial priors were not correct?
