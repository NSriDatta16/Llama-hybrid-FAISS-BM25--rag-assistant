The string you pass as :conditions needs to be an sql fragment. In the example given "customers.date" refers to the date field of the customers table. I think the "customers" bit is not strictly necessary, as the table name is clear from the context. In your example the following should work: @nonorders = @customer.orders.find(:all, :conditions => "order_date IS NOT NULL")
