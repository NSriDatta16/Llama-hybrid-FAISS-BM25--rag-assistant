Parallel gsub: how does one remove a different string in each element of a vector

I have a guest list that has a last name in one column and then in another column I have the first names or the full names (first space last) of each person in the family. I am wanting to get the other column to just have the first names. gsub(guest.w$Last.Name,"",guest.w$Party.Name.s.) That would work perfectly if I just had one row but how do it do it for each row in the dataframe. Do I have to write a for loop? Is there a way to do it in parallel similarly to the way pmax() relates to max(). My problem is similar in a way to a previously asked question by JD Long but that question was a piece of cake compared to mine. Example : Smith; Joe Smith, Kevin Smith, Jane Smith Alter; Robert Alter, Mary Alter, Ronald Alter Becomes Smith; Joe, Kevin, Jane Alter; Robert, Mary, Ronald
