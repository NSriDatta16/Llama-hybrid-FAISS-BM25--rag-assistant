Remember PCA is a dimension reduction technique. The idea is to have as much variance explained, will retaining as few principal components as possible. You cannot randomly choose to keep the second component, but not the first one. Even if the second component explains a higher percentage of the variation - this is due to the eigenvalues. A nice way to see how many components you should retain, is by using a scree plot.
