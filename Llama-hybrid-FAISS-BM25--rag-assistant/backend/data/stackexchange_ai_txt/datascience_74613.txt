How to classify very short text for spend analytics?

I have a very small description of the item, example below- ACCELATOR SHAFT ADAPTOR â€“EGR PIPE & EGR VALVE(125KVA) ADAPTOR-EGR COOLER AND VALVE-125 KVA ADJUSTING LATCH - ALTERNATOR-125 KVA Some items are just one word long and maximum number of words in a sentence are around 6. These items need to be classified into category and a sub category for further spend analysis. This is a generic problem and many of our clients have similar problems and it takes a lot of time in classifying this manually so we are trying to develop a ML/NLP model to expedite this process. For problem at hand we have around 2000+ unique items into 6 categories, each category having around 300 items. We plan to tag around 100 items in each category and expect the model to classify the rest. How do we approach the problem, If someone already dealt with such a problem in past, guidance will be helpful Does it make sense to go with tokenization/TFIDF approach with such a small description What other Neural Network based methods we can look at (LSTM, RNN etc, but will 100 tags per category be sufficient for training)
