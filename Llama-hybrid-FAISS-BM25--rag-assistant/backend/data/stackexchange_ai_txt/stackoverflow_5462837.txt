What are the steps required to mount the external storage (SD card) of Samsung Galaxy S from a chroot shell

I have placed an ubuntu.img file in a folder on my SD card as well as the following scripts obtained from - http://blog.coralic.nl/2010/08/17/ubuntu-on-samsung-galaxy-s-android/ /mnt/sdcard/ubuntu/start #!/bin/bash #Created by Armin Coralic http://blog.coralic.nl if [ "$1" == "" ] ; then echo "You need to specify the img file!" exit 9; fi if `test -d /data/local/mnt` ; then echo "/data/local/mnt" else mkdir /data/local/mnt fi export HOME=/root export USER=root export PATH=$bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:$PATH mount -o loop,noatime -t ext2 $1 /data/local/mnt sleep 3 mount -t proc proc /data/local/mnt/proc mount -t devpts devpts /data/local/mnt/dev/pts chroot /data/local/mnt /bin/bash /mnt/sdcard/ubuntu/stop #!/bin/bash #Created by Armin Coralic http://blog.coralic.nl umount /data/local/mnt/dev/pts umount /data/local/mnt/proc umount /data/local/mnt After running the start script, I get an ubuntu chrooted shell, but I do not have access to my external storage SD card from within the chroot. I would like to know the answer for the following two questions: 1) what is the /dev/block/ device file name for the external SD card which I should mount on a Samsung Galaxy S I9000? 2) what is the exact syntax that I should use before/after entering chroot to get read/write/execute access to the external SD storage? It would be helpful if the start/stop scripts could be modified with the required changes.
