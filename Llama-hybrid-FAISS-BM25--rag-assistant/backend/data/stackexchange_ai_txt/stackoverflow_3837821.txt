How do I code one import statement that the entire App recognises

I remember reading somewhere but I cannot remember where exactly I need to write the import statement so that the whole App has access to it. I have a AppHelper class which I want the whole app to see without importing it in every class file. So I have tried to add it to my .pch file but I get the following error messages: "_kGTMHTTPFetcherStatusDomain", referenced from: _kGTMHTTPFetcherStatusDomain$non_lazy_ptr in GTMHTTPFetcher.o (maybe you meant: _kGTMHTTPFetcherStatusDomain$non_lazy_ptr) "_kGTMHTTPFetcherRetryDelayStartedNotification", referenced from: _kGTMHTTPFetcherRetryDelayStartedNotification$non_lazy_ptr in GTMHTTPFetcher.o (maybe you meant: _kGTMHTTPFetcherRetryDelayStartedNotification$non_lazy_ptr) This is my .pcb file: // // Prefix header for all source files of the 'SplitView' target in the 'SplitView' project // #import #ifndef __IPHONE_3_2 #warning "This project uses features only available in iPhone SDK 3.2 and later." #endif #ifdef __OBJC__ #import #import #endif #import "AppCache.h"
