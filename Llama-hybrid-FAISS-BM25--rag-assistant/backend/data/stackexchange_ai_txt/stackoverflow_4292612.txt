Instead of Show[] use Overlay[] and the Alignment option: Overlay[{fig, p}, Alignment -> {-0.75, 0.33}] (* x,y values in [-1,1] *) You can control the size of both Plot and Overlay individually by using the ImageSize option in either of both of them. And remember that you gan get the image size of the graphic you are importing via Import["filename.ext", "ImageSize"] . So to make sure that the plot is the same size as the image you could do: size = Import["filename.ext", "ImageSize"]; p = Plot[Graphics[Points[data]], ImageSize->size];
