WinForms window drag event

Is there an event in WinForms that get's fired when a window is dragged? Or is there a better way of doing what I want: to drop the window opacity to 80% when the window is being dragged around? Unfortunately this is stupidly tricky to search for because everyone is looking for drag and drop from the shell, or some other object.
