Java StringBuffer questions

class MyStringBuffer { //TODO explain: why you would need these data members. private char[] chars; //character storage. private int length; //number of characters used public String toString(){ //TODO //Hint: just construct a new String from the ‘chars’ data member //and return this new String – See API online for how create //new String from char[] This is only part of the code, I didn't want to post the whole thing. I just to focus on this and then then move on when I fully understand it. 1) What does he mean when he said construct a new String from the 'chars' data member? I'm confused as to what he wants me to do. Am I suppose to do something with char charAt(int index) ? or something like this: StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("test"); ? 2) Does construct and create mean the same thing in Java?
