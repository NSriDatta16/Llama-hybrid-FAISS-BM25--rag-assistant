Self-referencing models in Rails 3

I have an Entity model and I want to display connections between the Entities. ie, Entity 1 is connected to Entity 2. My thinking, right now, is to create a join model between the two called Connection and have it work like a traditional rails join table. Except have the columns be entity_one_id and entity_two_id, then establish a many-to-many relationship between Entity and Connection. This seems like a really not-elegant way to do this. I was wondering if anyone had any better ideas? Maybe something more rails-esque that I'm just not seeing?
