Hypothesis Testing Assumes a Model & Conditions Need Met Hypothesis testing inherently involves a model to reason about the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis. In a way, hypothesis testing is almost always able to be seen as a goodness of fit test where a "do not reject null hypothesis" is a "good enough fit" to the hypothesis tests assumed model and focused statistic of interest. However, your question hinges on whether the hypothesis test's assumed model is the correct model you care about for your data. If sub populations are not resulting in a good fit then this demonstrates an issue in certainty of the model at a local level for your data. It would be more desirable and a clearer cut answer if the sub populations were a good fit. Since they are not that lack of fit indicates higher uncertainty in localized regions more than the global perspective (full model as you put it). I would suspect that if the conditions to apply the hypothesis test of choice are not satisfied (assuming the sub population goodness of fit is such a condition) then you cannot appropriately conduct that hypothesis test on the data. It'd be an improper application of the test. An example: if a hypothesis test about significantly different mean of data to null hypothesis model's mean, then there has to exist a first moment (expectation is the mean) in the underlying model of the data, which requires proper data design or knowledge of the family of underlying distribution of the data. Specifics in the Archer-Lemeshow test With respect to the Archer-Lemeshow test, the paper refers to it as a "Goodness-of-fit test, called the F -adjusted mean residual test" [1, pg 101]. Though Archer was a grad student of Lemeshow so I am uncertain if there is another test you are referring to. The paper is linked and open access. After fitting the logistic regression model, the test in this paper breaks the residuals into 10 bins (deciles). They discuss using the F-corrected Wald statsistic over those bins with g - 1 degrees of freedom, where here g=10. From my understanding, the lack of fit within can be an issue if severe enough. However, further digging into the conditions necessary to apply this test on your data needs to be done. References K. Archer, S. Lemeshow.
