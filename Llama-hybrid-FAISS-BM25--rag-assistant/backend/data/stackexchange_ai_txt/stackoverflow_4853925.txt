Looking for a shortcut for specificying parameters in an ObectDataSource UpdateMethod

I am using an ObectDataSorce in my asp.net C# code, with SelectMethod() that calls a method that returns List . (I don't think it matters to the question, but I am displaying the data in the UI in an infragistics webdatagrid.) I am working on UpdateMethod() now. I tried using Employee employee as the input parameter to the method, as I used as the parameter in the SelectMethod() , but the compiler is looking for each property in Employee broken out as a separate parameter, i.e. String Fn, String Ln, String Address1 , etc. Any there any shortcuts for doing this rather than creating the method with a whole long list of parameters? Or leaving out the parameters for stuff that was readonly?
