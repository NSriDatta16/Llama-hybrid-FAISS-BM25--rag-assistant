Haskell gtk2hs, no suitable image found

I'm trying to use GTK+'s Haskell API gtk2hs in OSX. I have installed ghc and haskell-platform via Homebrew. Then I ran these three commands: cabal update cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools cabal install gtk I'm trying to make this little program to run: module GUI where import Graphics.UI.Gtk main = do initGUI win It compiles just fine. But when I run main, I get: Loading package array-0.3.0.1 ... linking ... done. Loading package bytestring-0.9.1.7 ... linking ... done. Loading package containers-0.3.0.0 ... linking ... done. Loading package filepath-1.1.0.4 ... linking ... done. Loading package old-locale-1.0.0.2 ... linking ... done. Loading package old-time-1.0.0.5 ... linking ... done.

Did find: /usr/local/Cellar/gettext/0.17/lib/libintl.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture) I saw some other examples of this problem while googling, but none suitable in this case.
