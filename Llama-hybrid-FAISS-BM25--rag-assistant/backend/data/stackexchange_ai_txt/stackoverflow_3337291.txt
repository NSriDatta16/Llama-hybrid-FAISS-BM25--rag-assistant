Just use ASP.NET pages. We made an app at my previous employer that did a very similar thing. We made a view to relate all the available properties for a given application/program/report. The users had a list to select properties from, and then filtered those properties accordingly. Each property type was a separate object with different filterable properties that the 'manager' could setup for their users. After selected what columns they wanted to view/filter, the clicked go, we generated SQL and placed 15/30 results at a time back into a paging gridview. If they wanted to see more than that they could download an Excel CSV export file. For large, less filtered queries, we restricted the row return count to something reasonable that wouldn't time-out. It isn't the most elegant, but it was VERY versatile and made almost everyone happy. To Clarify - this reporting system in and of itself was an app we built (OOP, NHibernate, etc.) to support and simplify this process.
