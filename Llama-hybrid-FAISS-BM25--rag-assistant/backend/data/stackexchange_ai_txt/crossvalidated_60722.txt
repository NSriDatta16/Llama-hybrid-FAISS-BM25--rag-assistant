I would interpret your results as follows: The first model shows that the likelihood of getting the outcome (dependent variable = 1) decreases as the years of parenting increase. The odds ratio is simply the exponentiated regression coefficient ($OR=\exp(-0.532)=0.587$) and if years of parenting are continuous, represents the odds ratio per 1 unit (I assume per 1 year) of parenting. It doesn't matter whether you look at the regression coefficient or at the odds ratio to see how the relationship is: if the regression coefficient is negative, the odds ratio is This site offers a good starting point on how to interpret logistic regression results. This site here even discusses it with an annotated SPSS output. In the second model containing the interaction, the interaction is significant whereas the main effect is not any more. This has been discussed in this post , for example. Interactions mean that the slope (on the log-odds scale) for years parenting differ for different levels of similarity index. Just because the inclusion of the interaction term made your main effect insignificant, you should not exclude the main effect. See here on how to report interactions in logistic regressions ( this paper seems very useful too). You should also ask the question whether an interaction makes sense from a scientific point of view.
