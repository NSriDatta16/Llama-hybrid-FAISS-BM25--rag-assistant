Is it normal for ROC curve thresholds to be Inf or -Inf?

I am running a binary classification with a random forest via the ranger package in R , and am using the pROC package for building an ROC curve and calculating AUC. But, the using the coords() function returns only three rows, and two of them are either -Inf or Inf . > coords(rf_roc) threshold specificity sensitivity 1 -Inf 0.000 1.000 2 0.5 0.692 0.806 3 Inf 1.000 0.000 My question is: Is this normal, or does it indicate that there is an issue in my model/data? For reference, I've included the confusion matrix results: Confusion Matrix and Statistics Reference Prediction 0 1 0 211 72 1 94 300 Accuracy : 0.755 95% CI : (0.721, 0.787) No Information Rate : 0.549 P-Value [Acc > NIR] :
