It's odd that you are having this difficulty if you can still remember anything about C. I have a similar background but I don't find C# hard to read at all. Are you getting confused by LINQ or lambdas / anonymous methods ? EDIT you say it's LINQ: here are some links for LINQ. The LINQ syntax is different in VB from C# and there's not much help out there for the VB syntax. The MSDN 101 VB LINQ samples are good, and I also liked the coverage in the book Programming VB 2008 . Lambdas are a way of writing methods inline that might be the "inline syntax" you are referring to? In which case, just read up on them and try them out: you could try them out in C# or VB.Net. There were some useful articles on differences between C# and VB.Net in Visual Studio magazine back in Jan 2008. What VB developers should know about C# And for completeness, What C# developers should know about VB You might also be interested in the question " what's allowed in VB that is prohibited in C# (or vice versa) " Full disclosure : the bottom part of this answer is copied almost unchanged from this question on converting C# knowledge to VB.Net
