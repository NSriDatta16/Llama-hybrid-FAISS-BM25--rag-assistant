Just as JohnRos says above, you can indeed look for global single tree approximation of Random Forest by trying to fit a single tree to the prediction of the Random forest on a (very) large number of points. It may work for other black box model. It's called the "oracle" approach to global single tree approximation by [1] (because the black box is used as an oracle to fit the single tree). If I dare, I've loaded a couple of exemples and more explanation on Github here : https://github.com/ljmdeb/GSTA [1] Riccardo Guidotti, Anna Monreale, Salvatore Ruggieri, Franco Turini, Fosca Giannotti, and Dino Pedreschi. 2018. A Survey of Methods for Explaining Black Box Models. ACM Comput. Surv. 51, 5, Article 93 (August 2018), 42 pages. (especialy the table on page 93:26)
