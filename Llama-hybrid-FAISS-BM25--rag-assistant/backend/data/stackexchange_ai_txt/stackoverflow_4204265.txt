Embedding a swf on a wordpress page

I'm trying to embed a .swf into a wordpress page. This sounds simple, but it isn't working and I cannot fathom out why. I've uploaded all the relevant files onto the server, and I'm fairly sure all the filepaths are correct. The folder containing the .fla and .swf files also contained an index.html file, which I have put into a template. I've tried putting the supplied code into the HTML on the page, I've tried simply using said template, and the best I'm getting is a blank area which doesn't load the flash content. Could anyone suggest what I might have done wrong? Unfortunately I can't paste the code into here as it's full of javascript.
