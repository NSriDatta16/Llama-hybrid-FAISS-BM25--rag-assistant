Newey-West standard errors are a version of standard errors that corrects for serial correlations of regression residuals. If a regression model is run as $$ y_t = x_t' \beta + \epsilon_t $$ (where $x_t$ may contain lagged values of $y_t$ as needed), then Newey-West covariance matrix estimator has a form $$ v[\hat\beta_{\rm OLS}] = (X'X)^{-1} \frac{n}{n-p} \sum_{l=0}^m K(l,m) e_t e_{t-l} (x_t' x_{t-l} + x_{t-l}' x_t) (X'X)^{-1} $$ where the leftmost summation is over possible lags that the regression errors are suspect of being correlated; $n$ is the sample size, $p$ is the number of regressors; $K(l,m)$ is a kernel of the estimator, $K(l,m)=1-l/(m+1), l>0; K(0,m)=1/2$ in the original Newey and West paper.
