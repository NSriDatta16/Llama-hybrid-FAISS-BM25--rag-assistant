As one of the developers of vegan (though not the adonis() function) I am reasonably well-placed to comment; unfortunately, adonis() assumes vegdist() is to be used for computation of the dissimilarity matrix in the function. Changing adonis() wouldn't be too difficult to do so that it allows any function that returns an object of class "dist" to be used in place of vegdist() - in fact it would be trivial - but I'd need to know which function you intended to use to compute the mahalanobis distance so I could write a wrapper function and provide a modified adonis() here for your use. Changing the actual adonis() function in vegan is more involved... In the meantime, I'll take this up with the vegan developers; there are several functions in vegan that could benefit from being generalised to allow different dissimilarity functions and some already allow this. At this point in the package's development, we should be looking at making the variously-authored functions work more similarly.
