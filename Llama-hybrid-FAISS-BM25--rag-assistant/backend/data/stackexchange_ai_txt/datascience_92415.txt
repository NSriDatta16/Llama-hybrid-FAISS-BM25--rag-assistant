Which possible models can I use to predict results from this dataset?

I'm new at predicting things like this. I have a data set. The head of it is shown here: I have yet another data set for the upcoming basketball games that are taking place soon with the score columns blank. I have to use the current data that I have that spans from 2010-2020 to predict what will happen soon. It's just that I have little knowledge of this and no experience in machine learning although i would be willing to learn.
