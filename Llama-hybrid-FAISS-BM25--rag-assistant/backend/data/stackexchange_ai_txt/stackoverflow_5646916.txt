Assuming you are hitting the Oracle bug(s) and can't patch the database, you could try moving the subquery to a function. Not entirely sure this will work, and assumes your PL/SQL version is in a package, or there's one available that can have a function added: In the package spec: type q1_rec is record( d_id ab_a_table.v_id%TYPE, v_id ab_a_table.d_id%TYPE, c_id ab_a_table.c_id%TYPE, l_val char(1), c_val ab_a_table.c_val%TYPE); type q1_arr is varray(9999); -- assuming you can pick a max size function q1 return q1_arr pipelined; pragma restrict_references(q1, wnds); In the package body: function q1 return q1_arr pipelined is cursor c is select a.V_ID, a.D_ID, a.C_ID, case when a.percent > 0 THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' end L_val, a.C_val from ab_a_table a where a.C_ID = '00000003' -- '00000007' -- test values and a.B_VAL = '6010001' and a.Q = '11234567'); begin for r in c loop pipe row(r); end loop; end; And then in your main query replace the subquery with table(q1()) . Using a ref cursor or nested table might be a bit neater but would need a table type built outside the package, which I guess you want to avoid based on your extra-object comment about using a view.
