Google "machine learning" and you will find a lot of definitions. What is deep learning might be just slightly harder to put a finger on. Everyone will agree that neural nets is a method that is part of machine learning. However 'traditional' neural nets tended to work very poorly ('overtrain') on nets with a large number of hidden layers. Nets with a large number of hidden layers have been (up to now anyway) necessary for solving complicated problems such as image recognition. Deep learning is the name given to a number of techniques for finding the optimal constants in the hidden layers of a neural net so that overtraining doesn't occur in nets with a large number of hidden layers.
