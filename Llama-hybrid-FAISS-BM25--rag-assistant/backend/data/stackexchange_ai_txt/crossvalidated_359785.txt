How to simulate a dataset with a binary target in proportions determined 'a-priori'?

Can someone tell me what is the best way to simulate a dataset with a binary target? I understand the way in which a dataset can be simulated but what I'm looking for is to determine 'a-priori' the proportion of each class. What I thought was to change the intercept to achieve it but I couldn't do it and I don't know why. I guess because the average is playing a trick on me. set.seed(666) x1 = rnorm(1000) x2 = rnorm(1000) p=0.25 # What I'm looking for is to simulate the typical "logistic" problem in which the binary target can be modeled as a linear combination of features. These 'logistic' models assume that the log-odd ratio of the binary variable behaves linearly. That means: log (p / (1-p)) = z = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 where p = prob (y = 1) Going back to my sample code, we could do, for example: z = 1.3 + 4 * x1 + 2 * x2 , but the probability of the class would be a result. Or instead we could choose coefficient b0 such that the probability is (statistically) similar to the one sought : log (0.25 / 0.75) = b0 + 4 * x1 + 2 * x2 This is my approach, but there may be betters
