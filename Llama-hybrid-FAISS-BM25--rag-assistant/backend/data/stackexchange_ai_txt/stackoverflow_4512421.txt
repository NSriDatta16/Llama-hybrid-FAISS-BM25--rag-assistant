We ran into a similar issue where the compiler generated methods on enumerations, like values(), typically were not being called in our test code. We worked around the problem by filtering the numbers of our enum objects out of our final report. This is why I don't like using code coverage as a measure of completeness. When I think of a better metric, I'll let you know. :)
