What you probably want to do is first run a PCA and extract only the most significant principal components, and thereafter do a fit to only those principal components. Generally speaking, your problem falls under the domain of dimensionality reduction, see this wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_reduction PCA is probably the simplest method to do so, and additionally it isn't "true" dimensionality reduction since strictly speaking you still need all the original data to generate your principal components, but this should reduce the complexity of your problem somewhat. Coincidentally, one large pitfall of doing separate fits is that the variables you are fitting over may be collinear, so that the combined fit barely adds any value over a fit over one or the other variable.
