It's sort of an old saying that smart data structures and dumb logic beat the reverse every time . See rule 5 in the unix philosophy article . When it boils down to it, every project I've been on where I've had to monkey around with code to fix broken data structures has been a pain. Short Answer: Re-do the data if you can. Long Answer: Be pragmatic. If you can save yourself some headache by only re-doing part of the database, do it. It will be more suffering to deal with it in the application logic than at the database level. Hope that helps!
