How to test for mediation when working with binary data?

I want to assess if a single variable is mediating the effects of a set of IVs on a single DV. All variables in the model (IV, DV and the mediator variable) are dichotomous (0, 1) and observed. What is the appropriate statistical procedure to test this model? I have run separate binary logistic regressions, and have found that: IVs are associated with the mediator variable, and the mediator is associated with the DV. However, IVs are not associated with DV when removing the mediator variable from the model.
