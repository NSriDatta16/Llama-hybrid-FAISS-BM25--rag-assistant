I think, interface wise, I wouldn't go to so much trouble. I find it a bit frustrating to have designs that "change" significantly. So, personally, I'd want a grouping that is consistent, such that if, say, 15 events get added, it doesn't decide to re-organise on some arbitrary basis. So, my thoughts would be, think up a less complex scheme. For us to help, I think you'll need to expand more on what you are doing.
