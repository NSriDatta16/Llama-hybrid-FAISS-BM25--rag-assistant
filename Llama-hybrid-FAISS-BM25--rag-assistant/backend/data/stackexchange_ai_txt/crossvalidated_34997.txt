How to fix a coefficient in an ordinal logistic regression without proportional odds assumption in R?

I want to do an ordinal logistic regression in R without the proportionality odds assumption. I know this can be done directly using vglm() function in R by setting parallel=FALSE . But my problem is how to fix a particular set of coefficients in this regression setup? For example, say the dependent variable $Y$ is discrete and ordinal and can take values $Y = 1$, $2$, or $3$. If the regressors are $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, then the regression equations are $$ \begin{aligned} {\rm logit} \big( P(Y \leq 1) \big) &= \alpha_{1} + \beta_{11}X_{1} + \beta_{12}X_{2} \\ {\rm logit}\big(P(Y \leq 2) \big) &= \alpha_{2} + \beta_{21}X_{1} + \beta_{22}X_{2} \end{aligned} $$ I want to set $\beta_{11}$ and $\beta_{22}$ to $1$. Please let me know how can I achieve this. Also if R can't do this, could you also please let me know if I can achieve this in any other statistical software?
