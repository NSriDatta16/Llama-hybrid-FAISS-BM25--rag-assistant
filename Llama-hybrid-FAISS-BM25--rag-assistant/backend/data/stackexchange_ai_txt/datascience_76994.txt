You need to create a vocabulary of the n-grams, i.e., a numbered inventory of bigrams that you are going to use as features. Typically, these are the most frequent ones. When you create the feature vector, you start with a zero vector and put one (or add one) if the n-gram with the corresponding index appears is in your sentence. Machine learning libraries typically have functions that do that. For instance, in scikit-learn, you can use CountVectorizer to do the job. The fit method has an ngram_range argument that controls the length of n-grams that are considered in the feature vectors.
