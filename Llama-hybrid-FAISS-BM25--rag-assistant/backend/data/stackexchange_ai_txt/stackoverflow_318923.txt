How to indent a selection in gVim (Win32)

I'd like to indent a block of text . I am able to do this in the Linux build of gVim. I do this in the state of gVim where I'm not in the insert or visual mode. The bar at the bottom is blank on the left, and the line number and percentage are showing on the right hand side. Then I perform the following procedure : I select a block of text via click and drag. Then I hit Shift + . . After that, I hit Esc and the block of text will move over a tab. If I do this in Windows however, it just replaces the block with > . I am just running the stock Windows rc file and version 7.1 of gVim.
