One common way to deal with missing values is (multiple) imputation. A popular R package is mice , which by default uses a multinomial logistic regression for the imputation of categorical variables and a predictive mean matching for the imputation of continuous variables. However, in the package are many other methods available. The mice package uses the chained equations approach, i.e. all variables can be imputed in one programming step. Since you have only 21 variables in your data set, it probably makes sense to use all variables as predictors for the imputation. See also this paper from the author of mice for further information. Below you can find an example, how an imputation could be done with the mice package: # Example data N
