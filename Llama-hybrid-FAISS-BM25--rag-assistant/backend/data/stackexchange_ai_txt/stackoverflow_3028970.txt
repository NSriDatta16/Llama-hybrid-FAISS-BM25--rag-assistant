I had the same problem, and had to sleep on it. Seems the Converter gets "one shot" at getting the data - through the Binding value. So make the Binding value a complex class. If you are using M-V-VM you should be data-shaping, anyway, so I made the Binding value 'work harder' by including the display value and the other data I needed in my converter (created a contained class if you will). Next, I needed to have the Converter 'work harder', with its limitation of passing ConverterParameters as Value type literals, so I create an Enum in my converter, and cast the literal onto it for more elegancy in my Convert routine. What I could do then is vary color (Brush) and thickness of a Grid cell, based on the value being displayed and another threshold value (that I check against). The source code is on my blog site, its Silverlight 3 code using binding in a pseudo M-V-VM fashion (no dependency injection, but hey - its an example, right?) download at: http://www.martymazurik.com/file.axd?file=2010%2f6%2fHighlightGridCell.zip.txt then remove the .txt
