How should my application keep clients in sync with schema changes to HTML5 databases?

I'm wanting to incorporate HTML5 database storage into my web application to make it online-accessible. I've done lots of development in server-side environments with databases, and we all know that database schema additions and modifications are often necessary. I am wondering what should happen if my application uses an offline database schema, and that schema changes. How do I prevent the application from breaking on the client side? How do I ensure the database is always up to date on the client end? Anyone have any solutions?
