Step 1 would be mounting the filesystem . Since Android is Linux based, there's a huge array of filesystems available, and individual vendors may or may not decide to write their own filesystems, just for the fun of it. On Windows, your options include ext2fsd or ext2read , among other possibilities. Once you've got the filesystem mounted, then you get to deal with the per-application data storage. I'd wager a fair amount of applications use SQLite3 , because it is an amazing tool. But you'll have to figure out, for each type of data you want to read, where it is stored and in what format. (The standard file(1) tool on Linux systems can come in handy, it knows heuristics that are surprisingly good at showing what type of file you might be dealing with.)
