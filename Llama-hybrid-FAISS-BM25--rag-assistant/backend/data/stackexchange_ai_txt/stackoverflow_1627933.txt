Don't store the PIN. Hash it (one of the SHA algorithms, preferably with some salt) and store the hash. Then compare the hash of what the user types in to the hash you stored. Then, if your storage (be it in the session object, some database, or whatever) is compromised, the attacker does not learn what the PIN is.
