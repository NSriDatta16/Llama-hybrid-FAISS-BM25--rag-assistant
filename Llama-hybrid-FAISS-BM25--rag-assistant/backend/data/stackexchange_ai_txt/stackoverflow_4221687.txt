2-d Arrays in C

So, this program is supposed to take stats from Auburn's football season and compute averages for each game and the whole season and print them on the screen in a chart. I thought I had figured this out, but I keep getting errors while trying to compile. I'm sure I'm missing some other stuff too, but I should figure that out once I get the program to compile and give me results. I would probably know what was going on if my teacher decided to teach the class. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here are some of the errors I'm getting: error: expected ')' before '[' token - this shows up on all of my compAvg functions. error: expected expression before ']' token - this one shows up at the numGames=getStats line. error: too few arguments to function 'analysis' error: 'numGames' undeclared here (not in a function) - this appears at the void analysis function and I'm guessing it has to do with the last error. error: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer - this is coming up on my first second printf line #include #include #define MAXGAMES 15 #define AUSTATS "auPass2010.txt" int main() //main function { double date[MAXGAMES][2], oppName[MAXGAMES], inStats[MAXGAMES][4], outStats[MAXGAMES][3]; //declare variables double avgCmp, avgAtt, avgYds, avgTD, avgPts; int numGames=0, n=0,r,c; int getStats(int date[][2], char oppName[], double inStats[][4]);//prototypes void analysis( double inStats[][4], double outStats[][3], double numGames); double compAvgCmp(stat[][], numGames); double compAvgAtt(stat[][], numGames); double compAvgYds(stat[][], numGames); double compAvgTD(stat[][], numGames); double compAvgPts(stat[][], numGames); numGames = getStats(date[][2], oppName[], inStats[][4]); printf("\t\t2010 AUBURN PASSING STATISTICS\nDATE\tOPPONENT\t\tCMP\tATT\tYDS\tTD --\tAVEYDS\t%CMP\tPTS\n-----\t-------------\t----\t----\t----\t"); //prints header if(numGames
