how do i hide /magento/ in my site's url?

A site has an existing system (lets call it mysite ) and the client asks to put in magento. My directory structure goes something like this: ROOT -index.php (this is the app's main controller) -.htaccess /blog (runs wordpress) /assets (current system's media folder) /magento (this is where all magento files go) Problem is if I set up magento and specify in the installation that base URL is http://example.com , magento loads up mysite . Leaves me no choice but to setup magento with base URL set to http://example.com/magento/ and it runs perfectly. However the client wants me to feel hell and asks me to hide magento in the URL. Iâ€™m not really versed in .htaccess and I know only simple rewrite codes so I tried forwarding any HTTP requests that start with /magento to the magento folder and came up with: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/magento(.*) RewriteRule (.*) /magento/$1 [L] Just when I thought it was working, mysite links all became unaccessible and forwards to the magento system displaying it's 404 page. So, uhm, can I ask for help how to construct the .htaccess to hide the /magento/ on the URLs without affecting the current system aka mysite ?
