Flex itself is a pretty nice component framework and Flash has a very straightforward event model. These two things alone can get you very far in developing Flex apps. I wrote two large applications with Cairngorm in the Flex 2 days and I can't recommend it. It's bloated, over-abstracted and requires far too much code to do even simple things. The fact that people have written code-generation tools for Cairngorm I think proves the point that there's just too much to it. Cairngorm is also problematic in that it relies heavily on the Singleton which is basically a nasty way to use global variables in OOP. MVC doesn't need to be that hard and at the end of the day, it's just a few patterns to help with code organization and keeping business logic out of your UI code. This can very easily be done without a framework by exercising some discipline. What is very interesting to me is the IoC solutions starting to percolate in the community. I think the Flex framework needs to evolve so that there is an easier way for IoC/DI containers to plug into the component lifecycle. The value that these kinds of tools can deliver is enormous compared to what you could ever hope to get out an MVC framework.
