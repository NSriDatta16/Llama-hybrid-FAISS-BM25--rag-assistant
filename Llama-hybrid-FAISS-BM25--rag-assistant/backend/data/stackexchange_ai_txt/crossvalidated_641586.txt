One use case I can think of is multivariate regression,as opposed to multvariable regression, the former being a model with more than 1 outcome variable, whereas the latter being a model with one outcome variable, but more than 1 input. In such a case you could use an output dimension greater than 1. For example, predicting the coordinates of multiple points in a space, or forecasting several future values of a time series simultaneously, each output neuron corresponds to one regression target. Another case is multiclass classification, where each sample is assigned to one and only one label out of a set of more than two labels. This scenario uses an output dimension $m$ greater than 1 to represent the probabilities or scores for each of the multiple classes.
