But I reach a limit in execution to 100% load with 8 or 9 terminal windows running.. Most likely it is a result of bandwidth and just download time.. Umm... No. If you hit a wall due to bandwidth constraints/download time, then your processes will block on I/O (process status D in top / ps ) and effectively go to sleep, consuming next-to-no CPU cycles until the I/O request completes. As for what your current problem is, that's impossible to say without more details about what your code is doing, ideally including source code, but a general description of your algorithms may well be sufficient. Do note, though, that with 8 or 9 processes running, you're guaranteed to peg the CPU at 100% if a single instance averages any more than 11-12% CPU usage. You haven't said anything about average per-process CPU consumption, but, if it regularly bounces up to 24%, then I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that it averages half that or higher.
