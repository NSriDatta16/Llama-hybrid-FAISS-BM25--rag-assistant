SQL expression to remove duplicates from a calculation

I am trying to run a query that will give time averages but when I do... some duplicate records are in the calculation. how can I remove duplicates? ex. Column 1 / 07-5794 / 07-5794 / 07-5766 / 07-8423 / 07-4259 Column 2 / 00:59:59 / 00:48:22 / 00:42:48/ 00:51:47 / 00:52:12 I can get the average of the column 2 but I don't want identical values in column 1 to be calculated twice (07-5794) ???
