Some Hibernate-specific performance tuning tips: Avoid join duplicates caused by parallel to-many assocation fetch-joins (hence avoid duplicate object instantiations) Use lazy loading with fetch="subselect" (prevents N+1 select problem) On huge read-only resultsets, don't fetch into mapped objects, but into flat DTOs (with Projections and AliasToBean-ResultTransformer) Apply HQL Bulk Update, Bulk Delete and Insert-By-Select Use FlushMode.Never where appropriate Taken from http://arnosoftwaredev.blogspot.com/2011/01/hibernate-performance-tips.html
