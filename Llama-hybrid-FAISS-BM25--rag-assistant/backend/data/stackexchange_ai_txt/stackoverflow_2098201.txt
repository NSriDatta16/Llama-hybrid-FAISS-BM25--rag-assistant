The inline code ability using is not just for backward compatibility, but a feature of .NET that can allow for some (relatively!) clear and straightforward solutions. It is however often used in a less than ideal way. Likewise, code in the code-behind if often (usually in fact) used in a less than ideal way, as are web-controls. Having code in the code-behind typically does not serve to separate concerns , but to have jumbled spaghetti code in a different place than we had it in classic asp. .NET does allow you to have very well organized solutions, but it's up to you to make it happen. Having code in code behind pages is not the first step in that journey, just where that journey can begin. As to why your events are not firing, most likely: The event is not actually being triggered. (Are you changes the selected item in the drop-down list, to actually trigger that event?) You do not actually have the event wired up. In the properties window for that control, is the event function name listed corresponding to the event in question? (this is the most straightforward way; you can also use the handles keywork in vb, for example) Often when my events are not firing, it because I'm doing something stupid like not having started my code, or my url is pointing to the wrong place.
