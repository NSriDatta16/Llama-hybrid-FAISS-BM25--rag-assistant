Bootstrapping estimates of out-of-sample error

I know how to use bootstrap re-sampling to find confidence intervals for in-sample error or R2 : # Bootstrap 95% CI for R-Squared library(boot) # function to obtain R-Squared from the data rsq But what if I want to estimate out-of-sample error (somewhat akin to cross-validation)? Could I fit a model to each boostrap sample, and then use that model to predict for each other bootstrap sample, and then average the RMSE of those predictions?
