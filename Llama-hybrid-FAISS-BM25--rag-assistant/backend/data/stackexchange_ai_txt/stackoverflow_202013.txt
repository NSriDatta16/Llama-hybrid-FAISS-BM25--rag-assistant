ClickOnce and IsolatedStorage

The Winform application is release with ClickOnce in our Intranet. We store personal preference for the GUI in the Isolated Storage. All works pretty fine :) The problem is when we have a new version of the application, we publish... all preferences are lost! User need to setup their preference over and over each version. Is there a way to freeze the isolation for the whole application instead of the version?
