Typically I'd say you're best off storing the information in the database, although in the cards example I'd be tempted to either have the information in code and store a 'card number' calculated from (suit_idx * 13 + card_value), or use the cards table you gave in your second code fragment - as cards are highly unlikely to change (especially once you've started using them in code). At the end of the day - if you're going to be performing queries against e.g. 'hands' of cards, or against a deck of cards in the database then you're going to want to use either of your SQL representations - with the former being just that little bit easier to query (although with a view that joins card to suit, either option is easy to query - although I'd still be tempted to stick with the first SQL version).
