can ML learn concepts in an unsupervised manner

I am wondering if ML can currently learn concepts in an unsupervised manner and how would that work. For example, when it looks at a transaction, I would like ML to understand the concept of the matching principle which directs an organization to report an expense on its income statement in the same period as the related revenues.
