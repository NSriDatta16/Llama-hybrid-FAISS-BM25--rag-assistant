So, what is the probability that $X_1 \ne X_2$? This is obviously analogous to the probability of flipping a fair coin twice and observing one head and one tail; i.e., $$\Pr[X_1 \ne X_2] = 1/2.$$ Then we see that $$\Pr[\hat \theta = \theta \mid \theta] = 1 \Pr[X_1 \ne X_2] + (1/2) \Pr[X_1 = X_2] = 0.75,$$ because with probability $1$, we know $\hat \theta = \theta$ when $X_1 \ne X_2$; and with probability $1/2$, we randomly choose the correct value between the equally likely possibilities that $\theta = X_1 - 1$ or $\theta = X_1 + 1$. Consequently, the estimator $\hat\theta$ is, on average, correct $75\%$ of the time. It's worth remarking that $\hat \theta$ is not an interval. It is a point estimator. But a singleton is still a set.
