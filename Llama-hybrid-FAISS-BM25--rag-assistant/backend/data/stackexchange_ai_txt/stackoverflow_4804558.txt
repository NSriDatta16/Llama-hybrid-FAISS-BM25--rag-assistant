Jquery - drag and drop mask that doesn't hide page's events

I am building a small website. In my website users can perform different operations, everything is written in plain html. Nothing complex there. Now, here comes the trick. I'd like to give my users the ability to drag and drop images and place them in a mask on top pf the page they are viewing. This doesn't work well since the mask blocks all operations users used to be able to do. My old html controls no longer receive focus when the user click them, as my upper mask catches all click events. Is there any way to get around this? Maybe somehow tell the script engine to set the z-index of the original page as the topmost, yet not hiding the mask?
