This is a classic time series problem and there are lots of papers on it (see Tong JRSSA 1977 for an early discusson). You could transform the series (set lambda = 0.5 for example) and you will get slightly better ARIMA results. But the main problem is that the cycles are of unpredictable length, so any model you produce will struggle to capture the aperiodic cycles. That is why the ARIMA prediction intervals are wide and approach constant values (to cover the possibility of peaks or troughs). You will need to use a nonlinear model to get anything better than that. See Kajitani et al JF 2005 for one such model. To answer your second question: autoplot(train) + autolayer(fc_arima, series="ARIMA Forecast") + autolayer(tail(lynx,20), series="Actual")
