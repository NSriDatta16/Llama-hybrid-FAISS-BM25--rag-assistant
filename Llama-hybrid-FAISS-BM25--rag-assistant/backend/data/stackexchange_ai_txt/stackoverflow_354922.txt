You probably are looking for the ShellExecute() function in shellapi.h . It is called with an "action verb", a path, and optional parameters. In your case this will want either "open" or "explore" as follows: ShellExecuteA(NULL, "open", "C:\\", NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWDEFAULT); This will open an unattached explorer window at C:. ShellExecute() will give basically the same action as typing in a command at the Run dialog. It will also handle URLs, so the following will open up the user's default browser: ShellExecuteA(NULL, "open", "http://www.google.com", NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWDEFAULT); Although make sure to pay attention to the note in the documentation that ShellExecute relies on COM (Although your code doesn't have to worry about any COM objects itself). CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED | COINIT_DISABLE_OLE1DDE)
