How to solve an SVM with an overdetermined input matrix?

I know that you can solve an overdetermined input matrix with QR decomposition or using the normal equation for the least squares linear regression problem. https://notendur.hi.is/tpr/tutorials/svm/notes/chapter5_6.pdf How would you do the same for an SVM? I googled it and coudn't find an explanation I understand! Thanks!
