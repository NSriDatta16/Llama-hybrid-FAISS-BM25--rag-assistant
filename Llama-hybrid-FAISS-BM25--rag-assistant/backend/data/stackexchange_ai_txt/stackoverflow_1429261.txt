Hierarchical (Multi-column) Sorting for the .net GridView?

Is there a simple ".Net" way to do hierarchical sorting Table... A|B|C ----- 1|2|5 2|8|4 2|4|3 3|7|2 4|4|1 clicking on A, then B would get you.. A|B|C ----- 1|2|5 2|4|3 2|8|4 3|7|2 4|4|1 The change being that I'm sorting (B) in context of (A) and so forth. Obviously this could be managed in the datasource, but was wondering if someone has a elegant and scalable solution.. thanks.
