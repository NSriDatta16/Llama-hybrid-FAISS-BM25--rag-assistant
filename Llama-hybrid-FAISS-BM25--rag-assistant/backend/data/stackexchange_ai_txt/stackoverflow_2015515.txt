Retrieving a tree structure from a database using LINQ

I have an organization chart tree structure stored in a database. Is is something like ID (int); Name (String); ParentID (int) In C# it is represented by a class like class Employee { int ID, string Name, IList Subs } I am wondering how is the best way to retrieve these values from the database to fill up the C# Objects using LINQ (I am using Entity Framework) There must be something better than making a call to get the top level then making repeated calls to get subs and so on. How best to do it?
