On data granularity involving PCA

So I have a very large amount of data, on a 15 minute frequency. I want to reduce dimensionality, so PCA seems like a good choice. However, there's a catch -- I will use monthly data, not 15 minutes. Therefore, I need to convert high frequency data to low frequency. The question is if it makes more sense to do PCA before or after conversion. I believe converting to monthly data first and then applying PCA sounds much better, because this way I conserve PCA's properties (projections are uncorrelated). On the other hand, if I do PCA and then convert to monthly, the resulting series are significantly correlated. My advisor believes we might lose information present in the high frequency data if we convert to monthly before doing PCA. I think such information will be lost either way. Thoughts?
