When building your VAE model, you must use the common training/testing datasets to train/evaluate your VAE model performances. That means you validate your model using the testing dataset on both the encoder and the decoder parts. I understand that during testing the VAE only has the decoder part. You're probably refering to one common use of VAE, that is to generate new samples using only the decoder part, but it comes after building a model . I hope it helps.
