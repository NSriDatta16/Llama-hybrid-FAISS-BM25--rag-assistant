IMagick function to cut an image into roughly equally-sized tiles

I'm trying to use the IMagick PHP wrapper to assist in chopping a specified image into a set of tiles (the number of which is variable). In the ImageMagick documentation there is reference to the -crop operator accepting an optional flag of @ that will instruct it to cut an image into "roughly equally-sized divisions" ( see here ), solving the problem of what to do when the image size is not an exact multiple of the desired tile size. Does anyone know if there is a way to leverage this functionality in the IMagick PHP wrapper? Is there anything I can use besides cropImage() ?
