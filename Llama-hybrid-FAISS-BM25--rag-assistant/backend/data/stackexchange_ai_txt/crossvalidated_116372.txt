I have no idea what you mean by "why the first convolution step works." In order for a CNN to be successful it needs to have many layers. One of the fundamental ideas behind CNN and many other deep learning approaches is that larger signals can be identified by the spatial correlation of their smaller parts which can be sparsely represented. In other words, images might look complex but they are made from a combination of just a few basic parts. For computer vision, the baseline structure in images is usually composed of edges and corners. CNN try to exploit the sparseness of the structure in an image by looking for common localized structures. That is what the first layer of the CNN is trying to determine. Think of a convolution as a match filter that is looking for signals that match a specific template. How well it works depends on the data at hand. Fortunately the world is full of repetition on a small scale, so CNN works well for computer vision tasks.
