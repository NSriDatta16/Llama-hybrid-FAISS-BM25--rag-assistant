Machine Learning: Single input to variable number of outputs

Is there a machine learning algorithm that maps a single input to an output list of variable length? If so, are there any implementations of the algorithm for public use? If not, what do you recommend as a workaround? In my case, the input is a single scalar and the output is a list of scalars with variable length. For example, suppose I wanted to output a list of ones given the length of the list as input. Then could be , , etc. A small tweak would be providing the square root of the length in which case would be an answer. Note: the input need not be tied directly to the output. For a more complex example, suppose I want to learn the look-and-say sequence . Valid pairs would be: , , , , , etc. My problem is also similar in that I can generate more examples; I am not restricted to a finite set of examples.
