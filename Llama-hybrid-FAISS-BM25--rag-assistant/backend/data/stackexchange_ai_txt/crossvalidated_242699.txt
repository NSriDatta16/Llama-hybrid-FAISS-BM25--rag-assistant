You can use something like the standard deviation , taking the square root of the average of the squared deviations of the ranking positions from their final value. If the final ranking is a-b-c-d-e , you'll have $\sigma_1 = \sqrt { {1+1+1+1+16} \over {5}}= 2.00 $ for e-a-b-c-d $\sigma_2 = \sqrt { {1+9+1+1+16} \over {5}} = 2.37 $ for e-a-b-c-d showing that the first ranking is better, and a-c-b-d-e is nearly perfect ($\sigma_3 = 0.63$) even if it has two errors like e-b-c-d-a (that's the worst, having $\sigma_4 = 2.52$). You can refine and enhance this approach if your ranking comes from a ranking system , instead of from a simple points counting ranking.
