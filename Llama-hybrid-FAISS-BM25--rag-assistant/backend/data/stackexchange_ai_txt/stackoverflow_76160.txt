You can leverage a built in control called NotifyIcon. This creates a tray icon when shown. @Phillip has a code example that is somewhat complete. There is a gotcha though: You must override your applications main form Dispose method to call Dispose on NotifyIcon, otherwise it will stay in your tray after application exits. public void Form_Dispose(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (this.Disposing) notifyIcon1.Dispose(); } Something like that.
