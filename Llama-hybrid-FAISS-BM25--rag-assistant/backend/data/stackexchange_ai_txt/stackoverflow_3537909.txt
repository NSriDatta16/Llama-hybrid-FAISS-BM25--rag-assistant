Free JavaScript chessboard

Could anybody suggest a free (as in freedom) and open source JavaScript chessboard? My plan is to hook it up with some server-side Python code, most probably it will be the flask web framework. I need a really minimal set of features: a way to display a position on the board (not only the initial one) when generating the HTML code by the server-side script. The position can be stored in a list of lists (to emulate a two-dimensional array) and optionally in a FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string. a way to make moves (by dragging pieces with the mouse cursor) and have the moves automatically submitted to the server-side script via HTTP POST. Validation of moves by the JavaScript code is not mandatory, because I can do this server-side.
