jquery complex animation bugs up

im trying to create something in jquery but it just keeps bugging up. here is the sample: http://www.migo.no/testing.php as you can see the frame is supposed to be enlarged when u hover above it for more than 400 ms. it seems to work but when i hover both images very fast back and forward, the whole thing just bugges up. I dont really know how to solve this. the code can be edited here: http://jsfiddle.net/robertpitt/8u24b/ js: http://www.migo.no/js/testing.js css: http://www.migo.no/css/testing.css i hope i can get some advice on how to prevent this from totally bugging up. Regards, Alexander
