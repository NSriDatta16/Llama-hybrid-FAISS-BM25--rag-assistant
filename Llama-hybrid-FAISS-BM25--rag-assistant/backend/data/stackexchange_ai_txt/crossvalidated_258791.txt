Well, you can define the $Z$ statistic by the same formulas (well, actually using asymptotic approximations) that is used in the normal case. There is no implication that the resulting statistic do have a normal distribution. It might have so, but only as an asymptotic approximation. And, in the logistic regression case, that approximation is often very bad, you can try some simulations by yourself, or search this site for the Hauck-Donner phenomenon !
