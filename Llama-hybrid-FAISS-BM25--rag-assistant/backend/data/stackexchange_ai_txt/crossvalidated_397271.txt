For the dependent variable, I would start with ordinal logistic regression and see if the assumptions are met. There are various sorts of ordinal logistic, but the most common (and the place I'd start) is proportional odds logistic. Likert scaled IVs are interesting. There's no common method, but I've sometimes used optimal scaling with some good results. All then above is quite general - it may not be good with your particular data set. You might want to hire a consultant.
