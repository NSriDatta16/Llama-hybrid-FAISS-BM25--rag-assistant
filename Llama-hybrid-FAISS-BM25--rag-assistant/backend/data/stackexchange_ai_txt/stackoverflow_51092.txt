SQL: aggregate function and group by

Consider the Oracle emp table. I'd like to get the employees with the top salary with department = 20 and job = clerk . Also assume that there is no "empno" column, and that the primary key involves a number of columns. You can do this with: select * from scott.emp where deptno = 20 and job = 'CLERK' and sal = (select max(sal) from scott.emp where deptno = 20 and job = 'CLERK') This works, but I have to duplicate the test deptno = 20 and job = 'CLERK', which I would like to avoid. Is there a more elegant way to write this, maybe using a group by ? BTW, if this matters, I am using Oracle.
