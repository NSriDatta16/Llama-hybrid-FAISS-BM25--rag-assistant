In C#, the System.IO.Log namespace has log-related helpers, which might be close to what you're looking for, though it won't help directly with isolation on its own. If you use LogRecordSequence, you get a pretty sophisticated log implementation underneath it. Additionally sqlite does all of this and is in the public domain. I imagine its storage engine etc. would be somewhat separable, though you'd likely have to tear it apart yourself.
