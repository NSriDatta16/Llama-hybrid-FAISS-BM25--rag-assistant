The current version of the mtl library - which is based on the transformers library - exports the function reader :: (r -> a) -> Reader r a for exactly this purpose when using the simple Reader monad. So we see that the design of the library does take into account this usage. Since no such function is provided for ReaderT , we can say with some confidence that the officially supported way to do this with ReaderT is to use the constructor directly. I'll agree with you if you say that an analogous readerT :: Monad m => (r -> a) -> ReaderT r m a ought to be added to the library. That would be good both for consistency, and for allowing the possibility of changing the internal representation someday without breaking anyone's code. But for now, your "first possibility" is the way to go.
