For millions of calls (from I'm assuming c++, because you mentioned boost) into python, yes: you will notice a performance hit. This may or may not be significant - perhaps the speed gain of trying out new 'agents' would be greater than the hit. Python does have fast numerical libraries (such as numpy) that might help, but you'll still incur overhead of marshalling data, calling into python, the gil, etc. Yes, you can embed many other languages: check out lua. Also, check out swig.org, which can connect to many other languages besides python.
