I have never read (or tried) subsampling techniques on each node of the tree. I do not say that they might not exist, but it looks odd the statement "like is a common practice with random forests". Other than that, subsampling or bootstrapping the sample for each tree from random forests gives stochastic gradient boosting Friedman, 1999 . They give better results with subsampling than without and more details are given also in Elements of Statistical Learning, page 358, 10.12.2 Subsampling .
