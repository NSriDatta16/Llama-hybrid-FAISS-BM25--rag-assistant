Feels like most of the work is not related to data science at all. Is this accurate? Wrangling data is most definitely in the Data Scientist job description. At some level you have to understand the data generating process in order to use it to drive solutions. Sure, someone specialized in ETL could do it faster/more efficient, but being given data dumps is not uncommon in the real world. If you don't like this aspect of data science, there may be an opportunity to work more closely with IT resources to get the data properly sourced into a warehouse you have access to. Alternatively, you could find a job that already has data in better order. I know this is not a data-driven company with a high-level data engineering department, but it is my opinion that data science requires minimum levels of data accessibility. Am I wrong? I think the minimum level is txt files. If you have access to the data via text files, you should have access to the data in the database (push back on this with superiors). Is this type of setup common for a company with serious data science needs? Yes. You are the data SCIENTIST; you are the expert. It is part of your job to educate others on the inefficiencies of the current data structure and how you can help. Data that isn't usable isn't helping anyone. You have an opportunity to make things better and shape the future of the company.
