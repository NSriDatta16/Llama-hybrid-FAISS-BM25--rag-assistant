One fragile answer is to take the difference of the offsetof values for WriteEn and the next field up (or failing that, the sizeof the whole struct). This may give a slightly larger answer than sizeof due to alignment-based padding. A bigger problem is what happens if you rearrange your fields without fixing this - but it might be an option if you're desperate.
