RFE is an embedded feature selection method. First, according to the highly cited article [1], the SVM-RFE is not a wrapper. Because the authors distinguish the SVM-RFE with the wrapper in Section 6.4.3. They claim that SVM-RFE is based on feature ranking , while the wrapper is based on combinatorial search . Second, according to another highly cited article [2], it says Some embedded methods guide their search by estimating changes in the objective function value incurred by making moves in variable subset space. Combined with greedy search strategies (backward elimination or forward selection) they yield nested subsets of variables. That is exactly what SVM-RFE does. References: [1] Guyon, Isabelle, et al.
