Comparing Language Model of two corpora

I know using Conditional Language Model I can learn the probability of a sentence given the corpus I used to train my model. I will then be able to generate meaningful text by sampling from the distribution of sentences. Now what I want to do is to compare the text generated from the language model of two different corpora on the same topic. Use case: I want to compare the headline that a right winning vs left winning news outlet would use for a given news content. (my training data would be a large set of headline+news content from both news outlet)
