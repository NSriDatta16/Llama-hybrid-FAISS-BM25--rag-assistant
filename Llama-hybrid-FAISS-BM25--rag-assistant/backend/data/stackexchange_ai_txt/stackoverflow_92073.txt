Smallest Unicode encodings for different languages?

What are the typical average bytes-per-character rates for different unicode encodings in different languages? E.g. if I wanted the smallest number of bytes to encode some english text, then on average UTF-8 would be 1-byte per character and UTF-16 would be 2 so I'd pick UTF-8. If I wanted some Korean text, then UTF-16 might average about 2 per character but UTF-8 might average about 3 (I don't know, I'm just making up some illustrative numbers here). Which encodings yield the smallest storage requirements for different languages and character sets?
