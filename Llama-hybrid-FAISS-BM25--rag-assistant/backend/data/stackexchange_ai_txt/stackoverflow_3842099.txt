Ok problem solved. It seems that it wasn't the accordion or wmode's fault, it was jquery's sortable. My accordion is also sortable and when trying to press uploadify swf the sortable methods took over. The solution to this can be found in this thread: http://www.uploadify.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1556 What he did was to wrap the swf with a div, and then use sortable's 'cancel' option to prevent the div's class from being dragged ({cancel : ".uploadSwfDiv"}). In Firefox clicking the swf also opens/closes the accordion, so to prevent that I added this code: $('.uploadSwfDiv').click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); } );
