The general idea of ordinal data is that there is some order or gradation of different categories and exact numerical quantity of a particular value has no significance beyond its ability to establish a ranking over a set of data points ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_data ) With ordinal data your categories are ordered, e.g. $a With binary data you have only two categories so knowing that $x > y$ provides you with the same information as knowing that $\neg(x^* For example, with changing the labels in logistic regression you just get reversed signs of coefficients and this is what we expect, for more see the recent question on logistic regression (check @Scortchi 's comment for the linked question). On the other hand, as @ttnphns noticed, there are similarity measures that make assumptions about coding of binary categories, like Jaccard index and in these cases it makes a difference how the categories are coded. Coding of the categories (e.g. as $0$ and $1$ or $-1$ and $+1$) in many cases could also make interpretation of the results easier (positive or negative influence). In both cases the difference concerns rather with coding of the variables rather than with information they carry.
