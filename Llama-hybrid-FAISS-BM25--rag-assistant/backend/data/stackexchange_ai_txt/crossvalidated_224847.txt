1) One method is to reduce the complexity of the problem. Instead of training a classifier for 21 classes, you can train 21 binary classifiers. You pick the final class based on the softmax of the predictions of the 21 classifiers. 2) Another supervised learning technique is neural networks. Your output layer will have a size of 21. Your input can be a sparse input as with SVM, or you can use word embeddings (e.g. word2vec, glove) to create a dense embedding of the tweet.
