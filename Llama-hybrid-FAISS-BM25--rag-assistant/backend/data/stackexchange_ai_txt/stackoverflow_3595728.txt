Web browsers interacting with desktop?

What languages/techniques are used for letting the web browser interact with the desktop, e.g. dragging files to the web browser, dragging files from web browser to desktop, and maybe more features that I'm not aware of. I think flash and silverlight allows you to do that but I'm not sure. Does javascript do this?
