No, you don't need mathematics for data science in the same way that you need it for physics. As a data scientist, you won't be integrating a stress-energy tensor, or even solving a differential equation. What you do need is good quantitative reasoning and critical thinking skills. NotThatGuy's answer gives good examples of things you might think of as "just arithmetic", much more basic than the mathematics courses you've already done, but you'd be surprised at how many people struggle with these things. There will be probably be a bunch of stuff that you do automatically, and don't even realise that you're doing anything special. But these things are second nature to you because of the mathematics training you've had.
