Random forests are built from decision trees, which partition the data into discrete groups and assign a predicted value to each group. Because of that the predictions will never be a continuous function of your inputs (although with lots of trees, you might be able to get something that is effectively continuous). Your output is consistent with all trees in your model splitting on f7 > 3.5, for example. Also it's noticeable that the model output is exactly equal to the f3 values for a lot of rows, which I am guessing is the lagged target. My guess is that these rows were used for training, and the model learned some rule like "When f7 If you need to get a prediction from a random forest that varies continuously with some variable, you might want to try using a ratio of your current output and that variable as the target. For example instead of predicting total energy usage, predict this hour's energy use as a percentage of the last hour's energy use. However I think you probably would have better luck using something other than a random forest for your problem.
