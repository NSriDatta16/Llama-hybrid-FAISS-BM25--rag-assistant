Assuming the file type is constant then from the wget man page: You want to download all the GIFs from a directory on an HTTP server. You tried wget http://www.server.com/dir/ *.gif, but that didn't work because HTTP retrieval does not support globbing. In that case, use: wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://www.server.com/dir/ So, you want to use the -A flag, something like: wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.tbz http://www.mysite.com/path/to/files/
