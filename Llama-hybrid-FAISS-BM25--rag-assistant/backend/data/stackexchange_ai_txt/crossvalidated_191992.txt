A quick and simple approach is to consider all possible resamples of size 6. There are only 15,625 permutations. Looking at these and taking the average for each case, and then sorting the averages and extracting the 5% quantile, we get a value of 96. So the estimated amount you should be willing to pay is about 9600. This is in good agreement with a couple of the more sophisticated approaches. An improvement here would be to simulate a large number of samples of size 6 and use the same procedure to find the 5th percentile of the sample means. Using slightly more than a million resamples, I found the 5th percentile to be 96.1667, so to the nearest dollar the payment would be 9617 dollars, which is only a 2 dollar difference from user777's result of 9615.
