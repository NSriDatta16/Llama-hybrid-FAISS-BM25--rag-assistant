I suggest DHTMLX Tree: Cross Browser AJAX Support In-line node editing Drag-n-drop capabilities *Smart Rendering - allows avoiding performance problems in trees with great number of nodes per level. Rich Client API Special techniques implemented into the component make loading of really big trees fast and effective. Advanced drag-and-drop makes it possible to drag items not just within one tree, but between different ones (even if trees are located in different frames or iframes).
