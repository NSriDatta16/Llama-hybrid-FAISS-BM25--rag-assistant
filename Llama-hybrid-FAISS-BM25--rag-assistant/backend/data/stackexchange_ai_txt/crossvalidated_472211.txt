When you have interactions, things indeed get more complicated. But what you describe seems valid. That is, you select a specific value for the covariate , and make the pairwise comparisons for the different conditions using this particular value. Also, because you have fitted an interaction model, note that the main effect of condition is interpreted for a specific value of covariate , namely for covariate = 0 . With that in mind, I feel that your question mainly relates to the use of the emmeans package, and therefore, I would suggest having a look at the online documentation. More specifically, in the Interaction Analysis vignette . I would speculate that emmeans(model, pairwise ~ condition) produces results for covariate = mean(covariate) because this is often more relevant than covariate = 0 . For example, say that the covariate is age. It makes more sense to produce pairwise comparisons for condition for the average age in your data, than for age = 0 (assuming you have a study on subjects with ages far away from zero).
