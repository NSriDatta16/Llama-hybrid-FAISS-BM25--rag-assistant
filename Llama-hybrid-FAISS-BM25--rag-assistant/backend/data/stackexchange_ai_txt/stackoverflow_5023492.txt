This is by design of ASP.NET itself - check concurrent requests and session state . Once you turn on AspNetCompatibilityEnabled you always have to deal with that - I didn't try it but I expect that the only option can be turning off the session in configuration file. But still your test is probably not very realistic. When AspNetCompatibilityEnabled is turned off it will execute in parallel localy but I expect that if you run the page from different computer you will not be able to execute more then two requests in parallel. The reason is that by default HTTP persistent connection is used. By HTTP specification only 2 HTTP persistent connections can be opened to the same server = only two parallel requests can be executed ( last paragraph before chapter 8.2 ). Windows follow these recommendations. Edit: This thread on MSDN forum disusses the same issue. It also provides some solution.
