What's the CFString Equiv of NSString's UTF8String?

I'm stuck on stoopid today as I can't convert a simple piece of ObjC code to its Cpp equivalent. I have this: const UInt8 *myBuffer = [(NSString*)aRequest UTF8String]; And I'm trying to replace it with this: const UInt8 *myBuffer = (const UInt8 *)CFStringGetCStringPtr(aRequest, kCFStringEncodingUTF8); This is all in a tight unit test that writes an example HTTP request over a socket with CFNetwork APIs. I have working ObjC code that I'm trying to port to C++. I'm gradually replacing NS API calls with their toll free bridged equivalents. Everything has been one for one so far until this last line. This is like the last piece that needs completed.
