Linear regression vs Time series analysis

I am confused that when I should use static model (like cross-sectional regression) or other forms of time series model. I see some examples of analyzing time ordered data by crosss-sectional regression model. For instance, model GDP by using other economic factors but not time series analysis. Does such analysis a correct way to do? Do we still need to consider additional lags if the regression model already fulfill all its assumptions well? And do we need to add lagged term of dependent variables considering that GDP indeded has serial correlation?
