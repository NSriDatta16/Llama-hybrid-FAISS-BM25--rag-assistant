How can I upload a Zipfile to my Application Server using an Applet

I use an applet to bundle some files into a zip and during that I create a description-object. I already utilize JavaEE Webservices to send the description-object to the server but how do I transport my zip? I'm fairly new to Java EE and want to know if there is a common way to do that already (since java ee offers a lot) or would I use something ordinary like ftp? I imagine something like a takeFileWebService that I can use from my applet, which then calls some Method onFileReceived on the serverside to handle the file, dunno :/ Thank in advance, philipp
