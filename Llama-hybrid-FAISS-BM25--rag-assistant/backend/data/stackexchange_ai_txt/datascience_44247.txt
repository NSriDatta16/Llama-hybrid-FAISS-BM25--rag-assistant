In short, can I create neural network that takes different types of input individually or do I use different neural networks for each of them and then group their outputs? Yes, you can. Check the Functional API of Keras, on how to define multi input/output networks. Then you can create different models for the processing of each input and fuse them together into a single multi-input model using the keras.models.Model() class. In the following example, you can see that the main_input is processed differently than the aux_input and both are thereafter merged together to be propagated through the rest of the layers of the network.
