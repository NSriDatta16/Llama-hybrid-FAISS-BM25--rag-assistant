Why does the value function induce a partial order and not a total order?

In Sutton and Barto's book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, they write Value functions deÔ¨Åne a partial ordering over policies. My questions is why the value function is not a total order? I would have thought: $\pi_1 \geq \pi_2$ if and only if $V_{\pi_1} (s_0) \geq V_{\pi_2} (s_0)$ , where $s_0$ is the initial state distribution.
