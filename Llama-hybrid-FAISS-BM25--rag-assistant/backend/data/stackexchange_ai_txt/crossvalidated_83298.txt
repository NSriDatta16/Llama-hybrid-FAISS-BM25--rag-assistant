I believe your interval for part (1) is actually wrong (though almost correct). It's the $Z$ that looks off. Take a careful look; the subscript is wrong in at least one way and probably wrong in a couple of ways. On to the next part: If $g$ is a monotonic increasing function, and $(l,u)$ is a $1−α$ interval for $θ$, then $(g(l),g(u))$ will be a $1−α$ interval for $g(θ)$. (You can prove it inherits the same coverage by simple transformation of the probability statement for the original CI, but I don't see that you're expected to prove it here) That is, you can write a confidence interval for $\sqrt \lambda$ immediately, though it won't be symmetric about the transformed parameter estimate (which doesn't strike me as a problem). The alternative approach would be to write down a normal approximation for the square root of a Poisson, but it's a lot more work. On the other hand, the normal approximation is a lot better for the transformed Poisson.
