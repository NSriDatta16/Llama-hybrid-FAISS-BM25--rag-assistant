When is it appropriate to model data as a Stochastic Process?

I understand the question may be poorly worded, but please bear with me. I have a background in computer science and mathematics, but never took any upper-level statistics courses. I currently work as a data scientist. Recently, I have run into data I believe can be modeled as stochastic processes. For instance, I am currently working on a project where I am trying to predict the time it will take for various teams (ie, networking team, software development team) to finish a project they are given, given historical data. I believe this is a stochastic process because we know the length of each past project in days, and each project is indexed by time. Similarly, I attempted to model some employment data using Markov Chains, where the history of someone's employment with my company (ie, promotions, lay offs, etc.) were the nodes in the chain. My questions: i) How can we know when we can model data as a stochastic process? ii) Furthermore, if something is a stochastic process, how can I know which kind of stochastic process it is and what properties it has? It is my understanding that there are various kinds and "families". iii) Finally, when we know something is a stochastic process, and we know its properties, when is it appropriate to use methods meant for the analysis of stochastic processes instead of attempting to model the data in a different way (ie, with a liner regression). Thank you!
