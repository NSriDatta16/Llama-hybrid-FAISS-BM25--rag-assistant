Index for the shape of a distribution (necessary or sufficient condition?)

I have a confusion about the main statistical indicators for the shape of a distribution. Let me consider first the Fisher index defined as $$\rho=\frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)^3}{\sigma^3},$$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the statistical distribution and $\bar x$ is the total average. Is it true that If $\rho>0$ then the distribution is positively asymmetric (it is not true the inverse implication) If the distribution is symmetric then $\rho=0$ (it is not true the reverse implication). There exists a counterexample about the inverse implication? If $\rho then the distribution is negatively asymmetric (it is not true the inverse implication) Am I correct? What about the index for the curtosis of a distribution? $$\beta=\frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)^4}{\sigma^4}?$$ If $\beta>3$ then the distribution is leptokurtic (it is not true the inverse implication) If $\beta=3$ then the distribution is mesokurtic (it is not true the inverse implication) If $\beta then the distribution is platikurtic (it is not true the inverse implication) Could someone tell me if I am correct and clarify my ideas?
