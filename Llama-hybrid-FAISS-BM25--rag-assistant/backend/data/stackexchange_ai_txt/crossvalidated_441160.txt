Confidence intervals answer the question: "What is the range of plausible findings under the triparte assumption that the population is Normally distributed, the mean is the observed value and the standard deviation is also at the observed value". So it's really saying "if you knew for certain that the data was an excellent representation of sampling of/from the population, what would be the range of means under a random sampling of similar size. So you first sentence is accurate but your second sentence: Rather, if your sample was drawn an infinite number of times, 95% of the intervals would contain the population parameter (while 5% would not). .... is not. What is being said is that IF the population parameter were mu , then the sampling distribution around mu have 95% coverage of mu-hats by the CI. It's really that same duality as "type I errors" and "type II errors". They are calculated in two separate universes. Type II errors are those that occur under a hypothetical of a theoretical non-null situation (H[A]), whereas type I errors are those that occur in a theoretical null (H[0]) situation. Until I figured this out I was bothered by the usual diagram of a Normal curve centered around the null hypothesis for "type I errors and a shifted Normal curve centered around the alternate hypothesis for type II errors. Turns out that the curve around the alternate hypothesis should NOT be a Normal curve, but rather should be a non-central t-distribution, which is NOT symmetric. (For any decent size problem the difference is pretty much undetectable, and you really can only see the difference when your sample sizes are less than 10.)
