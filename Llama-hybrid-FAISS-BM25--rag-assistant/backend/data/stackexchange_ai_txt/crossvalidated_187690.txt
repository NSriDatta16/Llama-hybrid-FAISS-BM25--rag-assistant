statistics test to compare ratio of two variables in two population R

I have two datasets from two courses. In one of the courses we applied an experiment and I would like to infer whether that experiment causes the average number of posts per students increases or not. In our data p1(number of posts in course 1)/ n1 (number of students in course 1) is much more than p2(number of posts in course 2)/ n2 (number of students in course 2). What kind of test I should apply to check my result could be general? I could not find any question in stack overflow regarding ratio of variables.I tried chi-square and this is the result: dfchsq this is the result: Chi-squared test for given probabilities data: dfchsq X-squared = 3.801, df = 1, p-value = 0.05122 My questions are: Is chi-square an appropriate test in this case? If yes, how the result can be interpreted? Regards, P
