While programming you'll encouter so much problems, which won't be capture by compile-time (the evil run-time errors). So the compiler isn't capable to find all problems (aka errors). In some case he just says, mmmh there could be a problem, but i don't really know, please check it (aka warning). So take a look at the warning, fix it and proceed. In some rare cases you really know what you do and just think, i know this warning, but this code is correct so don't bother me anymore. In these (really rare) cases, you could maybe encapsulate the line(s) which are mentioned with a // Why you think this warning should be disabled at this point #pragma warning disable xxx /// ... some code ... #pragma warning restore xxx and proceed and the compiler doesn't mention anymore. Hence take a look at all warnings and fix them. Either by reprogram it or by temporary disable this warning. P.S. Really don't disable a warning within your project settings. Cause in this case you would disable it globally (and so maybe for code that will be created in the future) nor you can't add any comment why you disabled it.
