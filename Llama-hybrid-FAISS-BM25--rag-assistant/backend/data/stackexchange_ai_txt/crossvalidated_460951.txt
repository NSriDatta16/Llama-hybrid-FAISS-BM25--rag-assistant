It seems you want to estimate the marginal effect of var1 and var2 on the proportion of success. Let's call this variable 'success rate'. Because your dependent variable is already a proportion, taking the logarithm makes the interpretation less straight forward. suggest you run OLS with logarithmic transformations of the right-hand side (RHS) variables. This way, the interpretation is: "a 1% increase in RHS variable $x_j$ leads to a success rate increase of $100 \times \beta_j$ %" (e.g. $\beta_1=.06$ means a 1% increase in $x_1$ leads to a 6% increase in success rate). An improvement to 1 would be to estimate censored regression with censoring bounds of [0,1]. You should avoid approach 1 if you plan to do any forecasting or parametric bootstrap, since approach 1 can lead to predicted values less than 0 and greater than 1. Be aware, however, that calculation of the marginal effects is a bit different with censored regression. If you want to take the logistic regression approach, your dependent variable needs to be binary, not a proportion. You should avoid this approach, unless you have a dataset where the observational units are individual trails (with 1 or 0 for the dependent variabls), you should avoid this approach.
