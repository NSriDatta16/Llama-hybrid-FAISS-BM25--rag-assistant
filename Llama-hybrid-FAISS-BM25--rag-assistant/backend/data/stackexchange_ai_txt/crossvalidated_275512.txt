Categorical variables with too many levels in machine learning

I have a machine learning problem where the dependent variable is binomial (Yes/No) and some of the independent variables are categorical (with more than 100 levels). I'm not sure whether dummy coding these categorical variables and then passing them to the machine learning model is a optimal solution. Is there a way to deal with this problem?
