Pig script code error?

While running the below pig script I am getting an error in line4: If it is GROUP then I am getting error. If I change from 'GROUP' TO 'group' in line4, then the script is running. What is the difference between group and GROUP? LINES = LOAD '/user/cloudera/datapeople.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS ( firstname:chararray, lastname:chararray, address:chararray, city:chararray, state:chararray, zip:chararray ); WORDS = FOREACH LINES GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE(zip)) AS ZIPS; WORDSGROUPED = GROUP WORDS BY ZIPS; WORDBYCOUNT = FOREACH WORDSGROUPED GENERATE GROUP AS ZIPS, COUNT(WORDS); WORDSSORT = ORDER WORDBYCOUNT BY $1 DESC; DUMP WORDSSORT;
