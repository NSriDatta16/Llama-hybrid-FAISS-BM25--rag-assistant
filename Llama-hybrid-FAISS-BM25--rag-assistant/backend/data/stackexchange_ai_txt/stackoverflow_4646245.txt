The easiest way for you that I see is to use concept tagging from AlchemyAPI . You can also use some plugins for libraries from questions, pointed in comments, especially pay attention to OpenNLP and GATE . If you are going to build ontology-based search engine , I recommend you reading this paper on ontology-based interpretation of keywords, that shows some tendencies in user's habits ( video version ). Otherwise, you'll better use some statistical techniques like LSA .
