I'm not the first person to tackle this type of problem. I've drawn inspiration and know-how from several places to get this up and running: The original bookmark/back button fix, as used by Flash developers for a little while now: http://robertpenner.com/experiments/backbutton/flashpage.html I've not actually looked at how they implemented their solution but this is where I got the idea for replacing Robert Penner's frames with iframes: http://dojotoolkit.org/intro_to_dojo_io.html#so-about-that-thorny-back-button Rich Rutter's use of the hash for bookmarking: http://clagnut.com/sandbox/slideshow.html#5 For this little experiment I've used Harry Fuecks' JPSpan It's a fantastic framework that makes the methods you define in your server-side PHP classes available to your Javascript via XmlHttpRequest. It's the simplest way I've come across to get started with AJAX. I had the guts of my demo up and running in about 10 minutes! I'm using Algorithm's Timer object: http://codingforums.com/archive/index.php/t-10531.html And Scott Andrew's cross-browser event handler: http://scottandrew.com/weblog/articles/cbs-events Source: http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/content/fixing-the-back-button-and-enabling-bookmarking-for-ajax-apps For jQuery: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/116446/what-is-the-best-back-button-jquery-plugin
