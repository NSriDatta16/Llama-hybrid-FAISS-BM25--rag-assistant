mysql update math

say p.products_price equals 1 why does: UPDATE products p SET p.products_price = (1 + p.products_price) WHERE p.products_id = 8 make p.products_price equals 3? It is adding 1 to the price and then doing it all over again? I am trying to do something a little more complicated but when it didn't work I broke it down to the simplest thing ever. Can I make some kind of temporary value here and calculate the new price and then set it to that? Please help I am raging, Thanks. MySQL client version: 4.1.22 edit: the column is decimal type, i tried the same update on an int column with the same result. edit: this is not running in code so there is no chance of the code calling the same update twice
