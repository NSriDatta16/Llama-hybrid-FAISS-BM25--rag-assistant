How to associate my distribution identity with my provisioning profile in Xcode

My question is exactly the same as the one listed here The reason I'm asking it again is that I'm not sure how to get into the provisioning portal as the original user asked. Currently when I open the organizer through Xcode I see both identities but only 1 has the set of numbers following (and that is the developer identity) How can I make this distribution identity valid so I can use it inside Xcode to build my project? Currently getting the error: Code Sign error: The identity 'iPhone Distribution' doesn't match any identity in any profile
