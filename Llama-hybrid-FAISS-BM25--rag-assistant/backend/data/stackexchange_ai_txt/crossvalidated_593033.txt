How to interpret an ACF and PACF together?

I am using for the first time the tools of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation and I am facing some difficulties regarding the interpretation of the results. (Maybe I misunderstood what partial autocorrelation was?) To illustrate my problem, I use the number of daily views on the famous Wikipedia site between 01/01/2017 and 31/12/2021 (data available here ). Here is a graph of the raw data: We can clearly observe an annual cycle with a significant drop in views during the summer. The time series is too large, but we can also assume that there is a weekly cycle with an increase in the number of views on weekends. To highlight these different cycles, I have used an autocorrelation. Here are the results : We observe a very strong correlation if the lag is 1 day, the number of views on day d is thus "influenced" by the number of views on day d-1 . But we also see very strong correlations for lags of 7 days and multiples of 7 days, implying the existence of a weekly cycle. Same for a 365 days lag (actually, the correlation for a 364 days lag is more important, but I guess it is because of the influence of the weekly cycle, 364 being divisible by 7), implying the existence of an annual cycle. However, the correlations appear to be statistically significant for a (too) large number of values. To see if the correlation values for multiple lags of 7 days (14 d, 21 d, 28 d, etc) are only high because they are multiples of 7 or if on the contrary there are really cycles of 14 d, 21 d, 28 d etc, one can use (from what I understand) a partial autocorrelation. Here are the results: And here, I confess I don't know how to interpret the results... Certainly, we no longer see correlation peaks for multiples of 7, confirming that there are no 14 d, 21 d, 28 d cycles. However, the partial autocorrelation also seems to show that there is no clear annual cycle (few values around 365 are statistically significant). Another surprise is that the partial autocorrelation for a 6-day lag is significantly higher than that for a 7-day lag, whereas the opposite was true for the total autocorrelation. Have I misunderstood how partial and total autocorrelation works? Or is it simply not a suitable tool in this case? If not, can I still conclude that there is a weekly cycle and an annual cycle, even though for the latter the partial autocorrelation seems to say otherwise?
