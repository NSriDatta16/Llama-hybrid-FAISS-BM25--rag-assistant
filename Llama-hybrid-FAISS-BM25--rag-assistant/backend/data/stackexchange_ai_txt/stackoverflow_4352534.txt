where do you store a default image on internal storage of android?

Suppose I want to have a certain image on the main screen of my map. Also, there is a menu option that lets the user select an image from the gallery and once selected, it will downsize/crop the image and store it on internal storage for the app ( using something like here ). If I understand correctly, then the image will persist even after the app is killed. Now, there should only ever be one image at a time so the previous image file should just be overwritten every time the menu option is run. However, if the user does not change the image, there should still be some default image file that will display, where should this image be stored in my project? Alternatively, should I just keep a default image in my drawable or raw resource directory, and keep a boolean flag to know whether it is necessary to load another image?). However, I would need to make sure the boolean value persists after the app dies. Possibly using shared preferences?)
