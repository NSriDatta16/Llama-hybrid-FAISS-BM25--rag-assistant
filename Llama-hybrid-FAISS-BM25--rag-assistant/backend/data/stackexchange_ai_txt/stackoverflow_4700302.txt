Jquery tooltip absolute position above a link which is inside paragraph text?

I am trying to retrieve the position of an HTML element inside a paragraph. Eg. a span or anchor. I would also like the width of the element. So that when I hover the object, I can activate/build/show a sort of toolbar/tooltip above the element dynamically. I need it to be dynamically added to exisiting content, so somekinda "search-replace" jQuery thingy that scans the elements within eg. a DIV and then does this for all that matches this "feature". Main problem/question is: How do I retrieve the "current absolute" position of the element I am hovering with the mouse. I dont want the toolbar/tooltip to be following the mouse, but instead it must "snap" to the element its hovering. so I was thinking: "place BOX -20px from current element. Match width.... Possible? is there a jQuery plugin for this already - or? Sample code: headline Here is some sample text. But this is with an explanation you can hover . And this isnt. We could also do it inside a bullet list The .help is the class triggering the "help" and the .help45 or .help32 is the helpsection needed to be shown (but thats another task later, as I am hoping to retreive the "id" from the "help45" so a serverlookup for id=45 can load the text needed to be shown. Nb. if the page scrolls etc. the helptip still needs to follow the item on the page until closed/hidden.
