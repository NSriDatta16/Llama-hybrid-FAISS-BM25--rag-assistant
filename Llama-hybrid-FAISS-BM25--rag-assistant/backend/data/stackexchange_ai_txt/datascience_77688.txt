Multivariate Time series

I have a dataset which have two features,"feature_1",and "feature_2" and time in timestamp of 10 second intervals. While plotting,there is "trend" of both features with respect to time,but don't have seasonality .And both features are also highly correlated. The task is to predict "feature_2" values. And importantly,in test set "feature_1" values are also given. Which model and approach should I go with
