Reusable C#, Java and/or Flex components

I am looking for reusable open source components. The level of depth, breadth and hopefully quality that I'm looking for is similar to this . Although I need them in programming languages C#, Java and Flex (which I often use in my projects), other languages such as PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby etc. are welcome. I see this as a big help for other programmers who have similar needs such as mine. I plan to eliminate code duplication when building a large scale (in terms of code size) project by using this components and focus more on the business logic of it. Is there an open source (Java) or Codeplex (Microsoft) component implementation that does this that I'm not aware of? EDIT: The main point that I want to address for this question is to avoid interdeveloper duplication. Interesting case found in Pragmatic Programmer: An audit for government computer systems have been made showed 10,000 different programs having their own version for Social Security number validation.
