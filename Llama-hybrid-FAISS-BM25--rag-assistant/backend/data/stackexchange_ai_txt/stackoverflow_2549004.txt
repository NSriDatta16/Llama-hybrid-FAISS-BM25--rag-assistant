UI: where to display a status result from a drag & drop?

So I've got drag & drop working. When a drop occurs, I do some processing, and sometimes there is a result that I want to make the user aware of. Right now I am just outputting to the console which isn't very nice. What's an appropriate way to display a status result from a drag & drop? Somehow a modal dialog box seems inappropriate, and a status bar is too space-constrained, I think.
