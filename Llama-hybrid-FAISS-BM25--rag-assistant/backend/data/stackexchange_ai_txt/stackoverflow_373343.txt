In addition to what Steve says, let me add that sizeof does not evaluate its operand. So you are free to do anything in it. Not only you can use not-yet initialized variables, but you can dereference a null-pointer, call functions not defined but only declared and do any other kind of stuff. I encourage you to always use the expression version for reasons Steve explained greatly. Also consider that sometimes typenames are really long and unreadable, just think of pointers to functions (especially in C++). Instead of writing sizeof(my_long_type ) you just do sizeof t .
