Bayesian inference using Dirichlet: muddled outcome case

In relation to my previous question ( Bayesian inference for Beta distribution after an uncertain outcome ), Suppose that $$(x_1,x_2,x_3)\sim Dirichlet(a_1,a_2,a_3)$$ and an associated Mutinoulli trial has probability vector $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ . We want to (partially) identify these probabilities. The thing I'm curious about is what happens when we observe only a binary outcome from the multinoulli trial: when $(1,0,0)$ or $(0,1,0)$ , we observe ''success'' and when $(0,0,1)$ , we observe ''failure''. If this is the case, what would be the Bayesian inference after observing a ''success''? My initial intuition was the posterior is $$(x_1,x_2,x_3)\sim Dirichlet(a_1+\frac{a_1}{a_1+a_2},a_2+\frac{a_2}{a_1+a_2},a_3)$$ as $(1,0,0)$ happens with probability $x_1$ , which has an expected value of $\frac{a_1}{a_1+a_2}$ and $(0,1,0)$ happens with probability $x_2$ , which has an expected value of $\frac{a_2}{a_1+a_2}$ , but it doesn't seem to be right. To calculate the posterior, \begin{align*} \pi(x_1,x_2,x_3|success)=&\gamma~\mathbb P[success|x_1,x_2,x_3]\pi(x_1,x_2,x_3)\\ =&\gamma~(x_1+x_2)\frac{\Gamma(a_1+a_2+a_3)}{\Gamma(a_1)\Gamma(a_2)\Gamma(a_3)}x_1^{a_1-1}x_2^{a_2-1}x_3^{a_3-1}\\ =&\tilde \gamma (x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2-1}x_3^{a_3-1}+x_1^{a_1-1}x_2^{a_2}x_3^{a_3-1}). \end{align*} Here, the last term clearly looks different from the pdf of $Dirichlet(a_1+\frac{a_1}{a_1+a_2},a_2+\frac{a_2}{a_1+a_2},a_3)$ .. Any idea or help?
