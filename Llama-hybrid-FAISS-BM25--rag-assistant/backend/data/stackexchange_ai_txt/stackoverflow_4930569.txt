Looking at TTPhotoViewController.m , it appears that the "See All" button is created in a function called updateChrome ; and it looks like there is no elegant way to override the creation of that button. So the best option I can think of, although this is somewhat clumsy, would be to just subclass TTPhotoViewController , and override that function. Either copy the code into your own function and tweak it (and don't call super ), or call super but then assign a new button to rightBarButtonItem .
