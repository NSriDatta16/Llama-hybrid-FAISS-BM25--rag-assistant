Can I use logistic regression if one category of the dependent variable has a very low frequency?

An example of 100 subjects. Let's say I wish to study the impact of literacy levels (0 as limited and 1 as adequate), anxiety levels (0 as no anxiety and 1 as severe anxiety) and sex (0 for female and 1 for male) on the decision that has been made. We have decision A and decision B. the frequency of decision A is 98 and the frequency of decision B is 2. In such as scenario, is it reasonable to use logistic regression where the dependent variable is the binary variable (decision) ? Why/why not ?
