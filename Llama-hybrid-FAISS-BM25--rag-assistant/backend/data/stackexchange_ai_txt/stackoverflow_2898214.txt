Android: how to set click events on ListView?

I'm looking to be able to open up a new view or activity when I click on an item in my ListView. Currently I have a list of restaurants, and when i click on a particular restaurant I want it to open up another screen that will show its address, google map etc. What I need help with is knowing how to set click events on the items in the list. At the moment I dont have a database of the items, they're just Strings. Can someone help me with getting me to this stage? Thanks alot. package com.example.androidrestaurant; import android.os.Bundle; import android.widget.ArrayAdapter; import android.widget.TextView; import android.app.ListActivity; public class Dundrum extends ListActivity { TextView selection; /** Called when the activity is first created. */ @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setListAdapter(new ArrayAdapter (this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, DUNDRUM)); getListView().setTextFilterEnabled(true); } static final String[] DUNDRUM = new String[] { "Ananda", "Brambles Cafe", "Brannigans", "Buona Sera", "Cafe Mao", "Cafe Mimo", "Dante", "Douglas & Kaldi Terrace Cafe", "Eddie Rockets", "Frango's World Cuisine", "Nando's", "Overends Restaurant @ Airfield House", "Pizza Hut", "Roly Saul", "Siam Thai","Smokey Joes","Sohag Tandoori", "TGI Friday","The Rockfield Lounge", "Winters Bar" }; };
