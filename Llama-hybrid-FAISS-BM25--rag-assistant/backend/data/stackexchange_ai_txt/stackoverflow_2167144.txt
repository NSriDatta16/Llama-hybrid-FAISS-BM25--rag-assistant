Is it possible to interact with an embed movie via javascript?

I am embedding a movie in a web page with the embed tag, but I would like to interact and be interacted via javascript with the embedded movie in .mov. In particular, I would like to get the timings so I can perform actions on the web pages when a particular moment in the movie is reached (like adding subtitles or karaoke effects in the page as the movie plays). Is this possible with standard HTML 4 and javascript, or do I need flash or maybe html 5 ?
