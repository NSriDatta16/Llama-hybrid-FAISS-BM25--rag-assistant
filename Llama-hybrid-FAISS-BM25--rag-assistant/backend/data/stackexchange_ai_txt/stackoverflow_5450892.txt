Vertical Seekbar and problems with R / android.R

I'm trying to get a vertical Seekbar in my app and I've found sort of a solution here: Modifying the Android seekbar widget to operate vertically I've downloaded the VerticalSeekbarExample and it looks good but how do I import it to my app? If I drag the source into my project i get a bunch of errors relating to "R"
