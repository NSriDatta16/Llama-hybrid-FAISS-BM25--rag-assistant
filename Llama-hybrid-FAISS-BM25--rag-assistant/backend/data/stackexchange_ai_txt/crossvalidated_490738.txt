Reporting: using bayesian and frequentist statistics interchangeably in a study

What would you expect to read in a work's "data analysis" or "statistics" section if this used Bayesian and frequentist methods interchangeably? I used Bayesian regression, since it's posterior allowed me to do advanced plotting (showed the results of multiple models in one plot). However, for survival analysis, I used frequentist methods (my limited understanding is that Cox models are not that ready in Bayesian?).
