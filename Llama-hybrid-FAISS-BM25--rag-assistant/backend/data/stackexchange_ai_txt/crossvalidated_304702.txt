Suppose an example with four binary features and one binary output variable. Below is a set of observations: x1 x2 x3 x4 | y --------------- 0 0 0 1 | 0 0 1 0 1 | 0 1 1 0 0 | 1 0 0 1 0 | 1 This set of observations can be used by a machine learning (ML) algorithm to learn a function f that is able to predict a value y for any input from the input space . We are searching for the ground truth f(x) = y that explains the relation between x and y for all possible inputs in the correct way. The function f has to be chosen from the hypothesis space . To get a better idea: The input space is in the above given example $2^4$ , its the number of possible inputs. The hypothesis space is $2^{2^4}=65536$ because for each set of features of the input space two outcomes ( 0 and 1 ) are possible. The ML algorithm helps us to find one function , sometimes also referred as hypothesis, from the relatively large hypothesis space. References A Few Useful Things to Know About ML
