Leverage negative lookahead : >>> import re >>> x=r'(?!x)x' >>> r=re.compile(x) >>> r.match('') >>> r.match('x') >>> r.match('y') this RE is a contradiction in terms and therefore will never match anything. NOTE: In Python, re.match() implicitly adds a beginning-of-string anchor ( \A ) to the start of the regular expression. This anchor is important for performance: without it, the entire string will be scanned. Those not using Python will want to add the anchor explicitly: \A(?!x)x
