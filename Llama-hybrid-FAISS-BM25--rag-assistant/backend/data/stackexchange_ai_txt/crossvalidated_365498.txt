One reason we teach measures of central tendency before measures of spread because many measures of spread involve measures of central tendency: The standard deviation involves the mean, median absolute deviation involves the median. We could teach the range without teaching the mean, but teaching range is not exactly a long term project. Indeed, the mean is used nearly everywhere in statistics. Among measures of central tendency, I think we teach the arithmetic mean first because it is familiar - "average" occurs all over the place and it usually means "arithmetic mean". Of course, there are lots of measures of central tendency that we often do not teach so early in the curriculum - e.g. the trimmed, winsorized, geometric and harmonic means.
