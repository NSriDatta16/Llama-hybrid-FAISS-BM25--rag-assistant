I would suggest starting with a kernel-smoothing method. This could be used to create essentially a moving average of y over each x that takes into account neighboring values of y , weighted by their distance away from the target x . You could then set some threshold for identification for regions of x , based on the height and width of this moving average. Something like the average kernel-smoothed value of y is above 75 for at least 5 consecutive units of x .
