Version control implementation advices (SVN)

In my company, we are going to reimplement version control for our code base.(Now we have small groups of developers, all with their own VSS version control per project). We choose Subversion as our version control platform. Where can i find some Best practices for implementing version control in company(how to organize repositories, what to do and when (i don't want to forget something), processes, etc.) I don't want to reinvent wheel. Thanks
