logistic regression is a specific part of generalised linear models (GLM) where you can found more here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model . As for logistic regression, let's say that you have y as a response which follows bernoyli(p), then log(p/(1-p)) = X_{i1}*beta_{1} + .... + X_{in}*beta_{n} where you should estimate betas and X_{i1} could be the age of the person 1 and so one as for the other variables. Hope this is helpful!
