Two options. Remove the 'Devel' module from your modules directory entirely. Reload the page. Voila! No Theme Info module. Downside: If you drag the module back in, it will still be enabled. Open PHPMyAdmin (if you're using MAMP, WAMP, or a server that has it installed) and run the following query: UPDATE system SET status = 0 WHERE name = 'devel_themer'; Those should work to disable any module "in a pinch." You can also edit the php.ini file in your MAMP/WAMP configuration to give it more memory temporarily, though that trick won't work if you're running on a shared host that doesn't recognize php.ini changes.
