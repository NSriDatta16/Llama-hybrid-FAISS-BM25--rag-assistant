or is there something in the HTTP spec that says forms must contain at least one non-file form field? I do not know for certain. But according to these definitions it seems like a POST containing only a file input should be valid. So I suspect the problem may be CFHTTP in ACF. According to Fiddler the raw content from the cfhttp call in ACF contains an extra new line just before the end boundary (0D 0A in hex view). But under Railo it does not. So I think ACF's cfhttp might be the culprit.
