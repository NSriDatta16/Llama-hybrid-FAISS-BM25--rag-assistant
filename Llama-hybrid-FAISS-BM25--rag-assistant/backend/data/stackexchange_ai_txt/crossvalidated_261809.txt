One of the following three solutions might work for you. However, I am curious what other will suggest: You can use simple linear regression. However, that procedure might violate some assumptions of linear regression (depends on your actual data). Inferential statistics such as p-values and/or confidence-bands might not be trustworthy. Moreover, your model might predict scores outside of the boundary, which makes interpretations difficult. You can transform the percentage scores into logits and use them as outcome for the linear regression. Here ist the transformation formula: ln(p/(1-p)) By doing that, you adapt the link-function of logistic regression to the linear regression. That might solve some of the previous problems especially the last one because logits boundaries are -infinite and +infinite. However, you loose interpretability. (Edit: A short discussion of this approach and why it is not recommended can be found in the source linked for the third solution) Beta-Regression might be the model you are looking for. The following vignette shows how to apply beta regression in R using Cribari-Neto's and Zeileis's "betareg"-Package: ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/web/packages/betareg/vignettes/betareg.pdf I hope that some of my suggestions might help you!
