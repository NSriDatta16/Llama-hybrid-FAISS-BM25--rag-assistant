How to ensure a boolean field to be set in Grails?

I want to ensure that one of two form fields representing a boolean value is checked. But there is no appropriate constraint to do this. nullable: false does not work. class Organisation { Boolean selfInspecting static constraints = { selfInspecting(nullable: false) } } How can I check whether one of the two fields is checked or not?
