Compiling j2me using Ant

I have created a J2ME project after referring to this article J2MEUsingAntwithJ2ME . Now I am having problems in adding resources (such as images) and libraries (such as jar and zip files). I have copied the resources in the res folder as shown in this article but when I extract the .jar file, it does not have any resources.
