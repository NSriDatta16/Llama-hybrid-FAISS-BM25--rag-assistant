HMMs can be used with a continuous state space, in the sense that you can extend the concepts (Bayesian reasoning, hidden/observed random variables, ...) and the use that same framework with continuous hidden variables. Quoting Wikipedia : Hidden Markov models can also be generalized to allow continuous state spaces. Examples of such models are those where the Markov process over hidden variables is a linear dynamical system, with a linear relationship among related variables and where all hidden and observed variables follow a Gaussian distribution. In simple cases, such as the linear dynamical system just mentioned, exact inference is tractable (in this case, using the Kalman filter); however, in general, exact inference in HMMs with continuous latent variables is infeasible, and approximate methods must be used, such as the extended Kalman filter or the particle filter. This tutorial is a good introduction on the topic. As for your precise application, I am not familiar with it and there is too few details for me to judge. But you might give HMMs a try!
