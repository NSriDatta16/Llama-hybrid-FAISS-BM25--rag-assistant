Let's denote color_class as whether the diamond is in D-G or H-J. If you run a logistic regression including your two predictors, color_class, and the interaction between color_class and each of the predictors, you will get the same predicted values as you have generated with the method you proposed. That is, the following will give you the same predicted values: glm(factor(target) ~ depth + table + color_class + color_class*depth + color_class*table, data = diamonds, family = "binomial") Clearly this formulation is acceptable; your method is just a roundabout way of doing the same thing. In propensity score analysis, this method can be used in the context of moderation; see Green & Stuart (2014).
