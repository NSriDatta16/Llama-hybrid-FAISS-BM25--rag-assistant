lets put it this way- design patterns are mainly elaborations of the different design principles e.g. encapsulate what varies, program to an interface, not an implementation, etc. so its not that you HAVE to use a pattern or anything, basically make sure that the way you program conforms to good design principles. if using FSM for a particular design makes design sense, id advice you to go for it. usually patterns are encouraged so that other programmers are able to understand your logic and expand on it easily based on what they know about the pattern. theres no rigid rule saying that you HAVE to use MVC, you HAVE to use blah blah blah.. conclusion: as long as the pattern you're applying conforms to good design principles, (or even if you're not using a specific pattern), make sure its designed well and well enough for others to expand and understand it easily. thats my two cents worth..
