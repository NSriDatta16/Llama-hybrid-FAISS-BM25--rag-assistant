Why does overall-F-test is considering right tailed only?

I've seen this overall F-test several times, and when they compare F-statistics or $\alpha=5$ % with its p-value always use right tailed, whereas the hypothesis is formualed as $$H_0:\beta_0=\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta_3=0\\ H_1: \text{at least one of a tested parameter is nonzero}$$ first-two graphs are example one, second two graphs are example two Just pay attention to the critical value corresponding to $\alpha=0.05$ and p-value corresponding to $F-statistics$ , their number from only right-tailed, why not two-tailed?
