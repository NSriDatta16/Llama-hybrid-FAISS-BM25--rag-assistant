XSLT 2.0 Using XSLT 2.0, the following solution works: value1 value2 value3 XSLT 1.0 You cannot use a result tree fragment in a XPath expression in XSLT 1.0, but fn:document() can retrieve map values. An answer to a similar question will work here:. As described in the XSLT 1.0 specification : document('') refers to the root node of the stylesheet; the tree representation of the stylesheet is exactly the same as if the XML document containing the stylesheet was the initial source document. However, you don't need to use xsl:variable for this. You could specify your map node directly under xsl:stylesheet , but you must remember that a top level elements must have a non null namespace URI: value1 value2 value3
