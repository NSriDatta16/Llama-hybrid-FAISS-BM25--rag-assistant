Calculating effect size for a study with no groups

I am working on a meta analyisis of the effects of e-learning in an organizational context. I have prepared a list of about 25 studies to analyze and I have organized all the path coefficients based on the TAM theory for the standard TAM constructs, i.e. Perceived ease of use -> Perceived usefulness etc. Research that I did on calculating effect size always mentions having 2 groups which are used to calculate effect size. Problem is, in the studies which I singled out there are no control/treatment groups, but only path coefficients are calculated for TAM contructs and other additional factors which authors researched. Is there some way to calculate an effect size for a study which has no groups? Example study with available full text
