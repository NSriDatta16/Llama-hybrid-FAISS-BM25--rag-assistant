.NET 2.0 added generic collections, which should completely replace the use of the non-generic collections in applications built for .NET 2.0 and beyond. They have many advantages, especially since they bring strong typing and avoid boxing of value types. As for why the namespace is added by default - I'd guess Microsoft decided to add this to encourage their use instead of the older System.Collections classes.
