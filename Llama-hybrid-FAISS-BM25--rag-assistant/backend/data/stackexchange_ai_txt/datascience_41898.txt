Wave form analysis ML algorithm

I am trying to determine a person's emotions from their speech. This immediately rings Machine Learning bells and the first step in any ML problem is getting and processing data. My first question is, how do I know what data to provide a machine learning algorithm? Would I supply the entire sound file annotated with a score of "urgency"? Or would I break the sound file down into pitch and periodicity etc.? I guess what I am asking is, how do I quantify the level of significance of certain elements/dimensions of a piece of data in training a machine learning algorithm? My second question, is what sort of machine learning algorithm would I use? I am relatively new to ML although I have some experience with TensorFlow, so even just a general concept would be helpful. The machine learning algorithm also needs to be applicable to real-time audio and return results within around 2000ms. Thanks for the help, please let me know if I should update any component of my question with greater specificity!
