I was using the jqDnR, jqModal and jQuery for several months and had issues with dragging failing in Safari/Chrome or getting stuck in Firefox. I recommend switching to JQuery UI Draggable... http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ I think many of the features that were originally in jqDnR/jqModal have been moved to ui-draggable. The switch wasn't too tough. The only drawback (which is also in jqDnR) is when using an iframe in the draggable container. If the mouse moves too fast into the area of the iframe from the drag handle (or draggable area containing the iframe), the iframe appears to pick up the mouse action and the drag gets hung until you re-enter the draggable area. A bit of a hack is required for that... Trouble Using JQuery UI.Resizable() and UI.Draggable() with an iFrame After putting the hack above, performance is better.
