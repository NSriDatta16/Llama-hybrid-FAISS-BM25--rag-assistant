Voice Recognition Software For Developers

Well the docs finally said it, I need to take it easy on my wrist for a few months. Being that I'm a .NET Developer this could end my livelihood for a little while, something I'm not anxious to do. That said, are there any good handsfree options for developers? Anyone had success using any of the speech recognition software out there? POSTSCRIPT: I've recovered my arm again to the point where two-handed programming isn't a problem. Dragon Naturally speaking worked well enough, but was slower, not like the keyboard where I was programming faster than I thought.
