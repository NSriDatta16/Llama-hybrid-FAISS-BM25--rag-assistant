problem downloading file

I write a script to force download mp3 files from a site. The code is working very fine but the problem is that it can't download large files. I tried it with a file of 9.21mb and it downloaded correctly, but whenever i try to use the code to download a file of 25mb, it simply gives me a cannot find server page or The website cannot display the page. So i now know it has problems downloading large files. Below is the code snippet that does the downloading of files. header("Pragma: public"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Cache-Control: private",false); header("Content-type: application/force-download"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".$dname.".mp3\";" ); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header("Content-Length: ".filesize($secretfile)); $downloaded=readfile($secretfile); The displayed error is: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error thank u very much for ur time guys.
