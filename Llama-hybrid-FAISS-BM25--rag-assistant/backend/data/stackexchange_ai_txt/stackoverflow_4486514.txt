My suggestion is to go with whatever you are more comfortable developing and deploying on. I'd personally go with Sinatra, but that's because I personally find it fast and elegant to develop with. If speed is critical, and more important than development time, you'll need to develop a reasonable benchmark on both and test it on both.
