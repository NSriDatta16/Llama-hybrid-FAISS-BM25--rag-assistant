MCMC - Is Gelman-Rubin diagnostic criteria good for checking convergence of MCMC chains sampling from multimodal distribution?

I am using Bayesian inference to estimate some parameter in a model. My parameter space is multimodel - most likely bimodal. Is the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic criteria a good way to check convergence? It gives a false impression of convergence when it's value is below 1.2, however if I continue the runs, it goes back up. Below are the trace plots of three parameters and trend in the GR statistics. I am using DREAM MCMC algorithm. Any suggestion will be helpful.
