You copied that fragment of code straight from the manual at php.net about mysqli::prepare. On that same page is the following text: The purpose of prepared statements is to not include data in your SQL statements. Including them in your SQL statements is NOT safe. Always use prepared statements. They are cleaner to use (code easier to read) and not prone to SQL injections. Which is the answer to your question ;)
