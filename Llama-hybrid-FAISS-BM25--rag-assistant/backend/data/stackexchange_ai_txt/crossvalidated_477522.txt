On the question is it an acceptable practice to constrain, or specify, the correlation between your latent variables, the answer is perhaps yes, if presented in a different analysis context. As a particular example for the affirmative, I cite this work: Bayesian latent variable modelling of multivariate spatio-temporal variation in cancer mortality , to quote: The use of Bayesian approach to inference provides us with great flexibility in modelling options and a rich output for inferential purposes, in particular, various spatially and temporally correlated prior distributions for the latent factors and residual error terms to capture the geographical and time series structure. where gaining flexibility in your analysis appears to be one of your goals.
