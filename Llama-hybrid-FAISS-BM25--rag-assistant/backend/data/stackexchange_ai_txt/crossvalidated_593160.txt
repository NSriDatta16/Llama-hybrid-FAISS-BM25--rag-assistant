How to sample from a distribution with log likelihood a quadratic form

In the context of the article BiRank: Towards Ranking on Bipartite Graphs specially the Bayesian interpretation section 5.2. I want to make inference on the vector non-negative vector $\mathbf{u}\in \mathbb{R}^{n_u}$ . Thus, I want to sample from a distribution with the following log-likelihood: $$ \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{u})=-(1+\eta)\sum_{i=1}^{N_u}u_i^{2}+2\sum_{i=1}^{N_u}u_i\left(\theta\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} w_{ij}\sqrt{\frac{d_j^p}{d_i^u}}+\eta u_{i}^{0}\right)-\theta^{2}\sum_{j=1}^{N_p}(d_j^{p})^{2}-\eta\sum_{i=1}^{N_u}(u_i^{0})^{2} $$ where $w_{ij}\geq 0$ , $d_i^{u}= \sum_{j}w_{ij}$ , $d_j^{p}= \sum_{i}w_{ij}$ , $\theta,\eta>0$ ara hyperparameters, and $\mathbf{u}^{0}$ is a fixed vector with positive values. The MAP is given by: $$\hat{u_i}=\frac{\theta \sum_{j=1}^{N_p} w_{ij}\sqrt{\frac{d_j^{p}}{d_i^{u}}}+\eta u_{i}^{0}}{1+\eta}$$ The distribution with the above log likelihood can't be normal due to the non-negativity of $\mathbf{u}$ . Furthermore, after doing some simulation using Metropolis Hastings for each individual $u_i$ the variance changes significatly for every $i\neq j$ (at least from a simulated perspective). Any idea on what should I do? Gibbs sampling?
