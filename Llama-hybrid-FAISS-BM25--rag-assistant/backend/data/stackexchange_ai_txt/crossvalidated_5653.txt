Under one interpretation of your situation there is no need to modify the p values at all. For example, let's posit that a sequence of (unknown) bivariate distributions $p_i(x,y)$ govern $A$ and $B$ for each organism $i$. That is, $\Pr(A=x, B=y) = p_i(x,y)$ for all possible outcomes $(x,y)$ of $(A,B)$. To test whether the measurement procedures $A$ and $B$ differ, a reasonable null hypothesis is that these distributions are all symmetric : $$H_0: p_i(x,y) = p_i(y,x) \text{ for all } i, x, y.$$ The sign statistic (difference between number of $+$ and number of $-$ results) is still a reasonable one to use in this test. (It actually tests the null hypothesis $H_0: \Pr(A ties ; namely on the values $t_i = \sum_{x}p_i(x,x)$ (one for each organism $i$). The question, which appears not to contemplate the possibility of ties at all, suggests their chances are fairly small. In any case, the symmetry assumption in the null implies the chance of organism $i$ yielding a $+$ sign equals the chance of organism $i$ yielding a $-$ sign and the assumption that ties are unlikely implies both these chances are close to $1/2$. This implies the distribution of the sign statistic is binomial, as usual, despite any correlation (or lack thereof) between $A$ and $B$. If there is a substantial chance of ties, it looks like you cannot make any progress towards quantitative bounds until you specify something about those chances. For example, if you provide an upper bound for the $t_i$ you can say something about the distribution of the sign statistic.
