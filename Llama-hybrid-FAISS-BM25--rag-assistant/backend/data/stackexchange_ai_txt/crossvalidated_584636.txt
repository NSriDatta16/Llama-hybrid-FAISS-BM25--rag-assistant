What's GAN's Input-size Limitations?

I am interested in GAN for generating synthetic data. I am studying the input limitations for GAN starting from which GAN is no longer usable. I have found many applications that use GANs for 1024x1024 or 3072x3072 inputs. I haven't found implementations of much higher input dimensionality. This is important because for time series data for example, we might easily be interested in an input-size of tens of thousands or over. How does GAN behave when the input size increases tremendously (over a few thousands)?
