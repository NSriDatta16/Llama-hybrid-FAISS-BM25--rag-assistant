The warning, more probably than not, comes from the compiler. If you compiled and got the warning and later on removed it from the compilation process by means of a pragma or compiler option, it might be the case that the IDE still remembers it. It should go away in a later compilation, or you can manually delete within the Problems windows. If you have not removed it from the compilation process (that is, the warning comes out in each new compilation) this will be mainly useless as the warning will come back. But then again, if it is still there, the IDE is just reminding you.
