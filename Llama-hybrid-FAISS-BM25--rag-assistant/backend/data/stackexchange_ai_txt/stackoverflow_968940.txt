Your GUI classes will end up with many methods to keep it up to date and that is fine. If it worries you there is always the option of breaking up the GUI into sub GUIs each with a different functionality or a small set of related functionality. The number of methods will obviously not change, but it will be more organised, coherent and decoupled. Instead of having every method in your GUI create a Runnable and use SwingUtilities.invokeLater to put that update on the EDT I'd advise you to try out another solution. For my personal projects I use The Swing Application Framework (JSR296) which has some convenient Task classes for launching background jobs and then the succeed method is automatically on the EDT thread. If you cannot use this you should try and create your own similar framework for background jobs.
