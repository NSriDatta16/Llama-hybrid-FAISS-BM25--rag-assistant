Predefined Perl functions can be called with or without parentheses. Most of people coming from other languages confuse these functions for keywords/operators. bless, undef, push, pop, shift, unshift, print, split, join, etc. are all functions. Hence, these two are equivalent: return bless { }, $type; return bless({ }, $type); But these two are not: print 2 * 3 + 2; # prints 8 print(2 * 3) + 2; # prints 6 (with a warning if warnings pragma is on)
