Django does not provide a way to get associative arrays (dictionaries in Python) from the request object. As the first answer pointed out, you can use .getlist() as needed, or write a function that can take a QueryDict and reorganize it to your liking (pulling out key/value pairs if the key matches some key[*] pattern, for example).
