Perhaps an Enum would be the most elegant approach? public enum MaritalStatus { Single = 1, Married = 3, Divorced = 4 } Then you can simply use Enum.GetName() and Enum.Parse() to convert between string, int and MaritalStatus objects. This may also provide you with a more elegant solution in some of your other business logic.
