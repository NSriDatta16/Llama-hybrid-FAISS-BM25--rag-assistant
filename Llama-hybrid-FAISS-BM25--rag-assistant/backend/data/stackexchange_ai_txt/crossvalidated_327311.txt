The approach you outline towards the end of your question is often done in practice. You create an indicator variable for missing (yes/no) and then do logistic regression to see whether anything predicts missingness. You then include any variables which do predict missingness in your final model even if they are not otherwise of scientific or clinical interest. Doing comparisons the way you did will probably lead to the same conclusion but a multiple logistic regression is preferable as it allows for the covariates together rather than one by one.
