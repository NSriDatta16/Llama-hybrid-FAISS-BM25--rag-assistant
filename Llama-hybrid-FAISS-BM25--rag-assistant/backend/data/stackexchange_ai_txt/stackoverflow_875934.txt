Embed external application under Windows

I have a Windows desktop application that I want to add some functionality to. Unfortunately the source code is not available, but it has a COM API. So, my desire is to embed this application in my own window (with menus, toolbar, etc) and link events through the COM API. How do you suggest I embed one application within another? (I had intended to use the Qt toolkit but it only supports embedding applications on Linux.) thanks, Richard
