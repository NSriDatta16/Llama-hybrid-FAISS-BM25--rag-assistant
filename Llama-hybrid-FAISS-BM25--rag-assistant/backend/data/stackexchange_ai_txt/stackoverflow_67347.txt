SQL 2000 equivalent of SQLAgentReaderRole

I have quite a few developers asking me if certain SQL jobs ran, and I would like to give them access to check it on their own without giving them sysadmin rights. I know that in SQL 2005 , you can grant them the SQLAgentReaderRole , but I am looking for a solution in SQL 2000 .
