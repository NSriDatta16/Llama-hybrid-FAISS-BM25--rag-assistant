I spent a day to figure out what was the issue. But finally I got it. I cannot say the Evan Mulawski 's answer wrong. I tried with his code even. But no help. Finally I found that the file name extension is missing. I just appended .pdf to testfile. response.setHeader("Content-Disposition","attachment; filename=testfile.pdf"); Now I removed the following. response.setHeader("Pragma","Public"); response.setHeader("Cache-Control","must-revalidate,post-check=0,pre-check=0"); response.setHeader("Expires","0"); Even with the above code still I am getting the PDF as an attachment.
