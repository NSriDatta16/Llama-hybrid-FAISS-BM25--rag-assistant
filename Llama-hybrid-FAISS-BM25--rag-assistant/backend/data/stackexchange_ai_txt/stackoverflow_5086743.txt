You only need to bind to the events once! There is no need to bind and unbind them each time... I separated them out in the code below to make it more clear about binding once. And as ZDYN said (+1 to him), you need to include a droppable code, but instead of using the container, use the zones inside... here is a demo and the full code below. var feedback = $('#feedback'); $('.item').draggable({ revert: true, zIndex: 999, cursor: 'move' }); $('.drop_zone').droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { ui.draggable.appendTo($(this)); } }).bind('dropover dropout', function(e) { var id = this.id; feedback.text(e.type === 'dropover' ? 'Over: ' + id : 'Out: ' + id); });
