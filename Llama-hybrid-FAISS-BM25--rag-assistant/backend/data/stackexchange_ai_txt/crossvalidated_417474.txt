What you describe is the concept of dynamic predictions from mixed models. Initially, when you have no information for a doctor you only use the fixed effects in the prediction, i.e., you put his/her ability level equal to the average ( $\alpha_j = 0$ ). But, as extra information is recorded you can update your predictions by calculating the random effect of the doctor. You get this from the posterior/conditional distribution of the random effects $\alpha_j$ given the observed data $y_j$ . You can find more information on these predictions in the Dynamic Predictions vignette of the GLMMadaptive package.
