Expansion of inner product for polynomial kernel for SVMs

On page 424 in "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie et al (2013) ( https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf ), we see the following expansion of a polynomial kernel with degree 2: I don't understand the second line in this expansion. Why is it possible to expand the inner product $\langle X, X^\prime\rangle$ to $X_1 X^\prime_1 + X_2 X_2^\prime$ ?
