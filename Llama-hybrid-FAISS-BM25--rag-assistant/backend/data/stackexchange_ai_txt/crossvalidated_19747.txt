Stationarity is a one type of dependence structure. Suppose we have a data $X_1,...,X_n$ . The most basic assumption is that $X_i$ are independent, i.e. we have a sample. The independence is a nice property, since using it we can derive a lot of useful results. The problem is that sometimes (or frequently, depending on the view) this property does not hold. Now independence is a unique property, two random variables can be independent only in one way, but they can be dependent in various ways. So stationarity is one way of modeling the dependence structure. It turns out that a lot of nice results which holds for independent random variables (law of large numbers, central limit theorem to name a few) hold for stationary random variables (we should strictly say sequences). And of course it turns out that a lot of data can be considered stationary, so the concept of stationarity is very important in modeling non-independent data. When we have determined that we have stationarity, naturally we want to model it. This is where ARMA( A uto R egressive M oving A verage) models come in. It turns out that any stationary data can be approximated with stationary ARMA model, thanks to Wold decomposition theorem . So that is why ARMA models are very popular and that is why we need to make sure that the series is stationary to use these models. Now again the same story holds as with independence and dependence. Stationarity is defined uniquely, i.e. data is either stationary or not, so there is only one way for data to be stationary, but lots of ways for it to be non-stationary. Again it turns out that a lot of data becomes stationary after certain transformation. ARIMA( A uto R egressive I ntegrated M oving A verage) model is one model for non-stationarity. It assumes that the data becomes stationary after differencing. In the regression context the stationarity is important since the same results which apply for independent data holds if the data is stationary.
