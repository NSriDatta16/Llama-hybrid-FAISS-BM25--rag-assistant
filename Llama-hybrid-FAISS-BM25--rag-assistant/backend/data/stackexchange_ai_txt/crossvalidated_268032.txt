Regression without a dependent variable

I want to construct a multivariate model to find outliers in the data. The data I have is similar to the iris data (without the Species data attribute, I only have the first 4 attributes) > head(iris) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa It seems like there are a few methods for multivariate outlier detection. The document is as in this link Mahalanobis Distance Cookâ€™s Distance Leverage Point DFFITS All of them seem to require building a regression line and I understand that regression implies dependent variable. However, how can I choose a dependent variable from my data given that it only has the first 4 numeric continuous columns?
