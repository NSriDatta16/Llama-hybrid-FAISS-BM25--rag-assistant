C++ Agent : Base class undefined error in Game

I have 6 C++ header files. There are a lot of includes so I tried to make it so that I use as little as I can. But I keep getting an error from the very beginning saying that a class "Agent" is undefined. I defined it and included it and can't find the problem here are the 2 header files that are causing the problem: Sinbad.h: #ifndef SINBAD_H #define SINBAD_H #pragma once #include "Agent.h" #define NUM_ANIMS 13 // number of animations the character has. Should be made character specific class Agent; class Sinbad : public Agent { Agent.h: #ifndef AGENT_H #define AGENT_H #include #include "aStar.h" extern Ogre::SceneManager* sceneMgr; // Defined in main.cpp class GridNode; // forward declarations class Grid; class Astar; class Agent { Here's the error I am getting: 1>c\gameengine_solution\sinbad.h(12) : error C2504: 'Agent' : base class undefined
