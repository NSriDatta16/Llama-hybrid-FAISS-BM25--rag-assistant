Hello @Benj Cabalona Jr. What you are mentioning is something every algorithm uses for convergence of their loss metrics. I will list down some algorithms from sklearn for your reference Decision Tree min_impurity_split : float, (default=1e-7) Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf. Support Vectors tol : float, optional (default=1e-3) Tolerance for stopping criterion. Neural Networks For each loss function, one can set the stopping threshold. In Keras you have the EarlyStopping callback
