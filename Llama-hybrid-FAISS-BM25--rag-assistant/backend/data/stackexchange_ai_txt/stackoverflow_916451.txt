the problem is that you are just setting the report to break at certain points in the data instead of, say, rendering a sub-report multiple times by passing a parameter to it. the data only exists inside the scope of the table. what you could do is set up a sub report that accepts a department parameter and generates data for one department. in the sub report you could then add the header by referencing the parameter that's being passed. then in your main report you create a table with a dataset of unique departments. group by the department in the table, and drag the sub report into the table and set the parameter. if you do it right you should get the same effect, but with the department header. if you need more clarification, feel free to ask.
