Problems creating odds ratios for a binary regression in R

I am creating a binary logistic regression in R studio. So far I have performed the regression and I am trying to convert it to odds ratios using the function: install.packages(c("glm")) regression $MCZ_8 , family=binomial(link="logit"), weights=ons.data$ INDWGTr, na.action=na.omit) summary(regression) ####Producing odds ratios for the logistic regression#### install.packages(c("car")) library('car') vif(regression) OR It is when I get to the lines where I am trying to make the odds function (odds Waiting for profiling to be done... Error in profile.glm(object, which = parm, alpha = (1 - level)/4, trace = trace) : profiling has found a better solution, so original fit had not converged In addition: Warning messages: 1: In eval(family$initialize) : non-integer #successes in a binomial glm! 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred This is stopping the object 'odds' from being made, so the final line of code turns the error 'object 'odds' not found'. Can anyone provide some help on how I can get around this, or an alternative way of making odds ratios for my regression? I'm very new to R so apologies if this is really obvious or if I'm just a bit slow.
