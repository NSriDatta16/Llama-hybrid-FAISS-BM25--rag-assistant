Can we express logistic loss minimization as a maximum likelihood problem?

I have a simple question about the equivalence of loss minimization and likelihood maximization for logistic regression. Say are given some data $(x_i,y_i) \text{ for } ~i = 1,\ldots,N$ where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$. In logistic regression, we fit the coefficients of a linear classification model $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ by minimizing the logistic loss function. This results in the optimization problem: $$ \min_w \sum_{i=1}^N \log(1+\exp(-y_iw^Tx_i)) $$ Let $w^*$ be the optimal set of coefficients obtained from this problem. I am wondering: can we recover $w^*$ by solving a maximum likelihood problem? If so, what is the exact maximum likelihood problem that we would need to solve? And what would be the corresponding likelihood function for $w$?
