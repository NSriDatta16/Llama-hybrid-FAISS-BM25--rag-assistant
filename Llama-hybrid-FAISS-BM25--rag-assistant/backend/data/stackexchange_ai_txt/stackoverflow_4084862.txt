Install home screen widgets progrommaticly

I have main activity window in my app, which displays three icons on it, also there are 3 home screen widgets in this application. is there a possibility for long press on one of the icons in the main activity, to do the same behavior as when you install the program shortcuts from the application menu when dragging shortcuts on the desktop?(for example this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ37cASti4k ) or the user to have to go to home screen \ menu \ add \ widget??
