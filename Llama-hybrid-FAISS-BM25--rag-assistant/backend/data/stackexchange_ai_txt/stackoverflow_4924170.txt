Get "in_reply_to_status_id" from statuses/user_timeline Twitter in API PHP

Basically trying to get the "in_reply_to_status_id" value statuses/user_timeline and set it as variable in php ($replycheck), heres what I've written but to no avail useragent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9'; $reply_result = $oauth->get('http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json?screen_name=jwhelton'); $tweetid = $reply_result ->id; $checkreply = $reply_result ->in_reply_to_status_id; echo " Last tweet was id'd as ".$tweetid." and was reply of ".$checkreply; ?> Thanks to anyone who can give me a hand!
