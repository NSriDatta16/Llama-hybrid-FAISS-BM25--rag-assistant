simplicity rules: just restart your app with different parameters. it is very hard to either track down all allocs/deallocs and clean up the memory (just forget some minor blocks inside bigger chunks [fragmentation] and you still have problems to rerun the class), or to do introduce your own heap-management (very clever people have invested years to bring nedmalloc etc to live, do not fool yourself into the illusion this is an easy task). so: catch "out of memory" somehow (signals, or std::bad_alloc , or whatever) create a new process of your app: windows: CreateProcess() (you can just exit() your program after this, which cleans up all allocated resources for you) unix: exec() (replaces the current process completely, so it "cleans up all the memory" for you) done.
