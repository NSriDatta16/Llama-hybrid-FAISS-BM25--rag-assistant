I'm sorry to say it, but this analysis is doomed before it starts. You have only 2 participants in your smaller group, and 15-75 trials per condition per participant. Between-group differences in EEG signals are typically extremely small and noisy, and the chances of detecting a genuine effect in such limited data is essentially zero. What's worse, since you're planning on looking at 10 different outcome variables, in two different conditions, there are lots (20) of opportunities for false positives to occur. Taken together, this means that any significant differences you do find are considerably more likely to be false positives than genuine effects (and if they do happen to be genuine effects, they'll be huge overestimates). As a side note, between group effects are notoriously difficult to study using EEG. It's almost impossible to rule out the very strong possibility that any differences that do emerge reflect differences in motor artefacts, in electrode placement or signal quality, or even hairstyle. There are very few between group findings in the EEG literature that are believable. Luck's EEG textbook has a lot of good advice on good EEG designs for hypothesis testing. You may also want to look in power analysis for EEG designs. Further Comments Building a model that incorporates both conditions doesn't solve your problem here, since you want to compare the two groups and one of them has almost no data. Similarly, Bayesian methods are nice, but they don't solve the problem. They provide a way of quantifying the uncertainty in your model, but they don't get around the fact that without more data you have no way of reducing that uncertainty.
