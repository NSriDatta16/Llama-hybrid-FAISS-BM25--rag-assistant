Ok, so I worked this out myself, with the aid of the DLR spec, from here https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr/blob/master/Docs/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf and by looking at the IP/DLR source. This isn't very elegant, and using a ScriptRuntimeSetup object with the PrivateBinding property set True would probably be a neater route than using CreateEngine. But this one works: Dictionary options = new Dictionary (); options.Add("PrivateBinding", true); _engine = Python.CreateEngine(options);
