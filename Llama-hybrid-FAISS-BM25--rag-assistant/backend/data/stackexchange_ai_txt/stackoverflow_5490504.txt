Are you sure you want to select all columns from the dataBase table? Like this: cmdGet.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Paragraph"; I would say this is not correct, you only need to get one column where the text is saved, like: cmdGet.CommandText = "SELECT MyTextColumn FROM Paragraph"; //Maybe even som Where comparison!! And it would be better to use Text property of the richTextBox to fill into it and ToStirng method on Scalar: this.richTextBox1.Text = cmd.ExecuteScalar.Tostring();
