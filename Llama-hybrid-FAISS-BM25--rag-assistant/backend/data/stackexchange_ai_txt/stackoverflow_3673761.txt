Unit Testing Vocabulary: "coverage"

I'm preparing some educational/training material with respect to Unit Testing, and want to double check some vocabulary. In an example I'm using the developer has tested a Facade for all possible inputs but hasn't tested the more granular units 'behind' it. Would one still say that the tests have "full coverage" - given they cover the entire range of inputs? I feel like "full coverage" is generally used to denote coverage of code/units... but there would certainly be full something when testing all possible inputs. What's the other word I'm looking for?
