Listen to JFrame resize events as the user drags their mouse?

When a user clicks on the corner of a JFrame to resize and drags the mouse around, the JFrame redraws based on the current position of the mouse as the user drags. How can you listen to these events? Below is the what I have currently tried: public final class TestFrame extends JFrame { public TestFrame() { this.addComponentListener(new ComponentAdapter() { public void componentResized(ComponentEvent e) { // This is only called when the user releases the mouse button. System.out.println("componentResized"); } }); } // These methods do not appear to be called at all when a JFrame // is being resized. @Override public void setSize(int width, int height) { System.out.println("setSize"); } @Override public void setBounds(Rectangle r) { System.out.println("setBounds A"); } @Override public void setBounds(int x, int y, int width, int height) { System.out.println("setBounds B"); } } How can I determine and constrain how the user resizes a window (based on the current aspect ratio of the window) as they are dragging around the mouse around?
