How do you go about validating check boxes in ASP.NET MVC?

I am wondering what methods people are using for validating check boxes in ASP.NET MVC (both client and server side). I am using JQuery currently for client side validation but I am curious what methods people are using, ideally with the least amount of fuss (I am looking for a new solution). I should mention that I am currently using MVC Preview 4, and while I could upgrade to MVC Preview 5 if there is no elegant solution in MVC Preview 4, I would prefer not to at this stage just for compatibility purposes with other developers and existing solutions. Note, I have seen these related posts: Validating posted form data in the ASP.NET MVC framework Whatâ€™s the best way to implement field validation using ASP.NET MVC? MVC.net JQuery Validation
