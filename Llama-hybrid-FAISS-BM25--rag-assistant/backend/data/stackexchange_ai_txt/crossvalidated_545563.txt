I am not aware of any theoretical work giving minimum or optimum train/test set splits for time series, and I doubt that such general guidelines could be given with any theoretical foundations. Sales data frequently exhibit seasonality. So one reasonable split would be to hold out the entire last year as a test set, which still gives you more than two years to fit your models on (a good thing) and still allows you to analyze whether accuracy was systematically better or worse during certain parts of the year. And as you write, the last two years have seen a big impact from COVID. I would say that any conclusions of the kind "method A outperformed method B in the test set, therefore we will use A henceforth" will be far more driven by COVID idiosyncrasies than by optimal or suboptimal train/test splits.
