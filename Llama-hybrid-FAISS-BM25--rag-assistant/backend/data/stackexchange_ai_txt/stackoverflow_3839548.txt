iTextSharp center align objects within the Document object

Is there a quick and simple way to center align objects within the Document object? Without performing any calculation logic, ie. Get width of page, get width of contents, divide by two, etc. I have a PdfPTable object within a Paragraph object, within the Document object. I would like to center the Paragraph object. Thanks!
