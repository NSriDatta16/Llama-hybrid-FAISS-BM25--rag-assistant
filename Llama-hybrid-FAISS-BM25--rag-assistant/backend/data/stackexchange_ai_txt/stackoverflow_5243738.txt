Magento: Filtering a Collection with grouped Clauses

I would like to filter a collection with grouped clauses. In SQL this would look something like: SELECT * FROM `my_table` WHERE col1='x' AND (col2='y' OR col3='z') How can I "translate" this to filtering a collection with ->addFieldToFilter(...) ? Thanks!
