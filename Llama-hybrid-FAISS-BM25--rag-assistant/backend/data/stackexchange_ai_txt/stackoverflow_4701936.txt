This really depends what you know about the numbers in the array. If they're all drawn from a distribution where all the probability mass is on a single value, then on expectation it will take you exactly 1 step to find the value you're looking for, since every value is the same, for example. Let's now make a pretty strong assumption, that the array is filled with a random permutation of distinct values . You can think of this as picking some arbitrary sorted list of distinct elements and then randomly permuting it. In this case, suppose you're searching for some element in the array that actually exists (this proof breaks down if the element is not present). Then the number of steps you need to take is given by X, where X is the position of the element in the array. The average number of steps is then E[X], which is given by E[X] = 1 Pr[X = 1] + 2 Pr[X = 2] + ... + n Pr[X = n] Since we're assuming all the elements are drawn from a random permutation, Pr[X = 1] = Pr[X = 2] = ... = Pr[X = n] = 1/n So this expression is given by E[X] = sum (i = 1 to n) i / n = (1 / n) sum (i = 1 to n) i = (1 / n) (n)(n + 1) / 2 = (n + 1) / 2 Which, I think, is the answer you're looking for.
