How to interpret cumulative periodogram?

I use cpgram function in R to produce a cumulative periodogram of a monthly time series. Its horizental axis is a number between 0 and 6 labeled as frequency: what does these numbers mean, since the frequency in cumulative periodogram should be between 0 and 0.5 like the ones shown below (upper ones)? Also, do you know how can I create cumulative periodograms like these plots?
