Changing CSS pseudo-element styles via JavaScript

Is it possible to change a CSS pseudo-element style via JavaScript? For example, I want to dynamically set the color of the scrollbar like so: document.querySelector("#editor::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:vertical").style.background = localStorage.getItem("Color"); and I also want to be able to tell the scrollbar to hide like so: document.querySelector("#editor::-webkit-scrollbar").style.visibility = "hidden"; Both of these scripts, however, return: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of null Is there some other way of going about this? Cross-browser interoperability is not important, I just need it to work in webkit browsers.
