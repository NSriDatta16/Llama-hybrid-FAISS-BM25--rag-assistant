Here is my proposed answer to my own question, in SAS, using the method I alluded to previously. I can't necessarily think of another way to go about doing this, and I had a good long boring drive to ponder it. Again, if someone has a better way, I'd be happy to hear it. Generally, what this code does is generate a simple cohort-type data set with a fixed relative risk, then run a GLM on said cohort using the inbuilt MCMC routines to get a posterior distribution. Because this is a proof of concept, I'm using uninformative priors. This distribution is then sampled without replacement into a new data set. data work.tinkering; do id=1 to 20000; disroll = ranuni(68273); yran = ranuni(102842); if yran 0.333 then y = 0; pdis = exp(-2.30258+(1.0986*y)); if disroll pdis then case=0; output; end; ods graphics on; proc genmod data=work.tinkering descending; model case = y / dist=binomial link=log; bayes nbi=2000 nmc=10000 plots=all outpost=work.out; ods graphics off; proc sgplot data=work.out; density y; density y / type=kernel; proc surveyselect data=work.out method=urs outhits n=1000 out=work.SampledPrior; run; Graphical comparison of the two:
