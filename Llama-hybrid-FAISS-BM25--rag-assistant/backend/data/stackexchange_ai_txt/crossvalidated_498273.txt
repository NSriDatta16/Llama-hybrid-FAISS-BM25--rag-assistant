Choice of Time Series Models for Forecasting Data

I have a question that to most readers here probably think is fairly simple to answer, but never the less, out of curiosity I'd like to ask: Given a time series, yt, which is stationary (say the log returns of a stock x): if this series is best explained by an ARMA(2,1) model in sample, would it make sense to compare its out of sample performance to that of an MA(1) or AR(1) model to the same data set? The reason I'm asking is because I have heard that some simpler models often times perform better than more complicated ones. Please view sample code here: This code compares the MSE from an out of sample forecast for an AR(1) model and a Best Fit ARMA. require(tseries) require(quantmod) require(forecast) getSymbols("AAPL", from = "2015-01-01", to = "2020-01-01") plot.ts(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted) log_returns $mean) ar_one_mse mean) arma_mse ar_one_mse In this example, the AR(1) performs better out of sample as measured by MSE. My question here is though, can this comparison of models even be justified? Considering the residuals from the AR(1) process likely do not resemble white noise, can this model even be used to forecast? Thanks in advance and please let me know if I can be more specific.
