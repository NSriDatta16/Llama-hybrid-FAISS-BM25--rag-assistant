You can also try to create the document embeddings as you mention and use k-Nearest Neighbors to find the nearest job descriptions to a given resume based on some distance, without any clustering of job descriptions. There are some approximate implementations of k-Nearest Neighbors that work very fast like https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib .
