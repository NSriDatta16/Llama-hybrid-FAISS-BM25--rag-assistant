Volatility is is the degree of variation of a time series around its (conditional) mean. Volatility can be measured by conditional variance or conditional standard deviation. Volatility forecasting is important in finance, e.g. building low-variance portfolios, pricing derivatives and risk management. Classical volatility forecasting models treat the volatility as an unobserved characteristic of a time series and model it at the same frequency as the input data. Some examples are Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH), Stochastic Volatility (SV), and their multivariate counterparts. More recent volatility forecasting models rely on observed proxies for volatility (realized volatilities) derived from higher-frequency data. Heterogeneous Auto-Regressive (HAR) model is a popular example.
