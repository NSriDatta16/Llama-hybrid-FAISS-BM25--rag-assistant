General PHP debugging tip, never "echo" to the browser, always var_dump($var). This will do smart things, such as actually print out "false" for a boolean false instead of a blank string, which is what I think is happening here. Your attempt to get the block named "report_sales_sales.grid" is most likely returning false. That's because a block by this name hasn't been added to The Layout. I'm not certain, but my guess is a block by this name is added somewhere in the execution chain set off by the particular layout update in app/design/adminhtml/default/default/layout/sales.xml store_ids created_at_order Order Created Date updated_at_order Order Updated Date report_type note Order Updated Date report is real-time, does not need statistics refreshing. Most likely, the block named sales.report.grid.container (with a URI adminhtml/report_sales_sales which coresponds to the class Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Report_Sales_Sales) adds a sub-block (but don't quote me on that) The larger point being, you general approach here was good, but you didn't copy enough. The request to the Magento page runs with the Layout handle "adminhtml_report_sales_sales". A request to your page is going to run with a Layout handle something like "adminhtml_report_index_sales", which means the above layout block doesn't get loaded into the system. (if this made no sense, read up on Layout Handles .) You either need to Configure your module to use a custom layout files that adds the block for your handles Use a local.xml to do the same as the above (caveat, I'm not sure local.xml is used for the Admin layout system) Pragmatically add the needed blocks in your controller action.
