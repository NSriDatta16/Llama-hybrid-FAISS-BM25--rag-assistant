Regression Coefficients in terms of Individual treatment effect

According to the famous book “Mostly Harmless Econometrics”, the regression coefficient can be written in terms of the individual treatment effects. Precisely, the authors state that: Even so, allowing for random variation in potential outcomes across people and for nonlinearity for a given person, regression can be thought of as a strategy for the estimation of a weighted average of the individual-specific difference, $Y_{1i}-Y_{0i}$ . ( $Y_{1i}$ is the potential treated outcome, and $Y_{0i}$ is the potential untreated outcome.) Although I look over the entire book, I was not able to how the regression estimand (coefficient) can be thought a weighted average of the individual treatment effect. So, if you know where I can find the reference related to this issue, or you can show me the derivation, please help me.
