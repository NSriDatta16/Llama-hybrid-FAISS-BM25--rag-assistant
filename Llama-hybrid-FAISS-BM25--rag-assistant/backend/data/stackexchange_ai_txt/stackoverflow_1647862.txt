This seems easy to do if you've written your own DnD handler. Basically, DnD movement that is constrained to either vertical or horizontal axises work by only changing the left or top CSS attributes when dynamically position the draggable element. You can use this same idea to customize this restrained behavior. Instead just translating the (X,Y) of the current mouse position for the element's CSS left / right , you can use the X for the left and derive the right by passing it through a linear function like y = mx + b .
