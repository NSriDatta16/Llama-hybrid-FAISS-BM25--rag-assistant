What does "aspect model" refer to in machine learning

Hopefully this is the right place to ask my question. I am reading this paper about cold-start recommendations: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1352837 the expression "aspect model" is used a lot : in the abstract (sentence before last sentence), and at the beginning of section2. Is anyone able to shed some light here ? Thanks
