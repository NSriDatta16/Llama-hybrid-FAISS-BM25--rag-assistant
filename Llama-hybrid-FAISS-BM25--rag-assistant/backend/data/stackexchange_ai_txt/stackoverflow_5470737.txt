cyberneko html settings to ignore unencoded greater than and less than symbol

I'm having htmlcontent which contains greater than and less than symbol. But those symbols are not encoded as &lt; and &gt;. To balance tags in the content i pass the content through cyberneko html parser. After parsing content in between those greater than and less than symbol are discared. To overcome this problem, what settings i have to set up in the cyberneko html parser? sample content: Average Response Time server is critical because its value 282 > 0 ms. [Threshold Details : Critical if value > 0, Warning if value = 0, Clear if value After nekohtml parsing 0] Please help. Thanks in advance
