The Jumping Facebook Like button bug on IE 7, how can it be fixed?

Is this is known bug and is there a workaround? The Facebook Like button will jump forever in IE 7. Take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/Z53cs/10 using IE 7. And if you use IE 8 (and probably IE 9 as well which I don't have at work), you can use "Developer Tools" and change to "Browser Mode: IE 7" and you will see the Jumping Facebook Like Button. The code is very simple: hello world The font-size is to show that jumping of the button. If font-size is removed, as in http://jsfiddle.net/Z53cs/11 then the text of "hello world" jump instead, caused by the styling change of the Facebook Like Button. Also, due to this, if you look at the CPU graph using the Task Manager on Windows, you will see the CPU going up to 100%, and down, every 2 seconds or so. (I am using VirtualBox 4.0.4 on a Macbook Pro (2 years old), emulating 2 processors running XP, and IE 8 using IE 7 Compatibility mode) Has anyone seen this and know why the jumping? And any workaround or fix? Update : if I use Fiddler to view the net traffic, it seems like it is roloading the page every second on the clock, so if you are viewing the page on jsfiddle.net, it will refresh from fiddle.jshell.net, and if you put the HTML code in your webpage on www.foo.com, you will see the page refreshing every second fetching www.foo.com/?fb_xd_fragment Update : running this in Windows 7's Virtual PC, emulating a machine with 1GB of RAM, the VPC will start up having about 820MB free (unused), and our page loads up, will be about 775MB free, and then every second, a few MB is eaten away, until Windows XP on the VPC needs to increase virtual memory by increasing the page file, and IE 7 stops responding at last.
