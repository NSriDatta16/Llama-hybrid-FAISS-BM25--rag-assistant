Assuming you mean in a SQL database, then in your retrieval SQL, you can generally add e.g. WHERE (MyField AND 16) = 16, WHERE (MyField AND 24) = 24 etc. However, note that if you're trying to optimise such retrievals, and the number of rows typically matching a query is much smaller than the total number of rows, then this probably isn't a very good way to represent this data. In that case, it would be better to have a separate "ProductStore" table that contains (ProductID, StoreID) pairs representing this information (and indexed on StoreID).
