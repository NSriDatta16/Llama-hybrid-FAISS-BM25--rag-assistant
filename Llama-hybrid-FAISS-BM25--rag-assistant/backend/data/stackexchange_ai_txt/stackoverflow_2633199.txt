How to change proxy settings while using Watin?

I am using Watin mostly to automate thing I do by hand. Sometimes, I need to change proxy. To do this, I have to set up IE to use a local proxy all the time (listens locally and forwards to a remote porxy), and then by hand change the settings of that program each time I need to use another proxy. This is not an elegant solution! It may work, but it is not nice. So, my question is, how do I change programmatically IE settings while using Watin? I code in VB.NET. Thank you
