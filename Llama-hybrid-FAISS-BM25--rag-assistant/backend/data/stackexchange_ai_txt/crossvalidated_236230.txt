max pooling layer and number of feature channels

When reading some deep learning papers, which sometimes mentioned that max-pooling layer for downsampling can also be used for increasing the number of feature channels(maps). This confused me a lot. It looks to me the max-pooling layer can down sample the size, but should keep the number of original feature maps.
