It seems that the UserControl SelectablePicture needs to be serialized, because it is used in a Collection. So you were near from the solution with the attribut [Serializable()]. But you'd better implement the ISerializable interface in your UserControl SelectablePicture public partial class SelectablePicture : UserControl, ISerializable { #region ISerializable Membres public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) { ... } #endregion } This is the first step to solve your problem. With that you souldn't have the error message when you drag-drop your UserControl. But now you have to manage the serialization. If anyone knows why serialization is needed, I'm interested.
