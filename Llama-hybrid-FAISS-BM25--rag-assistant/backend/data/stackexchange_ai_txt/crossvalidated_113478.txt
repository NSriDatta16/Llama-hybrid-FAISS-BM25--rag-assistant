Apache Spark and specifically its component MLlib looks like exactly what you are looking for. MLlib contains implementations for classification, regression, dimensionality reduction etc. You can program in Scala,Java and Python. Its basically a very fast distributed computing framework that can be run in an Hadoop cluster. For development purposes, you can easily run it in standalone mode (without Hadoop) on your local machine too. Check out the MLlib guide here : https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html
