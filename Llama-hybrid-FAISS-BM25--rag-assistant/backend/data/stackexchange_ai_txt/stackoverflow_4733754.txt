How long for an app to be approved for Amazon AppStore?

What is the average time it takes for a application to be reviewed by the Amazon AppStore ? (small, non-controversial, quality application, popular on the Android Market) I know it is variable, so rough figures (3 days? 3 weeks? 3 months?) of minimum/maximum would be extremely helpful, I am just looking for some real-world examples.
