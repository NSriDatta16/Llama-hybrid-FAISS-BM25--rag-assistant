In deep learning, one iteration usually means update the parameters with the gradients for one step. Let me give you an example to explain the training process. Suppose we have a dataset with 10,000 dataset, and we choose a mini batch size of 100. Thus, for each epoch, we have 10000/100=100 iterations. To train a model, you can set a fixed number of epochs or training until the model satisfies a convergence criterion. Say you want to train for a total of 10 epochs, that means you are going to the update the model for a total of 10*100 times. With the above being said, one iteration for DQN update means update with one gradient step. Hope this helps.
