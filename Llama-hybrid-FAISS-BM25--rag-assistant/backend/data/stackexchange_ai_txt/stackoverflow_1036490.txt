You may also want to look into Fragment Cache Docs Which allow you to do this: 30.minutes) do %> ... Controller unless fragment_exist?("recent_posts") @posts = Post.find(:all, :limit=>20, :order=>"updated_at DESC") end Although I admit the issue of DRY still rears its head needing the name of the key in two places. I usually do this similar to how Lars suggested but it really depends on taste. Other developers I know stick with checking fragment exist. Update: If you look at the fragment docs, you can see how it gets rid of needing the view prefix: # File vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/caching/fragments.rb, line 33 def fragment_cache_key(key) ActiveSupport::Cache.expand_cache_key(key.is_a?(Hash) ? url_for(key).split("://").last : key, :views) end
