Programmatically add Bundle Products in Magento, using the SKU / ID of Simple Items

I have some simple catalog products in Magento, so I have their SKUs & IDs. Now I want to create a Bundled product using the array elements "bundle_options" & "bundle_selections" of the Bundle Items, which are used by the Magento Admin coding in its Observer Class. Also in the Observer class, there are method calls of two functions " setBundleOptionsData() " & " setBundleSelectionsData() ", for whose I am not able to find any function definition. Please any professional post here, because I need some proper way of doing this thing. If it needs, overriding modules or using events, I will do, but I need really professional help. Thanks in advance. Edit:- Regarding the two methods mentioned above " setBundleOptionsData() " & " setBundleSelectionsData() ", what I'm almost certain is that they are using some sort of PHP magic methods, but I don't know where the main logic of these magic methods are written? Please anybody provide some correct answer. Any help is greatly appreciated.
