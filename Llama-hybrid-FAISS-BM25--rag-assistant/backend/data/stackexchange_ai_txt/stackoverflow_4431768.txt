Marijus, I'd recommend you to re-think the algorithm, that's a very weird way of solving the problem. It's much simpler, use the function max , a single iteration (a generator expression , for example), and try to do it without temporal variables. It can be elegantly solved in just 2/3 lines (in fact, you could do it with a single line, but the abstraction of the product function, for example, would be advisable, as you will use it in other Euler problems)
