Pairwise z-test for evaluating classification accuracy

I'm fairly new to use of statistics in Remote Sensing, however I have seen the use of pairwise z-tests in several studies in assessing the accuracy of different classification techniques. I have three classification techniques (MLC, SAM and SVM) employed using two different dimensionality reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis and Minimum Noise Fraction transform). I therefore have six Kappa statistics, one for each classification using each dimensionality reduction technique and would simply like to test for a statistical significance between them. e.g MLC classification of PCA = 0.7, SAM classification of PCA = 0.6, SVM classification of PCA = 0.8, MLC classification of MNF = 0.7 etc Can i use the standard Z-statistical test to statistically assess the difference between the kappa coefficients? Thanks
