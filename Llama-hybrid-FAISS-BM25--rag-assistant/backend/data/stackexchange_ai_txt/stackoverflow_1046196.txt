Don't know OCJ4 in detail but I used the Thread approach and a java.util.Timer approach to perform some task in a Tomcat based application. In Java 5+ there is an option to use one of the Executor services (Sheduled, Priority). I don't know about the onTimeout but you could pass parameters around in the session itself, the app context or in a static variable (discouraged would some say). But the name tells me it is invoked when the user's session times out and you want to do some cleanup.
