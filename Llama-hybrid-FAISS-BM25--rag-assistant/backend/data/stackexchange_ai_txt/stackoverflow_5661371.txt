Retrieve >901 rows from SQL Server 2008 linked server to Active Directory

In SQL Server 2008 (version 10.0.4000) I have created a linked server to an Active Directory server. This query: select TOP 901 * from openquery(adsisca, ' select givenName, sn, sAMAccountName from ''LDAP://10.1.2.3:389'' where objectCategory = ''Person'' and objectClass = ''InetOrgPerson'' ') works. However changing the query and trying to retrieve 902 rows does not : select TOP 902 * from openquery(adsisca, ' select givenName, sn, sAMAccountName from ''LDAP://10.1.2.3:389'' where objectCategory = ''Person'' and objectClass = ''InetOrgPerson'' ') The error is: Msg 7330, Level 16, State 2, Line 1 Cannot fetch a row from OLE DB provider "ADSDSOObject" for linked server "adsisca". I've found other instances of people discussing the same problem on forums and they never fixed it, just worked around it writing multiple views and union'ing them together for example. Is there a more elegant fix, is there a setting I can change somewhere to retrieve more than 901 rows?
