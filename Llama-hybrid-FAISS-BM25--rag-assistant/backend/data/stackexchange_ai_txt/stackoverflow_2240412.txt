I found an inelegant solution to the problem by absolutely positioning a transparent div over the input fields and having the div's z-index decrease when they are clicked. At the same time I focus on the input field so the div is virtually invisible to the user. I would still prefer a more elegant fix if anyone has any suggestions.
