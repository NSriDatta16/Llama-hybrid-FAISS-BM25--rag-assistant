The exact way it's stored depends on the format; there are heaps of different GIS formats. GDAL is an excellent free library for reading (almost) all of them. Typically roads will be stored in the file as a "lines layer", that is a set of polylines with attached metadata. So each road will have a series of vertices, and depending on the quality of your data it will hopefully have information such as whether they're one-way or not, speed estimates and some sort of connection id. Yes, they're normally converted to a directed graph for solving. Edge weights may be distance or, more usefully, the time taken to travel that edge. Solving quickly is a tradeoff between precomputation and storage space (an embedded device may necessitate a different choice here to a PC). There are some very interesting algorithms out there for doing that.
