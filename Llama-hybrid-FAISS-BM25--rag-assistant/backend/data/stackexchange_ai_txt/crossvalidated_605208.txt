Measurement of indipendent variables for binary logistic regression

I want to run a binary logistic regression to understanding (modeling) factors affecting nest-site selection in a bird species..I measured 32 presence points and 64 absence points. Instead of measuring random points as absence points, I measured points where I guessed the bird could build a nest. Is this measurement method correct?
