What is the influence of initial state in sequence generated from a markov chain?

For thousands of item, I have observations about their state (a letter) for 9 timestep. From that, I build a transition matrix ( RotationMatrix by couting their occurence) and used the markovchain package in R to build a chain, then simulate a sequence of "observation" from it, then fitting a new chain onto the sequence and extracting the "simulated transition matrix". LetterList My goal is to have THE transition probability for each LETTER to any other LETTER. What is the influence of the initial state t0 in the simulated sequence and the chain estimated from it ? Should I run the markovchain several times with each LETTER as initial state? And then using the corresponding line (corresponding letter from initial state) in the transition matrix ? Thanks in advance, Sarah
