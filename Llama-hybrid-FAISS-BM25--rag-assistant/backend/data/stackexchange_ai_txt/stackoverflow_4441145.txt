What I think you may want is an ArrayList instead of an array. This will allow you do to: ArrayList arr = new ArrayList (20); System.out.println(arr.size()); The output will be 0 . Then, you can add things to the list, and it will keep track of the count for you. (It will also grow the size of the backing storage as you need as well.)
