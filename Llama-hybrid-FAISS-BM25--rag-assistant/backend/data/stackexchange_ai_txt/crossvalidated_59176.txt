Dummy variables for time series

I'm a new user on R. I'm stuck on my times series research currently with the some questions. Not sure anyone can help me. Dummy variable. I wanted to add more than 1 dummy variable in the model. But, I realized that the results unchanged after I put additional dummy variables. I have no idea why this happens. I provided my R code as below. Hopefully someone can advise me. R-Code: xreg Define dummy variable. How can I define my dummy variable if the outlier is lower value? If I define as "Dummy 1", my result will skew to higher point which I think is wrong. Any comments? Example: ID Sales Dummy 1 1 1800 0 2 2000 0 3 1500 0 4 500 1 5 1800 0 6 1600 0
