jQuery empty()/remove() makes page jump

I have a monitoring website which shows "who is logged in" and their "state" (online/away/etc.). They are basically wrapped near the bottom of my page with: So all "agents" get into the div with the class "agent_telecaster_container". I append as many divs as I need with: for (nameAgent in supervisionagents.group[0].agent) { //$("#agentenstatuus").append(' '+nameAgent+' '); counter++; if (supervisionagents.group[0].agent[nameAgent].stateCurrent.description == "idle") { $(".agent_telecaster_container").append(' &nbsp;' + nameAgent + ' '); } Which gets called over and over again. What I need is to "clear" the with its content because it can be that every second someone gets offline or online. So far this can be possible with a simple: $('.agent_telecaster_container').empty() / .remove(); But what then happens is that if I move my view / scrollbar to view some things underneath that table, with every reload (every sec.) it jumps back to this . I guess this happens because of the remove / empty and this element gets deleted but new content gets in. Has anybody any idea on how to prevent the jumping? :/
