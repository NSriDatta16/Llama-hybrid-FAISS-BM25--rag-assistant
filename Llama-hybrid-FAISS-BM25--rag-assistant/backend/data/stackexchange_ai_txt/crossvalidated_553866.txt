Is it wrong to multiply the average number of occurences for a single period by the desired number of periods, to get an overall average?

I'm working on a stats problem and I want to know if this is bad practice. (If it's reasonable, it'll save me a ton of time coding a different solution.) During a day, an average of 3 events occur. If I want to know the average number of events in some number of days (for a Poisson distribution) can I just multiply the average number of occurrences by the desired number of days to get an overall average? The events are independent. So, for two days the average number of occurrences is 6, for three days it's 9 etc.
