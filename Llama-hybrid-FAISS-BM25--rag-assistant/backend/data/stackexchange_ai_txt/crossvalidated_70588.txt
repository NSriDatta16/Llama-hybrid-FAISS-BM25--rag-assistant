One of the main applications of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality when there are many variables. So yes, you should use all of the variables. I routinely apply PCA to tens of thousands of variables (gene expression data) and it works very well. What can happen is that when analysing PCA you will have to look into more than the first two or three components. Often, the factor that you would like to understand does not contribute to the majority of variance and for example you will see nice clustering of your samples in the fifth or tenth component (yes, I have seen cases like this).
