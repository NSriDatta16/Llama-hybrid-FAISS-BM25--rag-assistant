css position question: layers with z-index?

hey guys, i have a probably rather simpel problem: my website has two layers: 1) a drag&drop navigation on top which should be positioned absolute, so scrolling doesn't affect the bars. 2) a content area in the back behind the navigation which should be scrollable. you can see what i mean right here: http://jsfiddle.net/Pghqv/ however now, i cannot click links in my content-area in the back. any ideas or solutions how i can still have the same position result and the links in the back are working? thank you very much.
