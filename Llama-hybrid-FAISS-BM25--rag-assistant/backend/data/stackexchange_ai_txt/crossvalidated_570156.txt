There isn't an accepted answer to this post yet so I will throw in my two cents. Since revenue is supported on the positive reals, you're going to need a likelihood which respects this property. The gamma likelihood is often used in financial and insurance applications, making it a good initial model. The problem is that revenue (especially revenue) can be long tailed, making the gamma potentially inappropriate. This model mispecification may not matter if the effect of the variant is sufficiently large, because after all you're not interested in making probabilistic statements about the revenue, you just want to know if there are differences in the expected revenue. The gamma distirbution also has a family of conjugate priors you could potentially use, however I think there may be more suitable means of analysis which may or may not be Bayesian. Generally this is moving towards regression territory. If the groups are defined by pre-exposure characteristics, it might be beneficial to use those to explain away variation in the outcome. Depending on what you're adjusting for, you could simply do a gamma regression (or use some other likelihood) and use a binary indicator for exposure. However, we are veering away from conjugate prior territory, and this means you'd likely need to use something like Stan, PyMC, or similar to perform the analysis.
