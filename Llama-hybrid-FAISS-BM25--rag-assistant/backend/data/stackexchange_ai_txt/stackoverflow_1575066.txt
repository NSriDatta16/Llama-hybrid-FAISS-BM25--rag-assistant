How do I data mine text?

Here's the problem. I have a bunch of large text files with paragraphs and paragraphs of written matter. Each para contains references to a few people (names), and documents a few topics (places, objects). How do I data mine this pile to assemble some categorised library? ... in general, 2 things. I don't know what I'm looking for, so I need a program to get the most used words/multiple words ("Jacob Smith" or "bluewater inn" or "arrow"). Then knowing the keywords, I need a program to help me search for related paras, then sort and refine results (manually by hand).
