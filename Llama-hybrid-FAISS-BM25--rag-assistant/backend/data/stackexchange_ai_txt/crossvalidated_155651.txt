What is the correct method for "standardising" scores -1 to +1 (ideally in R)?

I have a dataset 3,270 rows long of news stories DOWNLOAD HERE from Mega . For each story I have calculated a basic sentiment score for the title, description and body texts (which is just a simple positive words - negative words). BUT this isn't taking account of the number of words in the text being analysed so consequently the body scores vary a LOT more than say the title. This makes plotting a real pain. What I want is for the title, description and body a score that sits on the scale -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive) where 0 is a neutral sentiment. I suspect some sort of weighted average is the right approach but i) is this the right thing and ii) how does one do that in R for the three scores needed? Can anyone help please?
