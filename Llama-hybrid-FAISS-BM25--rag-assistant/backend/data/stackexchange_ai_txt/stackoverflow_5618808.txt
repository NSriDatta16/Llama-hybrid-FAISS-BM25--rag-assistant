You want to look for a space-filling-curve, or a spatial index, for example a hilbert curve or a z-curve. It recursivley subdivide the surface into tiles and reduce the 2d problem into a 1d problem but it is basically a reordering of the tiles. You want to look for Nick's spatial index quadtree hilbert-curve blog.
