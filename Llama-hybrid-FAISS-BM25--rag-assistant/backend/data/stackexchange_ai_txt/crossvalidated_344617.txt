Image processing is now dominated by the application of convolutional neural networks. Introduction of convolutional and pooling units to our network structure allows us reduce the number of parameters in a large network and take advantage of data structure. Pooling is a simple dimensionality reduction technique that is almost always used in combination with convolutional layers in CNNs. A pooling layer is defined by a size and a stride.
