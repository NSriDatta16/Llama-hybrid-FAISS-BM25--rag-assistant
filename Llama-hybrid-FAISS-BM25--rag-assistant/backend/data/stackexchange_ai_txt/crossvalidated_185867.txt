MAPE is Mean Absolute Percent Error. It makes sense to compare two models on their MAPE values. Since the errors are averaged out and it gives a measure of the overall model performance. Ideally you should be comparing two models on the MAPE value and not two predictions. When it comes to individual predictions higher the percentage error worse the prediction. eg: Case 1: Real - $40,000 Pred - $39,000 Dev- $1000 PE - 2.5% Case 2: Real - $2,000 Pred - $1,000 Dev- $1000 PE - 50% The absolute deviations are the same ($1000). It makes a bigger business impact if your predictions are off by $1000 in the second case than in the first.
