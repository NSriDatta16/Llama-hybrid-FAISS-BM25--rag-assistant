What is the difference between fasttext and DANs in document classification?

I came across two interesting papers that describe promising approaches for document classification using word embedding. 1. The fasttext algorithm Described in the paper Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification here . (With further explanation here ). 2. DANs Described in the paper Deep Unordered Composition Rivals Syntactic Methods for Text Classification here . Question: What is the difference between both approaches? Are they essentially the same as they both seem to average word embedding and pass it through an MLP or am I missing something crucial?
