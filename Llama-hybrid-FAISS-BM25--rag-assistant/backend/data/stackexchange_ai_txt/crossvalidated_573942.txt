Biased logistic regression in pytorch

My model has decently high AUC=90%, but is biased, underestimating the probability $y=1$ . This is systematic across some of the input features as well. How can I nudge the bias term, or otherwise address this issue? I am surprised that the model ends up being biased, despite it having an intercept (bias term). My dataset is very unbalanced, only 3% positives (1s) vs 97% 0s. But in y_hat, the number of 1s is closer to 2.5%.
