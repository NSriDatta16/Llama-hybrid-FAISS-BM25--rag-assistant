You can't really have this done between two untrusted Erlang node. That secret cookie is the only security measure existing between nodes. You will need to roll out your own protocol, even if it's just straight HTTP. What you could do from that point on is either send a BEAM file over the network, or just send the binary data contained inside one. You can then load the module by calling code:load_file/1 for the BEAM, or code:load_binary/3 for the binary data. This all sounds relatively brittle to me though. A repository, as suggested by Roberto Aloi would likely be the best idea.
