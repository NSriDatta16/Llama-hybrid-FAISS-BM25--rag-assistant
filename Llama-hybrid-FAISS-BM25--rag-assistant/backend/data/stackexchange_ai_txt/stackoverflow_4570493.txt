I thought Isolatedstorage is like notepad of windowsphone where i can store some data but not initially values. maybe my explanation was very unclear. simply a sample, I want to set my datepicker initially take 1 day later than today. I did that first just like this private void PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { dtpDate.Value = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1); } but then I realized if user tries to change datapickers value, it causes page loaded again and it takes inital value. secondly, I learnt I should use Application_Launching event in app.xaml but I couldnt figure out how to set this below from app.xaml dtpDate.Value = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1); thanks for your help
