Your mem fragmentation is largely due to the data structures you use and your memory manager. You can usually assume any lib you want to use will have lots of memory fragmentation. To completely stop it you need to use data structures that minimize these issues and try to avoid allocating and deallocating data uneccessarily and possibly tackle memory manager itself.
