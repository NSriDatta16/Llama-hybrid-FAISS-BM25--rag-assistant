Actually, there is a priori always a metric space whose distances can be used to model an autocovariance structure. In time series, the metric space is time , one-dimensional anisotropic . In your cross section, you can thus wonder in which metric space your values may be more or less close to each other. E.g. geographical ? Sociological ? In the one-dimensional space of ages ? of incomes ? Once the metric space is identified (on a knowledge-driven fashion), you can create your spatial weight matrix and use it to derive $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$.
