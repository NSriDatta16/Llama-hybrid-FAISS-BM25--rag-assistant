CCA has inconsistent nomenclature; there are a few things that I saw being called loadings: variable weights or parameters that multiply your data and create the canonical variates. Analogous to beta^hat in linear regression, or just weights machine learning algorithms. This is probably what sci-kit learn's cca.x_loadings_ is. You can check if X * x_loadings = X^hat to confirm this, or read the docs. Pearson's correlation between your X variables and X canonical variates (vice versa for Y). IMO this one is correct, but don't be surprised to see other uses. Pearson's correlation between your X variables and Y canonical variates (or vice versa), also called cross-loadings. canonical variates themselves Another possibility is that you just calculated it wrong by using columns instead of rows or the first row instead of the last row or something like that. I am not saying you did, but it's easy to make mistakes like that in similar problems
