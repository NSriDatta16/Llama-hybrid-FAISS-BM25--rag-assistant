How can I force invalidation of a running Cocoa program without additional custom code?

I have multiple custom NSViews in my Cocoa program. I am looking for a way to force them to invalidate without having to add additional code while the program is running. If I were doing this with on Windows with the .NET framework, I would just drag part of my program offscreen and drag back on again. Areas that was offscreen get invalidated when they come back on screen. I haven't figure out how to do this with Cocoa - OSX.
