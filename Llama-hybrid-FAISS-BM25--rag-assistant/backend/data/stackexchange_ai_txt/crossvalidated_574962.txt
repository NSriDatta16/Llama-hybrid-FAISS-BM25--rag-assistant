Restrict output range of a neuron based on output of other neurons

I have a neural network with three output neurons $X_1$ , $X_2$ and $X_3$ with output range in [-1, 1]. I have many training data split in 80:20 ratio between training & testing sets. While looking at the output of the neural network, I noticed a big thing that the neural network haven't learned. There is a restriction in the output as $X_1 . I found that only with training, I can't achieve this restriction. Is there a recommended way theoretically or using Keras library to tell the neural network about this restriction.
