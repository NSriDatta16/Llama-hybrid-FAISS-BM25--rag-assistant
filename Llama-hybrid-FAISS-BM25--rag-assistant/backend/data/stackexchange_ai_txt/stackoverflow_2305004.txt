Subscripts vs. Pointers Right now the code is written with a hybrid approach that uses some subscripting and some pointer addressing. It's possible that if you rewrote this loop to work entirely with subscripts instead of the current hybrid addressing, then it would be easier to understand. For that matter, it could be written to use entirely pointers with no subscripts. I'm not complaining about the current organization which looks just fine, I'm just saying that it might shed some light on the implementation to see it done both ways in pure form. But to answer your question, keep in mind that the list is always in the same location, it's just that elements have their values swapped. So the beginning of the list is always in the same place, but it doesn't always have the same contents. It's kind of nice that you have such an object-oriented picture embedded in your mind but in this case it is perhaps not serving you so perfectly well. Ultimately, data structures are just arrays of bits at specific addresses...
