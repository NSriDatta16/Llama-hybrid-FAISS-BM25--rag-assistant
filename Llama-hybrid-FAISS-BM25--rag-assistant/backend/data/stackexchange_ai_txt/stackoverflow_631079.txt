I hate to tell you this, but the most important attribute is their Communication ability; hands down. If they can't communicate well they can't remove road blocks, and they can't translate between the stakeholders and the doers. Communication is shortly followed by organisation/planning ability and tool knowledge; and of course by domain knowledge (B.S. detector, and a general understanding of the project without having to ask... what's that all the time.) Without these three things, you are at a disadvantage. So, I agree with Joel, that having a background in programming is essential for a Project Manager/ Program Manager - especially with intangible things like software. However, do you have to have 10 or 15 years experience? No. a couple years on the floor should clue you in enough.
