i was using time series for N=5 and the basic time series can't be use to make a forecast, so i use the bootstrapping of the oruginal data. we can make a 100, 300, 500, or 1000 resampling from the original data, so the resampling data we can use it to forecast the future value, if you find the convergen in each resampling from 100 - 1000, you can use the methode.
