Xcode 4 says "finished running " on the targeted device -- Nothing happens

The app neither installs nor runs on my device. All provisioning profiles are up to date. I've already tried deleting and re-installing them. The status bar shows that Xcode is building my project, then it says running my project on , then it says "finished running ." Throughout this entire period, the iPod screen stays black. The iPod is being detected in the Organizer and I don't see anything wrong with its configuration. Everything was working perfectly just a couple days ago with Xcode 3. It doesn't work on the simulator, but it may be important to note that in the simulator it appears to get stuck on "Attaching to " and the simulator refuses to start.
