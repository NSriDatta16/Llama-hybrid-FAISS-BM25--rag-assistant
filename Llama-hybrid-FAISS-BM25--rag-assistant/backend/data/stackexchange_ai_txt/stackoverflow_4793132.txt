Don't get the value from the column in the grid, get the value from the actual datarow that populates the gridrow. This way you can avoid all the magic strings etc. There's a little bit of casting to be done because the [Type]DataRow is hidden inside a DataView that's attached to the grid, but it is a more elegant approach (and far less brittle in case of future changes) if you integrate it nicely into your code than relying on magic strings. Here's an old blog post of mine that describes in detail how to do it: http://koder.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/getting-data-from-a-winforms-datagridview/ UPDATE You've mentioned that you're using Northwind and that you've "simply dragged the Products table to the form", so I'm guessing this isn't a mission-critical piece of software, but for the benefit of other people reading, I just wanted to suggest that this wouldn't be a typical approach any more in a real application. Typically these days we'd consider having a Domain Model , perhaps using an ORM to obtain our Domain Objects from the data store (of course datasets aren't a real ORM), then possibly using things like MVVM to build data structures optimised for binding to UI elements from those Domain Objects. Using this approach, because you have the actual data to hand in your ViewModel, you can calculate such rules as colours etc from the real data, and the UI simply displays the results of applying those business rules.
