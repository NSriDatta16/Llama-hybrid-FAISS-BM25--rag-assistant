Indeed, there seems no good explanation in a single place. The best is to read the articles from where it comes: The original AlexNet article explains a bit in Section 3.3: Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton, ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, NIPS 2012. pdf The exact way of doing this was proposed in (but not much extra info here): Kevin Jarrett, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Marcâ€™Aurelio Ranzato and Yann LeCun, What is the best Multi-Stage Architecture for Object Recognition?, ICCV 2009. pdf It was inspired by computational neuroscience: S. Lyu and E. Simoncelli. Nonlinear image representation using divisive normalization. CVPR 2008. pdf . This paper goes deeper into the math, and is in accordance with the answer of seanv507. [24] N. Pinto, D. D. Cox, and J. J. DiCarlo. Why is real-world vi- sual object recognition hard? PLoS Computational Biology, 2008.
