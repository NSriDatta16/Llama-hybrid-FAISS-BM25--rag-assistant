Here is my 2 cents: SQL server does not scale well. We attempted to use SQL server to store financial data in real time (i.e. prices ticks coming in for 100 symbols). It worked perfectly for the first 2 weeks - then it went slower and slower as the database size increased, and finally ground to a halt, too slow to insert each price as it was received. We tried to work around it by moving data from the active database to offline storage every night, but ultimately the project was abandoned as it just didn't work. Bottom line: if you're planning on storing a lot of data ( >1GB) you need something that scales properly, and that probably means a column database.
