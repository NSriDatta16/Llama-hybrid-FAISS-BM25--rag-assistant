Pre to Post Repeated measures for categorical dependent variable and more than one independent variables both continues and catgorical

I am doing Prenatal (before delivery) and Postnatal (after delivery) depression assessment (2 time points). Dependent variable is Depressed/Non depressed mother on a measure of depression. When as there a number of predictor variables both continues and categorical in nature. Clearly speaking I am using 2 questionnaires at 2 time points: i) dependent variable is dichotomous, ii) dependent variable has continuous predictors. Can i use Generalized estimating equation? What exactly constitutes repeated measures logistic regression?
