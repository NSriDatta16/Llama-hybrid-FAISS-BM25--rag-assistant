Should this work? private List t=new ArrayList(); t.set(2,"test"); No it shouldn't. A List doesn't automagically grow if you call set with a position that is beyond the end of the list. (See the javadoc .) If you want to do that kind of thing you have to fill the List with null elements first; e.g. private List t=new ArrayList(); for (int i = 0; i But I'd also like to reiterate the point that various other answers have made. You should write a class and do this in a type-safe fashion. Stuffing things into an Object[] or List ... and hoping that you get the indexes and types right ... gives you fragile code. It is bad practice .
