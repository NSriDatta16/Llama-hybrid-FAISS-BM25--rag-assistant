I have had seen a similar issue caused by an application which installed a clipboard changed hook ( SetClipboardViewer ) but later hung. Because it wasn't passing on WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD messages, eventually the clipboard simply stopped operating. Even Windows Explorer drag and drop stopped working. I suggest that next time this happens to you, you go through all non-base-Windows applications and kill them off, one by one, until the clipboard starts working again. Perhaps use Process Explorer to make sure you're getting them all.
