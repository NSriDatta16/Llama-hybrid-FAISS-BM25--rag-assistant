For the first two steps regular OLE automation using the Outlook2000.pas unit that comes bundled with Delphi should work fine though you might want to take a look at Dmitry Streblechenko's Redemption library: http://dimastr.com/redemption/ which simplifies many of the more low-level (Extended-)MAPI tasks significantly. For intercepting the sent message you should create an instance of TItems and connect it to the folder reference you could get from OutlookApplication.Session.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderSentMail) . You can then assign an event handler to its OnItemAdd event. For drag & drop from Outlook into your application you can take a look at Anders Melanders excellent (and free) Drag&Drop library (includes examples for interacting with Outlook): http://melander.dk/delphi/dragdrop/
