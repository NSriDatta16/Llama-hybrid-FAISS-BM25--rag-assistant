Cache and Session can lead to sluggish behaviour, but sometimes they're the right solutions: the rule of right tool for right job applies. Personally I've often created collections in pseudo-static singletons for the kind of role you describe (typically to avoid I/O overheads like storing a compiled xslttransform), but it's very important to keep in mind that that kind of cache is fragile, and design for it to A). filewatch or otherwise monitor what it's supposed to cache where appropriate and B). recreate/populate itself with use - it should expect to get flushed frequently. Essentially I recommend it as a performance crutch, but don't rely on it for anything requiring real persistence.
