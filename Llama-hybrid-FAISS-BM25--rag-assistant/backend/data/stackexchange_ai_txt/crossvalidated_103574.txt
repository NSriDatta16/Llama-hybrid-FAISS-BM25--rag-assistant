How to measure dispersion of a single point within a group of points

Lets say you are given a set of $n$ points and for each one, you want to get a measure of dispersion of its closest $d$ points. So a point far away from others will have a large measure of dispersion while points in a cluster have a low measure of dispersion. Anyone know which statistic would be useful for this? I feel like this is something similar to standard deviation but standard deviation uses an average instead of just that single element. Would summing the distance differences between that single point and its $d$ closest points work?
