It can't work within your constraints, I'm afraid. Internet Explorer 6 and previous only detects hover over an anchor, so you need to drop a requirement for it to work, either: Only has to work in IE7 and newer (in which case Loadaveragezero's solution will work) Can use anchors (in which case Eric's solution will work) Can use Javascript (in which case there are many ways to get hovering pre-IE7)
