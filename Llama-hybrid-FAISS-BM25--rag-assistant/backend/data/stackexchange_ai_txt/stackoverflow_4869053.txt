Is there a way to "link" several elements?

Suppose I have 4 visible divs: - 2 on top - 2 on the bottom, wrapped in a container and 1 hidden div. When a mouse hover over a bottom div it changes its color and changes color of one of the top divs. When user clicks on a bottom div the hidden div appears and stays on the screen until mouse leave the container. I use if statements to change color of divs, but I'm not sure whether I'm doing this right. Maybe there is a more simple and elegant way to do this. So there are the questions: - Do I have to use if statement here? Maybe there is a way to somehow "link" pairs of elements to reduce the amount of code? - What if I want a top div to stay active while hidden div is visible? Do I need to write additional function with if statements again? Wouldn't that be "do not repeat yourself" rule violation? Code example here: http://jsfiddle.net/Xq9kr
