It appears to me that Desktop$Sessions first needs to be formatted as a time series object using the ts() function. You should try the following and see if that produces more reasonable forecasts: m_tbats = tbats(ts(Desktop$Sessions, frequency=7),seasonal.periods=c(7,365.25)) f_tbats = forecast(m_tbats, h=365) plot(f_tbats)
