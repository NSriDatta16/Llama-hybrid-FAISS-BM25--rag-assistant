The real problem is that this question is misguided. It is not machine learning vs statistics, it is machine learning against real scientific advance. If a machine learning device gives the right predictions 90% of the time but I cannot understand "why", what is the contribution of machine learning to science at large? Imagine if machine learning techniques were used to predict the positions of planets: there would be a lot of smug people thinking that they can accurately predict a number of things with their SVMs, but what would they really know about the problem they have in their hands? Obviously, science does not really advance by numerical predictions, it advances by means of models (mental, mathematical) who let us see far beyond than just numbers.
