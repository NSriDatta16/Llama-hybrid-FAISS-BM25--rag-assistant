Constant conditional correlation (CCC) shows high spikes compared to Dynamic CC (DCC), why?

I have calculated 5 beta factors (beta is defined as the ratio between covariance between two time series and the variance between the one series). When I used CCC with GJR dynamics I get this When calculating with DCC the picture looks very similar just without this extreme spikes of the blue line. I am searching for an explanation. My first guess: The constant correlation matrix is not able to capture breaks in variance and covariance adequately? But this is very high level. Do you have a more detailed idea for this phenomen?
