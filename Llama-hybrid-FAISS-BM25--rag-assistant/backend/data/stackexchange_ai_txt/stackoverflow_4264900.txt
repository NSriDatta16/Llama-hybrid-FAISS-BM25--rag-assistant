Yes: You must switch the user. Try Runtime.getRuntime().exec("sudo -U randeel /usr/bin/wine cmd /c some.vbs"); Note that sudo will ask for a password unless you configure it otherwise. Another, more elegant solution, is to run a little server as randeel which waits for a network connection. It then runs the command and returns the output via the network connection. See the documentation for java.net.Socket .
