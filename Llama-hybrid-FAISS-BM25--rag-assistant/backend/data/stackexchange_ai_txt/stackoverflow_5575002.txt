File Not Found - Where are sound files saved?

I'm following an example app code at http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/index.html Whenever I try to run the code that begins to record audio, it fails saying the file cannot be found. I'm running this with the emulator set to Android 2.1. I'm really trying to find out: 1) Shouldn't the code create the file if it does not exist? 2) Where is it? Stepping through the code says it's at "/sdcard/recordertest.3gp". I can't seem to find that directory anywhere, so that may be the problem as well. Please help!!! Thanks. Applicable code is below: public RecorderTest() { mFileName = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath(); mFileName += "/recordertest.3gp"; } private void startRecording() { mRecorder = new MediaRecorder(); mRecorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC); mRecorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.THREE_GPP); mRecorder.setOutputFile(mFileName); mRecorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AMR_NB); try { mRecorder.prepare(); } catch (IOException e) { Log.e(LOG_TAG, "prepare() failed"); } mRecorder.start(); }
