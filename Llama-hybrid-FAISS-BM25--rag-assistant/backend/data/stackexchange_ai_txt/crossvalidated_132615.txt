Cut off values of the coefficient of variation in determining whether to include/exclude a sample

I'm fairly new to statistics and could use some advice. I have 70 blood serum samples that have had metabolite concentrations tested twice. (Same blood draw, different test dates). I calculated the average, the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation as a percentage for each sample's two measurements. Then I calculated the average %CV of all 70 samples. The average %CV is less than 10%, which according to what I've read is acceptable, but some of the individual %CV's are much higher. In this case you would expect to see some variation between tests, but a large difference would be indicative of some error in handling the specimen. I'm trying to determine a cut off value over which to reject the sample. The %CV's are not normally distributed (according to Shapiro-Wilks) or else I would say + 2 std.dev. Is there a mathematical way to determine an appropriate cut off? Thanks!
