Well, bash is intepreted line by line as it runs and depends on calling a lot of external progs (depending on what you want to do).You often have to use temp files as intermediate storage for result sets. It (shell) was originally designed to talk to the system and automate cmd sequences (shell files). Perl is more like C, it's largely self contained with a huge library of free code and it's compiled , so it runs much faster, eg about 80-90% speed of C, but easier to program (eg variable sizes are dynamic).
