One of the biggest differences between LDA and the other methods is that it's just a machine learning technique for data which are assumed to be normally distributed. That can be great under the case of missing data or truncation where you can use the EM algorithm to maximize likelihoods under very strange and/or interesting circumstances. Caveat emptor because model misspecifications, such as multimodal data, can lead to poor performing predictions where K-means clustering would have done better. Multimodal data can also be accounted for with EM to detect latent variables or clustering in LDA. For instance, suppose you are looking to measure probability of developing a positive diagnosis of AIDS in 5 years based on CD4 count. Suppose further that you don't know the value of a specific biomarker that greatly impacts CD4 counts and is associated with further immunosuppression. CD4 counts under 400 are below lower limit of detection on most affordable assays. The EM algorithm allows us to iteratively calculate the LDA and biomarker assignment and the means and covariance for CD4 for the untruncated DF.
