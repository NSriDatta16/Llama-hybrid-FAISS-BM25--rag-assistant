Need my xgboost model to be more liberal with classifications

I have an xgboost model that predicts the likelihood of a sales lead to close (actually to turn into an "opportunity" which is one step before the close but that's beside the point). The dataset is very imbalanced with the minority class only making up around 15% of the train/test sets. I am getting acceptable f-1 scores (macro avg is 81% which will suffice) but because there are so few leads that close relative to the total leads in our system when I run predictions for our entire database of leads only ~2% of the leads end up getting a probability to close of 50% or greater. The sales leadership will not respond favorably if I go back to them with such a small number regardless of it it's the most accurate portrayal of reality or not. Does anyone have any ideas of what to try to make the model more "liberal" (giving higher probabilities) toward the the minority class? Thanks
