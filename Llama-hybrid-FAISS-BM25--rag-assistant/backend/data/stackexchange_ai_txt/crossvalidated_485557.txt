How to do a weighted mean by certainty?

I would like to calculate the average over a list of many compositions in A, B and C. For example: Comp1{A:0.25, B:0.25, C: 0.5}, Comp2{A:0.35, B:0.15, C: 0.5}, Comp3{A:0.45, B:0.25, C: 0.3} And these compositions are based on different sample-sizes N. For example: N(Comp1)=4, N(Comp2)=1000, N(Comp1)= 100000 Please give me hints how to weight these compositions by their 'certainty'. Ideally this 'certainty' would only depend on N and the degree of freedom and not on the actual composition. Ideally this measure of certainty would go from 0 to 1, where both Comp2 and Comp3 would be rather close to 1, so be weighted rather equal and not by a factor of 100. Ideally I would like to ask for a reputable method. Also I do have a prior of what the composition should be, but I would rather not use it, unless this is mandatory.
