If you have dependencies on thousands of classes, I would suggest you organize those classes into libraries that you can reuse. That way, you can link targets (for testing or otherwise) against a single library, rather than including lots of individual code files. If you're targeting an iOS device you'll need to create static libraries, since dynamic linking to custom libraries is not possible on devices.
