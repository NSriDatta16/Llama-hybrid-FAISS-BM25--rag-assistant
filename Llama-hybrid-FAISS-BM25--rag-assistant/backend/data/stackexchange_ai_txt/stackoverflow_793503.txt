Struts is an entire framework and isn't really going to only be one layer of the typical "three tier" architecture (presentation, application, and data storage). Struts is going to provide you an MVC framework in Java land. You'll be able to better divide your presentation layer, application layer, and data persistance rather than mingle and mash them all together.
