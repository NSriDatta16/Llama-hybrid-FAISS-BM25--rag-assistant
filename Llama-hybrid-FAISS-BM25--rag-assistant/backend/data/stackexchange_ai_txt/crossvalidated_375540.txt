Logistic regression (with dummy variables)

I have some problems with question (a) and (b) of this question. For question (a), would it be correct to simply look at the p-value alone? treatment B is coded as 0, it 'disappears' in the logit equation hence I am confused. My answer is: p=0.04 For question (b), how can I compare the probabilities if treatment B 'disappears' in the equation? Will appreciate any help, thank you!
