Well, a little Googling finds several open-source Java-written spreadsheets, one of which may be suitable for your purposes. One of the questions you might want to answer, maybe edit your post, would be what calculations do you want to perform -- the full set of functionality that Excel provides (or something close) or would the facilities that SQL provides satisfy your requirements ? If so, then you might want to database this. Another question you might clarify is this: are you trying to create an application which like Excel is usable by end-users for specifying calculations ? But, unlike Excel, is based on open-source software and can cope with millions of rows. I don't know about its performance on such large data sets, someone else on SO can probably tell us, but R is very popular (and rightly so) for what you are probably trying to do. My view is that R sits between the average programming languages (say Python) and the average spreadsheet (say Excel) in terms of ease-of-use-by-non-programmers. Your choice of solution may (and certainly ought to) depend on who will be using it.
