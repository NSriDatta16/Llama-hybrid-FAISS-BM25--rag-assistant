Never used Yii and Code Igniter, but i come from CakePHP and now i work on Django, and i enjoy it. I can say that in Python there's a higher test-culture, and Django has superb docs. If you search for Yii and Django on github, you'll find 191 vs. 6176 projects. IMHO Python is orders of magnitude better than PHP, and the average Python code is better than the average PHP code. Your choice should be between Django and Rails or Sinatra, i think. Python community is bigger than Ruby community, instead there are more Rails projects and developers than Django.
