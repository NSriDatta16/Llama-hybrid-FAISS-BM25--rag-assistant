MCMC sampling using deterministic transformation

There are two random variables $X,Y$ with deterministic non-linear surjective and non-injective relationship $y=f(x)$ and I know unnormalized pdf $\hat{p}_y(y)$ . I want to obtain samples $y \sim p(y)$ , but I want to perform sampling in the space of $X$ . The theory says that I have to use variable transformation $p(y)dy = p(x)dx$ , and use $p(f(x))\mathrm{det}(\frac{df}{dx})$ as a sampling objective in MCMC. But will it work with non-injective $f$ , for example $f = x^2$ ? And in general, are there any ways to get rid of the determinant of the Jacobean using MCMC?
