the enemy AI model would have knowledge of the game's rules and change its internal state according to those rules. The game controller(s) provide the AI with knowledge of the external game's state that it can use to decide how it should change its internal state. (What I first wrote here:) The part of the AI that interacts with the game world would be in the controller. The part of the AI that makes decisions as an autonomous agent would be in the model. The controller would update the AI's model with the state it needs to base its decisions on and the controller would also modify the game and render the view based on any changes in the AI model. For a Goomba, the game controller would update the Goomba model with Mario's location (if it's in its sight) and the Goomba model would update itself as to where it intends to move. The controller would then move the Goomba (i.e., update the model's location) if there aren't any obstacles and render the view with the Goomba's new state.
