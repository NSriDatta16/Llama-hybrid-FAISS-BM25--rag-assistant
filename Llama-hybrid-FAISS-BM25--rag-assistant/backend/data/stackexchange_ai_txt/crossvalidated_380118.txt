A simple approach, although not as elegant and rigorous as possible, would be to estimate the probability that there is no rainfall, fit a gamma to the amount of rain conditional that there is rain , and then simulate by only drawing the fitted gamma if the "rain indicator" variable is greater than the cutoff. A more rigorous way would be to set up a hierarchical Bayesian model is something like rstan which reflects this choice.
