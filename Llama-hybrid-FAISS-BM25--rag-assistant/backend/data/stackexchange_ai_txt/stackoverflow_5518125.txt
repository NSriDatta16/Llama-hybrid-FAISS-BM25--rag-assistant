a simpler way would be to add the Photoshop COM .dll to your application via the COM tab. I'm a newbie and I've done this with success. 2 simple methods to run are the PhotoshopWebImageGallery, and the PdfPresentation methods (takes an input folder and an output folder for the resulting pdf presentation. There's also a "doJavaScript" method that takes a string with your JavaScript. If you google Photoshop Javascript Scripting, the manual from Adobe should be one of the first entries. I haven't tried the "doJavaScript" method yet, but I have seen the ImageGallery, and the PdfPresentation methods work! Here are some good links on the topic as it pertains to JavaScript. At Adobe At Rags The fella who runs this site just sent me back an email to some Photoshop Scripting questions I had today! Real good about responding promptly! In theory one should be able to add that Photoshop COM .dll, the "doJavaScript" method, the examples provided and "make something happen". Looks like this is kinda old and you may have it down pat by now! If so share some image sharpening methods!!! Good Luck!
