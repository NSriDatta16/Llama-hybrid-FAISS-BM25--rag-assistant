Here's how you should do it (IPython > v0.11): import IPython IPython.embed() For IPython from IPython.Shell import IPShellEmbed ipshell = IPShellEmbed() ipshell() # this call anywhere in your program will start IPython You should use IPython, the Cadillac of Python REPLs. See http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/reference.html#embedding-ipython From the documentation: It can also be useful in scientific computing situations where it is common to need to do some automatic, computationally intensive part and then stop to look at data, plots, etc. Opening an IPython instance will give you full access to your data and functions, and you can resume program execution once you are done with the interactive part (perhaps to stop again later, as many times as needed).
