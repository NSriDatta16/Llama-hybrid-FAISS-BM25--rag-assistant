Calling unset() in PHP script

Coming from a C/C++ background, I am used to doing my own garbage collection - i.e. freeing resources after using them (i.e. RAII in C++ land). I find myself unsetting (mostly ORM ) variables after using them. Are there any benefits of this habit? I remeber reading somewhere a while back, that unsetting variables marks them for deletion for the attention of PHP's GC - which can help resource usage on the server side - true or false? [Edit] I forgot to mention, I am using PHP 5.3, and also most of the unset() calls I make are in a loop where I am processing several 'heavy' ORM variables
