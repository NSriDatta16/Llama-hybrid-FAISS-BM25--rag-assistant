I don't know which version of sbt you're using, or what project setup you have used, but normally your hw.scala file should be placed in src/main/scala directory for sbt to find it. Also, as synesso remarked, the scala runtime seems to be absent. Normally sbt will just download these when creating a new project. I just tried it using sbt 0.7.3 in a fres project, and this works: $ sbt Project does not exist, create new project?
