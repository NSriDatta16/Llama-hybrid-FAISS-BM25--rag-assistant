How to model such problems of two distributions?

I am studying a modelling problem which is given as: Suppose I have a sphere(empty) and there are some particles that are entering it with Poisson distribution, and it is given that the number of incoming particles is given by: $y_i$~$Poiss(\rho)$. $\rho$ is given as rate of occurrence. Now if the center of sphere is also distributed or moving with Gaussian distribution, then what will be the resulting distribution of number of incoming particles? Also it is given that for this condition the Bayesian estimator of $\rho$ is Gamma distribution(when only Poisson distribution is there), now what is Bayesian estimator of the distribution(where both normal and Poisson are considered) in question? Please also tell me the resource where I can get to know such modelling. PS: I have asked somewhat same question on mathematics stack Exchange site but no answer was provided, and being a member with low reputation, I can't transfer question.
