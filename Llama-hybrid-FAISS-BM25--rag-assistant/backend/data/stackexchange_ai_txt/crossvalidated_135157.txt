There is a package in R called glmnet that can fit a LASSO logistic model for you! This will be more straightforward than the approach you are considering. More precisely, glmnet is a hybrid between LASSO and Ridge regression but you may set a parameter $\alpha=1$ to do a pure LASSO model. Since you are interested in logistic regression you will set family="binomial". You can read more here: http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html#intro
