@marc_s I don't believe one can "almost always" make any one selection among above options. There is a case to support both the solutions. Option #1 Go for this when the entity X is well defined i.e. you know exactly what you need to capture in order to define X. In such a case one single record of X pretty much captures everything an instance of X stands for. Option #2 Go for this when such an entity X can not be completely defined i.e. you dont know what set attributes are required to define it "completely". For e.g. take a example of employee record as mentioned in article "Five simple database design errors you should avoid" [link provided by @marc_s]. Yes!!! you will be tempted to got for Option 1 but if you consider the case of employees working in large organizations, once single record the employee information - both its definition and content is highly dynamic and the combination of option#1 and option#2 required.
