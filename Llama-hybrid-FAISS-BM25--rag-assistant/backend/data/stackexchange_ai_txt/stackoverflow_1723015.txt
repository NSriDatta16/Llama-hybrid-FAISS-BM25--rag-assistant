Check whether two dates contain a given month

My problem is simple... or may be not. I've got a table that contains two dates: StartDate EndDate And I have a constant which is a month. For example: DECLARE @MonthCode AS INT SELECT @MonthCode = 11 /* NOVEMBER */ I need a SINGLE QUERY to find all records whose StartDate and EndDate includes the given month. For example: /* Case 1 */ Aug/10/2009 - Jan/01/2010 /* Case 2 */ Aug/10/2009 - Nov/15/2009 /* Case 3 */ Nov/15/2009 - Jan/01/2010 /* Case 4 */ Nov/15/2009 - Nov/15/2009 /* Case 5 */ Oct/01/2010 - Dec/31/2010 The first and last case need special attention: Both dates are outside November but the cross over it. The following query does not take care of case 1 and 5: WHERE MONTH( StartDate ) = @MonthCode OR MONTH( EndDate ) = @MonthCode The following query also failed because Aug : WHERE MONTH( StartDate ) = @MonthCode OR MONTH( EndDate ) = @MonthCode OR ( MONTH( StartDate )
