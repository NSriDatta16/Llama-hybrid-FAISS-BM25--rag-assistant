Classic ASP - Windows Vista - IIS7 - Permission issue

I've installed II7 + ASP Classic on my Vista business pc as I want to develop my own pctools (automate some boring manual tasks). Unfortunately, every time I try to WRITE into a .txt file I get this error: Path out = C:\Users\Carlos\Storage\bpmbck.txt Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a0046' Permission denied /pctools/cleanfb.asp, line 53 Line 53 contains set fileout = fs.OpenTextFile(pathout, ForWriting) Given that I'm running as an ADMIN and that the target folder is owned by me, I don't understand why this is happening. I've googled the net to find a similar basic problem (write to a text file) but I only find more complex ones (databases, mail, etc..). An can anyone help me, please?
