PHP script works fine until I send it a parameter from HTTPService in Flash Builder 4?

I'm using a PHP script to read an RSS feed in my Flex 4 app. The script works when I put the URL of the feed in the actual script, but I can't get it to work when I try to send the URL as a parameter from a HTTPService in Flex. Here is the HTTPService from Flex 4 that I'm using: http://feeds.feedburner.com/nah_right This is the script that works: But this is what I actually want to use, but it doesn't work (only line 6 is different): Here is the request and response output of the HTTPService from the network monitor in Flash Builder 4 (using the PHP script that doesn't work): Request: POST /proxy.php HTTP/1.1 Host: talk.6te.net User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-length: 97 url=%0A%09%09%09%09%09http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds%2Efeedburner%2Ecom%2Fnah%5Fright%0A%20%20%20%20%09%09%09 Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 10 May 2010 03:23:27 GMT Server: Apache X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.13 Content-Length: 15 Content-Type: text/html malformed I've tried putting the URL in " " in the HTTPService, but that didn't do anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
