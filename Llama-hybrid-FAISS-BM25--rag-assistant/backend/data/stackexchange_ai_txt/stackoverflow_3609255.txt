You need to find the line of code that frame 13 of your stack trace represents. I would hope that you used the "Build and Archive" feature of the recent versions of Xcode. In this case, all you would need to do is drag and drop the crash log to the Xcode Organizer. This will "symbolicate" the crash log, meaning that it will convert the addresses to classes and methods. Once you know the line that caused the error it will (hopefully) be relatively simple to figure out what went wrong. My guess would be memory corruption of some description -- a value you assumed you saved on the first run isn't there or something.
