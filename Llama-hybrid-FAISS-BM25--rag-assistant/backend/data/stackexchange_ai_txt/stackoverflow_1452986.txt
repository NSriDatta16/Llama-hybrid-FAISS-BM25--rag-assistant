There's no one answer. Depends on the business situation. I do agile/XP development, and get the software in a stable and usable state as early as possible. I encourage our clients to get it out there to start getting feedback. This is great, as it always affects how you view the software you are building. And it definitely makes sense if you have the ability to digest the feedback and react to it. But there are marketing situations where you need to hold back. It's naive to think that there's only one way to release software in the modern world. There are risks inherent in releasing early, as you have to be careful to set expectations carefully with your audience, and you simply may not have the ability or inclination to do so. It may be easier to stick with more traditional release cycles. I still believe strongly in early releases, even if they are password protected. They reduce project risk and stress. We know there are no hidden problems with releasing to production, since we've been doing it since day one. And it also helps keep developers out of the hot-seat, since we always have something up and running. Demos and PR moments aren't as stressful as they are just a regular part of the process. So from a software development standpoint I recommend it. From a marketing standpoint... well this is SO and we shouldn't get into that here. :->
