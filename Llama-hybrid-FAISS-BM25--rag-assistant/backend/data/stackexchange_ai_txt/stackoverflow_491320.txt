Found this on another forum All credits go to Matt Baker For future reference to anyone who attempts to run WatiN tests automatically using TeamCity. You must start your build agent using \bin\agent.bat start and NOT as a service. WatiN requires a full UI to execute properly and it doesn't get this environment as a service. I hope this makes it easier for other people!
