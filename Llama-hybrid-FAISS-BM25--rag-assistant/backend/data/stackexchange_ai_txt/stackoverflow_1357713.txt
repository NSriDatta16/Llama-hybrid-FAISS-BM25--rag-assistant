In perlop, just a few paragraphs before the section you quote: Binary "||" performs a short-circuit logical OR operation. That is, if the left operand is true, the right operand is not even evaluated. Scalar or list context propagates down to the right operand if it is evaluated. This doesn't explicitly state that list context does not propagate to the left operand, but the top of perlop states: With very few exceptions, these all operate on scalar values only, not array values. so we can assume that list context propagating to the right operand is the exception to the rule, and the lack of any statement about the context of the left operand implies the general rule applies.
