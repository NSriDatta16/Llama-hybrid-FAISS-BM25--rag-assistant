The question I find a bit odd, because static methods and methods that perform no mutations are two orthogonal classifications of methods. You can have mutating static methods and nonmutating instance methods. For me, it has become more and more natural to combine functional and oo programming; I like instance methods that perform no mutations. Functional programming is easier to understand because it discourages complex mutations; OO programming is easier to understand because the code and the data it operates on are close together. Why choose? Embrace the power of "and"; do both!
