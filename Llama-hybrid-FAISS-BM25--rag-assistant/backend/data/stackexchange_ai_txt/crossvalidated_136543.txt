You are calculating $\overline{(|x_t-x_{t-1}|)}$. But $E(|X_t-X_{t-1}|)$ is not the same thing as $\sigma_X$. If $X_j\stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(6,1)$ then $X_t-X_{t-1}\sim N(0,2)$. So $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(X_t-X_{t-1})\sim N(0,1)$, and the absolute value of that has a $\chi_1$ distribution , with expectation $\sqrt\frac{2}{\pi}$. Consequently $E(|X_t-X_{t-1}|)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\approx 1.128379$ More generally, if $X_t\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ then $E(|X_t-X_{t-1}|)=\frac{2\sigma}{\sqrt{\pi}}\approx 1.128379\sigma$ Check (this is in R): > mean(abs(diff(rnorm(10000000,6,1)))) [1] 1.128571 Pretty close. (I took a bigger sample than 10000 but that won't hurt anything) If you're really getting around $1.25$ I think there must be some mistake in your code. [I just ran a couple of dozen sets of size 10000 and none of the averages were bigger than $1.15$, so I'm not sure how you're getting up around $1.25$. Were you maybe getting $1.\color{red}{1}\color{}25$?]
