Mobile website - how to switch to desktop version

I have a WordPress website ( abetterworldbydesign.com ) which has user-agent detection to redirect mobile websites to a subdirectory. It is using the plugin: WPtap Mobile Detector I want to include a toggle link to switch between the mobile and desktop version. How can I make the site remember that a mobile user has switched to the desktop version and avoid redirecting that user to the mobile version again?
