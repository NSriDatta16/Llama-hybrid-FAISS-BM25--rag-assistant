HTTP is a textual protocol that is very human-readable! Connect to the site using telnet and type in the HTTP requests by hand. This allows you full control over the user-agent string and other associated information. It's also dead simple. When you get this working by hand, you should be able to add this functionality to your app with some very basic socket programming.
