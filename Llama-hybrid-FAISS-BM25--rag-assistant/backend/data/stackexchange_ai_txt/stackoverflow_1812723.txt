Which SCM and Issue tracker for personal work?

I am planning to bring some "peace" (you may call it organization) to the personal work (small projects, etc.) I do at home. I would like to use a SCM and an issue tracker which can capture the commits and show them as changesets etc. automatically. Note that all the above applications are supposed to be for personal usage so would prefer something from FOSS and also they need to be ultra lightweight in terms of the system requirements. What do you recommend? EDIT: Following are some of my doubts/concerns: Git with GitHub looks good. But I am not very comfortable with making my code base public on GitHub . What do you say? Does GitHub provide an issue tracker? I mean, can I open up an issue on GitHub provided issue tracker and commit against that issue? Can I have a local SCM (on my laptop) and use some remote issue tracker like FogBugz ? But I just don't understand how could a remote issue tracker capture my commits. Any idea? UPDATE: I finally went with Mercurial and BitBucket . Working awesome so far!
