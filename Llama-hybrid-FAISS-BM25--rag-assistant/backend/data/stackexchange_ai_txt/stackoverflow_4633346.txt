Best to open many files as you go or all at once

Windows Form Application vb net I have many container files on a hard drive, inside of them are many images. I have to get a particular image by using an ID to do this I have to go trough each of the container files and find the one which has the ID in it then I can retrieve the image. I think I have 3 options: load all the images at start up into memory, some images may or may not be used. as I need each image go through all the container files and open the image into memory. create a dictionary of IDs and what file they are in at start up and then get each image as I need it without have to go through all the container files. Which option is better in that there is less delay between the user asking for the image and the image being shown, but doesn't use too much memory or slow downthe computer (average computer memory of the users who would use thisapplication is about (2-)3-4GB
