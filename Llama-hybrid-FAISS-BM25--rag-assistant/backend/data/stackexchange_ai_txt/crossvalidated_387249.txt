Logistic regression suddenly starts missing

Posting the following issue just in case anyone else has had experience with it and successfully dealt with it. Would appreciate any ideas. I have a logistic regression based model that gave excellent prediction when applied to historical data used to develop it (several '000 data points). r-squared value of approx 50% resulting in a prediction accuracy of 70%+ which is more than adequate for the application. The prediction model was then implemented on live data and gave the same near perfect prediction performance for the next 26 data points and then suddenly started missing by increasing margins with occasional random hits. All the terms in the model are statistically significant with p-values
