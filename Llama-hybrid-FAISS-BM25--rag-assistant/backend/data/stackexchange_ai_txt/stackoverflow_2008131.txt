A simple, repeatable hash from an UInt32 to a UInt16

I have a little problem where need to do a hash of a number of about 10 digits into a number of 6 digits. The hash needs to be deterministic. It's more important that the hash is not resource intensive. For example, say that I have some number, x, like 123456789 I want to write an hash function that gives me a number, y, back like 987654. I'd then like to have a function that takes the x and y as parameters, re-applies the hash on x, and checks that the result is y. It should be difficult to compute possible input values given the hash. My first idea of multiplying pairs of digits led to a lot of duplicate hashed values. I have the feeling that this sort of problem has some kind of elegant solution, but I just can't think of it myself. Can anyone help me out here? Thanks in advance :)
