log4J to log files per thread, but not able to release loggers even when the thread dies

* strong text *I have called getLogger(Unique Identifier ) to create single logger per thread and generated different files based on the thread Id and other unique identifiers using log4j. I generage multiple log files for each request sent to my application, Now even when the thread of requests are executed, ie the thread dies, I am not able to delete the log file associated with that thread. if i try to use logger.shutdown(), it shuts other open threads loggers as well which halts the logging in other files. Please suggest a solution to this.
