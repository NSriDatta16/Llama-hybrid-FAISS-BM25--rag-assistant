Your stopwatch class is fine. However your main method is not. You need to place your label on Form1 and set the label text on an event like click of a button. You can follow this simple steps - Goto the design view of the form in Visual Studio Open the toolbox and drag-drop a label and a button control on the form In the properties window give appropriate names to the controls by editing the Name property double click the button in design view and you will be navigated to its click event in the code view. set the label text in the click event of the button. I googled and found these resources as good starting point to learn winForms http://www.google.co.in/#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=winforms+tutorials&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&fp=98a02fd89f148227
