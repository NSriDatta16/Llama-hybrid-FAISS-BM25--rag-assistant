How would one go about creating one’s own graphics effect in WPF?

I have an Image object in my application which the user can drag around. The object displays an image which is partly transparent, so the window background (which is itself a bitmap) can be seen through it. I want to add a graphics effect to this object. Assume that I already have an algorithm for this effect — that’s not the issue. The issue is how to get this algorithm into WPF. So I tried to look at how DropShadowEffect works, but the implementation displayed in Reflector is empty. I also tried to look at what methods from the abstract classes Effect and ShaderEffect I should override and there doesn’t seem to be anything related to actually rendering an effect. So how do I create my own effect?
