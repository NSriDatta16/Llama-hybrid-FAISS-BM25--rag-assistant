It may not be as "elegant" as the static property provided by the C# plug-in architectures you are used to, but you could provide an exported function in the COM DLL that returns an IPluginInfo. By convention this exported function would have the same name in every plug-in DLL designed to operate in your architecture. The host application would obtain the proc address for the exported function dynamically at runtime then call it to obtain the IPluginInfo interfaced object for that specific plug-in DLL. The mechanics for this could all be encapsulated in a class for your plug-in architecture, hiding the implementation details. It would take very little work to reach a point where your plug-in architecture would be just as convenient to use and code against as the C# infrastructure you are more used to.
