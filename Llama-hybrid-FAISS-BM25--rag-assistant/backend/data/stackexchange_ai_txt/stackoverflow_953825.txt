One way of getting at the data in a low-level and not particularly easy to manipulate manner is to use the DBCC PAGE command as described in a blog post by Paul Randal: http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlserverstorageengine/archive/2006/06/10/625659.aspx You should be able to find the fileid and page number of the first page in the object by querying on sysindexes .. the last time I did this was on SQL Server 7. If the data is in the database, then DBCC page will be able to dump it. pjjH
