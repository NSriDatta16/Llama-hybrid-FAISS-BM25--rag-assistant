How does Visual Studio set sizes for WPF controls?

In visual studio, when dragging a control from the toolbox onto the design area, VS automatic sets width and height of the control with some values. Do you know how it does it? I was suspicious that there were some kind of attributes for the Width and Height properties or even the class itself but could not find anything from reflecting the Button control.
