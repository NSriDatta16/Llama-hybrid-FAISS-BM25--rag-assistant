custom tensorflow layer that inherits another class

I am trying to make my own custom layer in tensorflow which looks like: class custom_LSTM(RNN): # implementation of class where RNN is another class. However, to use this custom layer in model it needs to inherit tf.keras.layers.Layer . I am creating models using tf.keras . Any idea how do I solve this problem?
