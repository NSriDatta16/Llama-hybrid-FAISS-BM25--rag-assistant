Tjur's Coefficient of Discrimination and Multinomial Logistic Models

I am working on revising a manuscript where the analysis being used is multinomial logistic models. Based on suggestions from the editorial board and my reading of the literature, it would appear that an appropriate measure of goodness of fit for logistic regressions is Tjur’s Coefficient of Discrimination. Yet, since I am working with a multinomial logistic model and not simply a logistic regression (like GLM or GLMM) it is not clear if Tjur’s Coefficient is appropriate (or even applicable) to the model. Rather, the model (in R) gives McFadden’s R2 in the output. Is Tjur’s Coefficient of Discrimination limited to models such as the glm or glmm, or is it applicable beyond those models? Thank you in advance for any help you can offer that might help me further understand this.
