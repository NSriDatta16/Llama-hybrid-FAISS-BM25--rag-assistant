Chi-square stats is used to compare the difference between observed value and the expected value. One Example can be the following case: | category | Observed | Expected | +------------+--------------+-------------+ | True | 4 | 3 | | False | 6 | 7 | +-------+---+--+ chi2 = (4-3)/3 + (6-7)/7. The according degree of freedom = n_cat - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. In your example, the number of categories is not 2 (Category), but the number of time series points. Take a daily time series data in a year as an example, where observed values are consecutively increasing numbers 1 to 365, and the expected values are consecutively decreasing numbers 365 to 1. | category | Observed | Expected | +------------+--------------+-------------+ | 2017-01-01 | 1 | 365 | 2017-01-02 | 2 | 364 | ... | ... | | 2017-12-31 | 365 | 1 +---------------+------+--+ chi2 = (1-365)^2/365 + (2-364)^2/364 + ... + (365-1)^2/365. The according n_cat in this case is 365 (there are 365 days in 2017). Thus the dof = 365 - 1 = 364 instead of 2.
