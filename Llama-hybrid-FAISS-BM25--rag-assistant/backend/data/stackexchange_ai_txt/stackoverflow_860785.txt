javascript, flash, and MAPublisher layer toggle issue

Greetings. I'm working with Avenza Mapublisher (an extension for Adobe Illustrator) to create an interactive map . When exporting the map it creates a series of flash swf files, an html file, and some javascript code. The above link shows the non-formatted version. As you can see the map loads very slowly because by default all the layers are toggled on upon load. I've tried everything but can't figure out how to control which layers are shown when the map is loaded. Really all I want is the Schools, Towns, and a road layer to be active on load, and the rest to be toggled off. Ideally I would like the remaining pesticide layers to be in a pull-down menu so only one can be chosen. I tried setting the checked="true" to "false", eliminated the checked altogether and the checkbox comes up not checked but the layer is still active. I'm thinking something must be written into the swf file that I have NO control over. Has anyone worked with this program at all. There is a free 2 week trial online if you're interested. So the html file calls and this file is bascially a variable with all the selection choices. var checkboxes = ' \ Tulare Schools \ Towns \ Major Roads \ County Roads \ 1_3 Dichloropropene \ Aluminum Phosphide \ Chloropicrin \ Chlorpyrifos \ Diazinon \ Fumigants \ Metam Sodium \ Methyl Bromide \ Sodium Tetrathiocarbonate \ Acres Treated \ Application Rate \ Pesticide Use \ Agriculture Use' document.write(' ' + checkboxes + ' '); and the function swfLayerToggle() is in a file called checkboxFuntions.js function getMyApp(appName) { if (navigator.appName.indexOf ("Microsoft") !=-1) { return window[appName]; } else { return document[appName]; } } function swfLayerToggle(layer, isOn) { getMyApp("MAPublisherSWF").swfLayerToggle(layer, isOn); }
