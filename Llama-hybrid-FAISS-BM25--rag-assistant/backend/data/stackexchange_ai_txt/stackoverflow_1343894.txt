Refresh UITextView's Scroll Position on iPhone

I'd like to do some type of refresh of a UITextView to set the textview back to it's original state. I have a paragraph that gets dynamically populated depending on which TableViewCell the user clicks on. So when they scroll the text field, then go back and select another cell and return, the text changes, but the scroll position remains as the user left it. How can I return it to its default state. Thanks!
