Three tier architecture is a concept not a step by step instructional. Keep it simple and isolated. If you are working with data storage and retrieval, put it in the data layer. When there is logic to be had, place it in the logic/middle layer. Themes/skins, views, widget placeholders go in the presentation layer. Study others code. A good place to start would be monoRail . Read lots of documentation the more you know what others are doing the better. Above all, have some fun with it. If you feel overwhelmed or like things are getting complicated, step back and find out what's in the wrong place.
