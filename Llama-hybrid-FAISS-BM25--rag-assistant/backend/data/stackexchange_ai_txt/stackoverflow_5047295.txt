Trying to deploy Asp.Net Memebership database to SQL Azure

I've been trying to get the ASP.net member ship proveider to work with the rest of my databse which is hosted in SQL Azure. I've run the appropriate SQL Azure specific scripts against the database to set it up. The scripts are available from Microsoft here: http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/KB2006191 However, everytime I run my site in debug mode using Visual Studio 10, I get the following error: An error occurred during the execution of the SQL file 'InstallCommon.sql'. The SQL error number is 5123 and the SqlException message is: CREATE FILE encountered operating system error 5(failed to retrieve text for this error. Reason: 15105) while attempting to open or create the physical file 'C:\USERS\ROBERTO\DOCUMENTS\VISUAL STUDIO 2010\PROJECTS\FLYINGSHAKESTORE\MVCMUSICSTORE\APP_DATA\ASPNETDB_TMP.MDF'. CREATE DATABASE failed. Some file names listed could not be created. Check related errors. Creating the ASPNETDB_74b63e50f61642dc8316048e24c7e499 database... All other access to the database works perfectly. So its not my connection string. I think that when the membership provider is first called, ASP.Net is trys to attach a new Memberhship database to SQLAzure (which it can't anyway) because it thinks that one does not exist. I've no idea how to turn this behavior off. Anyone know what I can do? Thanks. Roberto
