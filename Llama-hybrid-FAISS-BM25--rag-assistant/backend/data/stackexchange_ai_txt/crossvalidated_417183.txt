Notation for unevenly-spaced to evenly-spaced time series conversion

I have an unevenly-spaced time series. To make it evenly-spaced, I resample the time series to a larger timespan (e.g. day) and sum up all values within this time frame. In Python (and pandas) it is a one-liner: ts.resample('D').sum() But what is a precise (and ideally easily unterstandable) mathematical notation for that?
