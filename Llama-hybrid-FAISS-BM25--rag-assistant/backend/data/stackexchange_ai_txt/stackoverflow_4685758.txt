I would instead consider using an e xponentially-weighted moving average . That approach will kill two birds with one stone: it will avoid the problem of accumulating a large number, and it will also adapt to recent behavior so that an accumulated average of 100fps in the year 2010 would not skew the average so that a 2fps rate would seem acceptable for a month or so in 2011 :).
