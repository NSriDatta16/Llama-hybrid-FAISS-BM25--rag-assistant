Support 3.0 and lower levels in the same project

I have a level 9 app on android, and I want to know if I can use new features from level 11 (Android 3.0) in the same project? For 3.0 tablet version, my layouts will contain fragments. How do I use these fragments and allow the level 9 version to build and run successfully? Can I define different layouts for different API levels (in the res/layout)? If I keep 2 versions, one for tablet other for phones, can I add that to the android-marketplace with the same package name?
