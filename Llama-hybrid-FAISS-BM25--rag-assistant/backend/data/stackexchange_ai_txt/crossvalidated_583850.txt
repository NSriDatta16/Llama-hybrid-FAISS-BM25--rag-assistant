I would probably do GAMs or trees for something like this and see what happens. For a tree (if there is a significant trend) you could detrend then fit your y with fourier basis functions for general seasonality, piecewise linear basis functions, lagged y values, and the season dummy you describe. Should be able to pick up on very complex relationships depending on the tree model you use. I'll plug a dev project I whipped up that does a lot of this for you LazyProphet . And here is an example gist of a multivariate problem. So in your case I would just let linear_trend='auto' unless your time series has a significant and visibly obvious trend. And just create your seasonal dummies to pass as X_train and X_test. Mess around with some of the other parameters. Could be good, could be bad.
