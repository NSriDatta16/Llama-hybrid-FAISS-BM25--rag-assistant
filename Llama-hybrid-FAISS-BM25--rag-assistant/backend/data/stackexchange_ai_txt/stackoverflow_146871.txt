I'm in pretty much the same situation at the moment. I have a lot of PHP under my belt, but the language really begins to annoy me. I have experimented with different languages, but have tinkered a lot with scheme recently, and I'm contemplating a gradual switch. Maybe we should start a user-group or something? Coming from a PHP background, you're probably used to working with a thin level of abstraction to the HTTP protocol. I think this is something that actually makes it easier to transition into a new language; Especially one, where there isn't one dominant framework. In this way, PHP and the Lisp community have some similarities (But so does other fragmented open source platforms, such as Python and Perl). One problem with Lisp is that there are so many to choose from. I have decided that I prefer Scheme over Common Lisp, so that narrows it down a bit. After some experimenting, I'm now focusing on plt-scheme , which seems to be the one Scheme with most momentum. Amongst other things, it has a web-server bundled with it.
