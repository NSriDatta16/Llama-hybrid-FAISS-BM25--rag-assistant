DateTime.ParseExact or DateTime.TryParseExact lets you specify the exact format of the input. After you get the DateTime , you can grab the DateTime.TimeOfDay which is a TimeSpan . In the absence of TimeSpan.TryParseExact , I think an 'elegant' solution is out of the mix. @buyutec As you suspected, this method would not work if the time spans have more than 24 hours.
