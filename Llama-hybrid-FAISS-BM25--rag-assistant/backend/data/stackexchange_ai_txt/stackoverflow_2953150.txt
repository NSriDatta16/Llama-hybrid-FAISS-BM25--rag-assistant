I think a database is really the appropriate form for doing this. Data in a database don't have to chance regularly or very often, almost more important is the fact that you can relatively easy extract very specific information from a large data set. So if you need to store the data lcoally I would use a database. Just a hint for another approach. Did you think about reading this data directly from the website? Judging from the style of this page I don't think they offer a webservice, but maybe you could parse it using HTTP Get? Don't know if the structure changes over time, but this solution would have the advantage that you don't need locale storage and if the data is update you don't have to manually update your database. Hope could help you
