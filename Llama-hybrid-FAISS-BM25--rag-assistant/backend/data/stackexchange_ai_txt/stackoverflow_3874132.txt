What I missed in all these advises about the drag-drop is making the text caret visible. Eventually, I have found that you simply need to set focus into the control! So the final code for the textBox1.DragOver event handler will be as follows. I have included GetCaretIndexFromPoint function from the previous answer: /// /// Gives visual feedback where the dragged text will be dropped. /// private void textBox1_DragOver(Object sender, System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs e) { // fake moving the text caret textBox1.SelectionStart = GetCaretIndexFromPoint(textBox1, e.X, e.Y); textBox1.SelectionLength = 0; // don't forget to set focus to the text box to make the caret visible! textBox1.Focus(); } /// /// GetCharIndexFromPosition is missing one caret position, as there is one extra caret /// position than there are characters (an extra one at the end). /// private int GetCaretIndexFromPoint(System.Windows.Forms.TextBox box, int x, int y) { Point realPoint = box.PointToClient(newPoint(x, y)); int index = box.GetCharIndexFromPosition(realPoint); if (index == box.Text.Length - 1) { Point caretPoint = box.GetPositionFromCharIndex(index); if (realPoint.X > caretPoint.X) { index += 1; } } return index; }
