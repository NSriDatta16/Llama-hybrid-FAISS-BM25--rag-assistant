Finding the $MLE$ of $\theta$

Let $X_{1}$ , $X_{2}$ ,...... $X_{n}$ be a random sample of size $n$ from a distribution with pdf $$f(x)=\begin{cases}\dfrac1\theta,&2\theta\le x\le 3\theta\\0,&\text{elsewhere.}\end{cases}$$ where $ \theta > 0$ . What is the $\text{MLE}$ of $\theta?$ I began by finding the likelihood function: $$ L = {\frac{1}{\theta}}^{n}$$ For $L$ to be maximum, $\theta$ has to be minimum. So for this question is the MLE of $\theta$ at $$ \frac{\min(x_{1},x_{2},......x_{n})}{2}$$ or $$ \frac{\max(x_{1},x_{2},......x_{n})}{3}$$ or both? EDIT: As mentioned in the comments, $\theta$ lies between $(\frac{\max(x_{1},x_{2},......x_{n})}{3},\frac{\min(x_{1},x_{2},......x_{n})}{2})$ So thereby taking the minimum value of $\theta$ to maximize $L$ we arrive at $$ \theta = \frac{\max(x_{1},x_{2},......x_{n})}{3} \ as \ the \ MLE$$
