ant: list folders on command line

I'm new to ant. I'm looking to a way to do this I have a folder, with a variable number of subfolders. Suppose subfolders are s1,s2,s3...,sN (N is not known) I need to create and execute this command line java -jar myjar.jar s1\ s2\ s3\ ... sN\ I would like to use standard task, but I do not know how to list folders on the command line. Any help would really be appreciated! Alberto
