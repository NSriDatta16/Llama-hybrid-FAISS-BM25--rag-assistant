Similarity metrics are a massive area of academic research. You need to decide what level of sophistication is required for your task. It may be that you can simply drag a "template pattern" across your board, raster style, and for each location score +1 for a hit and -1 for a miss and sum the score. Then find the location where the template got the highest score. This score_max is then your similarity metric for that template. If this method is inadequate then you may need to go in to more detail about the precise nature of the game.
