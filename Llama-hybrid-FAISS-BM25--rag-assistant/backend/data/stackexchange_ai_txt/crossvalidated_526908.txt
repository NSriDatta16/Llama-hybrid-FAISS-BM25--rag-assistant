What type of statistical test to use on ordered (e.g., time or position) observations?

I have 2 samples where one is using water as treatment (in black) and one using a test treatment (teal). The x axis is position on a gene and y axis is the coverage which is basically the number of times that region had a hit on the detecter. Is there a statistical test I can use to say the test treatment has higher or lower coverage than the water treatment? I guess a t-test or wilcoxon could technically work but it's not incorporating the position information which I think is important. Also, is there a way to incorporate segments? For example, is the (mean/median) "coverage" on region X to Y significantly different between the 2 samples compared to the other regions? Are there any tests that come to mind when looking at this type of data? These types of plots remind me of time series data so I feel that tests used on time series data would be applicable here.
