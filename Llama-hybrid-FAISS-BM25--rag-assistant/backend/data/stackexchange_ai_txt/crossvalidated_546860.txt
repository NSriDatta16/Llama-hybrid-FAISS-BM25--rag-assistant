Each of your coefficient belongs to a different B-spline basis function (think of them as locally defined polynomials of order $l$ , we come to that later) evaluated at the respective covariate values. The coefficients are not directly interpretable , i.e. statements like "if $x$ increases $y$ increases/decreases on average by $\beta_p$ " are not feasible. In your case, what the coefficients do is they scale the evaluated B-spline basis functions according to the data in order to fit a nice curve. A very good depiction of this idea can be found in the book Regression by Fahrmeir, L., Kneib, Th., Lang, S., Marx, B.D, page 431. In panel a you see the unscaled basis functions without any relevance of the coefficients. In panel b you see the scaled B-spline bases (e.g. positive coefficients lead to parabulas above the zero line and vice versa; the higher the coefficient, the higher the scaled parabula etc.). In panel c the scale bases are just summed up to form a smooth line that fits the data nicely. Note that the construction principle of the B-spline bases ensures that the parabulas can be smoothly joint together. This explanation also reveals the gist of B-splines in general: since each locally defined basis gets its own coefficient we are able to perform local smoothing. So in comparison to a simple polynomial approach that assumes the same amount of wiggliness over the whole curve, by using B-splines we can incorporate local differences in wiggliness. The aforementioned spline degree $l$ controls the order of the polynomial included in the B-spline bases. Setting $l=0$ leads to a straight line, while $l=3$ leads to a cubic spline. In other words, $l$ governs the amount of maximum wiggliness your spline can achieve. You find another nice depiction of this idea on page 427 in the same book: Setting $l$ is actually pretty simple as most approaches just use $l=3$ as the default to get a twice differentiable function. The question about the influence of the knots is a little bit more complicated as there is no default setting (this is where P-splines come into play, I will conclude with a short explanation later). A very general explanation is that the number of knots $m$ (I assume equidistant knots here) controls the "locality" of your spline. Usually, a higher number of knots leads to more flexible functions and vice versa. You can find a comparison on page 425 in the same book: As you can see, the fitted curve becomes wigglier the higher the number of knots is set. The relationship between the different parameters is $d = m + l -1$ where $d$ is the number of basis functions/coefficients, $m$ is the number of knots and $l$ is the degree of the spline. If you do not want to worry about the number of knots, you should consider P-Splines as a convenient alternative. They are based on the the idea of generously setting a high number of knots (usually $20$ ) to ensure flexibility and then introducing an additional penalty term that prevents overfitting. This is the way to go in a majority of cases where splines are used.
