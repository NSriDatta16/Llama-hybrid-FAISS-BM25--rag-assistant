Grab Next Row in SQL

I am trying to grab a field from the next row of this database. I can use the logged on time to determine the logout time but I would like to also grab the next login time so I can determine the logout [logged off] time as well. Any suggestions? Thank you |-LogonDate---|-PersonID-|-LoggedOnTime---| |5/30 12:00pm |100 |3600 | |5/30 01:00pm |100 |3430 | |5/30 03:30pm |100 |3000 | SELECT PersonID, LogonDate, LoggedOnTime FROM Agent_Logout
