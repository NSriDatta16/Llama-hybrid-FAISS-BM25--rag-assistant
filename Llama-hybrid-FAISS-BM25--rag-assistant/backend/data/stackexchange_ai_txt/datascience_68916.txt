Another benefit of using a static (not training) Embedding layer is that it reduces bandwidth to the model. In this case, there is a 300x reduction in bandwidth used. Instead of sending, for example, 300 floats corresponding with each value in the 300-dimensional vector, you can send a single integer. If you're running your model on the same machine, it might not be a big deal, but if you're using TensorFlow Serving to host your model, the reduced bandwidth can be useful.
