You can do this by a class (static) method, but not via a constructor . Delphis' constructors are called by compiler intrinsic on the just-created instance, which is already partially initialized (it's of the desired class and instance/field storage is zeroed-out). If you see the source of TStream.ReadComponent , you'll find that the components' real class is read from the source stream at first, then an empty instance is constructed and filled by RTTI from the stream and returned as the result. Which means: To use TStream.ReadComponent , you'll need to register your class to Delphis' streaming system via RegisterClass .
