Put your #endif at the end of the file not the end of your includes or use #pragma once at the top if your compiler supports this although that is less portable. Edit: To further explain what #ifdef & ifndef does is tell the compiler to include or exclude code entirely from compilation. // if _UNQIUEHEADERNAME_H_ is NOT defined include and compile this code up to #endif #ifndef _UNQIUEHEADERNAME_H_ // preprocessor define so next time we include this file it is defined and we skip it #define _UNQIUEHEADERNAME_H_ // put all the code classes and what not that should only be included once here #endif // close the statement The reason you want to do this is because including a header file is basically saying "put all the code in this file here" if you did that multiple times then you'd have naming conflicts from redefining objects and slow compile times in the best scenario.
