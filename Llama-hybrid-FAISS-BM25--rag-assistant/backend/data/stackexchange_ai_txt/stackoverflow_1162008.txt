PHP & Hash / Fragment Portion of URL

I am trying to find a way to save the hash portion of a url and as a PHP variable. This idea is a bit kooky, but bear with me... I'd like to extract the "location" fragment from the following URL and save it as a PHP variable. http://www.example.com/#location However, discussion at this link indicates that the fragment of a URL is only reachable through JavaScript. But would it be possible to create a link where the fragment is duplicated in the URL, parsed by PHP, and then removed by mod rewrite? So.... Original url: http://www.example.com/location/#location PHP gets location variable thanks to the plain "location" in the URL Apache then rewrites the link to: http://www.example.com/#location I'm curious to know if there is an elegant way to solve this problem.
