The Core Data schema is undocumented and therefore can change without warning. There is no guarantee that the schema from the article from a year ago is still the one used today. Although, transforming the schema of an existing SQL database to the one used by Core Data seems like the simplest solution but it's actually a fairly difficult and fragile solution. The better idea is to write a small utility app using the data model and any classes from your main app. Then import the existing SQL and create the Core Data objects and graph from that data. Then take the DB from the utility app and stick in the release app. It doesn't take anymore time and your schema is current and can be upgraded without worry.
