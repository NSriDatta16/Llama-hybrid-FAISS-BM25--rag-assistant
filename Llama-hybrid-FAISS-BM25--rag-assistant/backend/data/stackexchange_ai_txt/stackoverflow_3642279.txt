Embedding a UITextView in an image

I have a UIImageView displaying a picture that I took with the iPhone Camera. On top of that, I have a UITextView in which the user can type stuff that describes the picture. I would like to create a combined image of the two views and send it to a server. Anyone knows how I can do that (just creating the image. I know how to send it)
