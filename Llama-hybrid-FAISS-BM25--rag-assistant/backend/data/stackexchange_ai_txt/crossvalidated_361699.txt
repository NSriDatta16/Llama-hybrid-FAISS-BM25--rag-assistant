My sense is that this represents what you might expect with overfitting of a model, perhaps with some near-perfect separation added in. A useful rule of thumb to avoid overfitting in logistic regression is to have 15 to 20 events per predictor . "Events" in this context represents the number of cases in the sample with the lower prevalence of the 2 classes. With 10 predictors in your model and as I understand it a 50/50 split of the 2 classes, then you would want 300 - 400 cases total to avoid overfitting. This is in the range where the sum of the absolute values of coefficients in your example has stabilized at a low value. My guess is that something related to perfect separation or the Hauck-Donner phenomenon accounts for the peak at intermediate sample sizes. At very low sample sizes you do not have enough cases to find any substantial relations of classes to predictors. But at intermediate sample sizes you might pick up combinations of predictors that happen to do very well on the particular sample at hand but do not generalize well to new samples; thus the large-magnitude apparent coefficients fade away as more cases are considered.
