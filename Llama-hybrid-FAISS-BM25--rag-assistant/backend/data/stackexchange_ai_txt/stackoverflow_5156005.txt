You can easily limit the number of records that are being returned using the MySQL LIMIT clause. This can be achieved like the following with your sample query. SELECT a.id, date_added, title, content, category_id, person_id, organization_id, c.name AS category_name, firstname, lastname, o.name AS organization_name FROM articles AS a LEFT OUTER JOIN articles_categories AS ac ON a.id=ac.article_id LEFT OUTER JOIN categories AS c ON c.id=ac.category_id LEFT OUTER JOIN articles_people AS ap ON a.id=ap.article_id LEFT OUTER JOIN people AS p ON p.id=ap.person_id LEFT OUTER JOIN articles_organizations AS ao ON a.id=ao.article_id LEFT OUTER JOIN organizations AS o ON o.id=ao.organization_id ORDER BY date_added LIMIT 10 Where 10 is the number of records you wish to display. The MySQL LIMIT clause allows you to specify a limit of the number of records and an initial offset. Like so: LIMIT , In your case would be the current page * the number of records on a page. would be the number of records you would like to display per page.
