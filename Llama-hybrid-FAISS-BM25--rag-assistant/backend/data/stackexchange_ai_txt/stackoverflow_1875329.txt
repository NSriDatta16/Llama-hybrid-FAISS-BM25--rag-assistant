Pointers are not the issue. The statement is a version of the more general statement that a program should do nothing complicated. The essence of designing a program is removing complexity. "Fools ignore complexity; pragmatists suffer it; experts avoid it; geniuses remove it.‚Äù (Alan Perlis) "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction." (Albert Einstein)
