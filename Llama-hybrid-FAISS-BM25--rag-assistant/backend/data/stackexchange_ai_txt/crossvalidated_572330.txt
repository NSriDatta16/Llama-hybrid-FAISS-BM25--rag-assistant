Meta analysis average percentage difference with standard error

I am collecting data on the effect calorie labeling has. Each study provides a value for mean calories consumed before the calorie label and after. Each number has a standard error or deviation associated with it. I want to combine multiple studies and calculate a mean percentage change with a standard error value. How would I go about this? Thanks for reading
