(a 3-years late answer, but maybe still useful!) ROC is sensitive to the class-imbalance issue, meaning that it favors the class with larger population solely because of its higher population. In other words, it is biased toward the larger population when it comes to classification/prediction. This is indeed problematic. Imagine in different trials when data go under rounds of sampling (e.g., in cross validation), populations of subclasses may vary in each iteration. In such a case, the trained models are no longer comparable using a sensitive metric (like accuracy or ROC). To remedy this, either the number of each subclass should be kept fixed, or an insensitive metric must be used. True Skill Statistic (also known as Youden J Index ) is a metric that is indeed insensitive to this issue. These metrics are very popular in the domains which deal with extreme-imbalanced data, such as weather forecasting, fraud detection, and of course in bioinformatics. Also, people modified ROC and introduced Precision-Recall curve for this very reason. PR curve seems to be less sensitive to this issue. For Youden J Index, see Youden 1950 , for True Skill Statistic see Bloomfield et al. 2018 . For a thorough example, read this blog post on Machine Learning Master . For an applied analysis on extreme-imbalance data, see Ahmadzadeh et al. 2019 .
