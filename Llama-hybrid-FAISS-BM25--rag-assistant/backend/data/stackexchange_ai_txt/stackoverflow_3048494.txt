Problems when splitting Silverlight App into smaller components

I have a Silverlight 3 App that became quite big over the time. So I began to try to break it in several smaler Applications that will be dynamically loaded in my Main Application on demand. But I run into a strange problems with my VS 2008. When I add a new Silverlight Application project to my solution and copy User Controls from my old Main Application into this new project it happens from time to time (about twice a day) that the XAML files and their code behind files loose their association. When this happens and I try to build the project, the compiler complains that he cannot find all the Ccontrols like buttons, labels etc. in the code behind files that I added to the class in the XAML-file. And the build fails of course. The only workaround that I found so far is to add another Silverlight Application project and move all the content from the first added project to it. Than everything works fine for a while until the problem occurs again. But that's not really a solution. Any Ideas what happens here and what i can do? Best Regards, Rocko
