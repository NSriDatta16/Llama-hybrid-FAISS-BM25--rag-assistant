If you don't want to trust the system clock, you are going to have problems. Probably your best bet is an NTP or SNTP connection to establish the current time from authoritative time servers outside the organization - but you may easily be blocked by firewalls, etc. However, that is really overkill; people don't futz with the system clock for long - it is far too much of a nuisance.
