Regex to detect a proper permalink?

These permalinks above are rerouted to my page: page.php?permalink=events/foo page.php?permalink=events/foo/ page.php?permalink=ru/events/foo page.php?permalink=ru/events/foo/ The events is dynamic, it could be specials or packages . My dilemma is basically; I need to detect an empty link in order so I can feed a robots no index meta tag in the case of: page.php?permalink=events page.php?permalink=events/ page.php?permalink=ru/events/ page.php?permalink=ru/events I can't use a simple pattern such as [a-zA-Z]+\/?(.+)/ since it won't work on the i18n permalinks. What regex could I use which would detect this, using $_GET['permalink'] as the reference to the permalinks? And avoid false positives? Update: Empty link means there's no fragment after the "events/" part. These are empty: page.php?permalink=events page.php?permalink=events/ page.php?permalink=ru/events/ page.php?permalink=ru/events
