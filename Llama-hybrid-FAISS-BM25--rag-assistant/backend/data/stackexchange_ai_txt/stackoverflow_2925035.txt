Good news: in version 3.6 they've added a gridResize feature. It adds the drag handle for you and everything. jQuery("#grid") .jqGrid('gridResize', {minWidth:350, maxWidth:800, minHeight:80, maxHeight:350} ); See the demo - it's the last item under "New in version 3.6" http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html
