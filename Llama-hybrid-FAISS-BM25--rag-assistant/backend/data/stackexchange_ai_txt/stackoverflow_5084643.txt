I know, calling system() is not elegant (see below), but this is a pragmatic possiblity: #ifdef deployed int86( 0x10, &regs, &regs ); #endif #ifndef deployed system("MODE CON: COLS=24 LINES=16"); // includes a clear-screen #endif If you dont want to use system() you can use the consoleHandle to change the console-window back after your call to interrupt 0x10. Here are the functions for changing the buffersize and Window-dimensions: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms687089%28VS.85%29.aspx
