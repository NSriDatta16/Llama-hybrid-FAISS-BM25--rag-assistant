Evaluating logistic regression and interpretation of Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit

As we all know, there are 2 methods to evaluate the logistic regression model and they are testing very different things Predictive power: Get a statistic that measures how well you can predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The well-known Pseudo R^2 are McFadden (1974) and Cox and Snell (1989). Goodness-of-fit statistics The test is telling whether you could do even better by making the model more complicated, which is actually testing whether there are any non-linearities or interactions that you have missed. I implemented both tests on my model, which added quadratic and interaction already: >summary(spec_q2) Call: glm(formula = result ~ Top + Right + Left + Bottom + I(Top^2) + I(Left^2) + I(Bottom^2) + Top:Right + Top:Bottom + Right:Left, family = binomial()) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.955431 8.838584 0.108 0.9139 Top 0.311891 0.189793 1.643 0.1003 Right -1.015460 0.502736 -2.020 0.0434 * Left -0.962143 0.431534 -2.230 0.0258 * Bottom 0.198631 0.157242 1.263 0.2065 I(Top^2) -0.003213 0.002114 -1.520 0.1285 I(Left^2) -0.054258 0.008768 -6.188 6.09e-10 *** I(Bottom^2) 0.003725 0.001782 2.091 0.0366 * Top:Right 0.012290 0.007540 1.630 0.1031 Top:Bottom 0.004536 0.002880 1.575 0.1153 Right:Left -0.044283 0.015983 -2.771 0.0056 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 3350.3 on 2799 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1984.6 on 2789 degrees of freedom AIC: 2006.6 and the predicted power is as below, the MaFadden is 0.4004, and the value between 0.2~0.4 should be taken to present very good fit of the model(Louviere et al (2000), Domenich and McFadden (1975)) : > PseudoR2(spec_q2) McFadden Adj.McFadden Cox.Snell Nagelkerke McKelvey.Zavoina Effron Count Adj.Count 0.4076315 0.4004680 0.3859918 0.5531859 0.6144487 0.4616466 0.8489286 0.4712500 AIC Corrected.AIC 2006.6179010 2006.7125925 and the goodness-of-fit statistics: > hoslem.test(result,phat,g=8) Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit (GOF) test data: result, phat X-squared = 2800, df = 6, p-value As my understanding, GOF is actually testing the following null and alternative hypothesis: H0: The models does not need interaction and non-linearity H1: The models needs interaction and non-linearity Since my models added interaction, non-linearity already and the p-value shows H0 should be rejected, so I came to the conclusion that my model needs interaction, non-linearity indeed. Hope my interpretation is correct and thanks for any advise in advance, thanks.
