detecting touch on a particular area of screen

I am trying to detect touch on a particular area of screen where if user taps I can do something like this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point=[touch locationInView:myView]; NSLog(@"pointx: %f pointy:%f", point.x, point.y); if (CGRectContainsPoint(CGRectMake(5, 5, 40, 130),point)); { NSLog(@"touched here"); } } But this message is displayed even when I touch anywhere on the screen. I want it to be displayed only when I touch myView . I tried setting point.x and point.y to different numbers but that doesn't work? How can I solve this?
