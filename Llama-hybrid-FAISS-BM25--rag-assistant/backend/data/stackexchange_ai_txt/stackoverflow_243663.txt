My experiences have been with much smaller sets, so I can't speak for how well heirarchical queries will perform for large sets. When doing these tree retrievals, you typically have these options Query everything and assemble the tree on the client side. Perform one query for each level of the tree, building on what you know that you need from the previous query results Use the built in stuff Oracle provides (START WITH,CONNECT BY PRIOR). Doing it all in the database will reduce unnecessary round trips or wasteful queries that pull too much data.
