Loss is stuck at 67% and wont converge even with large epoch and early stopping criterion

I am training a very simple 2D dataset with 2 features. Its tabular data and contains only numeric information. I tried using keras to train a neural network but the performance does not bulge. I wanted to let the network fully converge and overfit but it doesnt work. overfitCallback = EarlyStopping(monitor='loss', min_delta=0, patience = 20) act= 'relu' last_act = 'softmax' los = 'mse' ep = 100000 batch = 8 opt = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001) # define the keras model model = Sequential() dense1= model.add(Dense(5, input_dim=2, activation=act,kernel_initializer='he_uniform')) dense2= model.add(Dense(2, activation=act)) dense3= model.add(Dense(1, activation=last_act)) model.compile(loss=los, optimizer=opt, metrics=['accuracy']) history = model.fit(data_train, target_train, epochs=ep, batch_size=batch,verbose=0,callbacks=[overfitCallback])
