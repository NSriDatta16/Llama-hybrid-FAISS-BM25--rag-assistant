Time series predictions with multiple series

I have a dataframe shaped something like this patient_id admission_id admit_date diagnoses 1 1 2125-10-18 [1,2] 1 2 2125-10-26 [1,2,3] 1 3 2125-11-30 [1,2,3,4,5] ... 4 7 2130-06-23 [2,3,4,7,9....] The task is to make predictions of the diagnoses at a future date based on prior medical history. However, I'm not sure how to train a model or how to make the train-test split since there are multiple patients with multiple admissions . I was thinking this could be a multivariate problem but I'm not quite sure how to encode that either. The dates between admissions for the same patient vary a lot too, anywhere between 7 days to ~2 years. They're also rarely any overlap of admit date between multiple patients. One thing I could try is to split each patient into their own df but that would be more of a workaround than a solution. Apologies if the title is incorrect. I'm relatively new to ML so I don't know exactly what kind of problem this would be.
