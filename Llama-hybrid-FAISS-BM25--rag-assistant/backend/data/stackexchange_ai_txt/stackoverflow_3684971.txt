The "right way" to do this is going to require three things: MainWindow UserControl ViewModel In the ViewModel, you want to create your ObservableCollection and set it as a property on the ViewModel, like so: public class MyListViewModel { public MyViewModel() { MyObjects = new ObservableCollection (); // Add items to collection } public ObservableCollection MyObjects{ get; set; } } Then, in your UserControl's Initialize method you want to instantiate the ViewModel and attach it to the DataContext for that UserControl: public AgentListView() { InitializeComponent(); DataContext = new MyViewModel(); } Note: this is much easier if you're using an IoC container to handle dependency resolutions for you, but for simplicity sake I am skipping that here. In your UserControl you want to specify the DataContext for the UserControl and then the individual Bindings for your DataGrid and the Columns: From here, you just need to add the UserControl to your MainWindow.
