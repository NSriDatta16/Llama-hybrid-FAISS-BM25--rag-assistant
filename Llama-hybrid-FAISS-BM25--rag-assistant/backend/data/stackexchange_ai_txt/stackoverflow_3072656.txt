If no mip-mapping is available, your probably don't want to avoid the aliasing. A platform without mip-mapping is usually not worth the trouble. However, if you really really want to avoid aliasing, you could approximate per-fragment mip-mapping by per-primitive mip-mapping. First you have to generate and upload all mip-map-levels by hand into separate textures. Before rendering a triangle, compute the appropriate mip-map level on the cpu and use the texture corresponding to this mip-map level. To avoid artifacts on large primitives, subdivide them.
