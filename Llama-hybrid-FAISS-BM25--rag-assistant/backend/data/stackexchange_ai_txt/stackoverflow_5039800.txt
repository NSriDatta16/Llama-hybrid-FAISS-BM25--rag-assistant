I'm not sure that you actually need a free control when you can get the original toolstrip control to mimic the appearance pretty close. Here's how I did it: Drag a toolstrip control to your Form Open Properties and change GripStyle to Hidden, RenderMode to System, AutoSize to false, and Set size to a larger Height, (34 is pretty close to the one in Explorer) add some Padding (I chose 5 on all) Open the Items property and add a dropdownbutton and select it Change DisplayStyle to Text Change Text to "Organize" Change AutoSize to false Change the Height to 28 or something close Click OK and go to the events for the toolstrip Enter a function name for the Paint event (or just double click) and enter the code snippet below private void toolStrip1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { e.Graphics.FillRectangle(new SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(227, 239, 240)), 0, 17, toolStrip1.Width, toolStrip1.Height); } So okay, the colors are wrong, but that's pretty close, wouldn't you agree?
