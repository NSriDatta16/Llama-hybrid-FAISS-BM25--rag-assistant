Minimizing the misclassification rate

I am reading the book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , and have a specific question from a text snippet. I'll state a few lines in the text Suppose that our goal is simply to make as few misclassifications as possible. We need a rule that assigns each value of x to one of the available classes. Such a rule will divide the input space into regions R k called decision regions , one for each class, such that all points in R k are assigned to class C k . {..skipping few lines}.In order to find the optimal decision rule, consider first of all the case of two classes, as in the cancer problem for instance. A mistake occurs when an input vector belonging to class C 1 is assigned to class C 2 or vice versa. The probability of this occurring is given by $$\begin{equation} p(mistake)=p(x \in R_1 ,C_2)+p(x \in R_2,C_1) \end{equation} $$ $$\begin{equation} \hspace{5em}=\int_{R_1} p(x,C_2)dx+ \int_{R_2} p(x,C_1)dx \end{equation} $$ To minimize p(mistake) we should arrange that each x is assigned to whichever class has the smaller value of the integrand in the above equation.Thus if p(x,C 1 ) >p(x,C 2 ) for a given value of x , then we should assign that x to class C 1 . Can anyone explain what is the last line supposed to mean? From what I could understand, if the probablity of a point x in the region R 2 is classified to be in the region C 2 , this is increasing the misclassification. But the sentence says the opposite. Please help.
