As far as I'm concerned, if you want a safe choice, spectral clustering methods have been achieving the highest accuracy rates in recent years - at least in image clustering. As for the distance metric, it depends a lot on how your data is organized. The safe choice is the simple euclidean distance but if you know your data contains manifolds, you should map the points via kernel methods. PS: they're all related to numerical values, not categorical. I'm not sure how one would go about clustering categorical data.
