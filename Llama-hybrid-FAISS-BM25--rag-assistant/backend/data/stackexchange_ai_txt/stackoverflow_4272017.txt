Actually, the .Net RNGCryptoServiceProvider class obtains random data from a "Cryptographic Service Provider" (CSP) (so says the documentation ). In the CryptoAPI, a CSP is a loadable DLL which provides some cryptographic services, mainly private key storage, signature computations... and also random number generation. A CSP can be used only if it has been signed (by Microsoft) and registered (by writing in some specific registry keys). The CryptGenRandom() function uses the default CSP (the one registered as to be used by default, normally one of the CSP which come with the operating system itself) and invokes the CPGenRandom() function on that CSP. RNGCryptoServiceProvider does the same. Hence, it does not call CryptGenRandom() , but it feeds on the same cryptographically strong source.
