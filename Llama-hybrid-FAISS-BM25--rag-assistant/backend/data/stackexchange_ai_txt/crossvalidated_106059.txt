The statement is related to the fact that the ACF of a stationary AR process of order p goes to zero at an exponential rate, while the PACF becomes zero after lag p. For an MA process of order q the theoretical ACF and PACF show the reverse behaviour, the ACF truncates after lag q and the PACF goes to zero at an exponential rate. These properties can be used as a guide to choose the orders of an ARMA model. See for instance, Chapter 3 in Time Series: Theory and Methods by Peter J. Brockwell and Richard A. Davis and this .
