Left-censoring in time series data

This is from a Bayesian problem I'm working on. I have worked out \begin{align} f(y_1,...,y_T|\varphi)=f(y_1|\varphi)f(y_2|y_1,\varphi)...f(y_T|y_1,y_2,...,y_{T-1},\varphi), \end{align} and all terms in the equation above are known. Now let $X=(x_1,...,x_T)$ with $x_i=y_i$ if $y_i>0$ and $x_i=0$ if $y_i\le0$. How do I calculate $f(x_i,...,x_T|\varphi)$? This is a bit like the tobit model but $f(y_i)$ is unknown in my case, I only have their conditional density.. Many thanks!
