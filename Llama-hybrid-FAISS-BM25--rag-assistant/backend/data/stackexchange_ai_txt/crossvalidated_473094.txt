What is the relevant asymptotic when regressing rates?

Suppose I am modeling some quantity $y$ as a function of a covariate $x$ , using a model from the linear family. $$ y = \beta x + \epsilon $$ For simplicity let's assume $x$ is categorical with $2$ values. I can then interpret my estimated coefficient $\beta$ as follows: if I take a sample where $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ , on average their difference will be $\beta$ . As the sample size grows, this difference gets closer and closer to $\beta$ . How does this work if $y$ is a rate? Now there are $2$ quantities that can grow - the exposure (denominator in the rate) and the number of times I measure that rate. Which is it that needs to grow so that the difference gets closer to $\beta$ ?
