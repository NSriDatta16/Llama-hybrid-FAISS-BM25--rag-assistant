Drag and drop with wpf and nested listview

I have a model like this: I want to be able to drag a Detail into another Group or into white space (in order to create parent elements Obj and Group) I have created DataTemplate for each entity with a ListView inside Obj and Group entities template. But every example I have found on web can't drag correctly the element because mouse events are raised from the parent ListView and not from the ListView that contains Details entities.
