You can do it in 2 ways: At lex stage define recognition of operators and provide terminal symbol (in you syntax mathOp) with value of operator '+', '-' ... Using mathOp as nonterminal you can return some associated value: mathOp : '+' { $$ = '+'; } | '-' { $$ = '-'; } ... Then usage will look like (pay attention to $2): | expr mathOp expr { $$ = opr($2, 2, $1, $3); } may be you would like to define more complicated mathOp then use %type
