Update after clarification: Take a look at the situation from another angle: Why don't you run a web server on the clients that host an asp.net page that triggers the capture. Then you can, from your root server, simply sent http requests to the clients and fetch the image. You can try http://CassiniDev.codeplex.com - it supports external IP and hostnames. And you may also consider simply embedding the CassiniDev-lib (a very simple example is shown here - Using CassiniDev to host ASP.Net in your application , that way you can use the web server as the reciever and the forms app can do whatever it wants on the client. I am confident in this approach as I designed cassinidev with this as one of the primary use cases. From asp.net you cannot. It is only HTML/JavaScript once it gets to the browser. ActiveX is a possibility but it is quite painful and dated and limited. And painful. The new way to do something like this is to deploy a .net Forms application or WPF app via Click Once. You can also write a WPF Browser Application but getting the kind of permissions you would need would entail setting the site as full trust.
