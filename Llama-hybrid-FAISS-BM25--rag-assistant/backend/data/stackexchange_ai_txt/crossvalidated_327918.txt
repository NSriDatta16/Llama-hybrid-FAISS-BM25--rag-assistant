I would train the AE, and use the resulting Encoder to extract a reduced dimension form of the input to pass to the LSTM. There is research that suggests the use of an AE has resulted in improved performance for prediction. Note that this is just dimensionality reduction, a non-linear form, as opposed to PCA, a linear form. There is research that suggests PCA helps to address multicollinearity, which constrains the predictive accuracy. I would think the Encoder would have similar positive effects. The reconstruction is used for training the AE. Use the reconstruction and the original input to compute a loss, compute gradients, and then apply backpropagation. Most frameworks will handle this for you out of the box. I don't think the reconstruction should be passed to the LSTM.
