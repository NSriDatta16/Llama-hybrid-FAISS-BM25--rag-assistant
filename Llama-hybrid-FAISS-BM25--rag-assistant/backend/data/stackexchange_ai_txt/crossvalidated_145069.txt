From what I see, your design actually has three IVs: Memory Type (V, P, and E, within-subject variable) Task Complexity (Simple or Complex, between-subject variable) Participant Type (Control or Autism, between-subject variable) Thus, I would recommend that you run a 3x2x2 mixed ANOVA, which would enable you to test your hypotheses about the main/interactive effects of Memory Type and Task Complexity, while comparing these effects between your two samples of control v. individuals with autism. Any significant interactions you could follow up by testing simple main effects. This approach would just use individuals' test scores. In other words, no use of difference scores is needed. Also note that the use of difference scores in analyses--in the way you have proposed at least--is generally discouraged. Peter, Churchhill, & Brown (1993) is a bit of an old reference, but it's a nice review of the issue that holds up pretty well. References Peter, J. P., Churchill, G. A., & Brown, T. J. (1993). Caution in the use of difference scores in consumer research. Journal of Consumer Research , 19 , 655-662.
