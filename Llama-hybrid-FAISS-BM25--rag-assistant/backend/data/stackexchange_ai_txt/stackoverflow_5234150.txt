How to change the drag and drop cursor when mouseover a drop target

I have an app that incorporates a drop target to unarchive (file attribute) files. I would like to change the mouse cursor in the DragEnter event of the form to a custom cursor (.cur) that I have as an embedded resource. The drop target is a transparent form with an image of a target. (The entire form is the drop target) I know I can use the GiveFeedBack event when I have control of the drag source. However this is not the case as the source is Windows explorer. (and maybe I'm wrong and I can still use GiveFeedBack in this scenario, but I could not figure out how to trigger the event.) To eliminate the possibility that my custom cursor was not valid or corrupt, I successfully set the custom cursor in the MouseOver event of the drop target form. Functionally everything is working, I am now just wanting to "pretty things up" a little bit. Thanks in advance for any insight.
