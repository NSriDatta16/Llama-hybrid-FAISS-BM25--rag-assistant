PCA scikit-learn - ValueError: array must not contain infs or NaNs

I use PCA from from sklearn.decomposition to reduce data dimension. pca = PCA(n_components=pca_components, whiten=True, svd_solver='full') y = pca.fit_transform(x) The numpy array shape is (512, 48), dtype is float64. The minimum value in the array is 0.0, the maximum value is 1.7976931348623157e+308. The array does not contain infs or NaNs but I get an error ValueError: array must not contain infs or NaNs I have looke for reasons of this error and found nothing useful for me. I suppose that maybe the maxim value in the array is too large for PCA. But I still do not know how deal with it. Could you advice me something. Thanks alot in advance.
