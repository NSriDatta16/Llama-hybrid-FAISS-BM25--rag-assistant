The correct answer is yes. A statistical model can have explanatory value without being a good predictor. But it depends upon what you are trying to predict. The classic example? Sex differences in body weights. Studies show that on average males are heavier than females. I can model the effect, estimate the difference and attach estimates of uncertainty to that estimate. But can I use it for prediction? Well it depends upon what I'm trying to predict. If I'm trying to predict the sex of an individual based on their body weight then my statistical model is unlikely to perform much better than chance. If I'm trying to separate two groups of same-sex individuals into the male and female groups then I'm in good shape. Providing we have an unbiased sample of a reasonable size then I should be able to do this with some confidence.
