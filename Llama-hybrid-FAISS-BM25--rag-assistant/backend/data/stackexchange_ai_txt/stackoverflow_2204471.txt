Access authenticated user outside of a view

I'm trying to access an authenticated user within a form class. I played with passing the request object from a viewto the class init, but it seemed sloppy. Is there a better way to access the authenticated user or request object outside of a view? class LicenseForm(forms.Form): '''def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): #self.fields['license'] = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=self.license_queryset(), empty_label='None', widget=forms.RadioSelect())''' def license_queryset(): queryset = License.objects.filter(organization__isnull=True) # add addtional filters if the logged in user belongs to an organization return queryset licenses = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=license_queryset(), empty_label='None', widget=forms.RadioSelect())
