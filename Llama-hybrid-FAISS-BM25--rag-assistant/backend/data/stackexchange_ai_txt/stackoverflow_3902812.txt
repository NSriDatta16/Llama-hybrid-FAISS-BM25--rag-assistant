How can I serialize and deserialize Perl data to/from database?

What is the best module or approach to serialize data into a database? Currently I am looking into Storable functions freeze and thaw , example: use Storable qw(freeze thaw); use strict; my %array_test = ('Year Average' => 0.1, 'Color Average' => 0.8, 'Humans' => 0, 'Units' => 1); my $serialized_data = freeze(\%array_test); my %deserialized_data = %{ thaw($serialized_data) }; What I would like to know: Are there any native command in Perl to serialize and deserialize data? Is Storable a good approach to serialize and deserialize into a database or is there better approch / modules around? Should I do anything else with the serialization before storing it, like encoding it?
