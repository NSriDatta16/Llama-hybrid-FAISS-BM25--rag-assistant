Times series with autocorrelated errors

I'm following the "Time Series Analysis and Its Applications With R Examples" from Shumway and Stoffer. In chapter 3.8 they talk about Regression with Autocorrelated Errors. "They use the model of the form: $$y=Z*\beta+x$$ Where $y=(y_1,...,y_n)'$ and $x=(x_1,...,x_n)'$ are $n \times 1$ vectors, $\beta=(\beta_1,...,\beta_n)'$ is $r \times 1$ , and $Z=[z_1|z_2|...|z_n]'$ is the $n \times r$ matrix composed of the input variables. Let $\Gamma={\gamma_x(s,t)}$ , where $\Gamma$ is the variance-covariance matrix made from an ARMA(p,q) model, then $\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}y=\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}} Z \beta+ \Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}x$ , so that we can write the model as $$y^\star=Z^\star \beta+ \delta,$$ where $y^\star=\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}y,Z^\star=\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}} Z$ , and $\delta=\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}x$ . Consequently, the covariance matrix of $\delta$ is the identity and the model is in the classical linear model form. It follows that the weighted estimate of $\beta$ is $\hat{\beta_w}=(Z^{' \star} Z^\star)^{-1} Z^{' \star} y^\star =(Z' \Gamma^{-1} Z)^{-1} Z' \Gamma^{-1}y$ , and the variance-covariance matrix of the estimator is $var(\hat{\beta_w}) = (Z' \Gamma^{-1} Z)^{-1}$ . If $x_t$ is white noise, then $\Gamma = \sigma^2 I$ and these results reduce to the usual least squares results." During this process, I try to take the covariance of $\delta$ then I should get the following, $$cov(\delta)=cov(\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}x) =\sigma^2 \Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}} \Gamma \Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}=\sigma^2 I.$$ This is derived from the fact that $cov(x)=\sigma^2 \Gamma$ and using the property that $cov(Ax)=A cov(x) A'$ along with the property that $(\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}})'=\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ since $\Gamma^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ is a symmetric matrix due to properties of covariance matrices. Additionally since $\Gamma^{-1}$ is formed from an ARMA(p,q) covariance matrix, the matrix has a $\sigma^2$ multiplier in it, so it is possible to factor it out from $\Gamma$ which provides the final result of $cov(\delta)=\sigma^2 I$ . So I have three questions that I am trying to understand, Is my thought process correct in understanding this? Does this mean that $\hat{\beta_w}$ doesn't depend on $\sigma^2$ Would this mean that the new transformed errors, $\delta$ , are now iid such that $\delta \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ ? Thank you kindly
