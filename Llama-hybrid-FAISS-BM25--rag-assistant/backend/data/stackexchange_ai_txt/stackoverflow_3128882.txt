Usually neural networks are used for decision making, so a 0/1 answer is just what you want: a "yes" or a "no". To actually fit the network one uses two sets that are known to produce a "yes" and "no" answer. Then one calculates the rates of Type I and Type II errors (often called purity and 1-efficiency) as a function of the network parameters. These functions have values between 0 and 1. The goal of the fit is to find a set of network parameters which produce an acceptable balance between Type I and Type II errors while making them both as small as possible.
