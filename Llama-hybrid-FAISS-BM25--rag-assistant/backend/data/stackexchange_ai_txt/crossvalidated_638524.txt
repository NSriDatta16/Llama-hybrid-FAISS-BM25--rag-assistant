How should I interpret categorical with continuous variables in a logistic regression output?

I am trying to interpret the output of a logistic regression with categorical and continuous variables. I am a bit struggling to get the concept of "other values fixed / other variables constant". As far as I know, I am always comparing to the reference group (when variables are categorical). However, I have BMI continuous. So are my interpretations correct? The reference group is people with "high school" education, "good" self-assessment, age " "0" or a any "fixed" value? People in the reference category have a chance to pass of (e^-0.73) 0.47. When people have a PhD and good self-assessment, age When they have a PhD and are aged 18-25, their chance increases by about (e^1.465+1.03) 12.12 compared to the chance of people with high school, good self-assessment, age So is BMI hypothetically 0 or at a (any) fixed value?
