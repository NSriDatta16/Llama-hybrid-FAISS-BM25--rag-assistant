Are you able to load the swf into Flex at runtime rather than embed it? I've had good results loading swfs into Flex after launch, whereas embedding tends to be problematic for accessing a swf API. Either use Loaders with eventListeners in a script or mx:SWFLoader in MXML with a listener on complete should work for you.
