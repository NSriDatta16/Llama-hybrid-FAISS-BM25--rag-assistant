Check to see how fragmented your indexes are. At my company we have a nightly import process that trashes our indexes and over time it can have a profound impact on data access speeds. For example we had a SQL procedure that took 2 hours to run one day after de-fragmenting the indexes it took 3 minutes. we use SQL Server 2005 ill look for a script that can check this on MySQL.
