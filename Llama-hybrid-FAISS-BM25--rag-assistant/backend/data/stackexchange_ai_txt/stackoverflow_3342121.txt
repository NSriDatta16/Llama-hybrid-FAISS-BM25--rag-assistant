Is this a secure authentication system for an ajax-driven app?

I apologize ahead of time, becuase I'm neither great at explaining things nor flow charts. This is not a specific code problem, but a general question on session security. I'm trying to eliminate as many potential problems as possible at once. I think this takes care of: CSRF Session fixation Session prediction Cookie theft (through browser vulnerabilities) Session sidejacking I realize the session can still be sidejacked if both the attacker's IP and user-agent header are the same as authenticated user's. I guess to make that bulletproof you would need SSL? I would appreciate any critiques, if you can make out what I'm trying to say with the clusterfuck below. This is more or less what I'm doing: EDIT - another question I had: Is it safe to assume that a user will not have an IP address that changes frequently enough for this to become a problem?
