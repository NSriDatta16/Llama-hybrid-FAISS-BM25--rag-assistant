Quantify MCMC chain mixing

I'm running an MCMC process with several parallel chains (often hundreds). To improve the visibility of the final plot, I only want to plot two chains per parameter: ideally the "best" and "worst" performing chains. I interpret this as the chain that shows the largest degree of mixing, and the one that shows the smallest. Is this a reasonable approach? If so, how should I quantify the mixing of a chain to pick the "best" and "worst" ones?
