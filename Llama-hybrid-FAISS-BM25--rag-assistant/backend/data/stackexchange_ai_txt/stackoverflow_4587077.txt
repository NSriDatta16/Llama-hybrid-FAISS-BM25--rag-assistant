As R. says, it depends exactly what you mean by "percentage of fragmentation" - but one simple formula you could use would be: (free - freemax) ---------------- x 100% (or 100% for free=0) free where free = total number of bytes free freemax = size of largest free block That way, if all memory is in one big block, the fragmentation is 0%, and if memory is all carved up into hundreds of tiny blocks, it will be close to 100%.
