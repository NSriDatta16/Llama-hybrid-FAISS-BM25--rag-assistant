SQL Server 2008 large table performance

I have this relatively large table in a separate filegroup (2 GB, well, it's not THAT large but large enough I think to start thinking about performance as it's a heavy duty table). This is the only table in this filegroup. Right now the filegroup contains only one datafile. Assuming the table is well-indexed and that index fragmentation is almost zero, would it increase performance (for select and insert statements) if I split the filegroup into two datafiles, BUT having those two datafiles reside on the same physical disk (as I don't have an array of disks at my disposal) ? Or is a split into multiple files only an improvement when you can split those files over separate physical disks ? Thanks for any replies. ps: must add that we're using standard edition so table partitioning is a no-go Mathieu
