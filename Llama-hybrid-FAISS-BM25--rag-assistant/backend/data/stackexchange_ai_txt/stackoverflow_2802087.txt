How can i generate mongoid.yml config in Rail 2.3.5?

As the title says, how can i generate the default mongoid.yml config file on Rail 2.3.5? I try to use the ´rails generate mongoid:config´ command but it just generates a new app. And also, I would like to use has_many in mongoid without embedding the associated model in the same field. I would like them to be in separate fields and associated through a *_id "column". Is that possible?
