This is easier than you think. We have $\Pr(A_n)=1$ which means that $\Pr(A_n^c)=1-\Pr(A_n)=0$, for all $n \geq 1$. Recall that for probability measures we have countable sub-additivity (also referred to as Boole's inequality ), i.e. $$\Pr\left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \Pr(B_n)$$ for any (measurable) events $B_1, B_2, \ldots $. Therefore, by De Morgan's law, we have $$\Pr\left( \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \right) = 1-\Pr\left( \bigcup_{n}^{\infty} A_n^{c} \right) \geq 1- \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Pr \left( A_n^c\right) = 1$$ and that does it.
