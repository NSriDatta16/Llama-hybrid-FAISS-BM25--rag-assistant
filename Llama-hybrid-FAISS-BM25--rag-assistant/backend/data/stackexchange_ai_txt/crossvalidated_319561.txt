What if Markov chain does not converge in a reasonable amount of time?

I'm doing data analysis using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for sampling from the posterior distribution of weights of a neural network. I'm using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic estimated potential scale reduction (ESPR) for checking the convergence of my Markov chains. My neural network has around 317 model weights and I check the convergence of each of the 317 parameters separately. If I have understood everything correctly the parameters should have converged if the ESPR value for each of them is This indeed does happen in most of the parameters but some weights seem not to converge in a reasonable amount of time. Some take up to 100.000 or more samples until they converge, which takes too long time in my analysis. My question is: "What is the appropriate way to proceed if the Markov chains do not converge in a reasonable amount of time? Do I just need to bite the bullet and wait for three months or so?"
