Yes. You can get this through the TFS Warehouse Analysis Services cube, or from the TFS Warehouse database. Specifically take a look at the dbo.Code Churn table in TFSWarehouse . You will need SQL skills to be able to pull this information together. This is how you get the metric. However, I recommend against using it. A good programmer will check in about 15 lines of code per day on average ( yes, that's hyperbole ). Using a code churn metric will not tell you who is working best, it will only tell you who is putting the most stuff into source control.
