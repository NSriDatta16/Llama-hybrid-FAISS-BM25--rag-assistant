Analysing seasonal variations in time series?

I have to analyze NDVI time series over 17 years . NDVI is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index , which represents the greenness in a pixel of satellite image and generally between -1 (non vegetation) to 1(maximum vegetation). I am going to use MODIS NDVI data at 16 days interval . I am specially interested in the seasonal variations of the time series. I want to see the variations or changes in the periodic components i.e frequency, amplitude and phase shift. How can I extract these from time-series? Please suggest me where to start.
