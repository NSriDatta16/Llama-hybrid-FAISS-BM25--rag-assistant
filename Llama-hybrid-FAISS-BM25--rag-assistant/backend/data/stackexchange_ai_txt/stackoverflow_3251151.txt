The realistic answer is no. With no restrictions (ie. a WHERE clause or a LIMIT) on your query, then you're almost guaranteed a full table scan every time. The only way to decrease the scan time would be to have less data (or perhaps a faster disk). It's possible that you could re-work your data to make your rows more efficient (CHARS instead of VARCHARS in some cases, TINYINTS instead of INTS, etc.), but you're really not going to see much of a speed difference with that kind of micro-optimization. Indexes are where it's at. Generally if you're stuck with a case like this where you can't use indexes, but you have large tables, then it's the business logic that requires some re-working. Do you always need to select every record? Can you do some application-side caching? Can you fragment the data into smaller sets or tables, perhaps organized by day or month? Etc.
