Master Page location of controls in content page

I'm trying to rebuild a site using masterpages. I copied the markup of the controls in the old page and placed them in the content place holder in the new page(in source view). Since they were absolutely positioned the controls do not stay inside the content place holder in design view. Everything is between the content place holder tags in source view. the page works when I run it. Is there anything wrong in leaving it like this? I can't seem to drag all the controls into the content placeholder in design view.
