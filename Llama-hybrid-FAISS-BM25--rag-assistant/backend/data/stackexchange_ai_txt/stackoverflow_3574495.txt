Can you build the VB.NET variant that guy posted on the link you gave us ? Message of Jan 29th, 2007, 03:28 PM ? Once you have that, you will have pretty simple .NET dll. Download Reflector ( http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/ ) free version of course :-) Just drag and drop your .net dll into Reflector and with a few clicks it will reconstruct that VB code for you - in C#. There is also a plugin to generate source code in files but this is so small that you can just click to show all methods and copy & paste. Also make sure that if dll is 32-bit you build your C# proj as 32-bit (if you build it as AnyCPU it will run as 64-bit if your OS is 64-bit and get in trouble trying to load that other dll). If you really just wanted in-proc editing with a memory stream (which is what accepted answer did), then you just needed LoadFile and SaveFile with a stream :-) EditStreamCallback is officially mapped to these 2. Look it up on this page : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302340.aspx The code posted and referenced in the question does something entirely - it hijacks RichText control in arbitrary app (just give it the pid), opens shared memory block and injects or leaches data from there - entirely different thing.
