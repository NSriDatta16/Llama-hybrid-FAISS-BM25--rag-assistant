After some investigation, I've come across the Liquid XML Sample Generator , which sounds like exactly the kind of thing I'd be looking for (though I'm not sure quite how good this would be for testing edge cases). I also stumbled across SUT: XML Schema Unit Test which does not look to be actively maintained any more, or well documented, but takes a more programmatic approach to defining what should be valid or invalid XML documents for a given schema, and testing this. Unfortunately test cases seem to be interpreted linearly rather than permuting the possibilities for each distinct node as the above XML sample generator would do. Consequently while it would be possible to enforce better coverage it would likely be a lot of work to do so. So at least I have what appears to be a workable fallback - generating a bunch of documents from the old schema and then validating them against the new schema, and vice versa. It's not definitive (well, unit tests never are anyway) but running a few hundred or thousand tests in each direction should give some pretty good confidence that the schemata are equivalent. I would still be very happy to have an elegant testing solution presented, but after an hour of Googling I'm not holding out much hope that something along those lines exists.
