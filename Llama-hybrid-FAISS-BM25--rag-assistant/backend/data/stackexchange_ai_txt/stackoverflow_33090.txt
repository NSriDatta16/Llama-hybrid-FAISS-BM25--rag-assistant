For C++ I am a big fan of C++ Common Knowledge: Essential Intermediate Programming , I like that it is organized into small sections (usually less than 5 pages per topic) So it is easy for me to grab it and read up on concepts that I need to review. It is a must read for me the night before and on the plane to a job interview.
