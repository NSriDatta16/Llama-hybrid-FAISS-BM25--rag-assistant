You can't do this with PHP's date function. You can only output the month as string. To do what you asked for you need to get a number to word function (plenty are available out there) and apply it on your day - numberToWord( date('j') ) , first part of the year - numberToWord( substr(date('Y'), 0, 2) ) and second part of the year - numberToWord( substr(date('Y'), 2, 2) ) . The month is date('F') .
