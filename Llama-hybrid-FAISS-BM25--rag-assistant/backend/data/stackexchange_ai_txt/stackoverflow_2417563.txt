Organization of RSS Reader

I'm creating my own RSS Reader, and to see which RSS items were already downloaded I'm converting the links(of each item) to MD5 hashes. When an RSS feed is loaded, it adds all the items to a ListView object and then checks the MD5 hashes against a text file and removes the ones that already exist. This way, only new items are shown. Now this works right now because I have only 5 feeds, and each feed only loads about 10 items, but in terms of longterm use, the textfile would become cluttered with very old MD5 hashes. I'm wondering if an SQLite database would be better to do such a thing, such as storing the Feed link, the MD5 hash, and the Date. But even then, the database would grow larger and larger, and eventually would become very slow. How do I mitigate this issue?
