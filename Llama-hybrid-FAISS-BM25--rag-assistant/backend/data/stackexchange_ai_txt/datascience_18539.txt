Next event prediction in the sequence

I have a sequence of event and would like to predict the next one. The training data looks like this: Ev1,Ev2,Ev5,Ev6,Ev7 Ev1,Ev6,Ev99 Ev4,Ev3,Ev6 So, the idea is to get Ev7 given Ev1,Ev2,Ev5,Ev6 The problem is that the number of "final" events is very high (100K). I tried to look into neural network but it means the last layer would need to have size of 100K. Can anybody point to any other ways how to do that or any examples?
