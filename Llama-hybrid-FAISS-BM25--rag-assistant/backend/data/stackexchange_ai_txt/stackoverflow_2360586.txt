IP addresses of agents registered with the Main Container in JADE?

I have a website at the back end of which I have a JADE main container running. Multiple machines can register with this main container. So, I want to know if the JADE API supports getting the IP addresses of all the agents currently registered with the Main container? I have to eventually display this information on the website. Thanks...
