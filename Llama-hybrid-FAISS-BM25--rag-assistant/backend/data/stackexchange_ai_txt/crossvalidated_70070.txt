Is mean of means a correct approach?

I need to compare a certain body value between several groups of people. The value for each person is a mean of several measurement itself. The simplest solution would be to compute an ANOVA between the groups, but I'm not so satisfied with this solution, because I'd loose all the information about the variability of the data in the single person. I would like to understand how being in a certain group influences the average value for an individual, accounting for the variability in the individual. Does it make sense? I expect not to see differences among individuals of the same group and to see differences among the groups. What would you suggest?
