What is the correct formula for Bayesian update for normal distribution with known variance

As question title states, I'm interesting in Bayesian update of normally distributed data with known variance. I compared three sources and they seems to contradict each other. I use some kind of unified notation: 1) Murphy K. P. (2007) $$\mu_{post} = \frac{n\times\sigma_{prior}^2}{\sigma_{known}^2+n \times\sigma_{prior}^2}\times \bar x+\frac{\sigma_{known}^2}{\sigma_{known}^2+n\times\sigma_{prior}^2}\times \mu_{prior}$$ $$\sigma_{post}^2=(\frac{1}{\sigma_{prior}^2}+\frac{n}{\sigma_{known}^2})^{-1}$$ 2) Jordan M. I. (2010) $$\mu_{post} = \frac{\sigma_{prior}^2}{\frac{\sigma_{known}^2}{n}+\sigma_{prior}^2}\times \bar x+\frac{\sigma_{known}^2}{\frac{\sigma_{known}^2}{n}+\sigma_{prior}^2}\times \mu_{prior}$$ $$\sigma_{post}^2=(\frac{1}{\sigma_{prior}^2}+\frac{n}{\sigma_{known}^2})^{-1}$$ 3) Gelman A. et. al (2014): 42 $$\mu_{post} = \frac{\frac{n}{\sigma_{known}^2}}{\frac{n}{\sigma_{known}^2}+\sigma_{prior}^2}\times \bar x+\frac{\sigma_{prior}^2}{\frac{n}{\sigma_{known}^2}+\sigma_{prior}^2}\times \mu_{prior}$$ $$\sigma_{post}^2=(\sigma_{prior}^2+\frac{n}{\sigma_{known}^2})^{-1}$$ I'm asking for two things: 1) verification of my notation changes from original sources 2) if they are correct, explanation of the difference between them
