Create an array of all the items in the sub arrays of an array of arrays?

Did I say "array" enough for you there? To clarify: I'm working on organizing and array in an iPhone project. I have an array of arrays. Each sub array has a list of items. How can I make a new array of all the items contained in the sub arrays? I've experimented with the addObjectsFromArray function with little luck. Thanks!
