This is not a 3 by 3 contingency table. It would become a 3-dimensional array. But that's a minor point. The answer really depends on what you would like to achieve, but at any rate, I would recommend that you go with logistic regression. It provides a nifty way of interpolating predictor values and it returns more information than just performing a test. Furthermore, if you have predictors as continuous variables before dichotomizing sleep (I assume physical activity was formulated as a question with a choice of 4 levels from the get-go), then it is beneficial to use the continuous variable, as 7 hours may not be a sensible cutoff point.
