The User-Agent header is private to the Browser application. Also note that different browsers (there are quite a few on the market) will use different User-Agent strings. Also, I don't know of any list of Android User-Agent strings. If you're just looking to test whether someone is using Android to browse your website, just check for "android" in the User-Agent string.
