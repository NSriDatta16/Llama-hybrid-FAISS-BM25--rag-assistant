How do I make a seekbar update itself after touch

I hope this is a simple problem. I have a seekbar that I want to limit the range it can be set to. This range can change depending on other factors (the values of other seekbars, etc.) The seekbar is a simple 0 to 100 range and defines a percentage. I need this value to be a minimum which can range from 0% (normal seekbar operation) to a higher value (let's say 50% for example). The code does its calculation and determines the minimum value depending on other variables. When I drag the seekbar below this threshold I want it to reset its value to that minimum. Here's some sample code seek6.setOnTouchListener( new OnTouchListener() { @Override public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) { if(event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_UP) { int CurrentLevel = seek6.getProgress(); if (CurrentLevel So in this sample if I drag below 30, the value will be set back up to 30. If I drag above 30 everything is fine. If I drag below the 30 mark, then the seekbar GetValue() is coming back as 30, but the seekbar shows the lower value. For example, if I drag it all the way down to 0 the return value is 30, but it shows 0 on screen. How can I get the seekbar to re-display at the 30 position automatically? I've tried to change the focus, update the seekbar from another method. Nothing has worked so far. Any ideas?
