Skewed distributions: choosing the median or average

Goal: To determine whether to use the median or average (or a weighted combination of the two) from a data set based on whether its distribution is skewed or uniform . Details: Seen below is a sample taken from economists forecasts/estimates of a financial release. There are 7 estimates in total, the statistics of which can be seen in the " Summary " panel along with a graph of distribution on the right hand side. Q1. Based on the distribution graph and the statistics observed under " Summary ", it seems that maybe the distribution is skewed to the right. As such, would it be a better choice to use the median value of 90 instead of the average value of 87.57? Q2. The standard deviation of 6.00 seems to be high- should this be considered also when choosing whether to use the median or the average ? Q3. In cases where the median and average are much closer together, say 87 and 88 respectively, would the distribution be said to be " uniform "? Q4. Could it ever be worthwhile constructing a weighted average of the two numbers, based on the distribution (let's say if it is not uniform, like in this case)? If so, does anyone have any ideas of some sort of weighting rule, or should both values always be multiplied by 0.5 e.g. (87.57 * 0.5) + (89 * 0.5) ? Apologies if my wording or theory is incorrect in any of the above, as well as for the low-res image.
