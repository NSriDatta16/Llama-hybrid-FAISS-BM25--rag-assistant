Wide prediction intervals for short time series: how to fix that?

I have very small time series data(24 points) for sales for different-different regions. I need to build Range Forecast (Confidence/Credible Intervals) for sales around it for every region. I tried FB's Prophet, XGB, ARIMA, SARIMAX but my ranges are very wide (more than 100% of my historical sales) as my data for some region is non-normal and for some other region either its bi-modal or multi-modal. Can someone suggest some other approach where I can have narrow range with high level of confidence? In other words, I am looking for the narrowest interval method which has a fixed level of confidence.
