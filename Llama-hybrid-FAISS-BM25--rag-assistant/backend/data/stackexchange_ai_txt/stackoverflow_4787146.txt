Drag and drop li elements using dataTransfer Object in Javascript

I am automating one of the drag and drop functionalities in our application. All I am trying is to drag and drop li elements from 'sourcelist' to 'destlist' through javascript using dataTransfer object. Here is what I have done and I am getting an error in Firefox. saying 'event.dataTransfer is undefined' foo1 foo2 event.dataTransfer.setData("text/html"," foo1 "); var textData = event.dataTransfer.getData("text/html"); var target=document.getElementById('destlist'); target.innerHTML=textData; Do I have to initialize the object event? how do I create an event object programmatically for drag and drop? I am pretty new to Javascript and would appreciate if someone could point me in right direction.
