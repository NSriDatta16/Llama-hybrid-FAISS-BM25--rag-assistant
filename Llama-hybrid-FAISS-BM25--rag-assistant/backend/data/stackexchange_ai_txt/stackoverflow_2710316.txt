Maven does provide dependency management based on remote repositories (like the central repo ) that are browsable, searchable . Maven Ant Tasks (retired) use Maven's repositories to provide dependency management and more to Ant builds. Ant Ivy is another alternative to Maven Ant Tasks. MOP is another command line tool that leverages Maven's repository and dependencies.
