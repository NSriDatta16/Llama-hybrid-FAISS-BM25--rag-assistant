Javax.mail in JNLP

I have a problem with my program. I develop in Netbeans, and when i run the program it is working fine. i built it, created a *.jar file, and updatet it in my JNLP file. here comes the trouble. as i'm using javax.mail.* in my program, the jnlp package just ignores all parts of it. Just to be clear, i'm working on a mail client. now i can check the numbers of the mails in the inbox. that is what the program ignores in JNLP. Thanks for any help.
