Feature binarization for RF/GBMs?

Are there any advantages to feature binarization for random forests or gradient-boosted machines? For example, suppose I am predicting snowstorms for the next day using various past measurements - temperature, wind speed etc. And I have a strong prior that snowstorms never lag 50 deg F or greater weather, is there any possible advantage to binarizing temperature into >50 deg F and If yes, are there any theoretical approaches or exploratory heuristics I can use to decide if it is worth binarizing a feature?
