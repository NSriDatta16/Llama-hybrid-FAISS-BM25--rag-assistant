It would be 2666% if you insist using percentage for a large number like that. Basically when you exponentiate the coefficients of a logistic regression, you end up with the odds ratio of being in class 1. In your case, it means 1 unit increase of that variable would result in 2666% compare to 1 unit less. For more details you could look at http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/odds_ratio.htm with details of the interpretation.
