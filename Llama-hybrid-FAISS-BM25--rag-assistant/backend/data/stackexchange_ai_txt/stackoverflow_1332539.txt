How to recreate shortcut to webstart application?

I use the shortcut tag in my appliation's jnlp descriptor to create a desktop link and a menu entry for my application. If these shortcuts get deleted on the client - how can they be reinstalled automatically without user action? Is there a configuration option for the jnlp file? (btw I'm using java6)
