I think this question is more about information ownership, trust and organization. You should ask yourself, what part of your organization would you trust to keep your system passwords safe from disclosure and misuse? I've been in organizations where they were kept by the people responsible for the business. In others they've been delegated to the operations team that also owned the processes around creation and usage etc. The most important thing is that it is clearly defined in your organization who should have access to system passwords. After that you can decide on appropriate technical solutions for protecting the passwords.
