It really depends on the structure of the underlying distribution of your data. If you have strong reason to believe that the data approximate a Bernoulli distribution, multinomial logistic regression will perform well and give you interpretable results. However if there exist nonlinear structures in the underlying distribution, you should seriously consider a nonparametric method. While you could use a decision tree as your nonparametric method, you might also consider looking into generating a random forest- this essentially generates a large number of individual decision trees from subsets of the data and the end classification is the agglomerated vote of all the trees. A random forest helps give you an idea of the share each predictor variable contributes to the response. Another factor to keep in mind is interpretability. If you are just trying to classify data, then you probably don't care about the underlying relationships between explanatory and response variables. However, if you are interested at all in interpretability a multinomial logistic regression is much easier to interpret, parametric methods in general, because they make assumptions about the underlying distribution, tell you more intuitively interpretable relationships.
