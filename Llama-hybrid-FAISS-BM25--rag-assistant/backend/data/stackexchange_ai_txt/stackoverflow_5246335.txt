I tried using the ChildBrowser with Phonegap/Android, but it didn't work due to API mismatches (the iPhone-version has event handlers for load finished etc, but the Android version doesn't). But I used the Phonegap Facebook plugin to connect and it worked flawlessly. I just refer to my earlier blog post which includes a step by step introduction how to connect to facebook inside a Phonegap environment: http://blog.lagentz.com/phonegap/facebook-authentification-inside-phonegap-android/ Hope this helps, Gregor
