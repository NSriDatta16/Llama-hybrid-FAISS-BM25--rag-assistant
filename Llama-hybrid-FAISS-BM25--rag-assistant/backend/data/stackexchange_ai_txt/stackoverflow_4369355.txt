How to add grid in Magento edit tab?

I ha created a new magento module. It shows info like for example Sales/Orders grid, then on click of order there is edit(in original magento view) tabs. I have created some tabs and I want one of them to be grid, like in orders shipment, creditmemos or invoices. How do I do that?
