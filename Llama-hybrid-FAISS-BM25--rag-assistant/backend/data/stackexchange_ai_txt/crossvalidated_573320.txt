Ordinal Regression with Categorical Predictors in R (Proportional Odds Logistic Regression)

My independent variable is Party Identification which I think will be best to create dummy variables for (Conservative, Labour) and then Lib Dem would be the intercept if I'm not mistaken. The dependent variable is a Likert Scale and I would like to model the effect of party identification on the ordinal variable to look for significant data etc. If I was to do this in R, can I use polr , do I have to run a separate model for each dummy variable or can I include them all in same model with the variable I haven't created a dummy variable for being the intercept and how will I interpret the results.
