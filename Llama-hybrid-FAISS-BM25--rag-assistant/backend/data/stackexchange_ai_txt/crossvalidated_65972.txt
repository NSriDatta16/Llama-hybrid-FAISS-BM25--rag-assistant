A model with Y normally distributed with unknown mean and variance, and identity link, is still a GLM. You may have seen it before. Also, don't pay too much attention to the canonical link. All that distinguishes it from the alternatives are some nice mathematical properties, which are not the same as its statistical properties: ie, whether it's appropriate for a specific dataset and analysis. People can and do use noncanonical links all the time, because they make more sense for the problem and/or simplify the analysis by making non-additive relationships additive. For example, probit analysis (binomial distribution, probit link) is common in econometrics and finance; and the gamma distribution with log link is a common alternative to log-transforming the response and using linear regression.
