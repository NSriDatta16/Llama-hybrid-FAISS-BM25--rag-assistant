It creates a new array of double some multiple of the size, and copies the elements over. (I'm not sure if the actual multiplier is specified per the Java standard.) Now the natural question is, why? Why not just add, say, five elements every time? It's to make things faster: You add n elements for free, and on element n + 1, you have to copy over the n previous elements into the array of size 2n . So the cost of copying those n elements gets distributed ("amortized") over themselves (since you previously added them for free), and so on average, the cost of adding each element was n/n , or about 1 operation per element. (See this link for some more discussion on this topic.)
