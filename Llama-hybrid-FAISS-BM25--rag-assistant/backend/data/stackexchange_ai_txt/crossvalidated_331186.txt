Can we apply a constraint on the distribution of the layer output?

As far I understood, the hidden layer outputs can be anything based on the learning algorithm or optimization rules. I was wondering if it possible to some constraints on the layer output. For instance, say, I want my layer outputs (for a particular layer) to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with certain predefined (or even estimated) mean and covariance. Is it possible to customize the neural network architecture in such a manner? If not, can I just make sure that the activation outputs for a particular layer follow a Gaussian distribution? Some pointers to the related literature will be very helpful.
