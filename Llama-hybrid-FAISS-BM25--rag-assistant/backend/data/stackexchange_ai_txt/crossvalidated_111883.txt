Because your outcome variable "success" is a binary variable and you do want to predict success, I would use mixed-effects logistic regression. You can keep using glmmPQL or glmer in the lme4 package. This post has a great tutorial. If you want to model your outcome variable as a geometric distributed variable as you originally did, then your outcome needs to be the number of attempts until the first success: max(attempt) .
