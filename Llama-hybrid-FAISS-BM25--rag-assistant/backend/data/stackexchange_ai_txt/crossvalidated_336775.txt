I don't think this is a grammatical issue, just a question of how words are used, or should be best used, in practice. A meta-lesson I have learned over several years is that a claim that something is ungrammatical is fragile. There is always another grammarian who can be found who will dispute the assertion. (I am of a generation firmly told never to split infinitives because, supposedly, the practice is totally ungrammatical; that was rebutted as bogus logic (a misconceived analogy with Latin) long before I was taught this in the 1960s; my teachers were, I guess now, just passing on what they had been told in their youth, and so forth. Nevertheless I still can't split an infinitive willingly.) I would understand "we correlated $X$ and $Y$ " easily as "we calculated the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ ". It's fairly common usage, I think. Even if it isn't common usage, I don't see what is ungrammatical about it. There is an associated question of how far the correlation exists as an inevitable consequence of the data, as a mathematical or even real fact, before its value is calculated, or indeed regardless of whether that is done. I can't say I have ever worried about that. But I wouldn't want to write that in a paper or catch myself saying it in a presentation. That is mostly a question of personal style, and as always agreement and disagreement about style are both to be expected. I can't imagine saying "We plotted $Y$ against $X$ ", because I would just say "Here is a plot..." or "Figure 2 is a plot ...". Similarly, at most, I would just say "The correlation is ...". It's worth remembering that Francis Galton hijacked correlation , which was a fairly unusual but long-existing word, for the present statistical purpose. Now I guess that the statistical sense of correlation (or a more diluted or generalised sense of it) is primary usage. Notes: You want nit-pickers to comment, so in that vein I will say that $A$ and $B$ are not congenial notation for variables, even in complete abstraction. Never heard of "decorrelated"!
