ROC, variables, unbalanced data, where to start?

Can someone explain to me how you would know which variables to remove? And how do you know if something is accurate or not? Because when I plot an ROC curve the specificity/sensitivity curve, it looks like a square for a random forest. If I use 2 different models, I assume I would have to use the same variables if I did stepAIC(logistic regression model) and then use those exact same variables for the random forest? I have 3 unbalanced datasets that come from the same sample and I have to make something of it and I am not too sure where to start. Thanks!
