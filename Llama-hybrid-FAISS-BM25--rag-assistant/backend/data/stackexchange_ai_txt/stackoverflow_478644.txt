If I were you, I would do the following things: write up some kind of document that describes what you're trying to do, why you're trying to do it, and how you will do it. This is between a mission statement and a spec, it should have the details you know about but also broadly describe why this is a good thing to work on and who would find it useful. get all of the code and associated data that you have so far and put it somewhere publicly accessible, such as GitHub or SourceForge. make a simple web page that integrates access to the code with any text you've written. notify people that you think will be interested. This includes mailing lists, websites of similar ideas, people you've met in your field, and personal friends in the industry that you think might like helping you with your idea. If you can do some or all of the prep work that I suggest above before contacting people, people are more likely to take you seriously because you will exude some aura of organization. as you work on things, post dated updates so that people who look at your web page don't have to wonder if your thing is still actively developed. Getting help from random people on the Internet is partially about marketing, so don't neglect that aspect of your work even though it's not coding. It's fun to work on something new, good luck. Also as DOK points out, similar questions have been answered before, so check those answers too.
