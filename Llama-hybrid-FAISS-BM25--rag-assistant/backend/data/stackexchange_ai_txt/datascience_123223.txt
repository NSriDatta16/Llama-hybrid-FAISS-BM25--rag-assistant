Here are a few ideas on how to modify your algorithm so that the formed clusters are question relevant: 1.Use a weighted K-means algorithm - In a weighted K-means algorithm, each data point is assigned a weight. The weight of a data point determines how much it influences the centroids of the clusters. You can use the question vector to weight the answer vectors. This will help the algorithm to pay more attention to the question when it is clustering the answers. 2.Use a semi-supervised K-means algorithm - In a semi-supervised K-means algorithm, some of the data points are labeled, while the others are unlabeled. The labeled data points are used to train the algorithm, and the unlabeled data points are used to evaluate the algorithm. You can use the question vector to label the answer vectors. This will help the algorithm to learn the relationship between the questions and the answers. 3.Use a hierarchical clustering algorithm - In a hierarchical clustering algorithm, the data points are recursively clustered together. The clusters are formed based on the similarity between the data points. You can use the question vector to guide the hierarchical clustering algorithm. This will help the algorithm to create clusters that are question relevant. I hope these ideas help you to modify your algorithm so that the formed clusters are question relevant. Let me know if you have any other questions. In addition to the above, here are some other things you can try: Use a different vectorization method for the question and answer vectors. For example, you could use a bag-of-words vectorizer or a TF-IDF vectorizer. Try using a different number of clusters. Try using a different distance metric. Try using a different K-means implementation. Experiment with different parameters and see what works best for your data.
