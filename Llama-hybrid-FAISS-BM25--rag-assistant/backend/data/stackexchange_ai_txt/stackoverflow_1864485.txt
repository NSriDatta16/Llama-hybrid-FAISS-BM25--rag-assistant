if you have look at the selector documentation on the jquery site you'll see the :contains(text) selector ( link ). this is how I'd use it: $(".gridViewClass a:contains('Delete')").click(function(){ /*your code here*/ }); Please note that this is extremely fragile and that if you ever change the text of the button (or you localize it to different languages) then the code will not work. Consider putting a css class on your delete link in which case you'll be able to do this: $(".gridViewClass a.deleteLink").click(function() { /* your code here */ }); This is a much more robust way of doing this.
