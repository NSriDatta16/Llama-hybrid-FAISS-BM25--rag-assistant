Bayesian regression does something like this on a continuous scale. To each value of the parameter a probability is assigned indicating how likely the parameter has that value. For instance, for each value of sales (a continuoum of classes) a probability is assigned predicting how likely it is that sales-value/class. Hypothesis testing is also much like this and a discrete form. One performs regression fits some parameters and subsequently classifies the observation as indictating whether the hypothesis is true or not true. Neyman Pearson hypothesis testing is very explicit with this and compares a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis and uses the likelihood ratio to decide between the two hypotheses. For instance a hypothesis might be that the growth in sales are gonna be more than some hypothetical percentage $x$ and the regression is leading to a rejection or non-rejection of that percentage/class.
