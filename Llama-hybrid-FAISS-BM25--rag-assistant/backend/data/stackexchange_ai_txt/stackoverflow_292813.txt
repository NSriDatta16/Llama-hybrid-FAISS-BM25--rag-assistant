I believe the approach shd be based on a combination of server-side sockets and client-side ajax/comet. Like: Assume a chat application with several logged on users, and that each of them is listening via a slow-load AJAX call to the server-side listener script. Whatever browser gets the just-entered data submits it to the server with an ajax call to a writer script. That server updates the database (or storage system) and posts a sockets write to noted listener script. The latter then gets the fresh data and posts it back to the client browser. Now I haven't yet written this, and right now I dunno whether/how the browser limit of two concurrent connections screws up the above logic. Will appreciate hearing fm anyone with thoughts here. AS
