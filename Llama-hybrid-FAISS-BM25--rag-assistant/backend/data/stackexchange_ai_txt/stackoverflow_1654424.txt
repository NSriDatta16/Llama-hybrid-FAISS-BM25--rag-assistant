One helpful tip: try to keep each comment as self-contained as possible. For example, this form: // First, mumble the frabbitz. blah blah // Second, foobar the quux blah blah this is a nice narrative, but makes it harder to edit the code, because the "First" and "Second" parts may become incorrect. In the end, they don't add that much to the comments, but make them interrelated in a fragile way.
