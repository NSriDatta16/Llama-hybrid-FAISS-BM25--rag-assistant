Are you using Ad-Hoc distribution profiles? For me the process is like this: They send their device uuid - which is visible in iTunes after you click the device sn. Then i send them the compiled application, and a provision profile. They drag both to iTunes, and sync their iPhone. I don't think that's impossible for non-technical clients.
