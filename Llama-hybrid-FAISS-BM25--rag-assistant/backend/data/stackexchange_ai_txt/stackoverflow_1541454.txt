Doesn't matter -- choose an organization that fits your needs. I roughly followed this guide when creating a server to handle several Django sites, and I like the folder organization it uses. A couple of benefits: All Django sites are in a special django user's home directory There is a domains folder, then a folder for every site that contains the django projects, logs, wsgi files, and other files VirtualHost containers are each in the own file, keeing httpd.conf manageable.
