cross validation vs. sample size

I am interested in performing GLM regression on a data with sample size of 37. After splitting the data into training (30 obs.) and testing (7 obs.) sets, I'm wondering wether it's better to build one GLM model using the whole training set consisting of 30 obs., or to make cross validation - building multiple models and then average the coefficients? What is the common practice in such cases and will you recommend one-leave-out cross validation as the sample size of a training set is relatively small?
