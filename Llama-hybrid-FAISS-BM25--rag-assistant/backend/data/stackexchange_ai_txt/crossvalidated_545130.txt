Simplified question Let the cars be modeled as completely randomly distributed and not interacting with each other. They flow along each other with different speeds and for every speed they are randomly and independently spaced. (Note this is not realistic but adjusting for complications, e.g. trains of cars driving at the same speed, would make the question too much broad) One single speed Let's focus for the moment on only one single speed of cars (later one we think about multiple speeds). The counts of these cars will be Poisson distributed and depend on the concentration of these cars and on their density in space. For some spatial density of $\rho$ cars per km, driving with a speed difference of $v$ km/hour. You would expect on average to pass $\rho \cdot v$ cars per hour and the distribution of the count of these cars in an hour will be a Poisson distribution with a mean of $\lambda = \rho \cdot \vert v \vert$ (using the absolute value $\vert v\vert$ because we can not have negative rates and also the sign of the speed does not influence the rate). Two speeds So... when we single out the speed of cars with a single velocity, the distribution will be Poisson distributed. When we look at multiple cars then we will have a combination of overlapping Poisson distributions. Say we have two different speeds. Then the probability that the next car is being observed is of speed $v_1$ or speed $v_2$ will depend on the relative concentration of cars with these speeds and with the hitting rate of those speeds. The cars with a higher speed difference will be encountered relatively more often. Say that the presence is $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ (with $f_1+f_2=1$ ) then the average hitting ratio's of the two will be $\rho_1 \cdot v_1$ and $\rho_2 \cdot v_2$ . The relative probability of encountering a car of speed 1 or speed 2 will be $\frac{\rho_1 \cdot v_1}{\rho_2 \cdot v_2}$ . Generalized to many speeds Using the above intuitive reasoning we can expand the relative probability of encountering a car at some speed as follows. Let $f(v)$ be the density distribution of the probability that a car has speed $v$ relative to us. Let $g(v)$ be the density distribution of the probability that we encounter a car with a speed difference of $v$ . We compute $g(v)$ as $$g(v) = \frac{f(v)\cdot \vert v \vert}{\int f(v)\cdot \vert v \vert dv} = f(v) \cdot \frac{\vert v \vert }{\overline {\vert v \vert}}$$ If $f(v)$ is a normal distribution with $\mu_v=0$ then $g(v)$ will resemble a Chi distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. That is, it will be of the form $x e^{-x^2}$ (and you need to mirror it to account for negative velocity as well). In the case that the average relative speed is not equal to zero, then I am not sure what you are getting. It won't seem like a standard (known) distribution to me.
