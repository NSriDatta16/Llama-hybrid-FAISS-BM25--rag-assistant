A GLM is a more general version of a linear model: the linear model is a special case of a Gaussian GLM with the identity link. So the question is then: why do we use other link functions or other mean-variance relationships? We fit GLMs because they answer a specific question that we are interested in . There is, for instance, nothing inherently wrong with fitting a binary response in a linear regression model if you are interested in the association between these variables. Indeed if a higher proportion of negative outcomes tends to be observed in the lower 50th percentile of an exposure and a higher proportion of positive outcomes is observed in the upper 50th percentile, this will yield a positively sloped line which correctly describes a positive association between these two variables. Alternately, you might be interested in modeling the aforementioned association using an S shaped curve. The slope and the intercept of such a curve account for a tendency of extreme risk to tend toward 0/1 probability. Also the slope of a logit curve is interpreted as a log-odds ratio. That motivates use of a logit link function. Similarly, fitted probabilities very close to 1 or 0 may tend to be less variable under replications of study design, and so could be accounted for by a binomial mean-variance relationship saying that $se(\hat{Y}) = \hat{Y}(1-\hat{Y})$ which motivates logistic regression. Along those lines, a more modern approach to this problem would suggest fitting a relative risk model which utilizes a log link, such that the slope of the exponential trend line is interpreted as a log-relative risk, a more practical value than a log-odds-ratio.
