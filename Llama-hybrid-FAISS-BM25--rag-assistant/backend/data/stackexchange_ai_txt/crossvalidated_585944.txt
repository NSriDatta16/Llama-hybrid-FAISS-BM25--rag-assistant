Partial dependency for random forest when predictive accuracy is bad

I have a relatively simple question which is just that if I run a random forest regression model and then use partial dependency plots to understand the influence the features have on prediction of the independent variable, are the results of the partial dependency less valid if the model has worse predictive accuracy? I was thinking that if the R squared is relatively low, that means that not all of the variance in the outcome variable is explained by the explanatory variables, but that does not necessarily mean that the effects of the inputted variables are invalid and hence interpretation of partial dependencies could remain the same?
