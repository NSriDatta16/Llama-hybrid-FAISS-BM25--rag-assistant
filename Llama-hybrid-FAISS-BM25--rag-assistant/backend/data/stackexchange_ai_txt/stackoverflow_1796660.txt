In C#, you use an enum for two purposes: To constrain the set of available values To give useful names to those values If you only had to satisfy part (2), you could just use constants. The storage type for an enum is, by default, Int32. That means that the == operator compares integers. You can control the base type for an enum by specifying the base type explicitly (e.g. Int64 or byte).
