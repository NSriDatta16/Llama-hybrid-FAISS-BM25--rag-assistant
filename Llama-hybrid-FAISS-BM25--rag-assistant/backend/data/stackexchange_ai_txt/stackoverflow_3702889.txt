How to know if I run python from Textmate/emacs?

I use TextMate to debug python script, as I like the feature of using 'Command-R' for running python from TextMate, and I learned that emacs provide similar feature. I need to know if the python is run from command line or from TextMate/emacs. How can I do that? ADDED I use TextMate for python coding/debugging, and it's pretty useful. But, sometimes I need to run the test using command line. I normally turn on debugging/logging mode with TextMate, and off with command line mode. This is the reason I asked the question. Also, I plan to use emacs for python debugging, so I wanted to ask the case for emacs. I got an answer in the case with emacs, and I happen to solve this issue with TextMate. Set variables in Preferences -> Advanced -> Shell Variables, and I found that TM_ORGANIZATION_NAME is already there to be used. So, I'll just use this variable. Use this variable, if os.environ['TM_ORGANIZATION_NAME']: return True I guess the shell variable from TextMate disappear when I'm done using it.
