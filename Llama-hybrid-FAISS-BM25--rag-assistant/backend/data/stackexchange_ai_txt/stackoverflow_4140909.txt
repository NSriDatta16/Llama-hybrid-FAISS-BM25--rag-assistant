Reading and storing data in a game (iPhone)

I'm currently trying to learn game programming, so I'm starting with a simple application for the iPhone so that I can sort of learn the flow and organization of game programming. Right now, I have a class for the player's ship called PlayerShip and the PlayerShip can come in different levels (i.e. when the player upgrades their ship). So for each level of ship, the class uses a different image. For each level of ship there are constant values that I have such as the number of turrets on the ship, the location of those turrets, and the number of thrusters and location of those thrusters on the ships (e.g. ship level 1 has two turrets and one thruster). My question is, what would be the best way to store and read in this data for the ships? I don't want to have to define them each time I initiate a ship because that seems unorganized, and I also would not like to hard code it in case of changes. I was thinking of using a PLIST file to store all of the values, but I also know that when reading a PLIST it's all or nothing meaning you have to read the entire file into memory and I don't want that to hit the game's performance. So what would the best route for storing this static information and having it be retrievable in the code be without having to risk performance?
