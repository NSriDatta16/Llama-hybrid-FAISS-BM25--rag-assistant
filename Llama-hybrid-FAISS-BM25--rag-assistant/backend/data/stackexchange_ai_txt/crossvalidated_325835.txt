My subjective view is that SOMs are less well known and perceived as being less 'sexy' than many other methods, but are still highly relevant for certain classes of problems. It may well be the case that they would have a significant contribution to make if they were more widely used. They are invaluable in the early stages of exploratory data science for getting a feel for the 'landscape' or 'topology' of multivariate data. The development of libraries such as Somoclu , and research such as that by Guénaël Cabanes (among many others) shows that SOMs are still relevant.
