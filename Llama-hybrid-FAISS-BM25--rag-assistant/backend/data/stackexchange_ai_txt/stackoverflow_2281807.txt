I think your problem lies here (quote from the API doc , text bolded by me): "The set of delimiters (the characters that separate tokens) may be specified either at creation time or on a per-token basis." That is, the delimiter is not a string, but a set of characters. When you pass " " as second parameter, you tell your tokenizer that the delimiters are any of the characters , t , i , t , l , e or > . Thus the tokenizer dutifully skips all the characters in the first tag and then t , and returns h because that is not in the set of tokens you gave it, but the next character ( e ) is. So StringTokenizer is not quite what you need here. Note also this remark from the API docs: " StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead." Or use a third party library, as has been noted by others.
