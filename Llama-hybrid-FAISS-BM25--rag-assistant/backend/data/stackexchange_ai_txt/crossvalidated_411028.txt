This answer focuses on what I guess is meant to be an ordinal aspect of the categories, taking age into account. Do you know (even approximately) the numerical age boundaries or midpoints of the categories? Perhaps the most significant challenge would be to distinguish between 'Teen" and 'Student', and between 'Adult' and 'Retired' categories. For example, if you could make meaningful guesses $m_i$ for category age midpoints, then use $a = \sum_{i=1}^5 m_ip_i$ (where $p_i$ are category proportions) as approximate average age. Maybe use something like $m = (5, 15, 20, 40, 75),$ if 'Student' means student beyond high school. (Looking at more-detailed US demographic tables of age distributions might be of some help.) Perhaps stretching the idea one step too far, you might even try to make sense of an approximate measure of variability, such as $v_1 = \sum_{i=1}^5 p_i(m_i - a)^2,\,v_2 = \sqrt{v_1},$ or $v_3 = \sum_{i=1}^5 p_i|m_i - a|.$ Note: Of course, useful answers depend on the use you want to make of your combined 'measure'. You mentioned age, so I focused on that. But the different categories might have varying impacts on the consumer economy, kinds of social services required, voting patterns, and so on.
