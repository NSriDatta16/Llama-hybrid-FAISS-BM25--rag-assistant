GLMER not converging

Here is a sample of 20 rows from some data I'm working with (everything below is consistent with the full dataset): lat cond id trial 1388 0 9627850 Pleasing| 2102 1 9654467 Disgust| 747 0 9644328 Happy| 2112 0 9638350 wmwf53.jpg| 579 1 9639422 Tragic| 2175 1 9628964 Despise| 800 1 9653958 wmwf53.jpg| 1276 0 9640461 wmwf52.jpg| 1602 1 9636965 Fabulous| 1140 0 9642953 wmbf4.jpg| 1070 1 9633495 bmbf3.jpg| 1000 1 9654108 Horrible| 473 1 9640532 Smiling| 476 1 9617722 Glorious| 891 1 9636287 bmbf31.jpg| 908 0 9635345 wmwf53.jpg| 592 0 9631025 bmbf40.jpg| 704 1 9642356 bmbf40.jpg| 756 1 9645445 wmwf39.jpg| 854 1 9646231 Cheerful| I'm trying to model latency ("lat") as a function of condition ("cond") while taking into account random effects of person ("id") and stimulus type ("trial").I notice that in the full dataset, that latency is positively skewed: Even in the sample data posted here with 20 observations, it seems like a GLM might be a better way to go (Model 1): Call: lm(formula = lat ~ cond, data = v) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -574.1 -354.6 -164.6 137.9 1137.9 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 1166.1 207.5 5.621 2.47e-05 *** cond -129.1 257.3 -0.502 0.622 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 548.9 on 18 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.01378, Adjusted R-squared: -0.04101 F-statistic: 0.2516 on 1 and 18 DF, p-value: 0.622 Compared with gamma distribution (Model 2): Call: glm(formula = lat ~ cond, family = Gamma, data = v) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.6945 -0.3766 -0.1681 0.1134 0.8445 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.0008575 0.0001664 5.153 6.67e-05 *** cond 0.0001067 0.0002157 0.495 0.627 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for Gamma family taken to be 0.2636089) Null deviance: 4.2975 on 19 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 4.2341 on 18 degrees of freedom AIC: 307.59 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 Model comparison BIC (Model1, Model2): df BIC Model1 3 315.9530 Model2 3 310.5728 Similarly, in the full dataset, the GLM is a much better fit. Then, I next tried to add a random effect of trial. Lmer worked fine: Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: lat ~ cond + (1 | trial) Data: v REML criterion at convergence: 282.7 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0460 -0.6460 -0.2998 0.2512 2.0732 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. trial (Intercept) 0 0.0 Residual 301274 548.9 Number of obs: 20, groups: trial, 17 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error t value (Intercept) 1166.1 207.5 5.621 cond -129.1 257.3 -0.502 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) cond -0.806 Glmer did not: > mod2 I know that this is just a small sample of my data, but the error messages are the same for the entire dataset. Thus, although I have a distribution that should be better fit with GLMER, why am I getting error messages?
