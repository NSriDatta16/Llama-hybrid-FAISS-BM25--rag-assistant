A logistic regression assumes that the log-odds of a 1 are given by $$\text{logit} P(Y_i=1| \text{covariate vector } \boldsymbol{X}_i \text{ for observation } i) := \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{\beta} \boldsymbol{X}_i,$$ where $\text{logit}(x) = \log(x) - \log(1-x) = \log(x/(1-x))$ (i.e. turns a probability into the logarithm of the odds or "log-odds"). In your case this simplifies to $$\text{logit} P(Y_i=1| \text{smoking}_i) := \beta_0 + \beta_i\text{smoking}_i,$$ where $\text{smoking}_i = 0$ for non-smokers and $\text{smoking}_i=1$ for smokers. Let's assume this is from a trial design (e.g. a randomized trial), where you can unproblematically use such a simple logistic regression to infer causality. In that case, $\beta_0$ gives the log-odds of having an event for non-smokers, i.e. $\text{logit} P(Y_i=1| \text{smoking}_i=0) := \beta_0$ and thus, the odds are $\exp(\beta_0)$ or equivalently the probability $P(Y_i=1| \text{smoking}_i=0) = \exp(\beta_0)/(1+\exp(\beta_0))$ . Similarly, $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ gives the log-odds of having an event for smokers, i.e. $\text{logit} P(Y_i=1| \text{smoking}_i=1) := \beta_0 + \beta_1$ and thus, the odds are $\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1)$ or equivalently the probability $P(Y_i=1| \text{smoking}_i=1) = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1)/(1+\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1))$ . If you form the ratio of the odds, then you have $$\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1) / \exp(\beta_0) = \exp(\beta_1).$$ This is called the odds ratio (i.e. simply the ratio of the odds) between smokers and non-smokers, and the logarithm of it is the log-odds ratio (in this case $\beta_1$ ).
