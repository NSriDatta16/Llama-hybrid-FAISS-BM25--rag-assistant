Assuming that your outcome is a discrete, ordinal measure, the textbook recommendation would be to use ordered logistic regression. However, you will find that scholars sometimes use OLS instead of ordered logistic regression. They might provide various justifications for this decision (higher number of response categories, ease of interpretation, etc.). You can estimate both models, compare the results, and run some diagnostic tests to understand possible violations of assumptions and how sensitive your analysis might be to modeling decisions. However, you should not use these analyses to arrive at estimates that best suit your interests.
