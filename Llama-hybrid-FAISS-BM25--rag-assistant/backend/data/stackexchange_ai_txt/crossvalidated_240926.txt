How are convolutional layers connected in Theano?

How are feature maps connected between two layers in Theano/Caffe/TensorFlow? For instance, if we have 32 feature maps in Conv Layer 1, and 64 feature maps in Conv Layer 2, with 64 kernels, how does the implementation connect the two layers? Is it fully connected? And if so, does it do an average across all inputs?
