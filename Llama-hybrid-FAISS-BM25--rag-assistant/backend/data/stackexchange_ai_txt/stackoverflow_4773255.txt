Embedding an external XML file in HTML and using an XSL file to parse it?

I have an XML file ("exchange.xml") and an XSL file ("exchange.xsl") for parsing it. exchange.xml has the following line: Indicating that exchange.xsl should be used to parse the file. It parses as expected if I load exchange.xml in a browser. However, I want to have exchange.xml embedded in an HTML file which otherwise does not have any XML in it. How do I do this? As far as I understand it, when you embed XML in HTML with the XML tag's SRC ID, you then have to parse it yourself for it to be displayed. I want it to automatically be displayed using the XSL file I've already created for it. It has also come to my attention that some browsers (e.g. Android default browser) won't parse the XML with the XSL file, and require a server-side transform. Is it possible to embed my XML into an HTML file but use a server-side transform?
