Reference: Analysis of neural network structure

I'm asking for good references on the structure analysis of neural networks, for example, is 100 layers convolutional neural network (CNN) better than a 10 layer CNN? When do we use more layers? When do we use what kind of pooling layer? etc. Those kind of analysis are very crucial to the design of a neural network. I have some engineering level of tunning a network, but they are all empirical. Academic analysis are eagerly needed. Paper or books involving this matter would be good^
