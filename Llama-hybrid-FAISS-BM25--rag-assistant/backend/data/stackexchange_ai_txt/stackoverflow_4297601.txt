try repair table , another good article The relevant section from the first link: MySQL database allows you to define a different MySQL storage engine for different tables. The storage engine is the engine used to store and retrieve data. Most popular storage engines are MyISAM and InnoDB. MyISAM tables -will- get corrupted eventually. This is a fact of life. Luckily, in most cases, MyISAM table corruption is easy to fix. To fix a single table, connect to your MySQL database and issue a: repair TABLENAME To fix everything, go with: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqlcheck --all-databases -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD -r A lot of times, MyISAM tables will get corrupt and you won't even know about it unless you review the log files. I highly suggest you add this line to your /etc/my.cnf config file. It will automatically fix MyISAM tables as soon as they become corrupt: [mysqld] myisam-recover=backup,force http://www.softwareprojects.com/resources/programming/t-how-to-fix-mysql-database-myisam-innodb-1634.html
