javascript regex to extract anchor text and URL from anchor tags

I have a paragraph of text in a javascript variable called 'input_content' and that text contains multiple anchor tags/links. I would like to match all of the anchor tags and extract anchor text and URL, and put it into an array like (or similar to) this: Array ( [0] => Array ( [0] => Yahoo [1] => http://yahoo.com [2] => Yahoo ) [1] => Array ( [0] => Google [1] => http://google.com [2] => Google ) ) I've taken a crack at it ( http://pastie.org/339755 ), but I am stumped beyond this point. Thanks for the help!
