Well... I think you could go for doing a sinchronization between the two sqlite databases, my idea is getting the tables and fields of each database, and loop over them to see what tables and fields are in one and not in the other. For getting started, these queries can be useful for you. -- For getting tables in current db SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table' ORDER BY name; -- For getting info about a table PRAGMA table_info('tabla_name');
