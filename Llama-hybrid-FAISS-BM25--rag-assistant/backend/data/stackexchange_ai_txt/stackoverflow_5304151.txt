You need to read up on Unchecked Exceptions - exceptions which inherit from RuntimeException. They don't need to be declared in the method header. http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html The last paragraph sums it up: If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception.
