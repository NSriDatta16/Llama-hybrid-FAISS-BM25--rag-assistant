How to convert varians of a character to the same character in python?

How to convert variants of a character to a same character in python. For example, the character a with the U+0061 Unicode has different variants like U+1D5BA , U+1D5EE , U+1D622 , U+1D656 , U+1D68A . How to uniform a text by converting the variants to a same character? Is there any library to do that? Actually I'm asking this question for a Non-English language. Is there any library which supports other languages? I asked the question here, because It's a preprocessing problem and those who do data science could help me.
