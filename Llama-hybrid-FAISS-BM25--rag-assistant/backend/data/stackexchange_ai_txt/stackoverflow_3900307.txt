Cleaner way to update nested structures

Say I have got following two case class es: case class Address(street: String, city: String, state: String, zipCode: Int) case class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String, address: Address) and the following instance of Person class: val raj = Person("Raj", "Shekhar", Address("M Gandhi Marg", "Mumbai", "Maharashtra", 411342)) Now if I want to update zipCode of raj then I will have to do: val updatedRaj = raj.copy(address = raj.address.copy(zipCode = raj.address.zipCode + 1)) With more levels of nesting this gets even more uglier. Is there a cleaner way (something like Clojure's update-in ) to update such nested structures?
