In my opinion, if you create .aspx page and get value from web form, it would be more real time testing than unit testing. I hope web service was already unit tested by the organization, which provide you this web service. I think, you just need to create .aspx form and get done your work. You can do unit testing for your entire development process satisfaction. It is good idea that unit test should be done by the person who wrote the code of class/function/web method. Let me know, if you have any question.
