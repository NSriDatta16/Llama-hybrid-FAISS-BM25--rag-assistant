Because of your users association, Rails already pre-builds the user_ids and users instance methods. Using @car.users should be your best bet. As for instance and class methods: instance methods are for specific objects, whereas class methods are just put under the class name for your convenience. @car.id is an instance method, since it returns the ID of a single car. Cars.find is a class method, since it is independent of any single object and instead is grouped under the Cars class for organizational purposes. (It could just as easily be its own global find_cars method and work just as well, though it would be horrible design.) So both of your methods should be instance methods, and the first one Rails creates for you because it loves you so much. As for your individual errors, adding objects to an array is done with the operator, not the plus sign. Ruby thinks you are trying to add two arrays, so is confused why you are trying to use a Fixnum in the same way you would typically use an array. Try making those fixes and see if you still get errors.
