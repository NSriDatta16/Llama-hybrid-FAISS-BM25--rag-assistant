"Not identically distributed" is generally is a conditional property, even though sometimes the conditioning variable is not observed, or at least not very obvious. For example, in a heteroskedastic fan-shaped plot with $E[y|x]=0, V[y|x]=x$, you can derive the marginal distribution of $y$ by integrating over $x$; and typically that would mean that if $y|x \sim N(0,x)$, then for most distributions of $x$, $y$ will be heavy tailed. If the goal of inference is the mean of $y$, then you can honestly bootstrap from that full marginal distribution; it will be the same as bootstrapping the pairs $(x,y)$, although arguably the latter will allow you to produce all the relevant analyses. Violation of independence is far more serious. Time series is one example (and block bootstrap is an answer to that). Cluster sampling is another (and cluster bootstrap is an answer to that). If an individual triggers multiple events (whatever that means in your application), then these events may or may not be independent.
