Wireshark leverages libpcap on unix platforms and its port WinPcap on Windows. This library provides an API to capture packets (Wireshark is also able to capture frames but I haven't found in pcap docs that pcap is able to do that). How the library does that is platform-specific, that's why a good way would be to use the library to do the heavy lifting for you; libpcap or tcpdump on unix (depending on how low-level you need it to be) and WinPcap or Windows Filtering Platform on Windows.
