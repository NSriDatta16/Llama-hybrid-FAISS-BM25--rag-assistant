As for session timeout problem, it must be the length of time configured in the server. You may need to review the php.ini file of the server. I have got to know that the following can alter this time: php_value session.gc_maxlifetime 72000 /* I have not tested this */ I think you can use my method to create a fingerprint id on user session using the following script on the page before leaving out from the website and on the page returning. $string = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; $string .= 'GHYU&*%HHD#JSFHJJFD(*JFJ'; // any long value /* Add any other data that is consistent */ $fingerprint = md5($string); if (isset($_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) { if ($_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] !== $fingerprint) { /* Prompt for password */ session_destroy(); header("Location:"."URL/PATH/TO/LOGIN"); } } else { $_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] = $fingerprint; }
