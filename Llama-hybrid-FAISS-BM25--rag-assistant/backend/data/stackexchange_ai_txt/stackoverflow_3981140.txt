How to save application state (variables' values, button states, etc) in Windows Phone 7 Silverlight application?

How can I save the state of my Silverlight application in case user pressed back button (or for example pressed on banner inside application) to set the same settings on application resume. Is there anything similar to registry in Windows Phone 7, some local storage? Can I use any database to hold application settings and variable values in it?
