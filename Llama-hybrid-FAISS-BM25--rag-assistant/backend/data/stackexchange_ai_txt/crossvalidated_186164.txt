ARMAX model and validation

I am new to time series and am trying to fit some time series data. I understand the general concept of ARIMA model. However, as I read more textbooks and articles from Rob Hyndman, I realized I could put some regressors using the xreg argument for the functions auto.arima or arima in R to get an ARMAX model. Therefore, I wonder if it is still necessary to include seasonality in ts(...,frequency) as everything can be specified as dummy variable within the xreg matrix and a more complicated seasonality structure (e.g. monthly seasonality) can be specified. In addition, what would be a good way to check the accuracy of the forecast? I am fitting multiple time series data with a hierarchical structure. Using auto.arima , I am able to select the best model and validate the model by looking at the residuals (check whether they are white noise). However, is there a way to even improve on the model if the prediction is still far from the actual data? To sum up, Is the frequency argument in ts function really necessary? Can I just specify everything in the xreg matrix? What would be a normal routine to improve on model after selecting the appropriate ARIMA model with the lowest AIC? Updates (Dec 17): I am now able to fit an ARIMA model with SARIMA error by specifying xreg argument and seasonal=F . One issue that I have with that is, my xreg matrix is not invertible (I assumed) and its not due to the presence of intercept term. Thus auto.arima() only fit a c(0,0,0) model. I then tried using Arima() to manually select model and it outputted the following error Error in optim(init[mask], armafn, method = optim.method, hessian = TRUE, : non-finite value supplied by optim I check the xreg matrix and it turns out column 48 (Day) and column 52 (2015) is causing the issue. Could you check if there's something wrong with my matrix structure ? If you think this additional updates should be asked in stack overflow or additional question, I will move it.
