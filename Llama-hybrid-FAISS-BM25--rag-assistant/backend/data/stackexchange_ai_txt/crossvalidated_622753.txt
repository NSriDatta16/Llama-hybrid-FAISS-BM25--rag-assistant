Optimal Bayes classifier is the classifier where you make the classification decision based on the known conditional distribution $$ \hat c = \underset{c}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; P(Y=c|X) $$ Knowing the distribution makes it optimal. Most, if not all, machine learning models can be defined in probabilistic terms as models that try to approximate the conditional distribution. We do not call those models Bayes classifiers, just classifiers. The name is reserved for the theoretical construct.
