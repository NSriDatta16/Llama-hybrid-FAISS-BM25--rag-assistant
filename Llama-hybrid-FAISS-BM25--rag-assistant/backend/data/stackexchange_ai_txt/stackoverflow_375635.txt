In theory there's a way if the iterator in question is at least a forward iterator. You can check whether your iterator is one of the iterators in [first,last) for each candidate container. Since you're using a vector container, you have a random access iterator, you can use the less-than operator to do this check quickly. You DO have to know all of the candidate vectors against which to check up front, and this is not a general way to get the container to which an iterator belongs. You can, however, define an extension of random access iterators by decorating random access iterator with something containing a pointer to the creating vector. This is likely to be slightly inelegant, inefficient, and inconvenient. So see if you can rewrite code to avoid this need first.
