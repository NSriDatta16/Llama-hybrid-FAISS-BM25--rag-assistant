As @Marcud D said, Data Vault is the model of Data Warehouse and usually when using DV modelling, you have to build data marts from DV for reporting purposes. I think that organizational unit should be modeled as Satellite table, not as Hub table. So, in any way, you should build a query to feed a specific data mart from DV model and then use it for reporting purposes.
