I think the problem is that you are trying to answer two questions with the same model. The Fisher test is for the crude odds ratio, collapsing across experimental levels. The logistic model does not test the crude OR. We do not want to conduct a crude or stratified analysis if the homogeneity of the odds ratio is not met in the experimental strata. The output from your saturated logistic model can be used to check this. Because you have coded Experimental level as a numeric, it's difficult to interpret the output. The ChoiceVAV effect is projected for an experimental level of 0. We have to use post-estimation to predict the actual, meaningful results from the experiment from the saturated logistic model. To get the OR for experiment one, you must add ChoiceVAV and ChoiceVAV:Experiment: 3.52 - 2.19 = 1.33 = log(35*13 /(20*6)). The last expression being the expression for the stratum specific OR for the first experiment. The second experiment has stratum specific OR 3.52 - 2*2.19 = -0.86 = log(12*11 /(10*31)). These are of opposite signs. So the homogeneity of the OR is violated. The crude OR is not quite (but close to) a test of the weighted average of these ORs. You can plainly see they average out to around 0. The crude OR verifies this. In summary, the two experiments produce massively conflicting findings and should not be combined into a single analysis. This is the problem of overfocusing on statistical significance. That the FET is not significant is exactly what is expected.
