How to perform variable/feature selection before random forest in R?

I have a phyloseq object with 4000+ taxa and 300+ samples. What methods/packages can I use to perform feature selection to reduce the number of taxa/OTUs prior to performing random forest? I was hoping to check correlations between different taxa. I'm planning to use the taxa as predictors of disease (i.e., disease~.).
