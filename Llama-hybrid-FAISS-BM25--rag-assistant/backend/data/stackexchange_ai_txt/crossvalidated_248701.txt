An overview of popular tree based models

There are many different widely used tree models. This is my notes and understanding of them. Could anyone tell me If I am correct on the model I mentioned If I am missing other "popular" tree model Statistic community (many packages can be found in R) CART (Classification And Regression Trees). This is from the classical book Classification and Regression Trees by Breiman. This is trademakred name of particular software implementations of the ideas. Tree package in R. Tree has been used for S Plus routines of Clark and Pregibon. RPART package in R. Free version of CART, and widely used in R, because of free it is even more popular than CART PARTY. Conditional Inference Tree Model Data mining community (many packages can be found in Java) ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3), Invented by Ross Quinlan. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains. C45, is an extension of ID3 that accounts for unavailable values, continuous attribute value ranges, pruning of decision trees, rule derivation, and so on. J48, is a re-implementation of C4.5 release 8 (hence the name J48) in Java. A lot of time has been spent getting the same results as the original C4.5. J48 implements both C4.5's confidence-based post-pruning (default) and sub-tree raising.
