Spoofing the user agent of an embedded Safari browser on the iPhone?

Is there any way to spoof the user agent on Safari on the iPhone? So for example, you would create an application on the iPhone that has the embedded Safari browser, however any website the user visits with this browser wouldn't know you were on Safari on the iPhone, it would think you are on something like Safari on a PC, or even IE/FireFox. Thanks
