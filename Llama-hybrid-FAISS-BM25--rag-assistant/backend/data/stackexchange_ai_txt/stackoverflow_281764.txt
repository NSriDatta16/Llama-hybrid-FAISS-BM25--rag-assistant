In CocoaTouch (iPhone OS) how do I find/eliminate leaks that the Instruments Leak tool doesn't find?

I have an iPhone app that is running great in the simulator. It responds well to the memory warnings by getting rid of everything that is not absolutely essential. When I run it on the device, it runs well. But after a certain amount of usage it crashes with error code 101 - which, from what I can tell, is the OS killing it due to memory usage. I can see the memory warning (I'm logging it), and my app responds to it, but dies shortly thereafter. If I look at the app in Instruments (either on the device or in sim), it doesn't find any leaks. In addition, the net memory usage is in the range of 600-700k bytes. Transitioning from the different views of my app increases memory usage (as expected), but when the views and controllers are released and dealloc'd, the memory usage never quite goes as low as it was. However, the addition is usually only something in the range of 1000-2000 bytes. So while Leaks shows me no leaks, I suspect there is an issue somewhere. I've also looked at all of the objects I'm allocating, and all of them seem to be reclaimed as expected. The only objects I see that keep increasing are GeneralBlock-N (where N is some number) Should I not pay any attention to Instruments net usage figure? What would be the next steps in trying to diagnose the issue? ADDED: I'm not making any calls to malloc() or any CoreFoundation libraries that would return a buffer that I'm responsible for. The only non-Obj-C calls I'm making are logging statements to NSLog.
