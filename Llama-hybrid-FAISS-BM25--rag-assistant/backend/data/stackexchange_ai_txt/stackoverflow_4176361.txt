You're making an assumption here that's not necessarily true: that there's something there already waiting in the unscrolled area. An application can build scroll bars for a certain height or width and not actually render anything to the surface until the user actual drags the scroll bar. The image you want to capture exists only in potential. This can be used to improve performance â€” think just-in-time loading, or reducing memory use. It's a fairly common technique, and so what you're asking for doesn't really make sense.
