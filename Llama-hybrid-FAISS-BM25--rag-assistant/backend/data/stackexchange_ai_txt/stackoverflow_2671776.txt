C# winforms: A problem with sending an email cointaining the image background

I'm trying to figure out how to resolve the problem: I create the MailMessage object like that and send it: MailMessage mail = new MailMessage(); mail.From = new MailAddress("me@mycompany.com"); mail.To.Add("login@gmail.com"); mail.Subject = "This is an email"; AlternateView plainView = AlternateView.CreateAlternateViewFromString("This is my plain text content, viewable by those clients that don't support html", null, MediaTypeNames.Text.Plain); (1) AlternateView htmlView = AlternateView.CreateAlternateViewFromString("Here is an embedded image. ", null, "text/html"); LinkedResource logo = new LinkedResource("c:\\cop1.jpg"); logo.ContentId = "companylogo"; htmlView.LinkedResources.Add(logo); mail.AlternateViews.Add(plainView); mail.AlternateViews.Add(htmlView); Everything is OK, the mail has the image in the background. But the problem is, when I change in the paragraph (1) from (click) to (click) everything fails, the image is not recognized and is threated as a attachment ! I think that is caused by the first colon here background-image:cid:companylogo Is it possible to resolve that ?
