Though I haven't played with datadir property but I've changed data storage location to the external HD by mounting default location to it as follows: Backup your current data directory Delete everything from your data directory Mount it to your external HD ( mount /var/lib/mysql/data /dev/XXX ) I've done it at Ubuntu Server. When changing InnoDB specific directories I've noticed that one have to be careful with rights (apparmord in case of ubuntu). When mysql cannot perform some filesystem operation I find its error messages very misleading. Sometimes it is really helpful to study it's error.log (/var/log/mysql/error.log in my case). Hope this helps you to resolve your issue ASAP.
