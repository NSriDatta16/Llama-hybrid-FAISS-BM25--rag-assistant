SQL group by LIKE pattern

I have the following table: what i want to do is group: group by firstname and address on this sort of data | firstname | address +-----------+---------- | alex | 338 s. michigan | mark | finger | alex | 338 south michigan | ted | port But the group by will not return similar values of the address field. Is there a pattern I can apply to the group by? I want to use the LIKE pattern system . for example : select firstname, address from t group by firstname, '%'+SUBSTRING(address,0,5)+'%' but that query doesn't seem to work. Any ideas? Thanks!
