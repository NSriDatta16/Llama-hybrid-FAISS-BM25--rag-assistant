If you're not keen on SQL, you could simply embed a template within the template that you're working on. Here's a simple example that assumes you're editing the index and meta templates inside of a template group called 'news' : index template contents: {exp:channel:entries channel="news"} {title} {body} {embed="news/meta" this_entry_id="{entry_id}"} {/exp:channel:entries} meta template contents: {exp:channel:entries channel="news" dynamic="no" limit="1" entry_id="{embed:this_entry_id}"} {entry_date} {author} {/exp:channel:entries} As you can see, the index template is embedding the meta template. Note that we're passing a parameter to the meta template so that it knows which entry ID to print information about. If you're unfamiliar with EE's template embedding feature, you can read more about it in the EE docs . Embedding templates in other templates is a great way to access the {exp:channel:entries} loop multiple times.
