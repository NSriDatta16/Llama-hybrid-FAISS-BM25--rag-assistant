Both R and SAS can handle your situation: For R you can check http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/melogit.htm . It is called Mixed Effects Logistic Regression. I think it is another name for "Multivariate Logistic Regression" note it is not "Multiple Logistic Regression" To use SAS you can either use proc Genmod (GEE) http://www.math.unm.edu/~bedrick/glm/examples1.pdf or Proc GLIMMIX procedure to conduct a mixed effect logistic regression http://www.lexjansen.com/wuss/2006/analytics/ANL-Dai.pdf
