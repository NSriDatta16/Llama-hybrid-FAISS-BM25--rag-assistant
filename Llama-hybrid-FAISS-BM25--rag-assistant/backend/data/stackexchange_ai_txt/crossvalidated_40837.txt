I think you should use logistic regression with verdict as the dependent variable and sex of attorney and powerless language as independent variables. First, you need to consider how to operationalize 'powerless language'. You say you have a frequency count, but it might be better to scale this by the amount of language. Trials last very different times, so perhaps your measure should be "powerless statements per hour" or some such. Call this variable PL (you can call it whatever you'd like). All your hypotheses are about language of the defense attorney, which simplifies things a bit. The next independent variable is sex of the defense attorney. Code this, e.g., 1 for female and 0 for male. Suppose your dependent variable is labeled "V" and can be G or NG (guilty or not guilty). Then your model is P(G) ~ PL + S + PL*S where ~ means "is related to" Then you use logistic regression. In R m1 In SAS proc logistic data = mydata; class sex; model V = PL|Sex; run;
