Association of binned data

this is my first question here, hoping you all can help. I have tenure and age data for an organization that has been binned already, and unfortunately don't have access to the actual ages/tenures of each employee. They're related, but not every new employee is young. Both age and tenure are sorted into five levels, but the range of each level is different. So for instance the tenure levels 1 is How can I find the association between age and tenure for the organization? Thanks!
