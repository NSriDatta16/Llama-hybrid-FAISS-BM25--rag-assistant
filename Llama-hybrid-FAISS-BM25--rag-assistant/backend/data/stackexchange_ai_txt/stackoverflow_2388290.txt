Polling is one way to do this, but if you are using SQL Server 2005 or later, a more elegant solution is to use SQL Server Query Notifications. This allows you to specify a query (for example "SELECT ID FROM Tickets") and be notified when the results change. There is a great tutorial on how to do this on CodeProject: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/QueryNotifications.aspx
