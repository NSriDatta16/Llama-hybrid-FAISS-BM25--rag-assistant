I would maybe set the width and height of the paragraph, and fix it using absolute positioning relative to the enclosing uPic div. That way you can have the paragraph of description appear "above" the image on hover without disturbing the flow. So, add position: relative; to the uPic, add something along the lines of position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; to the , and then adjust other things to suit.
