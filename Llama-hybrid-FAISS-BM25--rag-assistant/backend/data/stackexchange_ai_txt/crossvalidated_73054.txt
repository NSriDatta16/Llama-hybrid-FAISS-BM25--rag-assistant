How to transform this dataset to make classes linearly separable?

I have this data set: And I want to transform the data (with a RBF kernel?) in order to be able to do a simple linear ridge-classifier. I know I can do more or less the same thing using a kernel SVM with a RBF kernel but I have to use the ridge classifier. Does anyone know how it (if?) can be done? This is kinda homeworkish so I don't want a full solution I just want some input.
