Rails - delete one side of a one-to-many relationship

Quick question: If I have a one-to-many relationship, such as this: class SalesPerson how can I delete a Sales Person, without negatively impacting the deals associated with them? The use-case for this would be if someone left the organization. We still need a record of the deals in the database, but that sales person record is no longer needed. Would it just be better to have an active/inactive flag on the sales person instead? Thanks.
