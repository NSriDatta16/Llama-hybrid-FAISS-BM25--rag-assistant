In simple terms, a cycle is when bundle A depends on bundle B which depends on bundle A. If this is source code, then there's no way of building the bundles seperately in one pass. Since the problem only shows in Eclipse, it may be a binary circular dependency as opposed to a source code circular dependency. There is support for binary cycles in recent versions of Eclipse: Eclipsesource Blog If the cycle is in your code, then I suggest refactoring the code by breaking out some of the code to a 3rd bundle to remove the circular dependency. And watch out if you are using OSGi fragments (a common pattern for unit testing) as it is very easy to introduce cycles. Eclipse's manifest editor does have functionality on the "Dependencies" tab for looking for cycles (you need to click on "Dependency Analysis"), but I've never seen it show a cycle even when Eclipse has a big red X telling me there's a cycle!
