Found one page (in german language) which describes the same problem: JButton widgets only show up after hovering over them. The problem there was that AWT and Swing components/widgets have been mixed. I can't see from your code fragment if this is the case, but if you have java.awt.* imports, disable them, refactor your code to only use Swing classes and try again / hope for the best. Another suggestion was to explicitely do a setVisible(true) for every button, but the questioner said, that this didn't help in his case.
