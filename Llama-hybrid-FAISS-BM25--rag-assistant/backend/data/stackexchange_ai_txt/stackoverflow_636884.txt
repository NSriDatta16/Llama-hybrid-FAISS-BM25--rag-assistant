ConText or EditPad Pro both offer syntax highlighting for Delphi code, as do many other programmers editors (they sometimes call it Pascal though). I've used both of those though, and they work really well. I use them when I want to open code fragments or samples. They both have a nice feature of being able to associate specific commands with certain file types. So you could associate the Delphi command-line compiler or your build script with your source files to allow you to build, run unit tests, etc. from there. I've done similar with other command line compilers, but frankly I really like the Delphi IDE so have had no need to try to replace it.
