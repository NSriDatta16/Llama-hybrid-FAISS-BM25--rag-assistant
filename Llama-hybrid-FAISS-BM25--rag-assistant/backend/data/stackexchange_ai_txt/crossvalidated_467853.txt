The Cauchy distribution in R ( rcauchy , pcauchy , etc) gives you the ability to change the scale (something like variance) while maintaining the super-fat tails of the $t_1$ distribution. You can play with the scale parameter to find what value gives you the $0.025$ quantile at $-0.1$ like you want. The theory behind this is that you’re stretching or compressing $t_1$ but not really changing the shape. Think about a normal distribution with different variance parameters. Sure, the curve is different, but the spirit is the same: a mound shape. Be warned that the tails of a Cauchy distribution are really heavy, so heavy that Cauchy doesn’t even have an expected value!
