Moving Average (MA) process: numerical intuition

This forum is full of questions regarding MA processes; for instance: Confusion about Moving Average(MA) Process . There seem to be a lot of confusion wrt MA processes. I think having a numerical example would help. Let us say I want to model the following observations: t 1 2 3 4 5 6 Y 5 6 -4 8 10 -2 I find that I can model it using the following MA(2) process: $\hat{Y}_t=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_t+\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{t-1}$ The average is zero, so I guess the errors are equal to the observations, so that: t 1 2 3 4 5 6 Y 5 6 -4 8 10 -2 e 5 6 -4 8 10 -2 e-1 NA 5 6 -4 8 10 Å¶ NA 5.5 1 2 9 4 Is this how Y is forecast in a MA model?
