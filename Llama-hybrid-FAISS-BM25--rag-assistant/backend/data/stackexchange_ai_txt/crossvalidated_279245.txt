Probability notation in logistic regression

I found these expressions for the probability of an outcome $y$ given variables $x$ and parameter $W$. $\theta$ is the logistic function. $p(y \mid x,W) = Bernoulli(y \mid \theta(W^\intercal X) ) )$ adapted from [ 1 ] $p(y \mid x,W) = \theta(y W^\intercal X) $ [ 1 ] adapted from [2] I presume both are correct. How can interpret the first one where the argument of the Bernoulli distribution has a conditional. [2] youtube/qSTHZvN8hzs?t=44m1s
