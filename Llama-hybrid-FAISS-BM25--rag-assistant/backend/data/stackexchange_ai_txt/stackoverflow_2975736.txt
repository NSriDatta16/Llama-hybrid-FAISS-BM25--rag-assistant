It is guaranteed to work in any mainstream browser (I'm not taking browsers with less than 0.05% market share into consideration). Heck, it works in Internet Explorer 3.0. RFC 3986 defines a URI as composed of the following parts: foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose \_/ \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/ | | | | | scheme authority path query fragment When defining relative URIs ( Section 5.2 ), you can omit any of those sections, always starting from the left. In pseudo-code, it looks like this: result = "" if defined(scheme) then append scheme to result; append ":" to result; endif; if defined(authority) then append "//" to result; append authority to result; endif; append path to result; if defined(query) then append "?" to result; append query to result; endif; if defined(fragment) then append "#" to result; append fragment to result; endif; return result; The URI you are describing is a scheme-less relative URI.
