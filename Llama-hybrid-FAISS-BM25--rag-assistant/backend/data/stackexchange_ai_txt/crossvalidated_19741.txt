I don't know how to answer your question. However, I want to give one slight word of caution about trusting the "worst case" and "best case" estimates too much. There has been a lot of research suggesting that people tend to be overly confident in their estimates, and to underestimate the degree of uncertainty in their answers. For instance, you can give people a 20-question quiz, where each quiz question asks them something they don't know (e.g., "How many gas stations are there in the US?"), but rather than asking them to give the answer, you ask them to give a 90% confidence interval. Then, you grade their quiz by marking their answer correct if the true answer falls within their chosen interval, and false otherwise. If we were perfect at estimating our own level of confidence accurately, you would expect that people would score on average about 18 out of 20 questions correct. Instead, what you find is that most people's scores are much lower. In other words, they choose a confidence interval that is too narrow, underestimating their lack of knowledge or the amount of uncertainty in their estimate. Therefore, if you ask people for the best case and worst case time to complete a task, I would expect their worst-case estimates to be too optimistic: I would expect that the true worst case may be significantly worse than their estimates would indicate. This bias seems to be a fundamental human phenomenom, that is difficult to counter (even for experts). So, just beware that the amount of uncertainty in your estimates may be greater than your polls of the experts may indicate. I don't know of any easy way to correct for this through statistics; it is just something you'll have to be aware of and keep in mind.
