DragManager and its associated constructs are specifically for dragging and dropping. You will likely want to place your draggable item inside of a canvas with scroll policies turned off, and capture MOUSE_DOWN on the object, then activate MOUSE_MOVE, translating its origin analogous to the change in mouse position, deactivating the MOUSE_MOVE listener when MOUSE_UP or Event.MOUSE_LEAVE fires on the stage.
