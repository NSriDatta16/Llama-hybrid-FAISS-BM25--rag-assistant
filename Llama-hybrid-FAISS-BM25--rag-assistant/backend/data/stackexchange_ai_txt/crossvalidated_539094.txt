Comparing CNNs with same training data but different number of classes

I train a CNN image classifier for classes tabby cat , tiger cat and dog . Since tabby cat and tiger cat are subcategories of cat , I also train a classifier for the classes cat and dog . Finally, I want to compare both classifiers performance-wise. I need to have a balanced dataset, i.e. each class has the same number of samples. This is easy implementable for the first classifier. But how do I approach this for the second classifier, given that I want to train both classifiers on the same samples? If I just put all cat samples together I would have twice the number of samples for this class compared to dog and the dataset is not balanced anymore. If I ranomly prune my cat samples, the second classifier wouldn't have as many samples to learn from and wouln'd be comparable to the first one.
