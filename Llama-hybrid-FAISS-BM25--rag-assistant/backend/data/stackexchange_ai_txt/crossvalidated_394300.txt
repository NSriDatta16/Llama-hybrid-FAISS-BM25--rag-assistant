Using some objective priors (for unbounded space) in a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC

I'm doing some simulations using a M-H MCMC, and I was thinking of using some objective priors for some parameters. These parameters must be in $\mathbb{R}^+$ . I was thinking of using $\pi(\theta)\propto 1$ . Are there any inconveniences? Should I take care with some possible issue?
