Contemporary Frequentists?

My background is Bayesian. I know who to turn to for foundational discussion on this school of thought. To writers like MacKay, Gelman and Jaynes. Who do I turn to for a recent exposition of frequentist thought? I want a (fairly) thorough account of what the underlying philosophy is. That is, what is the connection between probabilities and the real world, where does the usefulness of the system begin and end, arguments for the systematic superiority of the system. I am aware there are different testing procedures within frequentism. But I'm craving someone willing to draw a line in the sand and say: 'This is what I think and here's why.' Even if it is a polemic in favour of eclecticism. I'm also not asking for the math, for an explanation of the Kolmogorov system. Stephen Senn might be a contender? But I'm not sure how committed he is to staking out a position. He seems more of a critic. I'm asking for someone recent because I suspect many arguments based on pragmatic considerations will have found the facts moving underfoot.
