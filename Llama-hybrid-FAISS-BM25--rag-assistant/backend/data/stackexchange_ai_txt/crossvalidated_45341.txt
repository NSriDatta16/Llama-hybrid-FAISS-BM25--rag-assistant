p-value for correlation/co-occurrence in sets of intervals

I'd like to have a probability measure for the co-occurrence of intervals in two datasets of intervals. dataset1: [125,500],[900,1300],[2220,2500], ... dataset2: [600,800],[1200,1400],[3020,3500], ... (Two exemplary datasets with an overlap in the second intervals) The intervals within a dataset are represented by the coordinates of their start and end (just two integer values). Within a dataset intervals are non-overlapping. The number, average lengths and distribution of intervals may be very different between two datasets, but the length of the dataset that is the maximal integer a coordinate can have is identical and known for both. I am looking for a kind of p-value for the probability that there is a "correlation" between two datasets, that is that intervals overlap more frequently (or on the whole more widely in terms of intersection length) than can be expected by chance. I would be grateful for suggestions on how to address the problem in practical as well as statistical terms (perhaps using R). Perhaps there is even a solution for the "correlation" between multiple datasets ... Thanks a lot :-)
