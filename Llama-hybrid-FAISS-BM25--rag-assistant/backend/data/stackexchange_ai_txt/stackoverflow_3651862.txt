Better variable exploring when debugging C++ code with Eclipse/CDT

Using Eclipse and CDT to debug C++ code the variable windows is cumbersome and not very informative for types defined in the standard template library or in boost (e.g. shared_ptr). Just an example how this may look like for an std::vector: bar {…} std::_Vector_base , std::allocator > > _M_impl {…} std::allocator > {…} _M_start 0x00007ffff7fb5010 _M_finish 0x00007ffff7fd4410 _M_end_of_storage 0x00007ffff7fd5010 Even if this information about the internals of those types may be useful, in almost any cases I would expect a clearer presentation here, i.e. a list of values for the std::vector. Are there any tools, plugins or other modifications around which can do this? EDIT The following solutions does not work for linux. I am using ubuntu 14.04, eclipse, g++, gdb. I cant find a package gdb-python and linux does not use mingw
