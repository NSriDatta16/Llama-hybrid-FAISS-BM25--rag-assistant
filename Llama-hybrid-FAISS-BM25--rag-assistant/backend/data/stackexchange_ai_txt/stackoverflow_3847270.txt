In R, what is the difference between class ts and class timeSeries?

In R, what is the difference between class ts and class timeSeries ? I think I am getting a problem in HoltWinters because of that. I'm getting: data(LakeHuron) x "Error in decompose(ts(x[1L:wind], start = start(x), frequency = f), seasonal) : time series has no or less than 2 periods" even though gamma=0 . Running R 2.11.1 (win32 x86) on a Windows 7 x64 machine.
