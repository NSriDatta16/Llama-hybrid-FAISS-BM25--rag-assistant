Out-of-Fold sample predictions using xgboost with xgb.cv

Is it possible to get the out-of-fold predictions when applying xgboost with xgb.cv? With randomForest, predict(RFfit) gives you the OOB predictions (resulting from the CV process); with gbm, fitgbm$cv.fitted gives you the OOF predictions (somewhat similar to CV predictions). However, I have not found something similar with xgb.cv or xgboost.
