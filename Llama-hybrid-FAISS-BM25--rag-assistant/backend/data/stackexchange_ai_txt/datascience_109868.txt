regression.fit(x_train, y_train) is not working on python

I try to deal with my homework. The Job is to take the Achievement data and perform a multi-linear regression on it. The code is published here . I am quite new to programming in Python and in data science. I obtained a R2 value to be -0.03558318907299585 which is too wrong to be true. I tried to incoporate and make my array into numpy but it still doesn't seem to work. Does anyone know how I could perform this linear regression?
