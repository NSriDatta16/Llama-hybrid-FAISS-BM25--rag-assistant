Openstreetmap: embedding map in webpage (like Google Maps)

Is there a way to embed/mashup the OpenStreetMap in your page (like the way Google Maps API works)? I need to show a map inside my page with some markers and allow dragging/zooming around, maybe routing. I suspect there would be some Javascript API for this, but I can't seem to find it. Searching gets me an API for access to raw map data , but that seems to be more for map editing; besides, working with that would be a heavy task for AJAX.
