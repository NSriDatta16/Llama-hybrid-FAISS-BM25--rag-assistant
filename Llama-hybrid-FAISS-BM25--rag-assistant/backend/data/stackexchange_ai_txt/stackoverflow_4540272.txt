Html newbie! background-image question

I'm learning HTML and I wanted to practice by recreating a invoice sent to me by Electronics Expo. However, I used the background-image property and repeated it by repeat-x and now, the background stretches across the page so much that it has a horizontal bar to drag. http://htmlpocketreference.110mb.com/index.html You can see what I did in my link above. Also, I would really appreciate some advice on simplifying my CSS coding. It seems really messy and I have to move every element once something changes. -.- Thanks!
