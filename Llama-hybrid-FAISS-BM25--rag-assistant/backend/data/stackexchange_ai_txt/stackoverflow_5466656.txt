Adrian, As you have tagged this as an asp.net question I would direct your attention to jquery (jquery.com). If you use a vanilla template (wrapping your elements in simple "div" tags) and use the jquery tools to do addClass/removeClass and toggleClass and apply various css styles to achieve the visual effect you desire you should be able to land just were you wish. Using page methods you can leverage your custom update on a partial postback from jquery and reduce the server impact. If you would rather do this server side you are probable looking to leverage the item databound event to set your template. A more complete answer would require more information about what you are trying to accomplish. Cheers, CEC
