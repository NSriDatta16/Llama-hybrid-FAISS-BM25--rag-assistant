Multivariate normal posterior

This is a very simple question but I can't find the derivation anywhere on the internet or in a book. I would like to see the derivation of how one Bayesian updates a multivariate normal distribution. For example: imagine that $$ \begin{array}{rcl} \mathbb{P}({\bf x}|{\bf μ},{\bf Σ}) & = & N({\bf \mu}, {\bf \Sigma}) \\ \mathbb{P}({\bf \mu}) &= & N({\bf \mu_0}, {\bf \Sigma_0})\,. \end{array} $$ After observing a set of ${\bf x_1 ... x_n}$, I would like to compute $\mathbb{P}({\bf \mu | x_1 ... x_n})$. I know that the answer is $\mathbb{P}({\bf \mu | x_1 ... x_n}) = N({\bf \mu_n}, {\bf \Sigma_n})$ where $$ \begin{array}{rcl} \bf \mu_n &=& \displaystyle\Sigma_0 \left(\Sigma_0 + \frac{1}{n}\Sigma\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\bf x_i}\right) + \frac{1}{n}\Sigma\left(\Sigma_0+\frac{1}{n}\Sigma\right)^{-1}\mu_0 \\ \bf \Sigma_n & =&\displaystyle \Sigma_0\left(\Sigma_0 + \frac{1}{n}\Sigma\right)^{-1}\frac{1}{n}\Sigma \end{array}$$ I am looking for the derivation of this result with all the intermediate matrix algebra. Any help is much appreciated.
