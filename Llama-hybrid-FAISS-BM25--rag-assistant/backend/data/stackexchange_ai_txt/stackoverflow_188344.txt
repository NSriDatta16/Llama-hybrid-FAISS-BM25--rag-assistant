Caching Application Block Error

Has anyone seen this error before? An error occurred creating the configuration section handler for cachingConfiguration: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Caching, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040) (C:\WorkingDir\Projects\ReportCentral\ReportCentral\bin\Debug\ReportCentral.vshost.exe.config line 5) I am using Ent Lib 4.0. I changed my App Traget Framework from 2.0 to 3.5. Edit ~ I have the following in the bin Caching.dll Common.dll ObjectBuilder2.dll Edit ~ "Solution" This was the deal, when referencing dlls in the C:\EntLib4Src\bin, they are signed and could only be configured by the EntLibConfig.exe found in that same folder and not the one from "Start>Programs>Microsoft Patterns...>Ent Wasn't that tricky?
