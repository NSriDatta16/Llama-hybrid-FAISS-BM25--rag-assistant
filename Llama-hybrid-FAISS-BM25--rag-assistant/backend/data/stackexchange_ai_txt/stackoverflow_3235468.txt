Since you're looking for every possible schedule, I think the best solution you will find will be a simple exhaustive search. The only thing I can say algorithmically is that your data structure of lists of strings is pretty terrible. The implementation is hugely language dependent so I don't even think pseudo-code would make sense, but I'll try to give the steps for the basic algorithm. Pop off the first n items of the same type and put them in list. For each item in list, add that item to schedule set. Pop off next n items of same type off list. For each item that starts after the first item ends, put on list. (If none, fail) Continue until done. Hardest part is deciding exactly how to construct the lists/recursion so it's most elegant.
