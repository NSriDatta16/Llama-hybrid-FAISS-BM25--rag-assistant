Suggestions for a multi-class text classification model with a large number of classes?

I was working on a text classification problem where I currently have around 40-45 different labels. The input is a text sentence with a keyword. For e.g. This phone is the most durable in the market is the input sentence and the out label is X and all the words in the output with label X will have durable as a keyword. What would be a good model to fit this? I tried basic SVM, Random Forest but to no use. I am not sure how to leverage the keyword to create a better model. Any suggestions would be very welcome. Thanks!
