(In Ruby) allowing mixed-in class methods access to class constants

I have a class with a constant defined for it. I then have a class method defined that accesses that class constant. This works fine. An example: #! /usr/bin/env ruby class NonInstantiableClass Const = "hello, world!" class My problem arises in attempting to move this class method out to an external module, like so: #! /usr/bin/env ruby module CommonMethods def shout_my_constant puts Const.upcase end end class NonInstantiableClass Const = "hello, world!" class Ruby interprets the method as requesting a constant from the module, rather than the class: line 5:in `shout_my_constant': uninitialized constant CommonMethods::Const (NameError) So, what magic tricks do you fellows have to let the method access the class constant? Many thanks.
