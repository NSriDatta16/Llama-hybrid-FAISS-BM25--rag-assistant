Anomaly Detection System

I need a sanity check. I want to create an anomaly detection system. The logic which I am planning to use is the following: Find anomalies in the past using Seasonal Hybrid Extreme Studentized Deviate Test. Binarise the anomalies (1 the anomalies and 0 the trends). Run several algorithms (Autoencoders, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Lasso Regression, etc) with variables that are correlated and validate the models and use it. Does the binarisation process makes sense?
