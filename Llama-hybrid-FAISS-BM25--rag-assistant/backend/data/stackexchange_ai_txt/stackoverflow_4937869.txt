Draggable NSButton

Is there any way of making an NSButton draggable? I mean like in the final built application, the user can drag the NSButton. I'm trying to do something almost "Dashboard" style... like draggable things. At the moment, I'm just using NSButtons that stay in place, but it'd be nice if they could be dragged around.
