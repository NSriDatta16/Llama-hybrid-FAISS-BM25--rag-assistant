Heroku app not pulling S3 images on other machines

I recently added photo uploading to a web application that I'm hosting on heroku. I'm using S3 for storage and it's working great, however when other users go onto the site, they see a photo missing icon rather than the photo. On my machine however, I see the photos on the site. Any clues as to what is happening? Thanks!
