You difference the trend in pure time series models such as ARIMA. However, there are many approaches which take care of the non-constant trend without necessarily differencing. For instance, consider ARIMAX model: $$y_t=c+\beta t^2+\phi_1 y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$$ Here, you have the nonlinear trend $t^2$ and as typical autoregressive term $y_{t-1}$ . This is just one approach of many possible
