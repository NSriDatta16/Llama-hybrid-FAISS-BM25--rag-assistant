Generic test automation framework for Python

I'm working as a system administrator/infrastructure engineer, and sometimes I am wasting my time on checking if everything working properly after infrastructure changes. I want to write some tests, such as: Download some CSS/JavaScript code from a website Login to website Upload some file and try to download it Login to a server and execute some script And so on. Most unit testing frameworks focused on unit testing and code coverage, but all I need is just a configurable runner for my tests with nice reporting and may be additional modules for ease of writing HTTP tests. Possibility to use this tool for stress-testing would be an advantage. I've found many names (testoob, functest, robotframework, py.test, etc.), but I don't know what to choose.
