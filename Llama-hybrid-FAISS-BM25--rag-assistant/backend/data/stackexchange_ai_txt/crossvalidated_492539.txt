Poisson Process Method of Moments

Disclaimer: This is a homework problem A School of Ornithology researcher wants to estimate the number of red-tailed hawks in Ithaca. She radio tags 10 birds, and then sets up a feeding station with automatic camera The researcher believes that each individual bird's visits to the feeder can be modeled as a Poisson process with some unknown rate $\lambda$ . Over the first five weeks, she observes an average of 28.8 birds (tagged and untagged) visiting the feeder, with an average of 6 tagged birds per week. Use the method of moments to obtain an estimate for the total population. The method of moments is a way to estimate the parameters by gathering a system of equations using empirical moments and setting them equal to the actual moments. Here, we only need one equation for one unknown: $\lambda$ . The way I understand this problem, we have $m_1 = \frac{X_1+X_2+X_3+X_4+X_5}{5} = 6$ . Then we want $\mu_1 = E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda} = m_1 = 6 \implies \lambda = \tfrac 16$ . However, I am unsure of my reasoning here as this does not take into account the untagged birds. I am also not sure if I am understanding the empirical moment correctly from this problem.
