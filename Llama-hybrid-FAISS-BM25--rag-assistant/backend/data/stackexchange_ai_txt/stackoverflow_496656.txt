First of all: class attributes, or instance attributes? Or both? =) Usually you just add instance attributes in __init__ , and class attributes in the class definition, often before method definitions... which should probably cover 90% of use cases. If code adds attributes on the fly, it probably (hopefully :-) has good reasons for doing so... leveraging dynamic features, introspection, etc. Other than that, adding attributes this way is probably less common than you think.
