Statistical analysis of amino acid profiles, quantitative vs qualitative methods?

I work on a study comparing the amino acid profile of 5 sample groups with 3 replicates in each group. This is how the data looks like except that there are 17 columns (one for each amino acid) in total. The values represent the measured level (in micromole per gram sample, not percentage of total) of individual amino acid in each sample. Group Asp Asn Glu Gln His ... A 13 8 9 15 12 A 5 7 6 11 1 A 10 15 1 14 13 B 13 10 11 5 7 B 12 5 10 9 4 B 6 2 13 1 5 C 9 4 3 15 1 C 2 4 10 1 5 C 5 9 8 7 14 D 5 13 2 10 6 D 7 13 9 1 5 D 13 12 5 8 15 E 15 7 4 2 1 E 1 2 15 14 8 E 1 3 2 13 5 I used an ANOVA to compare the mean sum of total amino acids between groups, then I ran a PCA to visualize differences in profile. I was asked by a reviewer to also analyze for significant differences in individual amino acids . I generally find PCAs sufficient for this type of analysis. Besides, the number of samples per group is small (n = 3) and there may be correlation between the response variables (i.e. individual amino acid content) meaning the results of multiple univariate ANOVAs (for each amino acid) may be misleading (inflating type I error). Correlation seems to be an issue for multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) as well. In this specific case a MANOVA would be rank defficient anyway. But there are examples of comparable data published in the scientific literature where multiple univariate ANOVAs are used to detect difference in individual amino acids between groups. Does anyone has good arguments for or against using multiple univariate ANOVAs or other quantitative methods in such cases?
