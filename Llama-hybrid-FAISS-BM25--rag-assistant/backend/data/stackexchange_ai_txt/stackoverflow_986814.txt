Dublin Core is an informal standard set of attributes for documents and media. The attributes are: Title Creator Subject Description Publisher Contributor Date Type Format Identifier Source Language Relation Coverage Rights There's a fair bit of thought from folks who've run document/media management applications for years behind this list. I think it's a good resource to scan down for ideas of what attributes your users might find valuable that you might miss at first (such as creator vs publisher vs contributer vs source). I wouldn't just dump all those into your application without thinking about if they're relevant. I think you do want a table that associates images to articles. Otherwise if you need to know what images an article uses, such as for deleting an article and it's images, the only way to find the associated images is to parse the article body itself. This makes for awkward SQL using string processing functions, or forces processing in your app, both of which could be performance problems if you need to process a group of articles at once. You could still just use image tags in the article body for laying out the images however, avoiding any more complicated custom markup system. Just write your model so that it parses out the image tags and updates the join table when you create/edit an article. A little nokogiri and attachment_fu (or their alternatives) should make this a quick job.
