Average deviation from mean of Irwin-Hall distribution

Consider the Irwin-Hall distribution, which for me means $X_n$ is the sum of $n$ uniform iid variables in $[-1/2, 1/2]$ . I would like an absolute lower bound for $E[|X_n|]$ . By general theory we know that it approaches an explicit constant times $\sqrt{n}$ , but I would like a statement of the form: for all $n > N$ , we have $E[|X_n|] > c\sqrt{n}$ for explicit $c$ and $N$ . I am aware that one way to achieve such a statement is from Holder's inequality, applied to say the first and fourth moments and comparing with the second moment. However, this may be a bit weak, and the $N$ we get may be quite large. Ideally I would want a statement that is true for $N$ relatively small (e.g. 1-digit would be great), and maybe a better bound if possible. Of course I can explicitly compute using a program what it is for small $N$ . So one strategy that might work for what I need is a statement that the actual $c$ one gets for $n$ gets closer to the limiting value of $c$ after a certain point, and check the values by hand for all $n$ up to that value. Edit: to clarify, and in light of Henry's answer, it seems that these $c$ -values decrease with $N$ , so that the limiting value is indeed an absolute lower bound. So I am really looking for a proof that these $c$ -values do indeed decrease. In some other contexts it seems that some results have been proven regarding monotonic convergence towards the central limit theorem, which is the flavor of result I need, but I haven't found anything that directly implies it.
