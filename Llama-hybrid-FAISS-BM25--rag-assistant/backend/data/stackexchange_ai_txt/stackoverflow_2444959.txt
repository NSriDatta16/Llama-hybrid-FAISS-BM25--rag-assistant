Would you use Code Bubbles?

I've read this question mentioning Code Bubbles and I've watched their video presentation. The video is impressive, and does seem a little bit futuristic, but apparently it's somewhat real. But that kept me thinking... Would a developer really use such tool? We, as developers, are used to deal with code files, organizing them in directories, in one way or another, some common IDE (for those language that has them). It would be a great leap to use something like Code Bubbles, as they propose. I, personally, am not sure if I could work in such environment... although I think I would just need some adjusting... but I really don't see my mind working out the kinks of it. What are your thoughts on this?
