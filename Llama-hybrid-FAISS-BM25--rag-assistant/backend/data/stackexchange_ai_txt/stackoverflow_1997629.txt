Take a look at the Apple example LazyTableImages . If you request all the images for your table asynchronously, they will load as they arrive. You'll notice some applications wait for scrollViewDidEndDragging and loadImagesForOnscreenRows to be truly lazy and only request images for rows the user is currently examining.
