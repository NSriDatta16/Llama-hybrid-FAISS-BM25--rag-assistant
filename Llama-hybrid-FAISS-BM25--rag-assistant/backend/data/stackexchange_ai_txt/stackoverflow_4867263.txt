I've always used build scripts to handle this kind of process, since you're using TC6 you should be able to add a second build step after your VS.NET solution builder which performs the copy/move. MSBuild would probably be the preferred scripting method for doing this but you could use a simple console runner if you all you need to do is copy. Using a scripted approach you should be able to use an absolute path for the deployment directory which shouldn't be as fragile as relative paths.
