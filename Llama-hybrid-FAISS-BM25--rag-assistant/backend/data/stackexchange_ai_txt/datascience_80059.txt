Deep Reinforcement Learning with Space Invaders

I want to better understand Deep Reinforcement Learning so I developed the Space Invaders game from scratch with Pygame. I have a fixed number of enemies (10). Instead of defining the states as a stack of frames (pixels) as in the state of the art, I rather defined them as relative distance between the player and the enemies + relative distance between the player and 5 closest enemy lasers. So the observation space dimension is (10+5)*2 (2 for x and y coordinates). I'm tuning the model for the moment and since I don't see any progression in the behavior (total reward is not really progressing after about 700 episodes), I thought that, beside other hyper parameters, maybe something is wrong with the way I defined the states and I want to have your opinion about it?
