Splines vs Gaussian Process Regression

I'm know that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an alternative to using splines for fitting flexible nonlinear models. I would like to know in which situations would one be more suitable than the other, especially in the Bayesian regression framework. I've already looked at What are the advantages / disadvantages of using splines, smoothed splines, and gaussian process emulators? but there does not seem to be anything on GPR in this post.
