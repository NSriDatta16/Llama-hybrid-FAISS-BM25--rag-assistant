get contents of tags using python

Assuming I have html read into my program like this: F/T &amp; P/T Sales Associate - Caliente Fashions - (North Vancouver) IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT WANTED! - TRAVEL AGENT - (NORTH VANCOUVER) Optical Sales Position - (New Westminster) Sales Clerk - (Kits) MARINE SALES - (VANCOUVER ( KITS )) Retail Sales Associate - (Vancouver) Retail with small parts appliance background - Manager *Enjoyable work atmosphere - (Langley Centre) Team Member - Retail Store - FT - (Burnaby South) STORE MANAGER-SHOE WAREHOUSE - (South Surrey-Semiahmoo) Retail Sales - (Coquitlam) How do I grab the contents of the text node? What I would like to end up with is printing something similar to this line in the terminal: http://vancouver.en.craigslist.ca/nvn/ret/1817849271.html - TRAVEL AGENT So far I have the following code which extracts the href link fine but I'm not sure how to extract the data itself. I'm thinking of overriding handle_data(self, data) from the sgmllib.py module but so far I can't seem to think of a way to do it. from sgmllib import SGMLParser class URLLister(SGMLParser): def reset(self): SGMLParser.reset(self) self.urls = [] def start_a(self, attrs): href = [v for k, v in attrs if k == "href"] if href: self.urls.extend(href) Thanks!
