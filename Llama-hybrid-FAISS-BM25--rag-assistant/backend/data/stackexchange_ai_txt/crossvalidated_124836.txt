Multiple neural networks with single output neuron vs. single NN with multiple output neurons

Main Question Given multiple output parameters that are independent of each other, would multiple ANNs with a single output neuron give better prediction results than a single ANN with multiple outputs ? Is there a benefit for each case? Specific description: I am using the ' caret ' package in R to come up with an optimized artificial neural network (ANN). The method I am using to train the network is within ' nnet ' package, which by itself allows multiple output neurons: For instance, for the given dataset: dataset x1 x2 x3 y1 y2 y3 1.4 5 6.1 7.9 8.5 3.5 ... ... ... ... ... ... I use nnet(dataset[,InputIndices],dataset[,OutputIndices],size=HN, decay=wd, rang=rg) But when using the 'nnet' method within 'caret', only single output is possible. Within Caret documentation: Arguments x: an object where samples are in rows and features are in columns. This could be a simple matrix, data frame or other type (e.g. sparse matrix). y: a numeric or factor vector containing the outcome for each sample. form: A formula of the form y ~ x1 + x2 + ... Therefore the code I use to train the network is: for (n in 1:NumOutputNeurons) { train(traindata[,InputIndices],traindata[,OutputIndices][,n], tuneGrid=param.grid, maxit = 1e4, method = "nnet", linout=F, trace=F, na.rm = TRUE, trControl = tc) } From a statistical point of view, is each method better than the other? (As an extra question, do you know a way to allow multiple outputs within Caret package?)
