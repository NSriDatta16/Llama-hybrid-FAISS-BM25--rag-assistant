Correlation in the shape of two lines

The two groups of lines below each have a correlation close to 1 but they have very different shapes. Let’s say each represents the changes in price of gold and silver at different times - there is undoubtedly different information between the two. What I’m wondering is how to determine how closely the shape of one line reflects the shape of the other. In a real example, the lines would have peaks and valleys, so slope alone is not enough. I think I could find the cumulative differences between the lines at various points in time and somehow measure that against the standard deviation of one or both of the lines, but there has to be a standardized way to do this. Also not ruling out the possibility that I’m missing something completely obvious. Any help is appreciated. Update: To better illustrate using slightly more realistic examples for a financial time series, the points of the two segments in Chart C below have a correlation of 1. The points of the segments in Chart D still have a very high correlation, but it is less than 1, but if each pair of segments comes from the same dataset, I would argue that the segments in Chart D are more statistically similar than the segments in Chart C after accounting for a known standard deviation, which would be the same for both segments in each chart. I think the eye test also confirms that. Again, I'm comparing different segments within the same time series for similarity. Maybe said differently, if I picked a few hundred pairs of segments in a random time series, and took the sum of absolute percentage differences (for the purpose of comparison the initial point in a segment would always be zero and the subsequent points expressed as a +/- percentage) for each point of each pair of segments, the segments in Chart D would likely be among the lowest pairs in terms of cumulative absolute percentage difference. And maybe that’s all I need to do. Chart C: Chart D:
