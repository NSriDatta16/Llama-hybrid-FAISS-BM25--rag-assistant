Bayesian and frequentist frameworks have difference conceptions of the nature of probability. In the Bayesian world the stuff of probability is partial belief and in the frequentist world probability is made of long-run frequencies. The distinction may have fewer practical consequences than might at first be thought, because when beliefs are rationally formed by unbiassed agents the expected long-run frequencies correspond closely enough to the frequentist ideals, and in many circumstances the long run frequencies allow at least a rough and ready state of partial belief that mimics that of a Bayesian.
