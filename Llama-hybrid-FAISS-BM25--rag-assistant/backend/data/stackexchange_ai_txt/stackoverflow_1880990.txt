Comparison of MindMeister and XMind Both products are excellent and are rightly the market leaders in the cloud-based mind mapping market. Through my own personal experience, I am more comfortable brainstorming with MindMeister. The iPhone application and offline access are two things I value highly. Be aware that the Pro version of MindMeister is $10 a year more expensive.
