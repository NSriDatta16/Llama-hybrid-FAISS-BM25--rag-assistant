How to use a select to go to the Show action of another controller?

I'm trying to do something I thought easy and natural but I'm struggling.. On the homepage of my website, I want a select containing a list of users. After selecting a user and clicking on a button, it should go to the show action of the User controller page. I searched and found differents answers that I don't find very elegant: using AJAX http://www.mail-archive.com/rubyonrails-talk@googlegroups.com/msg36368.html using an observe_field to modify the url in the html Is there a better way doing this? What would be the best way?
