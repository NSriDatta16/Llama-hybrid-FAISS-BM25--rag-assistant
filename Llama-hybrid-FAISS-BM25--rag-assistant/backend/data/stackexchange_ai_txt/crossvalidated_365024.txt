The standard definition of the Fisher information of a model with density $f(\cdot|\theta)$ is the function of $\theta$ $$\mathfrak{I}(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\text{var} \frac{\partial \log f(X|\theta)}{\partial\theta}\right]=-\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\partial^2 \log f(X|\theta)}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^\text{T}}\right]$$ so there is no data involved in this concept. It is a function of the parameter that can be turned into a Jeffreys prior measure $|\mathfrak{I}(\theta)|^{1/2}$. The observed information is$$\frac{\partial^2 \log f(x^\text{obs}|\theta)}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^\text{T}}$$and is never used for prior determination, being dependent on the data and all that. In cases when $\mathfrak{I}(\theta)$ cannot be computed analytically, a Monte Carlo version is the average $$\hat{\mathfrak{I}}(\theta)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\partial^2 \log f(x_i^\text{sim}|\theta)}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^\text{T}}$$ which still does not involve the observed information.
