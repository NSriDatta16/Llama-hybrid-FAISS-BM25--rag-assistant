Which financial time series have a PDF and/or a CDF?

Consider the following types of financial time series for a single publicly-listed stock: Price data Log returns Cumulative returns Each is computed from the item listed before it: log returns are based on differences of prices, and cumulative returns are cumulative products of log returns. Which of the random variables listed above possess a probability distribution function (PDF), which have a cumulative distribution function (CDF), and which have both a PDF and CDF? for what financial applications do the CDF versus PDF, and vice versa, come in handy? I ask because the following post says all random variables have a CDF, but not all of them have a PDF. So I wanted to see how this applies to commonly used financial data, which are prices and returns. Graphical depictions of the above datas' CDF and PDFs displayed side-by-side would help in the explanation. I'm particularly curious about cumulative returns. Since they're cumulative, it automatically makes me think it corresponds and is represented best by a CDF, so in a way I'm wondering if cumulative returns are more useful than they're made out to be, despite being non-stationary.
