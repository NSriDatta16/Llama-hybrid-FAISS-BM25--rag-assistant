A random subset of the data is not necessarily balanced for all covariates. If you were to repeatedly partition the data, partitions should be balanced on average, but this does not mean that an individual partition will be. You can demonstrate this with a really trivial example in R. You can see that in some cases the proportion of class "a" varies quite widely from the population proportion. a Low statistical power does not prevent spurious false positives. That is exactly what's happening. It's generally very difficult to partition test and training data while balancing for even a relatively low number of covariates (~10), even if you have a fairly large sample size.
