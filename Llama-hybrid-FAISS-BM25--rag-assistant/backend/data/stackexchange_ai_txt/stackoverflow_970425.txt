Subclassing list

I want create a DataSet class which is basically a list of samples. But I need to override each insertion operation to the DataSet. Is there any simple way to do this without writing my own append, extend, iadd etc. ? UPDATE: I want to add a backpointer to each sample, holding index of the sample in the DataSet. This is needed to the processing algorithm I use. I have a solution, but it seems unelegant - a renumber() function -- it ensures that the backpointers are valid.
