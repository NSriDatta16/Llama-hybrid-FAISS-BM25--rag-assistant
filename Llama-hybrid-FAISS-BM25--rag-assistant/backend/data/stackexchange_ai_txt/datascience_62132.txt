Transforming target variable

Building my machine learning model, I have a target variable that consists of dollar values ranging from $0.01$ to $1000000$ +. I want to transform these dollar values in to a scale of 1 to 10 and then try and predict that level of 1 through 10. What is the best approach to normalize my dollar values in to a scale of 1 to 10?
