First let us clarify that in fact you do not have t-tests but z-test although this does not affect the problem. What you have observed here is the phenomenon of separation. This has a tag of its own on this site with many relevant posts. This one is particularly helpful How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? In my view the answer there by scortchi is the one to read first. The diagnostic signs of separation are very large values for coefficients with large standard errors. It is caused by having the outcome either always or never occur for some combination of predictors. In your case for instance 29.13 is equivalent to an odds ratio of $e^{29.13} = 4.8 * 10^{12}$ which is large.
