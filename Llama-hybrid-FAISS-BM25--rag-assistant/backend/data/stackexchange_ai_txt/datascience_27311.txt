Reinforcement Learning on data only (NO emulators)

My team and I started digging into RL for the purpose of a specific application. We have plenty of data of an agent carrying out suboptimal policies (states and rewards...). It is too costly for us to emulate the agent (executing the action and assessing the reward) meaning our only option is to learn the optimal policy on our dataset using an off-policy algorithm. However I still do not know how to do that, Q-learning, while off-policy, still require an emulator. Could you please provide me some guideline on how to do that? Which type of algorithm should I use?
