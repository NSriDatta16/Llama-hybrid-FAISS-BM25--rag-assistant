Comment reflower for Visual Studio

Is there a built-in command or tool that can reflow C# comments in Visual Studio? Sometimes, a section of code requires several lines of comments, and after extensive editing you have to manually insert the line breaks in the appropriately places so that it does not flow past the right edge of your editor window. I'd like to be able to do this with a single key command. After many years of using Visual Studio I still miss the ability to M-q (c-fill-paragraph) in emacs. Edit: The Agent Smith plugin does not reflow comments in the method body.
