Step by step reference on machine learning for survival analysis?

I want to apply machine learning methods to survival analysis . This is, I have a sample of survival times $(t_1,...,t_m)$ , censoring indicators $(\delta_1,...,\delta_m)$ , and covariates ${\bf{x}_i}$ , $i=1,...,m$ . I am interested in estimating the survival function, hazard function, making predictions, and etcetera, like I would do with the Cox model or a parametric model, using machine learning methods (in general, as I am mainly interested in learning machine learning in this context rather than a specific method). However, most references I have come across are a bit cryptic, only handwaving how the method is used, but not really explaining the calculations behind their proposals. I would appreciate any references on detailed applications of machine learning to survival data, with explanations of methods that I can reproduce in a programming language (R, Python), even if it takes some effort (again, my goal is mostly self learning the magic behind the black box). I am not interested in packages that allow me to run black boxes.
