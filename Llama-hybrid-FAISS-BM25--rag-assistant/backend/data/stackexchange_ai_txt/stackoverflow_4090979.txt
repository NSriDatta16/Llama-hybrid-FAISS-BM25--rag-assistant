Thanks for all your hints. From what you've written I cobbled my own piece of code which seems to be working. Not elegant but it serves its purpose :-) def f = new RandomAccessFile("D:/input.txt", "r") def start = 3 def end = 6 def current = start-1 def BYTE_OFFSET = 11 def resultList = [] if ((end*BYTE_OFFSET)
