First, you should add your search field like explained in this railscast: http://railscasts.com/episodes/37-simple-search-form Since your search isn't specific to a particular model, use a generic controller name instead of ProjectsController though. Then, you should replace the ActiveRecord finder by the use of the Sunspot DSL. Here is an sample code to help get you started: page = @page = params[:page] && params[:page].to_i || 1 @search = Sunspot.search(Realty) do # search_ids per_page = params[:per_page] && params[:per_page].to_i || 10 # not adapted to your case with(:equipments).all_of params['equip'].split(' ') if params['equip'] case params[:sort] when "average_rating" order_by :average_rating, :desc when "type" order_by :type, :asc end paginate :page => page, :per_page => per_page # other criteria... end In your view, you can then iterate through @search.results Last, using WebSolR instead of a standard SolR server is quite simple, you can follow the setup instructions at https://github.com/onemorecloud/websolr-rails . Edit: As Nick commented, you should totally go to http://docs.heroku.com/websolr . Thanks Nick !
