You download MS SQL Express with the SQL Studio Management Studio Express. Only in the Studio Express can you connect to the server, select the database, open the database diagrams and edit diagrams. Then, you can drag and drop the entire set of Tables in to Linq to SQL. Entity Framework is nice, but I have yet to get it to render my tables well yet. I would stick to Linq to SQL until they release another upgrade to EF (easier for you).
