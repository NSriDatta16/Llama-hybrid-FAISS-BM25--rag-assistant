Override didTurnIntoFault and release them there. Managed objects aren't necessarily deallocated when they're faulted. From the documentation : You are discouraged from overriding dealloc or finalize because didTurnIntoFault is usually a better time to clear valuesâ€”a managed object may not be reclaimed for some time after it has been turned into a fault. Core Data does not guarantee that either dealloc or finalize will be called in all scenarios (such as when the application quits); you should therefore not in these methods include required side effects (like saving or changes to the file system, user preferences, and so on).
