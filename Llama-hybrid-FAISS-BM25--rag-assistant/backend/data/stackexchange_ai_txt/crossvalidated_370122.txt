Logistic linear mixed effects model with categorical predictors

I've read a lot of threads on stack exchange but haven't exactly found what I'm looking for. Everyone seems to have a slightly different problem/issue. First, lets have a look at my data: 120 Users 80 Items per User Between factor with 4 levels Within factor with 4 levels Binary response variable Now, usually one would perform a logistic regression. However, there are several issues with that: Categorical predictors have to be dummy coded? How do deal with the within-subject fator? -> lmm? How would you plot this data? As I think (but I'm not sure? correct me if I'm wrong) that one assumption of binary logistic regression is the independence of errors which is - again not sure - violated with within subject factor I'm trying to perform a linear-mixed effects model for my data. Now here begins the actual problem: First: I know, that I want to model the between-subjects and within-subject factors as fixed effects. However: which random effects should I implement? Random intercept of each subject as it can be assumed that they differ in they're apriori knowledge of the items (it's a performance test). Random intercept of the within-subject factor - as this is the reason for performing lmm in the first place? My data is actually not nested, so there is no sense in creating a random effect like all the examples "school", "county" and so on... other suggestions? Okay my suggestion is to assume random intercepts of subjects (the first one): lmm3 But, first I would have to calculate the ICC 1 and ICC2 to support the use uf lmm. for the ICC 1 I use the nullmodel: lmm0 No, again two questions arise: How do I calculate ICC2 for the logistic model? I know that there is a function for linear mixed models, but this is not the case here. However, my ICC1 is only 0.03760069 so it seems that this above model doesn't make a lot of sense. What kind of model should I try then? I thank you a lot for your inputs. You need more specific information I would be willing to prepare some data for you. I know that this is a rather theoretical issue so I'm looking forward to a discussion. Kind regards, David
