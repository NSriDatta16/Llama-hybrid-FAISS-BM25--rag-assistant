How to cluster and visualize 3D data in python

I have a 3D dataset of x,y,z points with 2 categories, category A and B. My end goal is to cluster all points in category B into volumes (spheroids/clouds) and find all points of category A close to edge of those volumes. I assume there won't be any points of category A inside the spheroids. The points of category B are very highly clustered in space, so clusters are probably very evident. In 2D GIS I have used Kernel Density Estimation and K-Means clustering for similar tasks, but since I am dealing with 3D data, and non-geographic at that (relative to a fictional 0,0,0 origin), and since I am comfortable with the python data science tools, I think matplotlib/scipy/numpy/sklearn/pandas/etc are probably better tools for this. But I am not sure what tools and libraries specifically would be good to look at. So my question is 2-fold: what libraries would be well suited to find the 3D clusters and the points of category A "close" to them what tool would allow me to visualize the clusters, preferably in an interactive plot that allows me to zoom/pan/rotate
