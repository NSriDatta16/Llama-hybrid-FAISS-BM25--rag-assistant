If your sales are aggregated by week then you data is most likely highly autocorrelated. You can test whether autocorrelation in your data is significant that with a simple autocorrelogram or a Ljung-Box test. Cross-sectional methods such as standard neural networks and random forest cannot handle a high degree of autocorrelation. You will need to apply a time series approach such as ARMA models, exponential smoothing, autoregressive neural networks, or something equivalent.
