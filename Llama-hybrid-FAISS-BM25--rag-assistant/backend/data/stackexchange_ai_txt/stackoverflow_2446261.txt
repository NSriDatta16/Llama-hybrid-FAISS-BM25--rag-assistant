Crystal Reports: Cannot insert some fields from Field Explorer to Report

I have an existing report (Crystal Reports 11) that is based on two Oracle views. I have made 'Verify database' already, it's done and up to date. My problem is that I can insert some fields to report but some other I cannot. For example: field Name (string(35)) is ok, but similar field Compamy (string(20)) I cannot insert to Report. Drag&drop does not work and small button "Insert to Report" in Field Explorer is disabled too. Next symptom: when I try to use functionless field (e.g. Company) in Record Selection Formula Editor, Crystal Reports crash. There is any way how to add these fields into Report? Thanks
