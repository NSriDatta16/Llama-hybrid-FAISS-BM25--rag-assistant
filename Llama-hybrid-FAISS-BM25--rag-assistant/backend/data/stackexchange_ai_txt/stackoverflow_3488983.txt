It can also depend on your area and what you are trying to get into. It seems like certain segments of the business world use MSSQL or Oracle exclusively. I would say that MSSQL is easier to get into but that's just opinion. Overall it seems like there's more MSSQL jobs but the oracle jobs pay a little better...but again that's a very person experience. I don't think you'd go wrong with either direction. I would agree with the others though that you should just download the free versions and play around a little and see which ones catches your attention more and go from there.
