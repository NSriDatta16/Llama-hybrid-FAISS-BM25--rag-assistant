Incase it helps anyone here is a very basic (the first draft) of some simple linaear regression code I used. // Calculate the averages of arrays x and y double xa = 0, ya = 0; for(int i = 0; i There are more efficeint ways of doing this (see CodeCogs or AGLIB) but as quick fix this code seems to work. To detect Circles in OpenCV I dropped the Hough Transform and adapeted codee from this post: Detection of coins (and fit ellipses) on an image It is then a case of refining the co-ordinates (removing any outliers etc) to determine if the circles lie on a horizontal line from the slope and intercept values of the regression.
