Sklearn randomforest online learning

Can I do online learning with random forests? I have a few million datapoints and the classifier fails to finish on the cross validation step. Can i break it up in chunks sequentially? Current code: X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test = load_dataset() print('Planting trees...') clf = RandomForestClassifier( n_estimators=50, max_depth=None, min_samples_split=1, random_state=0 ) print('Growing trees...') classifier = clf.fit(X_train, y_train) # see how we did print('Testing trees...') scores = cross_val_score(classifier, X_test, y_test) print(scores) print('accuracy: %d' % (scores.mean())) Can I change it to something like: for chunk in df: clf.fit(...) cross_validate...
