The state-of-the-art (SOTA) for image segmentation would be Facebook's Mask-RCNN . While it is usually trained on dataset such like COCO or Pascal which feature real-life objects, you can re-trained it on a dataset of your choice, real or not. Facebook provides an implementation ( Detectron ) under the Apache2 license. Give it a try!
