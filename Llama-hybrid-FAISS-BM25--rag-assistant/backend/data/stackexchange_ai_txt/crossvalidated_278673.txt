Pattern in Weight of evidence and Information Value approach

I am trying to build a logistic regression Model and for that I am following Weight of evidence and Information Value approach to assess the predictive power of the variables. I have tried the "Information Package" but I couldn't find the Pattern in the same. I am following the Book "Developing and Implementing Intelligent Credit Scoring" authored by Naeem Siddiqi in which he has also mentioned the Pattern in Weight of Evidence. How to get the pattern in Weight of Evidence?
