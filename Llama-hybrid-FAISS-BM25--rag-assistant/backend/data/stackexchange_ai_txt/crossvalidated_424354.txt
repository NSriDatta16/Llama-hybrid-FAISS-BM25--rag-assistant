Bayesian Estimator

The Bayesian estimator is defined as $f* = \text{argmin}_f \epsilon(f)$ where $\epsilon(f)$ is the error function. What is the Bayes estimator for the error function $\epsilon(f) = \sum_x \sum_y | y- f(x)| p(x,y)$ ? I know I should differentiate with respect to $f$ and set this equal to zero but am struggling because of the modulus. I wrote $|y-f(x)| = \sqrt{(y-f(x))^2}$ and then I get $\frac{\partial \epsilon(f)}{\partial f} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_x \sum_y \frac{1}{\sqrt{(y-f(x))^2}} 2 (y-f(x)) \times (-1) p(x,y) = - \sum_x \sum_y |y-f(x)| p(x,y)$ There must be a mistake here since if I set this expression equal to zero (for maximum) there is no way for me to isolate and solve for the $f(x)$ term. Where's my mistake?
