No, such a test will not always be used. There are for sure situations in which it is crystal clear from background knowledge even before seeing the data that the involved explanatory variables are connected to the response. In such situations a precise strength of effect (and quantifying uncertainty) is of interest, but a test of a null hypothesis of "no relation" isn't of interest as rejection will not be informative beyond what is already known. There is a considerable number of statisticians these days who oppose the use of statistical hypothesis tests and the notion of significance quite generally. These people may advocate Bayesian methods and may not run F-tests. Model assumptions behind the F-test may be violated to the extent that it should not be trusted. Bootstrap/resampling, nonparametric, or robust techniques may be used instead.
