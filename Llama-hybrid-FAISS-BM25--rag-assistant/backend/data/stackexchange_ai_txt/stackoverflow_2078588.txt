You can make an AppleScript application that accepts a drag 'n' dropped file/folder onto it. You can probably make an Automator app to accept drag 'n' dropped files also. Both should work on Leopard and Snow Leopard. On Snow Leopard, at least, you can set up a new Services Menu item that points to a particular app to process the selection. This is done via the Keyboard preference panel.
