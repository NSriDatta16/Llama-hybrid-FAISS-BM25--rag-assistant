Plotting fit for binomial lme

I've been asked by a reviewer on a manuscript to provide plots of a model fit for a binomial lme which is specified as follows: EVENT_OCCURRED ~ (IV1*IV2) + IV3 + (1|PPT) + (1|RANDOM1) + (1|RANDOM2) + (1|RANDOM3) Where EVENT_OCCURRED is a binary value (0/1), IV1 , IV2 and IV3 are independent variables, PPT is the participant identifier (it's a behavioral experiment), and RANDOM1 , RANDOM2 and RANDOM3 are random effects. For the version of the manuscript that I submitted, I included mean-average data that visualised the three IVs and the interaction, without any kind of line fitting the results. Before submitting it, I'd asked a colleague who seemed to think that plotting a model with a bunch of random effects and three independent variables with an interaction wouldn't really make much sense. However, now I've been asked to do it specifically, I would like to check: Is there any way that I could plot the fitted versus actual values for this model? Would it involve generating a large number of plots - for example, breaking up the plots and fits by the participant identifier, and for the other random factors?
