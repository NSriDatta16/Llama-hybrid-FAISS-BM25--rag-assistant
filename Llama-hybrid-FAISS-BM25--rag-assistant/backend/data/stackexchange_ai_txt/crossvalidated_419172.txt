I'm taking this question to mean that if you pick a number at random, what is the probability you'll win? This is simply a weighted average. There's a 5/90 chance the number is chosen from bracket 1, 5/90 for bracket 2, and 8/9 for the last bracket. Multiply each case by it's winning probability and you have your answer. So, (5/90)X(6/10) + (5/90)X(3/10) + (8/9)X(1/10) = 0.1389. This is how the game creators make their money, as with enough people betting, only around 14% of them will win. The rest of the money goes to them. Hope this helps!
