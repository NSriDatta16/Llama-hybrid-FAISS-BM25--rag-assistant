display different image based on state of link

I have a link that a user selects, to display a paragraph, once they select it, I want it to display a different image, initially the image will be a plus (+) sign, to visually communicate that it can be clicked to slide down the content to be seen, and once it is clicked, I want it to change to a minus (-) sign, so they can click and it will slide back up and disappear. I've got the slideToggle down, I just need to plug in the image file path, based on the current state (display or hide) of the link. Example jQuery and HTML: Click $(document).ready(function() { $('.slide-down').click(function() { $(".content-to-slide-down").slideToggle(100); }); }); All I need to do is put the appropriate image filename, path within the Any help is appreciated.
