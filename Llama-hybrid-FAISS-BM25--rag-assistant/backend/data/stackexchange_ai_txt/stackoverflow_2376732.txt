Team Foundation Build under Mono

I'm currently looking at which build server we should run up for a multi-platform development (targeting .NET on Windows and Mono on Windows/SUSE). We use TFS (2010 RC) for all other aspects of the ALM, and we need to get continuous integration in place. I'm drawn to TFS because of its integration with the rest of the ALM, and the ability to assist in deployments etc, however I am yet to find any evidence that I can runup a build agent under mono on a non-Windows build machine. Has anyone tried/successed at this? If not, I will most likely opt for TeamCity on Mono. Thanks, Michael
