Yes, you can. Storing a document inside a SqlServer XML column will work and if you use standard XML serialization that will leave you with a decent ACID complant key/value store. Also, it will allow you to do queries on it with relative ease and you can join the results to data that you store in a more relational way. We do so, it works. If you store content in XML fields, storage demands are a lot lower than using NTEXT and querying it will be more flexible and faster. What SqlServer will not get you (comparing to mongo) is the seamless failover of replica-sets an the autosharding of mongo. Also, atomic operations like incrementing a specific property deep inside a document is hard (though not impossible with the XQuery update function). Updates tend to be faster on most NoSql databases, because they are more relaxed on the "data is only safe on disk" principle.
