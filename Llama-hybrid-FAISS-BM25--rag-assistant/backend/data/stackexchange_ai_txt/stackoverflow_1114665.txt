There's lots of Java code coverage tools. Many of them work by using JVM features not available in embedded systems due to space limitations. One that uses only an additional boolean array in which to hold the coverage data can be found at http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/TestCoverage/JavaTestCoverage.html You have to code an additional routine that dumps that array out of your embedded device into a file on a PC, but that's generally a pretty easy task (e.g., several hours work, once).
