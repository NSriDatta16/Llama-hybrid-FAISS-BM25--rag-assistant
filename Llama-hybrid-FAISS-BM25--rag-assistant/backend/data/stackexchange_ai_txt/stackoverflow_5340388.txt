Skipping files in spec/ when running rcov with RSpec 2.5

When running rake spec:rcov for a Rails 3 application, the files in the spec/ directory are getting included in the coverage statistics, but I don't want them to be. I want coverage statistics only for my actual application. In older versions of RSpec, it was possible to customize this with a spec/rcov.opts file with the line --exclude "spec/*" but it seems that file is no longer read by Rspec 2. I tried creating a .rcov file since spec/spec.opts changed to .rspec , but that didn't get read either. I've found some documentation on how to do this when defining a rake task, but I'd rather not overwrite the provided rake task â€” it seems like this must be something other people have tried to do as well. How can I customize the files that are excluded from coverage statistics? For reference, the versions of all relevant gems I'm using are: rails (3.0.5) rake (0.8.7) rcov (0.9.9) rspec (2.5.0,) rspec-core (2.5.1) rspec-expectations (2.5.0,) rspec-mocks (2.5.0) rspec-rails (2.5.0)
