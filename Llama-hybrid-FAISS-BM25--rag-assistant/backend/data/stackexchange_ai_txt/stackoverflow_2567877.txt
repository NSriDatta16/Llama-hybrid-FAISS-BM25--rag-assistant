Zend_Nav in zend framework issue getting menu to show up

I have the following problem, using zend framework, specifically zend_nav to create a reusable menu to be passed in via the layout/layout.phtml page. These are the code fragments in their respective files. first of in application/configs/navigation.xml, Home index index Add post add Admin login login this is then passed into an object in the Bootstrap.php file(only showing that specific method) protected function __initNavigation(){ $this->bootstrap('layout'); $layout = $this->getResource('layout'); $view = $layout->getView(); $config = new Zend_Config_Xml(APPLICATION .'/config/navigation.xml', 'nav'); $container = new Zend_Navigation($config); $view->navigation($container); } and then finally in the view layout.phtml, the object should return the menu doctype() ?> Zend Blog ! headLink()->appendStylesheet('/css/global.css')?> Blog Me ! navigation()->menu() ?> layout()->content ?> The menu does however not show up when i start up my app in the browser, any ideas as to might have gone wrong, is humbly received.
