If Scratch is starting to get a bit limiting, but they're not ready for the hardships of text-editor coding, take a look at Scratch-derivative "BYOB" (Build Your Own Blocks) . Seriously, it turns Scratch into a grown-up programming environment with functions (and hence recursion), data-structures, multithreading and everything! There's also Panther but I was less impressed by it (creating new blocks in Panther seems to require coding their function up directly in Squeak, while in BYOB you can just build them in the usual drag-n-drop Scratch style).
