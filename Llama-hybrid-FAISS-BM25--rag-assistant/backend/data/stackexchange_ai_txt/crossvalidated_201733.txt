How does deep learning and reinforcement learning combined to use together?

Recent advance in Google's AlphaGo show a really powerful use of deep learning and reinforcement learning in the complicated space (Go). How did we use deep learning and reinforcement learning together, for example, in Atari or Go? As far as I know, when we say use them together, we are talking about use deep learning (e.g., CNN) to predict the Q in the reinforcement learning, and then use the Q to make the decision, am I right?
