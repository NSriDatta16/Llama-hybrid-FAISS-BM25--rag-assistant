I found myself looping the following tasks for most projects: Gather User requirements Design database Models Build Views Streamline Layouts Find and learn Plug-ins/Gems Testing User Review/Acceptance Deploy the app Documentation After these years of working as a freelancer, I think step 1 and 2 are the most important (at least for small projects). Before writing any code, I urge users to finalize all UI first. HTML skeleton is better than written document. Users do not and will not understand software specifications. They can only give feedback after they see can click something. So being fluent in building a HTML site is a helpful skill. Sometimes I delegate the task to a partner, as a SA role. Rails is very good for building an ever-evolving schema. Try to use migrations and data seeding instead of writing SQL statements directly. I find myself rely on ActiveRecord more and more overtime. The script/console is a nice tool to test out those many-to-many relationships and building :conditions => . I worked on a few legacy database lately, the establish_connection and set_table_name feature in ActiveRecord glue old and new database elegantly. I'd also like to use this chance to thank Ryan Bates , I learn a lot of Rails from his railscasts .
