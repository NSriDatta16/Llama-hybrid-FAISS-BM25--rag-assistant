Can one have good understanding on a method without having direct experience with it?

This question is in line of these previous questions on other sites: Is it possible to conduct scientific research without actually getting close to the sample/specimen? in Biology SE Is it possible to have a scientific review of a method if the author doesn't have direct experience of it? in Philosophy SE The overall conclusion of them is that, yes, it is possible to conduct scientific research/have valuable critiques on the samples or methods without having direct experience to them, because one can work on the data . This makes me wonder: does this statement hold true in data science? In other sciences, scientists use method to extract data from samples. Since samples and data are different entities, therefore methods are not algorithms. But in data science, isn't that sample the data itself? Does data science only study methods/algorithms on how to process the data? (I suppose the study on new data format is more about computer science.) If yes, then cognitively, are data science methods different to other sciences methods? Imagine a this scenario: I only have directly tried rule-based method. I have read introductions, researches, conversations of people have direct experience with statistical-based method, but never tried it once. Can I still be able to join conversations, debate on which method should be used in a classification problem, or even write good papers on LLM? I think that in theory the answer is no different to other sciences. Having direct experience only help correct false assumptions quicker, but that shouldn't be a problem to the conversation partner who have direct experience with it. Is that correct? Here I only limit the problem to terms you think you know. If you don't know a term then you acknowledge your limitation in knowledge and return to the listening mode. But if from the reading you think you know it, then you can form opinions. And if your opinions are formed incorrectly from your reading, then in a sense you are also hallucinated like LLM I guess?
