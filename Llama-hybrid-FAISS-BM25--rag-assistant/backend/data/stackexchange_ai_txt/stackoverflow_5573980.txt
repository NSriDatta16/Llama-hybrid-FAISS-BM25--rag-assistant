Turns out that this is just a variant of a problem that's been long noted, namely, that Internet Explorer refreshes the page when (a) the user has arrived at the current page after a redirect, and (b) you change the window.location.hash. In other words, this is an IE issue (still not fixed in IE9!), not a Silverlight problem. Everything behaves correctly with Firefox and Chrome. (See javascript location.hash refreshing in IE and Response.Redirect with a fragment identifier causes unexpected refresh when later using location.hash for more details, and some suggested workarounds.)
