I think the proper answer really depends on the definition of a "dataset". As you mention in your question you are storing individual sets of information for each record; timestamp, userid, destination ip, source ip, number of bytes etc.. SQL Server is perfectly capable of handing this type of data storage with hundreds of millions of records without any real difficulty. Granted this type of logging is going to require some good hardware to handle it, but it shouldn't be too complex. Any other solution in my opinion is going to make reporting very hard, and from the sounds of it that is an important requirement.
