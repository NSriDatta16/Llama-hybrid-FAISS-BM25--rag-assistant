Assume that we have computed the forward and backward probabilities $\alpha(z_t)$ and $\beta(z_t)$ for each of the $K$ hidden states $z_t$ at time $t$. Then the probability of the state $x_t$ at time $t$ is $$p(x_t|D)=\sum_{z_t=1}^K p(x_t|z_t)p(z_t|D)$$ where $D$ are the observed data. From equations 13.32 and 13.33 in Bishop (2006) we see that $$ p(z_t|D)=\frac{p(D|z_t)p(z_t)}{p(D)}=\frac{\alpha(z_t) \beta(z_t)}{\sum_{z_t=1}^K \alpha(z_t) \beta(z_t)}$$ Literature: Bishop, C. M.
