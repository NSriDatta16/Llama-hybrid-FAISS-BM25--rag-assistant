For the question in your first paragraph: Use bayes rule, there are surely examples on this site, like Interpretation of Bayes Theorem applied to positive mammography results and others. I take your main question then to be, when we later take medical diagnosis as response data in a regression model (typically logistic regression), we model the diagnosis as certain, we forgot that is has a related probability lesser than one. One response to that very reasonable question is that we can extend the logistic regression model (and others as well) to use an uncertain diagnosis as response data. One such approach is given in Venables & Ripley: "Modern Applied Statistics with S (4th edition)", chapter 16, page 445. The function is called logitreg, but it is not included in the MASS package. If you have R and MASS installed you can find the file containing it by system.file("scripts", "ch16.R", package="MASS") [1] "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/MASS/scripts/ch16.R" and then you can open that in an editor.
