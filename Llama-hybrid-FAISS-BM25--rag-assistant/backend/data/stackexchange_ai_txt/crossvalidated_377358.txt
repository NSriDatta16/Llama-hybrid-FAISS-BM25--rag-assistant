Finding a UMVU estimator for the mean

I am struggling with the following problem. We are given an i.i.d sample of size $n,$ with the form $X_{i}=\mu+n_{i}$ , where $\mu$ is a deterministic unknown constant, and $n_{i}$ is a noise with a known distribution and mean $0.$ The purpose is to find a noise distribution, for which the UMVU estimator for the mean $\hat{\mu}$ dominates the sample average estimator: (for finite $n$ ) $$\forall \mu:\operatorname{Var}\left(\hat{\mu}\right) \leq \operatorname{Var} \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right).$$ Does anybody know a noise distribution for which it holds?
