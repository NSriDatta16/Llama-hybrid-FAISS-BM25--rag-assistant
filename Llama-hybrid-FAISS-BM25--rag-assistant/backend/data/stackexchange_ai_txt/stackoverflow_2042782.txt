I don't count this as open source as we have come to expect it. They have set up a system where what you contribute to the project is not necessarily incorporated for the benefit of all. By withholding features they are making you as a developer work for them. This is a bait and switch for the non-developers. If you start using it and grow to the point that you need one of the enterprise features you can't get it from the community because that feature is effectively reserved. So just move to enterprise with a 10 yr. cost of ownership of more than $89,000. I actually like the idea of a professional support organization on an open source project. But that is not what this is. I am running for the exit.
