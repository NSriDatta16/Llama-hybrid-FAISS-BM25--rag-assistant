I would suggest opencart (http://www.opencart.com/) and Magento (http://www.magentocommerce.com). Both are quite solid and reliable, been using them myself. Both are quite easy to setup. Magento has, as mentioned as well in this question, a very active community so getting help is easy, and there's a lot of good plugins for them. Both work with paypal.
