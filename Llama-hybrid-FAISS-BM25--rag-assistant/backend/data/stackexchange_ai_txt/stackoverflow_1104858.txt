How to create a repeating background with xaml elements in silverlight?

I want to create an area in my application that looks draggable. Usually, you see this done with a background of small dots or squares, or sometimes lines. I'm using Silverlight and I want to simply create a background that is a set of repeating small rectangles. I honestly cannot figure out how to generate a background with xaml. I'd rather not have to create every little rectangle -- this will also cause the control not to scale. Is there some way to repeat xaml elements to form a pattern? This would be similar to CSS repeating backgrounds, but I would like to use xaml instead of images.
