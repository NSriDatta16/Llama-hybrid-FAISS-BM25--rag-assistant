Multivariate time series forecasting with LSTM

I have the following problem: $\mathbf{Y}(t)$ = real valued random vector of observations at time t, $Y_i(t) \in R_{(0, 1)}$ $\mathbf{X}(t)$ = real valued random vector of observations at time t, $X_i(t) \in R$ I want to forecast $\mathbf{Y}(t+1)$ , given $\mathbf{X}(t+1)$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ history. To sum up I'd like to forecast a vector of observations given its history and another vector of observations as the same timestamp. To make it clearer: let's say that I want to forecast daily temperatures in London and Dublin, knowing the same day temperatures in Manchester and Liverpool and London and Dublin (and Manchester and Liverpool) historical data. It's a bit like a kalman filter where you want to estimate the state variables given some output. How would you set up this problem in an LSTM?
