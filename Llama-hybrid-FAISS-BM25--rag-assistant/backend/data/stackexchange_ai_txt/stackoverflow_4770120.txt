You are assigning a function pointer here, not making a call. Thus no passing of arguments. Having to store extra state with a HWND isn't unusual, a very common requirement for a C++ class wrapper around a window for example. You should keep a map<> to help you retrieve the wrapper object from the window handle value. Using SetWindowLongPtr() with GWLP_USERDATA is possible too but less ideal if you don't control the window creation.
