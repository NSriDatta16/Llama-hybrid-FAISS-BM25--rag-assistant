Mac OS X Universal Binary, including 64-bit support on Mac OS X 10.5. No sub-classing required. Seamlessly adds regular expression support to all NSArray, NSData, NSDictionary, NSSet, and NSString Foundation objects with a rich set of Objective-C category additions. Unicode enabled. Full Unicode support for NSString objects. Extensive, high quality documentation. Full source code with a BSD license. Uses the BSD licensed PCRE Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library for the regular expression engine. Tuned for high performance, including such features as: Caches the compiled form of the regular expression for speed. Multithreading safe, including multiple reader, single writer multithreaded access to the compiled regular expression cache. Makes minimal use of heap storage (ie, malloc() and free()), instead allocating most temporary buffer needs dynamically from the stack. Uses Core Foundation directly on Mac OS X for additional speed.
