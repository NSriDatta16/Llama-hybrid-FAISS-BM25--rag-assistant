There does not exists a distribution over a finite number of discrete random variables that cannot be captured by a Bayesian Network: Given a set of random variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$. Define the parents of $X_i$ to be the variables $X_j$ with $j $$P(X_1,\dots,X_n) = P(X_1)·P(X_2\mid X_1)·P(X_3\mid X_1,X_2) · … · P(X_n \mid X_1,\dots,X_{n-1})$$
