SQL SERVER 2008 - Memory Leak while storing Millions of records

I need some help very badly. I'm working on a project where a bulk of data is entered all the time. It's a reporting software. 10 Million records in an average is stored per day and it could keep on increasing as users increase. As of now, SQL SERVER CONSUMES 5gb of RAM on the task manager. I have an 8GB ram on my server now. How do other enterprises manage such situations?
