On the GNU/Linux platform with a real time pre-emption enabled Kernel, you have the JACK Audio Connection Kit. Put simply, JACK allows you to connect JACK-aware audio programs such that you could capture all the sound from your computer. You would then pass this captured sound into another JACK audio program which hosts your equalizer plugin. The equalizer plugin, in Linux at least, will be either a LADSPA plugin, or, LADSPA's successor plugin standard LV2. You can program a band pass filter if you have a very very very good grasp of very high level mathematics (IMHO) and excellent knowledge of Digital Signal Processing in general. If you don't have these skills I would strongly discourage you against coding a band pass filter, and to just use one of the many freely available implementations. http://jackaudio.org http://ladspa.org http://lv2plug.in see also: http://musicdsp.org
