Returning all matches from a series of regex captures

I've a string which contains many fields I'd like to extract from it. These I can easily parse from the line with regex, but I'd like to grab them all at once. My string is: >sp|P31946-2|1433B_HUMAN Isoform Short of 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha OS=Homo sapiens GN=YWHAB I'd like to use something like this: id, entry, protein, organism, gene, existence, seq_version = (1..6).each do |i| line[/^>sp\|(\w*)\|(\w*)\s(.*)\sOS=(.+)\sGN=(.+)\sPE=(\d*)\sSV=(\d*)/, i] end Mainly, I'd just like to have one line of code to capture all of these attributes from the entry string. Is there a way to do it?
