I think there is a misunderstanding here: regularized regression methods like lasso & ridge regression are for predicting individual data points (not used in training the coefficients), not for inference on the coefficients. The very purpose of regularisation in lasso is to bias the coefficients towards zero in order to get a better predictive performance. See this discussion on the difference between predictive and inferential statistics. In case you research goal is to interpret your coefficients, you may resort to regular logistic regression. Given the problem of a small-sample size and a large number of potential predictors I see two established solutions: Conclude that your inferences are exploratory (meant for guiding follow-up research, not making conclusions about the phenomenon in question). You may pre-select predictors based on theory, but you should say that you did so when reporting your results. Get more data or even better a separate validation sample to test the robustness of your initial model. PS: In any case avoid step-wise procedures at all costs.
