Character-level embeddings in python

I'm working on an NLP task that requires the use of character level embeddings, and I've been trying to use Spacy . However, it seems that spacy uses word-level embeddings for the word vectors, and I need character-level embeddings. The only character-level embedding library I've been able to find is chars2vec which does not seem well maintained. Is there a way to get character-level embeddings with either spacy or a more popular package than chars2vec?
