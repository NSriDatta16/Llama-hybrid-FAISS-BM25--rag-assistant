You need to remember that runtime flex CSS with embedded assets is also an swf. So if you wan't to load an swf you should probably just go ahead and load it without additional embedding. If you're, however, planning to use the swf symbols as part of the skin you should use something similiar to this: style.css: ComboBox.Styled { skin: Embed(source='skin/some_file.swf', symbol='ComboBoxSkinInSomeFile'); } I'm almost sure you can't just use the CSS as a container for symbols, without defining them as a part of some style.
