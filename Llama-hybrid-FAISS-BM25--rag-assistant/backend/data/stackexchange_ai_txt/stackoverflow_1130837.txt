App not visible on iPod after installing through an ad hoc profile

I have build my app with and ad hoc provisioning profile/distribution certificate pair following the instructions from developer program portal. Then I send the binary (.app file) and provisioning profile to one of my peer. He drag and drop the .app and .mobileprovision files on iTunes and sync his iPod Touch. The iTunes shows the application is installed but I cant see it on the iPod. Anyone who faced this issue OR have any clue what could have went wrong? Thanks AJ
