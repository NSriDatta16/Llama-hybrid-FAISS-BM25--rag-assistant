Correct way to compare two (very) different regression models?

I'm working with some piecewise linear regression models, and I'd like to compare their predictions with those produced by multiple (weighted) linear regression models. Both models describe the same physical system, but have very different parameterizations of the independent variable. The two different parameterizations are such that the averages of the independent variables are much different--that is, call $x_1$ the independent variables under the first parameterization, and $x_2$ the ind. vars. under the second parameterization. Generally, I have $\mathbb{E}x_1 \gg \mathbb{E}x_2$. This (in turn) means that the model coefficients may be very different. Additionally, it is sometimes the case that the piecewise linear regression may have a segment with slope = 0 and intercept = 0, which would seem to cause a problem for a statistic like CVRMSE. The best way I can think to compare these two models is to just use a training and a test set, but then, I'm not sure what statistic I should compute to (algorithmically) say "this one is better". Is there a better way to discriminate between these two models in an a priori way?
