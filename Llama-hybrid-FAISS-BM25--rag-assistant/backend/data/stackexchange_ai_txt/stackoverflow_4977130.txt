Based on the widely accepted Single Responsability Principle (SRP), a class should always be responsible for one task, and one task only . That pretty much invalidates your "one big dataclass" approach. I would always recommend smaller, more manageable bits that can be combined, instead of one humonguous class that does everything (except brew coffee for you). Resources for the SRP: Wikipedia on SRP OODesign: Single Responsibility Principle ObjectMentor: list of articles on good app design - which has a few links to PDF documents, like this one on SRP written by Robert C. Martin - the "guru" on proper OO design
