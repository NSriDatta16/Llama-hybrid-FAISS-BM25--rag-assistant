It is definitely recommended to center data before performing PCA since the transformation relies on the data being around the origin. Some data might already follow a standard normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation of one and so would not have to be scaled before PCA. If you are getting a number of PCA components for multiple features it is best to scale them as with features of different size, your algorithm might interpret one as more important than others without any real reason.
