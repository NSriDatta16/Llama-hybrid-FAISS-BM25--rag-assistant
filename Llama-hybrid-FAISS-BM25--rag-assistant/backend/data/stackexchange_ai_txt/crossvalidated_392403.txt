How to do backward subset selection on a random forest model for classification?

I'd like to identify the most predictive features for my classification model. I'm using this data . Here is a sample. This is my code. I'd like to use the predictors to predict loan status. library(caret) folds $Loan_Status Loan_Status==FALSE,0,1) index I get the warning message: In randomForest.default(x, y, importance = TRUE, ...) : The response has five or fewer unique values. Are you sure you want to do regression? Why is it serving this error? Is this the right way to do subset selection to prep for classification? Also, when I run plot(Quote_Pred_Profile) , it serves a plot with RMSE on the y-axis.
