Having a Neural Network recreate what it's learned

I've created a basic Neural Network that learns from basic information and can verify whether or not a piece of information matches it's parameters from a match percentage. Conceptually however, I haven't been able to think of or find anything on google about actually compiling something new. For instance, if I where to feed my network hundreds of images of dogs, It can recognize a dog, but it can't draw a dog. It definitely doesn't have to be accurate, but how could I have the network in this example draw a dog? Would I simply do something like drawing the highest weighted nodes?
