No, linear transformations of the response are never necessary. They may, however, be helpful to aid in interpretation of your model. For example, if your response is given in meters but is typically very small, it may be helpful to rescale to i.e. millimeters. Note also that centering and/or scaling the inputs can be useful for the same reason. For instance, you can roughly interpret a coefficient as the effect on the response per unit change in the predictor when all other predictors are set to 0 . But 0 often won't be a valid or interesting value for those variables. Centering the inputs lets you interpret the coefficient as the effect per unit change when the other predictors assume their average values. Other transformations (i.e. log or square root) may be helpful if the response is not linear in the predictors on the original scale. If this is the case, you can read about generalized linear models to see if they're suitable for you.
