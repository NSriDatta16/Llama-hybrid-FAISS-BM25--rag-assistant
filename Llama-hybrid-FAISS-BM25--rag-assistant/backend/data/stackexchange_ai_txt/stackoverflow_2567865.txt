How can I do metering/average peak power level in OpenAL?

I'm in the process of switching from AVAudioPlayer to OpenAL using the Finch sound engine. I need to do metering, i.e. get the average peak levels. Finch sound engine does not provide this, and I'm completely new to OpenAL. How can I do this? Any examples would be really appreciated.
