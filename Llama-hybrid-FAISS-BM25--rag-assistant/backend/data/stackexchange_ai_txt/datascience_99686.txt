It is multivariate time series forecasting indeed, and you need to train your model on the past time of the features as well as the interdependencies between them. One common solution is Vector Auto Regression (VAR). They are basically models that calculates both time and values interdependencies using a matrix: Source: Wikipedia Here is an overview for 3 features and second order: Source: https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/vector-autoregression-examples-python/ In your case, you will consider Y1 as feature_1, Y2 as feature_2 and Y3 as price. This will calculate the interactions between Y1, Y2 and Y3, and you will get the prediction you want for the 3 of them, including Y3. There is a library in Python, Statsmodel, that has a VAR function here . VAR is a good start, but it is a linear algorithm, i.e you may not have good results if your features are complex to predict. If you have complex features, there are non linear algorithms that would perform better, like Multivariate LSTM and Random Forest .
