I ended up doing this by creating a temp table of everyday between the start and end date along with their respective day of the week. I limited the recurrence intervals to weekdays and a set amount of weeks and added where clauses like this --Check Week Days Reoccurrence ( mrm_booking.repeat_type_id = 1 AND #ValidWeeklyDayOfWeeks.dow IN (1,2,3,4,5) ) OR --Check Weekly Reoccurrence ( mrm_booking.repeat_type_id = 2 AND DATEPART(WEEKDAY, mrm_booking.start_date) = #ValidWeeklyDayOfWeeks.dow ) OR --Check 4 Weekly Reoccurences ( mrm_booking.repeat_type_id = 3 AND DATEDIFF(d,#ValidWeeklyDayOfWeeks.[Date],mrm_booking.start_date) % (7*4) = 0 ) OR --Check 52 Weekly Reoccurences ( mrm_booking.repeat_type_id = 4 AND DATEDIFF(d,#ValidWeeklyDayOfWeeks.[Date],mrm_booking.start_date) % (7*52) = 0 ) In case your interested I built up a table of the days between the start and end date using this INSERT INTO #ValidWeeklyDayOfWeeks --Get Valid Reoccurence Dates For Week Day Reoccurences SELECT DATEADD(d, offset - 1, @StartDate) AS [Date], DATEPART(WEEKDAY,DATEADD(d, offset - 1, @StartDate)) AS Dow FROM ( SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY s1.id) AS offset FROM syscolumns s1, syscolumns s2 ) a WHERE offset Its not very elegant and probably very specific to my needs but it does the job I needed it to do.
