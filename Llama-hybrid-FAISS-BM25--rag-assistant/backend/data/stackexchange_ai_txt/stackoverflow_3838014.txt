Does Gray code exist for other bases than two?

Just a matter of curiosity, is the Gray code defined for bases other than base two? I tried to count in base 3, writing consecutive values paying attention to change only one trit at a time. I've been able to enumerate all the values up to 26 (3**3-1) and it seems to work. 000 122 200 001 121 201 002 120 202 012 110 212 011 111 211 010 112 210 020 102 220 021 101 221 022 100 222 The only issue I can see, is that all three trits change when looping back to zero. But this is only true for odd bases. When using even bases looping back to zero would only change a single digit, as in binary. I even guess it can be extended to other bases, even decimal. This could lead to another ordering when counting in base ten ... :-) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 Now the question, has anyone ever heard of it? Is there an application for it? Or it is just mathematical frenzy?
