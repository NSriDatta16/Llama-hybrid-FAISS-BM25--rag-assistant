Not being able to use GPL is often a matter of abstraction; that is if it is the license you have problems with. So if you create a small GPL application (released under GPL) you can call this from your non-GPL application. Why re-invent the wheel? Especially if you can use a python script which already exists: why not leverage it? Of course things are different if you can not expose the element reconsolidation algorithms.
