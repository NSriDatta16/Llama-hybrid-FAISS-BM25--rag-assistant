Markov chain and withdrawing balls from a box without replacements

I have a box that contains three types of balls: blue yellow and red. I do not know how many balls there are in the box nor the proportion of them, the number of the balls is not infinity though. When I withdraw the balls, it is a random process, and also I do not return the drawn ball back into the box. Given that the withdrawn ball is not replaced, then the current event interferes with the future event: Would it be a Hidden Markov Model? Could I use the Markov process to construct the model of the ratio between the number of balls? How do I describe the equation/inference and that process? I always see examples similar to this one, but it is always demonstrated with the replacement of the balls. So this scenario in which the balls are not set back has gotten me more confused as to statistical reasoning and demonstration.
