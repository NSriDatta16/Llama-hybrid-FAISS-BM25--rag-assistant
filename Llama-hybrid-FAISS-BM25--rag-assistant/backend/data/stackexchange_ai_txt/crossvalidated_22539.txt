Markov blanket vs normal dependency in a Bayesian network

While I was reading about Bayesian networks, I run into " Markov blanket " term and got severely confused with its independency in a Bayesian network graph. Markov blanket briefly says that every node is only dependent on its parents, children and children's parents [it is gray area for node A in the picture]. What is the joint probability of this BN, $P(M,S,G,I,B,R)$ ? (source: aiqus.com ) If I follow the step parent only independency rule, it is: $$ P(M | S)P(S | G,I)P(I | B)P(R | B)P(G)P(B)$$ However, if I follow the Markov Blanket independency , I end up with this (notice $P(I|\mathbf{G},B)$ is different): $$P(M | S)P(S | G,I)P(I | \mathbf{G},B)P(R | B)P(G)P(B)$$ So which is the correct joint probability of this BN?
