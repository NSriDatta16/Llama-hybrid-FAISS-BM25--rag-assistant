Integer overflow problem

Please explain the following paragraph. "The next question is whether we can assign a certain value to a variable without losing precision. It is not sufficient if we just check for overflow during the addition or subtraction, because someone might add 1 to -5 and assign the result to an unsigned int. Then the actual addition does not overflow, but the result still does not fit." when i am adding 1 to -5 i dont see any reason to worry.the answer is as it should be -4. so what is the problem of result not being fit?? you can find the full article here through which i was going: http://www.fefe.de/intof.html
