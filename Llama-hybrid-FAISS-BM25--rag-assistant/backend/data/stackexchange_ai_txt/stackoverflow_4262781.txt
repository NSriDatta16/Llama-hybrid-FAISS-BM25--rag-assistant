Step #1: Create a PNG file (or possibly a ShapeDrawable ) that is your scan bar, with appropriate transparency as you see fit. Step #2: Add an ImageView to your RelativeLayout that holds the image from step #1, possibly set to have android:visible="gone" at the outset. Make sure the ImageView is a later child of the RelativeLayout than is your ImageView that you are "scanning", so it will appear to float on top. Step #3: Use a TranslateAnimation to animate the ImageView from step #2 (after making it visible) by whatever pattern you want. Step #4: When the animation is complete (via the AnimationListener ), make the ImageView be gone again to return you to the state you were before the animation began.
