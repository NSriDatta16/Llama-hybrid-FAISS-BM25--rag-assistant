@DocDescendants and @DocChildren are special text

I got an error when I used this operation (Incorrect data type). I want to get the average of the below formula. What is the correct formula to get the average of @DocDescendants and @DocChildren? OR is there any alternative way to count the category and sub category then get the avg for each category? avg:=@DocDescendants/@DocChildren; OR this also avg:=@Text(@DocDescendants/@DocChildren); OR this also avg:=@ToNumber(@DocDescendants)/ @ToNumber(@DocChildren);
