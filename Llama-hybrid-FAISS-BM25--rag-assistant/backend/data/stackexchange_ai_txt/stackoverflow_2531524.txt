I know you answered your own question, but let me just add this to the pile: You're not leveraging CodeIgniter AT ALL in this sort of query - which if you used CI as it's intended, you wouldn't have had that typo. Your query should look like this (among other things): $query = $this->db->update('items', array('name' => $this->input->post('name'), 'price' => $this->input->post('price'), 'curr' => $this->input->post('curr')), array('id' => $this->input->post('id')), 1); By assembling the query string by hand, you're undoing what CI does for you. Only when you're using some complex JOIN statement should you be writing your own SQL in CI, and even then, you want to use the sprintf PHP function to make sure you're not introducing typos.
