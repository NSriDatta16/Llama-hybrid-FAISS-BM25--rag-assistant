Postbacks and output caching on user controls

There is a well known issue with using output caching on aspx pages which postback, where Asp.Net returns the cached page, instead executing the postback logic I came across what seems like an elegant solution here However this doesn't seem to work where the ouput caching in on the user control, rather than a page. Can anyone suggest a workaround? Or am I missing something Thanks.
