To expand on my comment, commonly "spatial covariance" is associated with Gaussian Processes , which are typically assumed to be stationary . Furthermore, in practice the spatial covariance function ( kernel ) is assumed to be non-negative and decay with distance. The standard setup is then to assume that your spatial (sample) domain is much larger than the correlation length, so that under the ergodic hypothesis, ensemble averages are well approximated by spatial averages. In this framework, empirical (auto-)correlation functions can be estimated using e.g. spectral methods. So a parametric fit of some particular model is not always required in practice. Now, in my work I encounter a lot of geostatistics , where all of these assumptions are commonly taken for granted, even though they blatantly do not apply (simple parametric fits are also common). As this is a pet peeve of mine, I would like to take a moment here to contrast the standard geostatistics approach with a technique from computer vision, to demonstrate how one might relax the stationary assumption. Consider the common geostatistics paradigm of a zero-mean stationary random field $z[\mathbf{x}]$ with variance $\sigma^2$. Typically geostatistics does not use the covariance function directly, but rather uses the variogram , defined for some lag $\mathbf{h}$ as $$\gamma[\mathbf{h}]\equiv\langle (z[\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{h}]-z[\mathbf{x}])^2\rangle=2(\sigma^2-\kappa[\mathbf{h}])$$ where $\kappa[\mathbf{h}]$ is the (auto-)covariance function, and the last equality comes from expanding the terms in the average and invoking the stationary assumption. A quite similar construction is commonly used in computer vision, but is derived somewhat differently. If we assume that $z$ is differentiable, then we can approximate the variogram as $$\gamma[\mathbf{h}]\equiv\langle (z[\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{h}]-z[\mathbf{x}])^2\rangle\approx\langle (\mathbf{S}[\mathbf{x}]^T\mathbf{h})^2\rangle=\mathbf{h}^T\langle \mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}^T\rangle\mathbf{h}\equiv\mathbf{h}^T\mathbf{T}\mathbf{h}$$ where $\mathbf{S}$ is the gradient of $z$ and $\mathbf{T}$ is known as the structure tensor . A key difference between the geostatistical variogram and the structure tensor is that the latter is not assumed to be stationary. Rather, $\mathbf{T}$ is used to describe the local texture in an image (or in 3D, e.g. seismic or medical imaging data). A simple Google image search will show numerous examples of non-stationary structure, which is perhaps the norm (i.e. the classical geostatistics assumptions are quite commonly invalid). EDIT: This structure-tensor demo on " Lena " (from a Matlab toolbox by Gabriel Peyre ) gives a nice illustration of the texture information the tensor field captures.
