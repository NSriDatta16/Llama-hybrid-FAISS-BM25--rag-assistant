I have found that it is often very hard to push TDD from the developer up. What I tend to do is talk about the benefits of TDD as much as possible and wherever possible, introduce elements of TDD myself bit by bit. If they don't mind, start a new project with unit tests in it (managers seldom mind more test coverage) and start developing that way yourself. Slowly show the rest of your team the benefits and try to win some converts. Once you have a few other developers on your side, start pushing management for some training. You could also offer to run some lunch-n-learns about it for the other developers. Teaching is the best way of learning and your will hopefully gain allies. If you are lucky, you can talk your boss into buying the pizza for the lunch-n-learn and everyone benefits.
