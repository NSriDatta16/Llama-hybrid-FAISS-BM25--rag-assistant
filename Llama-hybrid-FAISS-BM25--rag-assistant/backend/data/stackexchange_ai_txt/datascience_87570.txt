You can also use frequency encoding in which you map values to their frequencies Example taken from How to Win a Data Science Competition from Coursera, eg. for titanic dataset: encoding = titanic.groupby('Embarked').size() encoding = encoding/len(titanic) // calculates frequency titanic['enc'] = titanic.embarked.map('Encoding') This will preserve info about values distribution and will help both linear and tree based models. Make sure you don't have multiple categories with same frequencies, you can use rank operation instead or any other relevant operation.
