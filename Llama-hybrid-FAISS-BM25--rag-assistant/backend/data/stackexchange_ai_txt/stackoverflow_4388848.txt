jquery dialog table causes ie to lockup

I am working on an internal website that uses jquery's dialog box. When I open the dialog box, it uses an ajax-loader.gif while the application is getting data from the server. This works fine and dandy in FF, of course IE is struggling. Here is the code... $("#inputDiv5").html(' ').dialog({ title: 'Databanks for ' + $("#PidTitle" + count).text(), width: 500, modal: true, resizable: false, open: function() { $.get('content_backend_pub_pid_2_5.ashx', { cmd: 11, pid: x }, function(o) { $("#inputDiv6").html(o); $(".sortablethree th").addClass("sort_header"); $(".sortablethree").tablesorter({ widgets: ["zebra"] }); $(".sortablethree tr").hover(function() { $(this).addClass("over"); }, function() { $(this).removeClass("over"); }); }); }, buttons: { 'Close': function() { $(this).dialog('close'); } } }); It probably is not the best written code since this is my first time using jquery, so don't make fun! Lol! ;-) The issue is in IE the animation displays, but does not spin. FF it spins while the data is being loaded. I did run some tests. I commented out the code within the success function of the get and the animation works. So it looks like it is slowing down when I declare the table a tablesorter. This table does return about 1000 rows. I added the animation to a lone paragraph in the DOM and that animation stops working too. Also, I had task manager opened up when I open the dialog box and there is a large spike in CPU usage. Any thoughts?
