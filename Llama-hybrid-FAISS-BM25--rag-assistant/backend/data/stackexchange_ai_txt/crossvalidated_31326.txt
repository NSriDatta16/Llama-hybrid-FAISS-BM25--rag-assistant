How should one interpret the comparison of means from different sample sizes?

Take the case of book ratings on a website. Book A is rated by 10,000 people with an average rating of 4.25 and the variance $\sigma = 0.5$. Similarly Book B is rated by 100 people and has a rating of 4.5 with $\sigma = 0.25$. Now because of the large sample size of Book A the 'mean stabilized' to 4.25. Now for 100 people, it may be that if more people read Book B the mean rating may fall to 4 or 4.25. how should one interpret the comparison of means from different samples and what are the best conclusions one can/should draw? For example - can we really say Book B is better than Book A.
