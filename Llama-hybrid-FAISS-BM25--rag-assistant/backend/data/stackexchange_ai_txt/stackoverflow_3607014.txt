Python is an interpreted , interactive, object-oriented (using classes ) , dynamic and strongly typed programming language that is used for a wide range of applications . It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high-level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in c or c++ . It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later. The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, and CGI programming), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, and parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, and TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of interest to you. Python allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in many other languages, such as C, and the language has constructs intended to be used to create clear programs in a variety of domains. Example: Python program print("Hello, Stack Overflow!") versus C program #include int main(void) { printf("Hello, Stack Overflow!"); return 0; } Python was originally created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991. Guido van Rossum chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus). Python 2 (16 October 2000 - 01 January 2020) has officially been sunset , and Python 3 (3 December 2008) is the only supported, maintained, and improved major version as of 01 January 2020. We have a community of people from both worlds, and if you have a question that relates to a specific version, please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using, when asking a question about Python (see Tagging Recommendation section below). Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl. Like other dynamic languages , Python is often used as a scripting language but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython , the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software. It has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks (see Python implementations on the Python wiki). The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in The Zen of Python , written by Tim Peters, which one can read by issuing this command, in the interactive python interpreter: >>> import this Unlike many other languages, Python uses an indentation-based syntax (in which tabs and spaces are noninterchangeable). This may take some getting used to for programmers who are familiar with using braces. >>> from __future__ import braces File " ", line 1 SyntaxError: not a chance >>> To help with the transition, using a properly configured text editor or IDE is recommended. Python comes with a basic IDE called IDLE ( python-idle ), to get you started. Other popular examples are the charityware Vim ( vim ), the free GNU Emacs ( emacs ), Eclipse+PyDev ( eclipse , pydev ), or PyCharm ( pycharm ). Take a look at this IDE comparison list for many other alternatives. There is also a style guide for Python, named PEP 8 , which aims to make Python code more readable and consistent. This guide is (should be) followed all across the Python development community. Tagging Recommendation: Use the python tag, for all Python-related questions. If you believe your question includes issues specific to individual versions, use python-3.x or python-2.7 , in addition to the main python tag. If you believe your question may be even more specific, you can include a version-specific tag such as python-3.5 or python-3.6 , etc. Also, consider including the tag for the specific implementation ( jython , pypy , etc.), if you are using one other than cpython — the use of cpython is assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise. FAQ: These are some of the common questions many beginners face and can serve as canonical duplicate targets: User input: Asking the user for input until they give a valid response How can I read inputs as numbers? Get a list of numbers as input from the user Value testing: Why does a == b or c or d always evaluate to True? How to test multiple variables against a value? Common errors: What to do with “Unexpected indent” in python? Don't understand why UnboundLocalError occurs Dealing with lists: List of lists changes reflected across sublists unexpectedly How to remove items from a list while iterating? How to iterate through two lists in parallel? List changes unexpectedly after assignment. How do I clone or copy it to prevent this? How to make a flat list out of list of lists? Dealing with dicts: Iterating over dictionaries using 'for' loops How do I sort a dictionary by value? How can I add new keys to a dictionary? General: Using global variables in a function What is the best way to call a script from another script? How to execute a program or call a system command from Python?

PSF License Agreement for Python 2.7.x and 3.8.x Awesome-Python Full Stack Python Installation of External Packages: Pip pip Most of the Python libraries used for simple and advanced scripts are downloaded using pip, the Python Package Installer. It allows you to install and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library. Most distributions of Python come with pip pre-installed. General syntax: $ pip install SomePackage [...] Successfully installed SomePackage easy_install easy-install easy_install was released in 2004, as part of setuptools. It was notable at the time for installing packages from PyPI using requirement specifiers, and automatically installing dependencies. Easy Install is deprecated. Do not use it. Instead, use pip. Popular general use Python libraries: Requests requests A simple Python library for making HTTP requests. Requests are marketed as being "For Humans".

It combines the best of Python and Qt and it up to the programmer to decide whether to create a program by coding or using Qt Designer to create visual dialogs. It is available in both commercial as well as GPL license. Although some features may not be available in the free version, if your application is open source, then you can use it under the free license. The latest iteration of PyQt is v5 Tkinter tkinter Tkinter is commonly bundled with Python, using Tk, and is Python’s standard GUI framework. It is popular for its simplicity and graphical user interface. It is open-source and available under the Python License. One of the advantages of choosing Tkinter is that since it comes by default, there is an abundance of resources, both codes and reference books. Also with the community being old and active, many users can help you out in case of questions. PyGUI pygui PyGUI is a graphical application cross-platform framework for Unix, Macintosh, and Windows. Compared to some other GUI frameworks, PyGUI is by far the simplest and lightweight of them all, as the API is purely in sync with Python. PyGUI inserts very little code between the GUI platform and your Python application, hence the display of the application usually displays the natural GUI of the platform.
