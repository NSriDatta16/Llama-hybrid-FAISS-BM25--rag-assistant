For binary classification, which is best Random Forest or Neural networks?

I had to perform a binary classification, and from the beginning I started thinking about using the Random Forest classifier. But now I'm thinking, if using a neural network would've not been better. So my question is, which model you would've chosen.? and if not the Neural Networks, what are the tasks the most suited for the Neural Network and why.?
