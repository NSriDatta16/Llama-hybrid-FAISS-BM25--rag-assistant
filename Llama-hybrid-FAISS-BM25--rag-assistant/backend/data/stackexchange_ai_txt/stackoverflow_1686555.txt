I would guess the the column in your SQL 2005 database is defined as a varchar(N) , char(N) or text . If so the conversion is due to the database driver using a different code page setting to that set in the database. I would recommend changing this column (any any others that may contain non-ASCII data) to nvarchar(N) , nchar(N) or nvarchar(max) respectively, which can then contain any Unicode code point, not just those defined by the code page. All of my databases now use nvarchar / nchar exclusively to avoid these type of encoding issues. The Unicode fields use twice as much storage space but there'll be very little performance difference if you use this technique (the SQL engine uses Unicode internally).
