load html fragment with dynamic content

First of all In Jquery loading html frag with dynamic content using load() is it a good aproach? If yes when you load html fragment with load() from the server under JSP environment,How do you style the page with css?do you insert css syntax in the html frag inside jsp or you wait until you load it to the client side? To clarify more the html fragment i am trying to load is inbox page with a list of messages from friends just like linked-in or facebook.Any different advice will also be appreciated.
