Although it doesn't solve the problem of assigning string values to enum, which I think might be solved as others have pointed out by a simple Dictionary Dictionary StringEnumMap; You should take a look at the Stateless project in google code (my prefered one) or the Simple State Machine on codeplex to encapsulate the logic. Its verbosity is just amazing and I think it could fit perfectly what you need. An example from the stateless project homepage: var phoneCall = new StateMachine (State.OffHook); phoneCall.Configure(State.OffHook) .Allow(Trigger.CallDialed, State.Ringing); phoneCall.Configure(State.Ringing) .Allow(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook) .Allow(Trigger.CallConnected, State.Connected); phoneCall.Configure(State.Connected) .OnEntry(t => StartCallTimer()) .OnExit(t => StopCallTimer()) .Allow(Trigger.LeftMessage, State.OffHook) .Allow(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook) .Allow(Trigger.PlacedOnHold, State.OnHold); phoneCall.Configure(State.OnHold) .SubstateOf(State.Connected) .Allow(Trigger.TakenOffHold, State.Connected) .Allow(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook) .Allow(Trigger.PhoneHurledAgainstWall, State.PhoneDestroyed);
