Can Poisson deviance be used to evaluate models that use loss functions other than Poisson? (Such as MSE)

I am currently doing a a study on emergency department utilization rates at various geography levels. Especially of interest, are tree-based approaches to this analysis - namely random forest and GBMs. I've built some models using Sklearn RandomForestRegressor and HistGradientBoostingRegressor, both of which I've run using Poisson loss. For evaluation metrics, mainly I have been concerned with proportion of deviance explained (D squared), and mean Poisson deviance. However, to add some robustness I would also like to run some models that use MSE as loss and compare the performance to the Poisson-based models. I know this makes some false distributional assumptions - correct me if I am wrong - but given that the tree estimators are non-parametric, I don't believe this is entirely disingenuous. I know that "raw" error metrics could be viable here (i.e., MAE, MSE, total error, etc.), but I want to maintain the Poisson-specific metrics if possible. So, could I still use Poisson deviance/deviance explained when MSE is the loss? Is there a statistical explanation for why or why not?
