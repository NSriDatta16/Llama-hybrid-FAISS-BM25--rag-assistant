Visual Studio 2010 - no tests were run because no tests are loaded or the selected tests are disabled

I have a problem which has received plenty of attention which, despite much googling, I have been unable to resolve. I have a Test Project attached to my Visual Studio 2010 MVC 2 Application. When I attempt to run my tests, I get: "no tests were run because no tests are loaded or the selected tests are disabled." Following this, I followed the instructions in these posts, to no avail: MSTest: No tests are run because no tests are loaded or the selected tests are disabled = my GUIDs are right, and the assembly IS being built - I can see the file in explorer. MSTest Not Finding New Tests = reopening the solution & rebuilding didn't result in any change http://richallen.blogspot.com/2008/05/ms-test-re-enabling-ignored-tests.html = the tests do not even appear in the test list browser under "loaded tests" Furthermore, the output console reports: "Could not load file or assembly 'file://\shared\shared\IT\Development\TPS\TPS.Tests\bin\Debug\TPS.Tests.dll' or one of its dependencies. Operation is not supported. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131515)" I have confirmed the build settings on the Test Project are the same as those for the main project (Any CPU targeted). Therefore, is it a problem accessing the resource over network share? Otherwise, does anyone have a suggestion?
