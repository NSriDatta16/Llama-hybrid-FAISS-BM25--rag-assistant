This might be a bit more complicated. I normally reuse computer vision and deep learning software to do that. Even if I don't do Deep Learning. Particularly I use Pytorch, for its bridge with Numpy and pandas. Here is a tutorial . This allows me to use a GPU if wanted, and to reuse a lot of code since for deep learning and images there is tons of code snippets out there.
