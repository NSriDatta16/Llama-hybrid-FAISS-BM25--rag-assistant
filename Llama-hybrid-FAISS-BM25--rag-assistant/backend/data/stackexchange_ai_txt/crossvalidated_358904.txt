The SVM equations

I performed a model using an SVM regression with more than one predictor. After creating model, I need to use it with image processing software. The SVM used to model is “Radial”. My questions are: Please give me the equation that I have to use (there is many equations). Is it possible to use a multiple predictors in SVM? If yes, How to write the equation with number of predictors? Finally, is there a way to write function(s) in R to bootstrap SVM regression in order to choose best predictors (backward or forward selection) than to set best SVM hyperparameters
