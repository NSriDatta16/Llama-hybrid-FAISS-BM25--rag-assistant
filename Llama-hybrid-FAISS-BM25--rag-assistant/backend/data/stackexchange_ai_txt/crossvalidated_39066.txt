I don't see why you want to use ordinal logistic regression here (I don't use STATA, but I'm guessing that's what ologit is). You basically have 2 possibilities: accepted, & not accepted. Thus, you want to use regular logistic regression. Other than that, yes you want to fit the whole model & then solve for the predicted probability w/ the specific covariate values in question.
