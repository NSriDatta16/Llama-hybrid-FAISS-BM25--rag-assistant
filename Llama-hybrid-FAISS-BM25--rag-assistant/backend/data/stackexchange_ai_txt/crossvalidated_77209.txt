Unit root test refers to ARIMA model while the trend, seasonal effect and random component approach is about decomposition approach. They are different approach of time series. If ARIMA model is decided to use, unit root test can be employed and decide whether differencing is needed. But in this approach, seasonal component and trend should not be added to the model, because differencing can handle these effects. On the other hand, in decomposition approach, unit root test is not appropriate, neither the differencing.
