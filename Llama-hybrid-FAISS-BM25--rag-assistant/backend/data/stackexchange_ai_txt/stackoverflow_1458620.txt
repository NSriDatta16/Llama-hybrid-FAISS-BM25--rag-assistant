I've found the solution. We had a stored procedure that was waiting via WAITFOR DELAY if another stored procedure was still running. And somehow, our database got inconsistent, so the stored procedure thought the other procedure was running all the time and waited and waited and waited... At some point in the night, when the server got restarted because of a backup job, the agent worte this "The step was cancelled (stopped) as the result of a stop job request." into the job log. Maybe this will help someone in the future who has the same problem.
