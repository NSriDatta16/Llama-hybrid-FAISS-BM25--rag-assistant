Avoid ASP classic. It will reinforce bad programming practices. ASP.NET is only as "pre-made" as you allow it to be. If you want to learn, do not use the drag-and-drop designer; write all your HTML by hand in the VS editor. This will make you a far more versatile web developer, and will also prevent VS from generating "bloat" in your pages. I would also encourage you to explore ASP.NET MVC, because the WebForms model has many complications that MVC avoids. If you can, look for another internship. I politely, but firmly disagree with your boss.
