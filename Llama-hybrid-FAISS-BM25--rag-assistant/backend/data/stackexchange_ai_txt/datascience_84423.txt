loss function of autoencoders

I am trying to understand the loss function of autoencoders. I think the loss function of the decoder is to compare the input image with the decoded image, tell me if I am correct. but I don't understand what is being compared to find the encoder error. Someone explains to me that it compares to find the encoder error. and decoder.
