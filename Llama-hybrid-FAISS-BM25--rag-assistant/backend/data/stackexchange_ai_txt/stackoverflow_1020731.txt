java agents with maven in eclipse

I'm running aspectjweaver as a javaagent in Eclipse. I use maven to manage my dependencies, but I need to put a path to aspectjweaver on the command line. What's the recommended way to do this? Save another copy in my workspace? Reference my local repository? thanks, Jeff
