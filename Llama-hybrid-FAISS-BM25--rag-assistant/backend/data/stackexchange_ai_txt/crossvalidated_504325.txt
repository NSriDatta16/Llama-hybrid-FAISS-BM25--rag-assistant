Inaccurate parameter estimates for state-space models?

I'm modeling time series using dynamic linear/state-space models, and was surprised by how inaccurate the estimates of model parameters can be, even for fairly long series. In particular, I'm generating series of length n using the second-order local linear trend model: $\begin{align} y_t &= \mu_t + \alpha_t & \alpha_t \sim N(0, \sigma_\alpha^2)\\ \mu_{t+1} &= \mu_t + \nu_t + \beta_t & \beta_t \sim N(0, \sigma_\beta^2)\\ \nu_{t+1} &= \nu_t + \gamma_t & \gamma_t \sim N(0, \sigma_\gamma^2) \end{align}$ for some particular values of the the three variances $\sigma_\alpha^2, \sigma_\beta^2$ , and $\sigma_\gamma^2$ . Here the observed series is $y_t$ , while $\mu_t$ and $\nu_t$ are unobserved state variables. I then estimate the variances using the $\texttt{dlm}$ package in R. Here is some code: library(dlm) n (Sorry for the probably bad R code, I'm just a beginner R programmer.) It generates a $n=100$ series according to the above equations with variances equal to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, and then estimates the variances using the dlmMLE function. What surprised me is how off these estimates can be, even for a series of length 100. The average absolute error is about 0.11 (so around 50%). For a series with $n=1000$ , the error is still around 0.04 (so about 20%). Is this normal? Is parameter estimation for state-space models inherently difficult and noisy and error-prone (and therefore requires very long series for accurate estimates), or am I doing something wrong?
