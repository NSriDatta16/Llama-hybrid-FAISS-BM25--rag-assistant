Given the large volume of data and the rate that it's growing, I don't think that Amazon would be a good option. I'm assuming that you'll want to be storing the data on a persistent storage. But with EC2 you need to allocate a given amount of storage and attach it as a disk. Unless you want to allocate a really large amount of space (and then will be paying for unused disc space), you will have to constantly be adding more discs. I did a quick back of the envalop calculation and I estimate it will cost between $2,500 - $10,000 per year for hosting. It's difficult for me to estimate accurately because of all of the variable things that amazon charges for (instance uptime, storage space, bandwidth, disc io, etc.) Here's the EC2 pricing .
