Simple: use Amazon's Mechanical Turk . Without that (or an equivalent) you're in trouble. If there are no further constraints on the problem then you will need a full-blown AI, the kind that doesn't yet exist. If there are severe restraints then you might have a chance of doing this in a week. If the expert can be in any field (medicine, politics, history, fashion, science, comic books, etc.) then there will be no single, well-organized repository of essays. You'll have to use Google to find Dr. X's opinion. Once you find Dr. X's writing (and let's pray it's text, not audio) you'll have to do some kind of natural language processing to get the thrust of it, even if you're lucky enough to find a descriptive title ("Digital Photography Is Absolutely Great"). Then you have to figure out it's opposite. What's the opposite of "Neil Gaiman draws on folklore for his story ideas"? Figuring out what opinion you're looking for will be a serious problem. After that, things actually get easier: you can google for the subject and use the same magic tools to find the one you're looking for. So what do have a chance of solving? A search for opinions that someone else has already organised into "pro" and "con". Some online political forums are organised that way. Wikipedia cites opposing views in a special section in some of its articles. Science journals print letters of rebuttal. Look around, you might find a site even more cut-and-dried. Choose a small enough arena and you'll have a tractible problem. EDIT: Damn, Ben Dunlap beat me to all my major points in a comment. Sigh
