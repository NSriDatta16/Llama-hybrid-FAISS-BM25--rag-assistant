I think the notion goes back to commercial arrangements. The first and second parties are in a direct producer-purchaser relationship. The third-party parties are those other than the first party that the second party is dealing with. (Note that grammatical person doesn't quite fit, but it is a cute idea. It works better if the first party is the customer and the second-party is the primary supplier.) In this context, it is perhaps overloading too much on the term to say second-party developer. The second-party might be an IT organization and have to do many activities to install and use the products and services of the first-party. It might farm out a lot of that to third parties, too. Perhaps the key thing is that the third party is generally not part of the (business) relationship between the first and second parties.
