Each request takes 25-30 sec for Google Analytics API?

I'm using GAPI library (in PHP) for querying Google Analytics API. I request 2 dimensions (pagePath, date), 2 metric (pageviews, visits), past 365 days time range, and 2 filters for pagePath. Average time to get data for one query is 25-30 sec. When I use only 1 metric (pageviews), average response time is 3 sec. Why would there be such a difference when using 1 or 2 metrics?
