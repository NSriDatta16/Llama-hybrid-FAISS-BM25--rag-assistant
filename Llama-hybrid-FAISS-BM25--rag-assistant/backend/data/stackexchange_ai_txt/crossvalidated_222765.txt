Can we use Box-Ljung as a stationarity test for time series?

It's all in the title, I know that we usually use Box-Ljung to test the randomness in a time series (independence of residuals), but I found this post about how to tell if a time series is stationary or not. If this is correct, can someone explain how stationarity is checked using this test?
