The GEE is a marginal model. Unlike "plain" regression, such as OLS or GLMS for independent data, the GEE estimates the variance structure which accounts for correlation structures. However the point estimates are the same as with the models for independent data. The inference is also often from sandwich variance estimation which sandwiches the expected information (A matrix or bread) and observed information (B matrix or meat) to calculate robust error estimation. The sandwich is a powerful estimator even for independent data, providing heteroscedasticity consistent estimates of the standard error. Unfortunately, the literature on GEE hasn't, in my opinion, been well codified until somewhat recently. Two references come to mind: Longitudinal Data Analysis - Diggle, Heagerty, Liang and Zeger (the latter two authors pioneered the GEE model). Also recently Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods by Jonathan Wakefield
