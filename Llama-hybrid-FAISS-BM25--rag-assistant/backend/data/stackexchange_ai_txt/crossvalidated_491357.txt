Because the general approach in neural networks, especially in deep learning, is to let the NN learn to create useful features by themselves, instead of us engineering them. Especially in computer vision problems, the networks are made deeper (e.g. more layers) and wider (e.g. more filters) to learn more sophisticated representations of the input images.
