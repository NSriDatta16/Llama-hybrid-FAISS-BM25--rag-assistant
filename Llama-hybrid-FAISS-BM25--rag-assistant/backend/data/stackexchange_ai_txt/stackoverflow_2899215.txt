After trying a number of different methods, our dev team found it easiest to force everything to https when trying to display mixed content. Part of that was our particular environment (3rd party code, load-balancing servers, SSO servers, etc.) but we never found a solution which was elegant and worked everywhere. Sorry for the non-answer, but I figured knowing someone else investigated this issue might be nice.
