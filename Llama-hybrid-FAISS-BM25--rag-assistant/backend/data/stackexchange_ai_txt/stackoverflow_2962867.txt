Is it verified that iPad cannot create ad hoc wifi networks?

Has anyone been able to verify that the iPad cannot create an ad hoc network? It has different radio hardware (the fact that it does 802.11n demonstrates this) than the iPhones, which I thought was the reason that the iPhones could not create WiFi networks. I know this was sort of answered elsewhere, but I wanted it to get proper attention with its own question and by more tag coverage. Jeff, your god of biscuits. ;)
