Requirements for distances depend on method of hierarchical clustering. Single, complete, average methods need distances to be no-negative and symmetric. Ward, centroid, median methods need (squared) euclidean (which is even narrower definition than metric) distances to produce geometrically meaningful results. (One can check if his/her distance matrix is euclidean by doubly centering it [see my reply here ] and looking at the eigenvalues; if no negative eigenvalues found then the distances do converge in euclidean space.)
