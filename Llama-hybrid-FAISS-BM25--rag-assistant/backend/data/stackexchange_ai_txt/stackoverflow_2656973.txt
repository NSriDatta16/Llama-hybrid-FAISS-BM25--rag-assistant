I seriously doubt there is a way to get a complete list of .NET calls that require elevation of privileges. BTW writing to the Event Log doesn't require elevation, however creating an Event Log source does require elevation. The best way to find out which parts of your code have issues is by testing on Win7 and see what breaks, not elegant but does the job. If you are looking to create time estimates for this task, then you might have to spend a day or two hacking through your app: run on Win7, see what breaks, make note of it, comment/avoid/disable that section, and repeat until you think you have enough a of list of things to address.
