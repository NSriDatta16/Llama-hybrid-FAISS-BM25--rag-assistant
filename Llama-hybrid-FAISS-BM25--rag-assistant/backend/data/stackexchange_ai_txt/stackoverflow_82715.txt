Unfortunately I'm stuck on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 so that isn't an option for me. - (I will re-clarify that in my question as I found this solution after posting and realised i couldn't use it) I found that one solution was to setup a custom handler which would move my message onto another queue or poison queue and restart my service. This seemed crazy to me. Imagine my Sql Server was down how often the service would be restarted. SO what I've ended up doing is allowing the Line to fault and leave messages on the queue. I also log a fatal message to my system logging service that this has happened. Once our issue is resolved, I restart the service and all the messages start getting processed again. I realised re-processing this message or any other will all fail, so why the need to move this message and the others to another queue. I may as well stop my service, and start it again when all is operating as expected. aogan, you had the perfect answer for MSMQ 4.0, but unfortunately not for me
