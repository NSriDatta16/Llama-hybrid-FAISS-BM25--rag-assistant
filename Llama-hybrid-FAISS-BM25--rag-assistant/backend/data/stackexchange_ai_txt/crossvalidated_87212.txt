Testing for multicollinearity in logistic regression

So far I have checked the tolerance value, VIF and condition indexes. But checking the variance of the regression coefficients I have to wonder: how little variance of the regression coefficient should be associated with the smallest eigenvalue and what is too much (indicating multicollinearity)?
