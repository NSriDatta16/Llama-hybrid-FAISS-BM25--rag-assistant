Error creating spatial index on MySql BLOB column

I am trying to add a spatial index to a table column named Location of type BLOB. If I try this: ALTER TABLE route ADD SPATIAL INDEX(Location); I get: Error: BLOB/TEXT column 'Location' used in key specification without a key length But in the official docs for MySql 5.1 (the version I am using), it clearly says when referring to spatial indexes: "In MySQL 5.1, column prefix lengths are prohibited. The full width of each column is indexed." This surely says that I don't need to provide a prefix. I tried adding a prefix anyway like this: ALTER TABLE route ADD SPATIAL INDEX(Location(256)); And I get: Error: Incorrect prefix key; the used key part isn't a string, the used length is longer than the key part, or the storage engine doesn't support unique prefix keys So what the heck is going on?? For info, I am using MySQL 5.1.37 community, and my table is MyISAM, this is the create statement: CREATE TABLE `climb`.`route` ( `Id` int(11) NOT NULL, `Name` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `Location` blob, PRIMARY KEY (`Id`), ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1; PS I have also tried making Location NOT NULL, this made no difference.
