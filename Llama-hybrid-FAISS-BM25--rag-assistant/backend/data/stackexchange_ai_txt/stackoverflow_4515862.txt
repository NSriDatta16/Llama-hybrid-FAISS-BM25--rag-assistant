Reflection and Outlook AppointmentItem GetProperties

I have the following question: Why do I get nothing when I do appointment.GetType().GetProperties() but at the same time .GetMembers, .GetMethods work. appointment refers to an Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.AppointmentItem I need to dynamically build a list of properties on a given AppointmentItem object. I am able to set the properties them once I have a name, but I also want to do the reverse, to get all the names and iterate through the names to get the values for storage. Any pointers?
