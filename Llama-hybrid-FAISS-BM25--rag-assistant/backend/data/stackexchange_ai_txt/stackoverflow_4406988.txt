Though this is not guaranteed, most std::string will implement the Small String Optimization , which is just that (with VC++10 up to 8 or 16 characters are thusly stored) I have not seen vectors do it, and always wondered why, but the upcoming C++ standard will facilitate this with std::aligned_storage and alignof . This way we'll be able to get properly aligned raw memory and build containers with some default number of "stack" memory.
