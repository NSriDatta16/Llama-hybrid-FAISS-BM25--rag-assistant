Exponential Smoothing for many time series

I have a detailed dataset with a lot of time series. If I apply exponential smoothing (using for instance R ) it will take me to much time to calculate an $\alpha$ (level parameter) and $\beta$ (trend parameter) for each time series. Therefore, is there a scientific method you can apply when you have a lot of time series (maybe by calculating a pooled $\alpha$ and $\beta$ or something like that).
