With the variables that were observed or not being pretty much random you should be able to use standard missing data tools. These include the EM algorithm and Multiple imputation . There are existing tools that help with Multiple imputation and make a regression analysis fairly straight forward. Another option is to do a Bayesian regression fit and specifying a prior on each of the missing values.
