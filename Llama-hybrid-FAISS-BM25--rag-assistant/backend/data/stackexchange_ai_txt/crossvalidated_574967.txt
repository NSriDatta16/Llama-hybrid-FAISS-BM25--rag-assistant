Interpreting Results of Logistic Regression when both x, y variables are nominal

I've been trying to analyze the result from my experiment. But since I'm new to the field of statistics, I'm struggling in every step, including the interpretation of results. I have 4 groups of subjects, and each subjects made a choice between 3 options(A or B or No choice). I wanted to show that "Being in Group4" changes choice from B to A. To test such hypothesis, I tried using logistic regression. Since my dependent variable has more than 3 outcomes (A or B or NoChoice), I used multinomial logistic regression. And as my independent variable was also nominal (Group 1~4), I use one-hot encoding as shown below. Group1 Group2 Group3 Group4 Choice 1 0 0 0 A 0 1 0 0 A 0 1 0 0 B 0 0 0 1 A 0 0 1 0 No choice 1 0 0 0 A 0 1 0 0 A And because it uses one-hot encoding, I dropped "group 1" and proceeded with group 2, 3, 4 to avoid multicollinearity problem when making regression model. So by using R, I managed to get the result below (I used "Choice B" as reference") Call: multinom(formula = Choice ~ Group2 + Group3 + Group4, data = mydata) Coefficients: (Intercept) Group2 Group3 Group4 A 0.1004105 -0.3031104 -0.3030879 -1.198999 NoChoice 7.7997855 -6.6829425 -7.2990311 -7.029537 Std. Errors: (Intercept) Group2 Group3 Group4 A 0.8790567 0.5607085 0.6935957 0.5222399 NoChoice 111.4725793 111.4715781 111.4716982 111.4717650 Residual Deviance: 96.76822 AIC: 112.7682 and then to check statistical significance, I calculated Wald z to get p-values below: > zvalues pvalues pvalues (Intercept) Group2 Group3 Group4 A 0.9090592 0.5887939 0.6621254 0.02168292 NoChoice 0.9442172 0.9521939 0.9477928 0.94971781 But I'm confused with the result because I could not find another case yet where both x and y variables are nominal. So Here's my questions: When I report this result, can I say anything about the effect on being on Group1? Since p_value is below 0.05 only in the upper row of Group 4, is it correct to say that being on group 4 effects choice shift from B to A significantly whereas group 2,3 does not have significant effect? How do I interpret the result of Intercept? Can it be interpreted as the result of Group1?
