Johansen Cointegration Test

I do have a question regarding Johansen Cointegration test. After checking my time series variables with ADF, PP and KPSS, I conclude that my time series is non-stationary at level but stationary at first differences . Thus, the variables are all I(1) . Now my question: When I apply the Johansen cointegration test (function ca.jo in "urca" package in R), should I test with the variables at level or at first difference? I did not test the first differences yet, but I do find at least one cointegration for the level data. I assume it's okay to test with level data as long as the variables have the same order of integration? Thanks!
