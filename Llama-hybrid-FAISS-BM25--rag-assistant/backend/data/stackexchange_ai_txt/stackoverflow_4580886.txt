If dealing with huge datasets, constantly checking the last created object can become quite intensive (especially when talking distributed storage, etc). One alternative is to base the IDs on say the time, a random string, and more information, in order to create unique IDs less intensively without having to worry about collisions. http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/06/announcing-snowflake.html provides some information on how Twitter deals with this.
