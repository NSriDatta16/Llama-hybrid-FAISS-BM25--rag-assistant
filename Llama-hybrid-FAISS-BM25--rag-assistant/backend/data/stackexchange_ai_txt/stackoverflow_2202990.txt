You talk about formatting and evidently want aligned output. I notice that Å‚ is the only character in the sample not occurring in Latin1. To rule out the problem that you just have a stupid font, configure your terminal to display a well-behaved one with extensive coverage: DejaVu Sans Mono is nice. Also, have you hexdumped the output yet? This is what I get: 0000 4d 69 6b 6f c5 82 61 6a 0a Miko..aj .
