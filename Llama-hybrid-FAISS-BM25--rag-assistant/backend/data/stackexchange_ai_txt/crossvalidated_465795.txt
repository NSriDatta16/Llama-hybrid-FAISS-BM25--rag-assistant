How to discover relationships between features?

I'm an undergraduate fairly new to statistics. I am trying to find relationships between the features of a dataset. The dataset in question consists of 5000 objects each with up to 23 features. I was looking for methods which could relate many features. The idea would be to find a sort of "equation" that would relate some features. My guess is that this problem would have something to do with regression analysis. In the past MIC was applied to this dataset, but without any results. From what I understand, it is limited to only analyzing the relationship between 2 features at a time. I was suggested to use Neural Networks. However, in my limited understanding, I'm not sure the data would be big enough to do so. Furthermore, arent NN like black-boxes, would it be possible to extract how it does a prediction? Any pointers of possibly useful techniques/resources to learn from, are greatly appreciated! Many thanks for the help.
