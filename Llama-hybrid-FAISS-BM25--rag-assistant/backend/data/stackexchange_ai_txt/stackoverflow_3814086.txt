Eclipse canonical list of command line options

I have googled all the obvious strings, searched through FAQs but cannot find a canonical list of command line options for eclipse. I have installed eclipse on an NFS mounted directory and upon upgrading to helios immediately began having errors with lock files. The NFS export options are (rw,insecure,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,async) I can't process locks in the workspace (an NFS dir) nor in eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/.manager/ Upon starting eclipse, eclipse posts a dialog Locking is not possible in the directory "(NFS path)/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi". A common reason is that the file system or Runtime Environment does not support file locking for that location. Please choose a different location, or disable file locking passing "-Dosgi.locking=none" as a VM argument. Starting eclipse directly with the arg -Dosgi.locking=none still belches same error. Since it's a VM arg, I cannot figure out how/where to specify an alternate lock dir or none; as stated, I can't even find a canonical list of all eclipse args. Thanks, bsd 64bit Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS AMD Phenom II X4 940 (Black) 8GB DDR2 4x2GB unganged ASUS M4A785-M
