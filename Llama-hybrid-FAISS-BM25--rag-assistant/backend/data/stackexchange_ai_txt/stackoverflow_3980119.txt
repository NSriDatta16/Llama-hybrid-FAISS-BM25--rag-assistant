There's a non-linear (sort of hackerish, sideways and admittedly unprofessional) way to do this - a kind-of follow the breadcrumbs approach: choose any line of code and read on until you find some (say) function or class that grabs your attention; copy its name and mark the block with a comment ('found: [name of thing]', incrementally adding each thing you follow); then search for every instance of this word throughout the code; you'll find the actual 'thing' on the way, so make a note of the line where it appears, and what it does. After you've done this awhile (if the method works for you) the thinking behind the code becomes apparent and you'll hopefully locate all the main connections quite quickly. In the worst cases, I've also searched & replaced all instances of poorly-named vars, subroutines, etc. to something that makes more descriptive sense (then run the code again). Of course (like Paul says) if you use an editor or IDE that can list defined stuff, you're already halfway there :-)
