(PHP & mySQL) Treat rows as columns

I am working on PHP & mySQL based website. I am trying to setup the 'Settings' page in administration panel where I can enter different settings to manage the site. The settings can range upto 100 (or even more) depending upon the requirements. So instead of making 100 columns (and increase if I have to add more columns in future), I want to store the data in row wise format and fetch the values as if I am fetching it from columns. REFERENCE: I found a similar real life implementation of such feature in the most popular blogging tool 'Wordpress'. For reference, it is the 'wp_options' table that I am talking about.(Please correct me I am wrong) EXAMPLE: Here's a quick example of what (& why) I am trying to do it that way: --Table settings P.KEY option_name option_value 1 site_name XYZ site inc. 2 siteurl http://www.xyz.com 3 slogan Welcome to my XYZ site 4 admin_email admin@xyz.com 5 mailserver_url mail.xyz.com 6 mailserver_port 23 ..... etc. As you can see from above, I have listed very few options and they are increasing in number. (Just for the records, my installation of Wordpress has 902 rows in wp_options table and I did not see any duplicate option_name). So I have the feeling that I am well off if I apply the same working principle as Wordpress to accomodate growth of the settings. Also I want to do it so that once I save all the settings in DB, I want to retrieve all the settings and populate the respective fields in the form, for which the entries exist in DB. ONE OF MY CODE TRIALS: -- -- Table structure for table `settings` -- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `settings` ( `set_id` tinyint(3) NOT NULL auto_increment, `option_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `option_value` varchar(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`set_id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ; -- -- Dumping data for table `settings` -- INSERT INTO `settings` (`set_id`, `option_name`, `option_value`) VALUES (1, 'site_name', 'XYZ site inc.'), (2, 'slogan', 'Welcome to my XYZ site'); $result = mysql_query("SELECT option_name, option_value FROM settings"); $defaults = array('option_name', 'option_value'); while( list($n, $v) = mysql_fetch_array($result) ) { $defaults['option_name'] .= $n; $defaults['option_value'] .= $v; } echo $defaults['option_name'].'---'.$defaults['option_value'].' '; //The above code gives me the following Output: //site_nameslogan---XYZ site inc.Welcome to my XYZ site When I run the above query, I also receive 2 PHP Notices that says: Undefined index: option_name Undefined index: option_value I would appreciate any replies that could show me the PHP code to retrieve the options successfully and eliminate the Undefined index issues as well. Also, like I mentioned earlier, I want to retrieve all the existing settings and populate the respective fields in the form when I visit the settings page next, after storing the data. Thanks fly out to all in advance.
