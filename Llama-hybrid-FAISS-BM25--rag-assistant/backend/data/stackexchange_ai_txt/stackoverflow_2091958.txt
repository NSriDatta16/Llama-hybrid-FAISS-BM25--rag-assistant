How to get maven gwt 2.0 build working

EDIT: Added some of the output of the mvn -X -e commands at the end My company is developing a GWT application. We've been using maven 2 and GWT 1.7 successfully for quite a while. We recently decided to upgrade to GWT 2.0. We've already updated the eclipse project and we are able to successfully run the application in dev-mode. We are struggling to get the application built using maven though. I'm hoping somebody can tell me what I'm doing wrong here since I'm running out of time on this. The exacty bit of the output that worries me is the 'GWT compilation skipped' message: [INFO] Copying 119 resources [INFO] [compiler:compile {execution: default-compile}] [INFO] Compiling 704 source files to K:\iCura\assessor\target\classes [INFO] [gwt:compile {execution: default}] [INFO] using GWT jars for specified version 2.0.0 [INFO] establishing classpath list (scope = compile) [INFO] com.curasoftware.assessor.Assessor is up to date.

It's finding the correct sourceDirectory. That folders has a 'com' folder within which ultimately is the source of the application organized in folders as per the package structure.
