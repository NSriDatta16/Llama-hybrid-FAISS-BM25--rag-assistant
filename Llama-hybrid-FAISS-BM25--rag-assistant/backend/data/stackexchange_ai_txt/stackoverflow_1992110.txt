Matt Facer just posted a question that includes more-or-less the code you're talking about. UIImage detecting touch and dragging The short answer is that you don't create the UIImages in IB. You'll create the programmatically and add them to the main view as you need them. The UITouch event can be used to determine the view that was touched. There's probably no need for an array here; an NSMutableSet makes more sense unless there's some special reason for preserving order.
