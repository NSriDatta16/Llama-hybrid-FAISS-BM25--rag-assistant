You can use univariate (or multivariate) time series regressions or neural network. Neural networks are more powerful, especially the dynamic NN which have memory and they can be trained to learn sequential or time-varying patterns. In contrast to regression models, you can train your neural network model by setting different parameters (and the training algorithm to use) and then check its quality on a test set (or on the actual set of points you are trying to predict if you have it!). A crucial step is the setting of the n. of delay and the n. of the hidden neurons of the NN. An increase of them would reduce the Mean Squared Error but it would increase the computational time of the algorithm. So, it is necessary to find a right trade-off between them. Furthermore, to start and get used to training NN, check out this applet: https://nl.mathworks.com/help/nnet/gs/neural-network-time-series-prediction-and-modeling.html or otherwise open the Neural Network Start GUI with this command: nnstart It is an easy way to train your NN and it gives you the scripts at the end! Let me know about that!
