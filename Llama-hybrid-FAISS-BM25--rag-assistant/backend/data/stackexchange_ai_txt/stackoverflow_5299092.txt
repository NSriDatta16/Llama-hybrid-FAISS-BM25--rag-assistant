Edit configuration file through python

I need to edit a configuration file through python and i tried searching on stackoverflow and google and they don't cover my situation, since i need to replace lines in the file and perform matches in my search. Also, what i found covers how to do it for one line, i will be performing at least 8 line replacements in the file and I would like to know if there is a cleaner and more elegant way of doing this than putting 10 replace(foo, bar) lines altogether. I need to "match" lines like "ENABLEPRINTER", "PRINTERLIST", "PRNT1.PORT". I want to match thesse text and ignore whatever follows (ex: "=PRNT1, PRNT2"). So i would do something like replace('ENABLEPRINTER', 'y') replace('PRINTERLIST', 'PRNT3) The file looks like this: ENABLEPRINTER=n PRINTERLIST=PRNT1, PRNT2 PRNT1.PORT=9600 PRNT1.BITS=8 Also note these files are about 100 lines and i need to edit about 10 of them. Thank you very much for your help. UPDATE : Using the code posted by @J.F. Sebastian, i'm now getting the following error: configobj.ParseError: Parse error in value at line 611. Line 611 of the file is: log4j.appender.dailyRollingFile.DatePattern='.'yyyy-MM-d So the problem is with the ' character. If I comment out that line, the script is working fine with the code posted by @J.F. Sebastian.
