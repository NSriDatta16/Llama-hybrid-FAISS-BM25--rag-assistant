#include #include /* get seconds since the Epoch */ time_t secs = time(0); /* convert to localtime */ struct tm *local = localtime(&secs); /* and set the string */ sprintf(timeString, "%02d:%02d:%02d", local->tm_hour, local->tm_min, local->tm_sec); The important types for dealing with time (the wall-clock type of time, not process/thread time) are time_t and struct tm . With some work you can convert between one and the other, but you have to pay attention to local time versus UTC time. Peruse the description of , try the functions there until you grok time in C. Again, pay attention to UTC time and local time.
