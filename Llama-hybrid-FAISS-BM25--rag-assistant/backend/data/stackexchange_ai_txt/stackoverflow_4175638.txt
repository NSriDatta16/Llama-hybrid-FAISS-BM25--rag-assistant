Which Programming methodology to used for Final Year Project?

I am a final year Computer Science Student and as part of my Bachelors degree I am doing a project on Data Mining of Microarray DNA expression data. I will have to develop a few algorithms such as Bayesian Networks to run on my datasets to find out how each variable(genes) affect each other. As part of my Project Proposal I have to talk about which methodology I will use to develop my software. From what I have learnt in school and from extra reading I find that the Incremental Development model seems a good idea. I would run 2- 3 iterations of Plan, Design, Implement until I get the full functionality of the software. Could somebody with more knowledge than me please tell me it this sounds like a good idea. The reason why I am not 100% sure which methodology I would use is because I don't have a team to work on the software, I don't have a client with requirements and I am very limited in terms of the amount of time to work on the project as I have 3 other modules. All the methodologies which I have read about seem to be for big software projects with teams of developers. What do you do if you are just 1 person and focusing mainly on getting 3-4 algorithms to work rather than focusing on getting broad range of functionality. I was also thinking of using UML to get a better idea what I want the software to do and using like a stripped down version of an Object Oriented Methodology. My guess would be I would have to use parts of more than 1 methodology at a very basic level but I just can't pick. I am very confused and lost on the subject so any help is greatly appreciated. Thank You,
