Best Feature extraction for at the end retrieving audio

I work on a machine learning algo, which basically learns sequences in an audio .wav and generates the most “logical” sequences. The algorithm learns features, so I generate MFCCs from the audio file. But at the end it’s impossible to do MFCCs to .wav properly. I read this paper [1] which says, yeah MFCCs lose a lot of information and give other feature extraction techniques but I don’t really know how to implement them in python. So if you know some good feature extraction techniques for retrieving/reconstruct audio, with which I can choose the number of coefficients and how many times a vector of these coefficients represents, it would be so much help for me ! I Have test, the Librosa library which can generate MFCC and reconstruct audio with them but the MFCCs generated have weird dimensions like for 12 coef, you get a matrix 12 lines and 1000 columns, or i want the transpose of this matrix. Thanks. [1] Gonzalez, Ruben. (2013). Better Than MFCC Audio Classification Features. 10.1007/978-1-4614-3501-3_24.
