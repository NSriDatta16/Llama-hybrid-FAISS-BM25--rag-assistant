This depends on the system. Windows has centralized certificate storage, while other platforms don't (at least, no uniform one). So querying system certificates is platform-specific. And as it is, it would be wise to look for JNI to platform-specific API for doing what you need. I guess there must be some class already available for Windows (most likely working via JNI), but I never saw one. I'd be interested in such solution too (for specific purposes where JNI can't be used).
