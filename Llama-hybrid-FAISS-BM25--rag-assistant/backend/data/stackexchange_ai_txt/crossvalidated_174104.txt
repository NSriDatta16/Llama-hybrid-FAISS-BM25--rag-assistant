Averaging the coefficients just means that: compute the hazard ratios in each of your dataset, add them and divide by 5 (= the number of imputed datasets). However, Rubin's rules assume that the sampling distribtution (actually, the posterior distribution) of the estimates is normal. This is more likely to be true for log(hazard ratios) than hazard ratios. Remember that a normal distribution covers all negative and positive numbers, while a hazard ratio cannot be negative. So more often the log-hazard ratios are combined using Rubin's rules and than the combined log-hazard ratio is transformed to hazard ratios.
