TeamCity & Subversion: Checkout copies ALL tags to buildagent's checkout directory

We have the following URL: URL: https://dev-01:8555/svn/Shop We have the following structure in SubVersion Shop --trunk --branches --tags The problem is, when I do a build, under the buildagent directory, I get every single tag in the repository copied over to the buildagent. Is there a way to only retrieve the HEAD revision to effect the build on.
