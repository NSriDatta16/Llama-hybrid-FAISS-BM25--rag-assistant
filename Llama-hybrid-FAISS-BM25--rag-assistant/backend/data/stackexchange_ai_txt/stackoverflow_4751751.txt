Our company started using Maven about 8 months ago. It forces you to organize your project into logical modules. Before, we had two projects for a client/server application, with circular dependencies. Now we have a framework project for the shared code, and individual server and client projects for the unique stuff. All of our 'standalone' apps (custom installer builder, etc) can also branch off of the framework too. Depending on how complex your setup is, it may be time-consuming to "Mavenize" your project. However, I've found that once you do so, things such as dependency management are no longer an active concern. Maven is also useful in that it hooks nicely into Hudson, which is a continuous integration server. Hudson will do regular builds for you, whether by polling Subversion on some regular basis, or simply every night. It will also automate all of your unit testing as well (you /are/ using JUnit or a similar appropriate framework, right?) Hudson is incredibly simple to set up. You can deploy it into Tomcat pretty much instantly, with a minimum of configuration. It provides a decent selection of plugins if you want to work with a tool such as Sonar. Subversion is a fairly popular source control tool. I don't mind it; it's what I have the most experience. I've played with Mercurial, but not enough to really contrast Subversion with it. The most important thing to learn with Subversion is how to branch and merge properly. Knowing this will let you maintain separate branches for disjoint feature requests, bug fixes, etc. You can more easily do experimental builds or a special build for QA/your test group. Merging can be painful. I've heard some horror stories, but the worst I've run into is dealing with the 'normal' sort of conflicts that crop up when working on a team. I've left out Trac because I have no experience with it beyond hearing the name before. Edit: a quick Google informs me it is bug tracking software. I've had decent luck with Bugzilla, which is another open-source bug tracker, but configuring it properly is aggravating and upgrading can be a nightmare due to how picky its permissions setup is, especially when trying to integrate with suexec. YMMV
