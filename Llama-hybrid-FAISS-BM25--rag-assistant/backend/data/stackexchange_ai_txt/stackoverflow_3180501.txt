WCF reliable sessions via proxy server - not sending authentication credentials on Windows XP

I have a full trust XBAP which connects using reliable sessions to a remote service using the endpoint configuration attached below. The catch is that when running the application behind a client's organizational proxy server, the WCF requests are blocked on Windows XP but pass through fine on Windows 7. My suspicion (pending further analysis by the client) is that the default proxy credentials are not attached to the HTTP or HTTPS requests on the XP machines, despite the useDefaultWebProxy=true setting. Is this a known issue on XP, or am I missing something? Is there a way to bypass this issue? Thanks in advance for any help Binding configuration for the secure (production) version: For the demo (unsecured) version: (Please note that neither of them work under the described conditions!)
