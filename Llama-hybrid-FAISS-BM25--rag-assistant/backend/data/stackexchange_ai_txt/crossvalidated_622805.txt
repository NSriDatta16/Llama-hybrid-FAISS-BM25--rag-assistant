Logistic regression with binary and ordinal variables (SAS)

I have survey results (n=14, small size, I know) which scored several health measures from Poor (1), Fair (2), Good (3), Very Good (4), and Excellent(5). I want to see if having a physician (0=no, 1=yes) and insurance (0=no, 1=yes) predicts the likelihood of someone reporting poorer or greater health scores. How would I do this? And in SAS? My colleague recommended I perform logistic regression. I have only performed frequency, correlation, and linear regression in SAS so far. I am new to statistics and coding. This is my code: proc logistic data = inc.data_scores desc; class general_health1; model physician (event='1') = general_health1; run; general_health1 is the ordinal variable. My results seem weird (below). I know I've got this wrong somehow.
