It may be that the boost documentation is simply talking about a general configurable limit, not necessarily some hard limit of the platform. On Linux, the ulimit command limits resources processes can have (number of threads, stack size, memory, and a bunch of other stuff). This will indirectly impact your thread local storage. On my system, there doesn't seem to be an entry in ulimit specific to thread local storage. Other platforms may have a way to specify that on its own. Also, I think in many multiprocessor systems, the thread local storage will be in memory dedicated to that CPU, so you may run into limits of physical memory long before the system as a whole has its memory exhausted. I would assume there is some kind of fallback behavior to locate the data in main memory in that situation, but I don't know. As you can tell, I'm conjecturing a lot. Hopefully it still leads you in the right direction...
