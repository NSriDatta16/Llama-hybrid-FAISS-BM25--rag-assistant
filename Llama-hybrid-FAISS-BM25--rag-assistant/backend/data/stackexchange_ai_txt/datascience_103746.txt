Speech/Voice Detection in Audio Files

I have several hundred 30 second long WAVE Files. I need a way to find out, if there are spoken words / voices / speech in them or not. E.g.: 1.wav no; 2.wav yes; 3.wav no (boolean) or 1.wav 0.21; 2.wav 0.93; 3.wav 0.13 (likelihood) My approach is to transform the wave-files into spectograms. I don't have any labels, so training a Neural Network is out of reach. The problem: all pre-trained networks focus on speech-to-text. Does anyone know a solution?
