Giving all labels the same Text doesn't make any sense, let's assume you meant "Font". Yes, this is possible, all three properties are "ambient" properties. Which means that when you don't explicitly give them a value, either in the designer or in your code, then they'll 'inherit' the property value of their container. Ambient properties were designed to easily give your UI consistent look and feel. Just assign the parent control's property and the label property automatically get the same value. You can put them in, say, a Panel to isolate them from the other controls in the form if necessary. Another way in the designer is to select them all by dragging a larger rectangle around them and setting the property. Ctrl+Click to add/remove controls from that selection. Favor the ambient property approach though.
