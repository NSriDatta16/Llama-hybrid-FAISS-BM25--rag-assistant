Your situation is ideal for the generalization of the Kruskal-Wallis test: the proportional odds ordinal logistic model. With that model you can adjust for covariates, avoid problematic change scores, and analyze the ordinal response directly while handling even extreme clumping in the data. The prop. odds model has as many intercepts as you have distinct values of $Y$, less one. For a start see my RMS course notes . But this deals with the non-repeated-measures part of your issue. To handle repeated measures you have three choices: Bayesian hierarchical prop. odds model (e.g.. R brms package), mixed effects classical proportional odds model (e.g., R ordinal package), or fit the regular prop. odds univariate model on a tall and thin dataset and correct after-the-fact for within-subject correlation (e.g., R rms package lrm , orm , and robcov functions).
