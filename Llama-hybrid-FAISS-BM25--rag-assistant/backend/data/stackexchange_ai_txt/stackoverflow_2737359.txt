Images not loading online but works when I try it offline (local), why is this?

I am using localgetstorage and setstorage to load a list of links and show them as in a slideshow. The problem is that when I preview it on my PC it works, as soon as I try to use the page in my server online it won't work. Have I done something wrong? Here's a link: http://hem.bredband.net/noor/bildspelet/bildspelet.html It is very buggy and I'd rather just use a thirdparty slideshow plugin but I don't know where to find one that matches my needs and is free..
