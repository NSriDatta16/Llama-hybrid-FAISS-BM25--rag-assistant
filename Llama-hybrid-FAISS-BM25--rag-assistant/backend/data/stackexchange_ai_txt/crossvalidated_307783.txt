I suggest you could look here: https://vk.com/doc8733459_342746046?hash=7f1ab7634db4cb6828&dl=2086b693480c5a7d41 It is a paper presentation by Prof. Leonidov on the Econophysics or Statistical Enonomics, whatever you prefer. I particularly refer to slides 14 and 15 on exogenous effects to the stock price. They analyzed many years of news feed affecting the stocks. They call the problem, along with the physics conventions, a relaxation. It is an averaged (over many events) process of price volatility returning to its "normal" level following any significant news. They found actually that the news effect is an order or 2 orders less meaningful than the price dynamics itself (indigenous processes). Just to give you an idea how to approach this on a high level. I am sorry that half of that paper is in Russian, but you could search through preprints authored by Leonidov. It is quite a mind blowing reading...
