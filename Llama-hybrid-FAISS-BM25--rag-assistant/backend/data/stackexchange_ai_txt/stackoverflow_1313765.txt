Session Lock Contention with Page Readonly in Inproc Mode

I recently discovered that when you have a page set to session readonly and you are using inproc (in memory) session storage, the session is still writable on that page and is not truly read only. Out of process session storage does respect the readonly setting. Do you still get the benefit of having no session lock contention when a page is set to readonly and using inproc mode? Will multiple simultaneous requests with the same session Id have to wait for the session lock to release when in readonly and inproc?
