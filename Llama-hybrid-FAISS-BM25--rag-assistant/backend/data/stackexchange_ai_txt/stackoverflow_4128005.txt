If you want to do it in a separate module, you should put your new model (block, helper or whatever you need to override - I'll be using the model example, its the same for the others - only the controllers are quite different) in the 'Model' directory (for instance: code/local/MyNamespace/MyModule/Model/Sales/Order.php). In your modules config.xml you should add: (...) (...) MyNamespace_MyModule_Model_Sales_Order (...) Of course your own Sales_Order model should inherit from the core one. This is the cleanest way to override Magento core functionality (maybe besides events, but they can't do everything).
