Converting my comment into an answer in view of the OP's response, given any two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$, their average value (or sample mean) is $$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2}{2}.$$ The sample standard deviation is $$ \sigma = \sqrt{\left.\left.\frac{1}{2-1}\right[(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(x_1-\bar{x})^2\right]} = \frac{|x_2-x_1|}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707|x_2-x_1| $$ Assume without loss of generality that $x_1 \leq x_2$. Obviously, $[x_1, x_2]$ is a $100\%$ confidence interval for the observations which does not even require any calculations of $\bar{x}$ or $\sigma$, but even greater confidence can be generated among the non-cognoscenti by saying that $\left[\bar{x}-\sigma/\sqrt{2},\bar{x}+\sigma/\sqrt{2}\right]$ is a $100\%$ confidence interval for the observations.
