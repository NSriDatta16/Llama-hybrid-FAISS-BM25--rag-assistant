Compare the following code examples (apologies, my C++ is a little rusty). C++: int x; std::cin >> x; C: int x; scanf("%d", &x); So, what do you see above? In C++, a value is plugged into a variable. That's cool, but what does it teach us? In C, we notice a few things. The x has a funny & in front of it, which means it's address is being passed. That must mean that the scanf function actually needs to know where in memory x is. Not only that, but it needs a format string, so it must not really hvae any idea of what address you're giving it and what format it's getting information in? C lets you discover all these wonderful things about how the Computer and the Operating System actually work, if you will put effort towards it. I think that's pretty cool.
