Mixed-effects models with customer data: how do choices affect the model?

Suppose I had a large sample of customer data from which I want to predict total amount of sales over a time period with predictor variables indicating: -which sales channel did customers come from (e.g. internet, phone, store), which has a big impact on the variable to predict and the categories are not going to change. -demographic data (e.g. age, gender, address) including zip code. -detailed information for each zip code (e.g. average income, proportion of people with university degrees, etc.). And I wanted to use them to both predict and make inferences on the total amount purchased over a period of time (not necessarily having the same model for both). Iâ€™d like to ask what would be effects or the advantages/disadvantages of these approaches: -Using a nested structure of state/city/zip code vs. appending the aggregated information from the zip code to each record (i.e. replacing zip code by columns indicating average income and such in that specific zip code). -Treating the sales channel as a random effect vs. a fixed effect interacting with others, in terms of predictive accuracy. Finally, how would you decide on classifying the sales channel as either a fixed or random effect?
