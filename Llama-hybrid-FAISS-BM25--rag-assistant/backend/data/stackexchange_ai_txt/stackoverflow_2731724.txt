Like David commented above, you need to run the Teamcity Agent service as the user that has the drive mapped. To do that, go to the Services console, right click the service "Teamcity Build Agent", Properties, Log On, This account. What I usually do is to use UNC path and if needed, before reaching the path I authenticate with "net use \machine\folder /USER:domain\user password".
