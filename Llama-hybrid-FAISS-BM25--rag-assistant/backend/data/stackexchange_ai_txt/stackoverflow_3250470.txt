AS i was runnig the code on a diferent thread, the credetials where not set for that thread, so all i have to do was to impersonate the main's thread identity and that works. It should look like this using (System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Impersonate()) { //Consult the isolated storage here }
