How can I produce sentences response with AI when I use my own data to train the model?

I have trained a model in KERAS with my own text data from OneNote notices. Now, when I use the model.predict function with a question as an input, I receive as return data an array with 5700 elements with some probabilities. Now I don't how can I generate a meaningful reply from my model. I tried to find a solution, so I used the 10 maximum probabilities to generate a sentence but the result is ridiculous. I use the following model model = tf.keras.Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.Embedding(total_words, 100, input_length=max_sequence_length), tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2), tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(128, 5, activation='relu'), tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=4), tf.keras.layers.LSTM(150), tf.keras.layers.Dense(total_words, activation='softmax') ]) Could anyone help me with my issue or give me any tip?
