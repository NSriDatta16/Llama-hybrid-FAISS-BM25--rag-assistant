Data Art/ Data Visualization Art/ Information Art

Few days ago, I learned about data art/ data visualization art/ information art. I think I have interest in it. I want to see how I can use my data science skills in this area. However, I don't know how and where to start. I would be grateful if you guys could recommend books, videos or online tutorials for me. Thanks Note: I am a self-learning student of data science. I have basic understanding of data visualization. I mostly use deep learning in my work.
