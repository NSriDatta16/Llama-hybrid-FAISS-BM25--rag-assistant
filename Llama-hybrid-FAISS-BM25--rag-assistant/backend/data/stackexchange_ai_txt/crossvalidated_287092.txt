The likelihood is not restricted to be between 0 and 1, so it could hardly be a probability of anything: notice that in order to compute the likelihood associated to a sample of a continuous variable, you multiply the densities which can have any (non-negative) value. Aside from that, asking for the probability of parameters being such and such only makes sense in a Bayesian setting. In a classical setting parameters are fixed rather than random variables, so it makes no sense to assign them any probability.
