Quantifying + comparing the effects of conditioning on Shannon entropy

I'm working on a project that compares how predictable/unpredictable individuals' actions are in terms of how they transition between actions. We consider their actions to part of a first-order Markov chain, where $X$ is a random variable describing their present action and $Y$ describes their next action. We calculate $P(Y|X)$ based on observed data and then compute $H(Y|X)$ for each person. Ideally, we'd like to be able to compare the transitional/behavioral unpredictability between individuals. Our concern is: we have $n$ human-defined "types" of actions, so some individuals engage in the full set of actions while some only perform a subset of them. Thus, the "maximum" possible conditional entropy differs between people: $|Y| \neq n$ for everyone. This makes me think that $H(Y|X)$ can't be compared between individuals as-is. My first idea was to use Mutual Information instead because it accounts for how much uncertainty is contained in $Y$ in the first place: $I(X;Y)=H(Y)-H(Y|X)$ . However, the maximum value of $H(Y)$ is also still affected the number of action categories. Instead, I'm thinking of proposing that we compare $\frac{H(Y|X)}{H(Y)}$ between participants: the percentage of uncertainty left in $Y$ after viewing $X$ . Thus, we can compare how informative a person's present action is when predicting their subsequent action; less predictable people will have a greater percentage of the original entropy $H(Y)$ remaining than more predictable people. However, I've been unable to find any mention/usage of the quantity $\frac{H(Y|X)}{H(Y)}$ in other papers. Is there a term for this value, or is there a reason why I can't find it anywhere? The closest comparable quantity I could find divides by maximum possible entropy instead ( $\log(n)$ ), but this makes me uncomfortable because it requires us to assume that each person is only capable of the actions seen in the data and not all $n$ action categories.
