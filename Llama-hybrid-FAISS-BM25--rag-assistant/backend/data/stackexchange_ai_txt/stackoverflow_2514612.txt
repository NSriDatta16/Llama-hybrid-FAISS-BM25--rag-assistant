Need help in tuning a sql-query

i need some help to boost this SQL-Statement. The execution time is around 125ms. During the runtime of my program this sql (better: equally structured sqls for different tables) will be called 300.000 times. The average row count in the tables lies around 10.000.000 rows and new rows (updates/inserts) will be added with a timestamp each day. Data which are interesting for this particular export-program lies in the last 1-3 days. Maybe this is helpful for an index to create. The data i need is the current valid row for a given id and the forerunner datarow to get the updates (if exists). We use a Oracle 11g database and Dot.Net Framework 3.5 SQL-Statement to boost: select ID_SOMETHING, -- Number(12) ID_CONTRIBUTOR, -- Char(4 Byte) DATE_VALID_FROM, -- DATE DATE_VALID_TO -- DATE from TBL_SOMETHING XID where ID_SOMETHING = :ID_SOMETHING and ID_CONTRIBUTOR = :ID_CONTRIBUTOR and DATE_VALID_FROM = :EXPORT_DATE order by DATE_VALID_FROM asc; Here i uploaded the current Explain-Plan for this query. I'm not a database expert so i don't know which index-type would fit best for this requirement. I have seen that there are many different possible index-types which could be applied. Maybe Oracle Optimizer Hints are helpful, too. Does anyone has a good idea for tuning this sql or can point me in a right direction?
