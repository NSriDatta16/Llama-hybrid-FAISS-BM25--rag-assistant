Boruta feature selection in R with custom importance (xgboost feature importance)

According to the documentation - CRAN Boruta is an all relevant feature selection wrapper algorithm, capable of working with any classification method that output variable importance measure (VIM); by default, Boruta uses Random Forest. Source: Boruta documentation The package has one parameter getImp that defines the importance to be used, which by default is random forests from the Ranger package. So theoretically one could use xgboost's xgb.importance() function as the source of feature importance but I cannot find an example of how to use such parameter in practice because so far I've been unlucky. Is it possible at all to do this with the Boruta package or do I have implement from scratch the Boruta algorithm again using xgboost? And if it's possible how?
