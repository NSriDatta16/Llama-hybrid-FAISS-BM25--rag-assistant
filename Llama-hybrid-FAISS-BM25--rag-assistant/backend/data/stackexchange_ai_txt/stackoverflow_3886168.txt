how to automatically run a bash script when my qsub jobs are finished on a server?

I would like to run a script when all of the jobs that I have sent to a server are done. for example, I send ssh server "for i in config*; do qsub ./run 1 $i; done" And I get back a list of the jobs that were started. I would like to automatically start another script on the server to process the output from these jobs once all are completed. I would appreciate any advice that would help me avoid the following inelegant solution: If I save each of the 1000 job id's from the above call in a separate file, I could check the contents of each file against the current list of running jobs, i.e. output from a call to: ssh qstat I would only need to check every half hour, but I would imagine that there is a better way.
