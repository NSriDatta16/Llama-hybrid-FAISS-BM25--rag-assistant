The local-part of the email address (i.e. before the @ ) is case-sensitive in general . From the Wikipedia entry on E-mail address : The local-part is case sensitive, so "jsmith@example.com" and "JSmith@example.com" may be delivered to different people. This practice is, however, discouraged by RFC 5321 . However, only the authoritative mail-servers for a domain may make that decision. For the detailed specifications, you may wish to consult the following RFCs: RFC 5321 : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol RFC 5322 : Internet Message Format RFC 3696 : Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names
