Let's suppose your data set includes $m$ firms led by MBAs, and $n$ firms led by non-MBAs, for a total of $m+n$ firms in all. Suppose you label your firms in order by some index variable $j$: let $j = 1, 2, \ldots, m$ index the firms in your first group, those led by MBAs, and let $j = m+1, m+2, \ldots, m+n$ index the remaining firms. Suppose your data set includes data from $T$ distinct reporting periods (e.g., quarters). Let time periods be indexed by $t$, where $t = 1, \ldots, T$. Let $x_{j,t}$ denote the measured financial performance of firm $j$ during period $t$. From these numbers you want to extract some understanding of the "true" financial prowess of the firms, and to devine whether this true capacity differs in a systematic way between the subgroups. How you address those questions depends on what you believe about the data-generating process. We might suppose that the data are generated in a fairly simple way, as a sum of three components --- intrinsic ability + macroeconomic conditions + idiosyncratic random shocks. Intrinsic ability may in turn incorporate the effect of an "MBA premium" (which could in principle be negative): $x_{j,t} = \mu + \beta\cdot\chi(j) + \nu_j + Z_t + e_{j,t}$. Here $\mu$ denotes the average performance of all non-MBA firms, averaged across all firms in all periods; $\beta$ is the size of the MBA premium (what you're after); $\chi(j)$ is an indicator function for the MBA-led firms, i.e, a function that takes the value $1$ if $j$ denotes and MBA-led firm, and zero otherwise; $\nu_j$ measures the firm-specific ability; $Z_t$ denotes the effect of macroeconomic conditions (varying across time, but affect all firms identically); and $e_{j,t}$ the random shock. You want to know whether $\beta$ is non-zero. You could estimate $\beta$ be computing the difference between the average performance of the MBA-led firms vs. non-MBA firms in each period, and then averaging across all periods. A nice thing happens: since you are taking differences in this way, the $Z_t$ terms, representing macroeconomic effects, drop out of the equation. If you believe that the above model provides a reasonable representation of the data-generating process, and if you further believe that the error terms $e_{j,t}$ are independent and identically normally distributed , then you may test your hypothesis using a t-test. There are many reasons to believe that this model does not, in fact, fully capture the data-generating process. Refinements of the above model would involving delving into more advanced statistical procedures, to handle issues such as autocorrelated or heteroskedastic errors, multiplicative macroeconomic effects, non-normal error processes, etc., etc. There is not likely to be a definitive, clear answer to how far in this process you might go. Every model is an approximation, not Truth. I suggest trying the simple model, while testing for the sensitivity of your answers to its several simplifying assumptions.
