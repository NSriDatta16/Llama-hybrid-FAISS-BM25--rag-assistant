Ensembling vs clustering in machine learning

Following the raise of ensembling (e.g ensembling of xgboost learners) after its recurrent wins in Kaggle competitions, using it has become a tradition in machine learning. However, some argue that clustering is a form of ensembling where we apply clustering on a data set first, then applying a learning algorithm (to do classification or regression) on each of the resulting clusters. I would like to understand how clustering is different from ensembling? EDIT I understand that clustering can be similar to the idea of ensembling if we simply consider "homogeneous ensembling" where we train the same model on each of the clusters. But I am looking for potential limitations of clustering where using heterogeneous ensembles (different learns for all the data) is the "only" way to go about the problem.
