Flow_from_directory() won't load any image

i'm trying to load images for training a CNN using keras flow_from_directorY(), but seems that is having hard times finding the images. i'm running the code on google colab !unzip "/content/drive/My Drive/fruits.zip" -d "/content/drive/My Drive" I used this command to unzip my dataset and then if i try to visualize how many images i have for every folder, it seems that it recognises the images for folder in os.listdir(os.path.join(path,'training')): folder_count = len(os.listdir(os.path.join(path,'training',folder))) image_count.append(folder_count) class_names.append(folder) print('{:20s}'.format(folder), end='') print(folder_count) print('-'*24) print('Number of Classes:', len(class_names)) print('Average number of images per Class: ', np.array(image_count).mean()) however, if i try to use flow_from_directory with those paths, i got that it has found 0 images train_batches = train_datagenerator.flow_from_directory('/content/drive/My Drive/fruits-360_dataset/data/training', target_size=(224, 224), color_mode="rgb", classes="categorical" , batch_size=32, subset='training') val_batches = train_datagenerator.flow_from_directory('/content/drive/My Drive/fruits-360_dataset/data/training', target_size=(224, 224), color_mode="rgb", classes="categorical" , batch_size=32, subset='validation') test_batches = test_datagenerator.flow_from_directory('/content/drive/My Drive/fruits-360_dataset/data/test', target_size=(224, 224), color_mode="rgb", classes="categorical" , batch_size=32, shuffle=False) Found 0 images belonging to 11 classes. Found 0 images belonging to 11 classes. Found 0 images belonging to 11 classes. if someone could help would be really appreciated! :)
