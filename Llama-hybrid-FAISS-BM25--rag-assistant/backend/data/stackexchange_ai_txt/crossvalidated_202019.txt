(Repeated) Cross-Validation and Wilcoxon test

Is it a common practice to apply the Wilcoxon test to the (repeated) cross-validation score estimates when comparing two different models? I've read that most of the time the average of the cross-validation scores is taken and the model with the best average is chosen, but some authors ( here , here and here ) suggest to apply the Wilcoxon test in order to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the models.
