How to compare 2 regression models?

Suppose I have 2 regerssion models A and B , and dataset for evaluation containing N samples, for each sample I can estimate MAE(mean absolute error), then I can compute average MAE across dataset and compute standard error, so I have something like: For model A: avr_mae1 +- standard_error1 For model B: avr_mae2 +- standard_error2 For now I'm just comparing avr_mae1 vs avr_mae2 to understand which model is better, but intuitively I understand that model with low avr_mae and large standard_error is not very usefull model, so what is the proper way of comparing models, some statistical test? My second question is: my model come from deep neural network and training process is not fully deterministic, so I can have slightly different results from run to run, so my question: is it true that if intervals avr_mae1 + standard_error1 and avr_mae2 - standard_error2 cross I can say that models are have about the same performance?
