In order to check whether certain view inside another view was touched you can use hitTest. - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; In your custom implementation of touchesBegan check every touch in touches set. The point for hitTest method can be obtained using - (CGPoint)locationInView:(UIView *)view; method, where the view is your superView (the one that contains other views). EDIT: Here's a fast custom implementation: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint locationPoint = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; UIView* viewYouWishToObtain = [self hitTest:locationPoint withEvent:event]; } I hope this was helpful, Paul
