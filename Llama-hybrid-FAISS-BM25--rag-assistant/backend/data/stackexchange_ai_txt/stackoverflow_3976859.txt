I just tried, and I do not encounter this issue (I am using Eclipse 3.3, 3.4 and 3.6). I don't know if you are aware of this Eclipse feature, but in Preferences > Java > Editor > Save actions , you can define the list of actions that are automatically run when you save the Java class you are currently editing. The interesting elements in this panel are the Format source code as well as the Organize imports actions. Edit regarding the comments: This problem seems to be related to the Eclipse CDT plugin which does not offer the save actions feature. I just had a look on CDT version 7.0 and this feature has not been added unfortunately. So I suggest that you log a bug in their Bugzilla instance to report the problem you encounter with the Impement method feature. Eventually, you can also log an enhancement to add this Save actions in this plugin!
