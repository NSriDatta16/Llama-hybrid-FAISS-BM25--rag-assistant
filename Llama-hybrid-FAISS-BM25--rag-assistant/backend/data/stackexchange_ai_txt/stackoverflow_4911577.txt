jQuery click / toggle between two functions

I am looking for a way to have two separate operations / functions / "blocks of code" run when something is clicked and then a totally different block when the same thing is clicked again. I put this together. I was wondering if there was a more efficient / elegant way. I know about jQuery .toggle() but it doesn't work as desired. Working here: http://jsfiddle.net/reggi/FcvaD/1/ var count = 0; $("#time").click(function() { count++; //even odd click detect var isEven = function(someNumber) { return (someNumber % 2 === 0) ? true : false; }; // on odd clicks do this if (isEven(count) === false) { $(this).animate({ width: "260px" }, 1500); } // on even clicks do this else if (isEven(count) === true) { $(this).animate({ width: "30px" }, 1500); } });
