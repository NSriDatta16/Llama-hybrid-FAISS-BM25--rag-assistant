It doesn't appear there are any internal methods in FancyBox, so you'll have to modify the plugin. I took the liberty of making a minor change and posting a demo - in the demo, open any image in a FancyBox popup, then press Enter on the keyboard. It will load all of the images into the gallery and start from the first. Modified line 887, then insert a line before 892: $.fancybox.pos = function(pos, array) { // array parameter added if (busy) { return; } if (array) { currentArray = array; } // new line So, basically add "array" as a function parameter, then add the if (array)... line. To use it, just call the pos function while FancyBox is open. This is the code from the demo: // pos( index of image, jQuery object of gallery objects ) $.fancybox.pos(0, $('#examples a[id]')); *Note: Initially I just used $('a[id]') and it included the image that was inside fancy box. Update : So like you said, you are loading in more images using ajax... I'm guessing you are just getting a list of image urls. Starting with a url, you will need to form and add these images to the page in a hidden area: ... Then you can make an array of jquery objects $('#ajax-content img') to the $.fancybox.pos function as a second paramter, and start with the first image (the zero) // ajax complete, add images to gallery $.fancybox.pos( 0, $('#ajax-loaded a') ); Update #2 : I wrapped the above HTML in links and the jQuery selector after I found that it is necessary if you want to include an image caption.
