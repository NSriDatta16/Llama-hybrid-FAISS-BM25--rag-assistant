(PHP) randomly insert a 10 word sentence into a large text document

I have large text files 140k or larger full of paragraphs of text and need to insert a sentence in to this file at random intervals only if the file contains more then 200 words. The sentence I need to insert randomly throughout the larger document is 10 words long. I have full control over the server running my LAMP site so I can use PHP or a linux command line application if one exists which would do this for me. Any ideas of how best to tackle this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Mark
