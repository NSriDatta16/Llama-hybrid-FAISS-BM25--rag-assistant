I have two advices for you: If you are expecting lots of writes with little low priority reads. Then you are better off with as little indexes as possible. Indexes will make insert slower. Only add what you really need. If the log table is going to get bigger and bigger overtime you should consider log rotation. Otherwise you might end up with one gigantic corrupted table.
