Thank you all for the responses. I am currently using the registry as temporary storage to store values. I will read about remoting and application domains and will try to do that way. The reason I want it, is that I have an exe application running in the background (minimized to windows tray). This exe app acts as an central API and generates some web login information which must be available to be accessed from any TestApplication that uses MyClassLibrary.dll. Would it be good if I put all the code from my dll class to exe and then have only one executable which has everything? Then in MyTestApplication I could add a reference to exe. But I would still have the same problem. Because if I want to create another application that integration with exe API, e.g. MyTestApplication2 and add a reference to exe would I still have the same problem? I guess this is not possible from reflection. However in VB6 you could say something like object o = GetObject(,"MyExeApplication.Class") and then I could say o.GetBasicValues()).
