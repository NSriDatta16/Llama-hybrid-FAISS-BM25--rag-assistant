Inverted ROC curve

I am using tidymodels package in R. Running random forest to classify three classes. There are about 8000 samples in total and 130 features. This is how the ROC curves look like. The predictions for all 3 classes are actually pretty good and fit with expectations. The misclassified samples are also easy to explain. Here are some metrics as given by the software on test data: .metric .estimate 1 accuracy 0.887 2 bal_accuracy 0.917 3 f_meas 0.887 4 kap 0.831 5 mcc 0.835 6 precision 0.895 7 recall 0.889 8 roc_auc 0.975 And the confusion matrix. Truth Prediction A B C A 573 19 22 B 6 662 17 C 148 25 628 Everything seems to be fine except for the strange ROC curves. I am trying to find an explanation for this.
