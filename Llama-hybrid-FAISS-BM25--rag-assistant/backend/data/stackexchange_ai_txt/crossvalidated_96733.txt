Generate predictions from a logistic regression model reflecting the uncertainty of the model

I want to generate predictions from a fitted logistic regression model that reflect the uncertainty of the model (within a classic frequentist framework). To clarify, my objective is not to characterize the predictive uncertainty as such, but to get a set of reasonable predictions which are fair to the uncertainty about the coefficients of the predictors included in the model . My approach is as follows: for each group of interest, defined by a combination of values of the predictors; draw values for each regression coefficient from a normal distribution with a mean - the point estimate of the respective regression coefficient, and a standard deviation - the respective standard error of the regression coefficient; plug the resulting values in the inverse logit formula to get the prediction; and repeat. Would that be a valid approach? Would it work for mixed-effects (multilevel) models as well where the predictors are modeled as random effects?
