Rather than embedding information to pass to the window in the querystring, you can use javascript directly. Using window.opener on the newly opened window, you can access info from the child page: var selItems = window.opener.strSelectedItems; Keep in mind that strSelectedItems in this case would need to be globally scoped in the parent page. To keep things clean, I would consider functions on the main page that will return the information the child page needs.
