If you use Hibernate then Hibernate Tools is a must. I really like the ability to write my HQL or JPQL and view the generated SQL real time! If you're not using Hibernate I'm guessing your using a database in some form or another. Therefore, I would recommend the Data Tools Platform . In fact, you would be crazy to develop Java apps without using all the plugins provided by the Eclipse Ganymede Release. It's a great development platform without the headache of getting all the must have plugins synced up and working together.
