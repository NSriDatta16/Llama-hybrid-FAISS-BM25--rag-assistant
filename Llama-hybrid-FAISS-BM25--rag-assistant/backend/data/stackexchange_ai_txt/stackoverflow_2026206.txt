Organising Dbs and tables in SSMS

This is a repost of a question I asked 4 or 5 days ago, with zero response. Hoping for more luck this time... (Using SQL Server 2008) Within the next few weeks I plan to introduce SQL server to an office that is in dire need of a proper data server. Currently there is a heavy reliance on loose Excel and Access file (supplemented with frighteningly large amount of impenetrable VB code to do data manipulations) strewn all over the internal network. We need SQL server for two things: 1. For internal databases that will be designed upfront and will be capturing data on an ongoing basis 2. For ad hoc uploads of datasets received from clients, which we then analyse I am the only person in this office who is familiar with SQL. I will have to train the other 5 or 6 people to use it. Now, my question is this: how would you guys set up the DBs so that it would be easy using Management Studio to visually recognize where what is being stored? To be more precise: if this were a windows file system it would look something like this: c:\client work\client 1\piece of work 1 (db with 10 tables)\ c:\client work\client 1\piece of work 2 (db with 8 tables)\ c:\client work\client 1\piece of work 3 (db with 7 tables)\ c:\internal\accounting system\some db with 8 tables\ c:\internal\accounting system\some db with 5 tables\ c:\internal\some other system\some db with 7 tables\ etc. So briefly, I need to visually split by internal and client work. Client work I need to split by different clients. For each client I need to split out the different distinct sets of work. (Internal work follows a similar pattern). Solutions that I am aware of: Run multiple data servers (e.g. one internal, one for client work). Not sure what the cons of this would be though Assign schemas to tables I would love to hear your suggestions!
