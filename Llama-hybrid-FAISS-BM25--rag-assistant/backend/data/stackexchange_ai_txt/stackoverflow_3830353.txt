This is probably hard to do two-way, since you will have impedance mismatches between the various formats. The best world I can think of would be a sort of Wiki / Word hybrid: Maybe you can get Google Wave to do that for you? Another solution that might work is a CMS like Plone (did they ever add WYSIWIG capability? I stopped caring after version 1). Keep your documents there. Let the system handle changes, annotations etc. You can automate retrieval of the source (should be ReStructuredText) and commit that to your source control if you have to.
