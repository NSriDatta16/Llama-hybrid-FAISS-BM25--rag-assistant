In Ruby on Rails, how can I map all actions in a controller to root?

In Ruby on Rails, how can I do the equivalent of this in a more elegant routes line? I may have to add many of these... map.connect '/about', :controller => "site", :action => "about" map.connect '/contact', :controller => "site", :action => "contact" map.connect '/preview', :controller => "site", :action => "preview" Thanks!
