How long did it take you to learn LINQ to SQL?

I didn't see any questions that asked this previously so here goes: Once you made (or had) the decision to start using LINQ to SQL how long did it take you to learn it's ins and outs? We're looking at using it at my organization but my superiors are concerned with the initial time cost (learning it). Hours would be the most useful of answers but any insight would be appreciated. Bonus question: how much time has LINQ saved you since you started using it?
