How to calculate the average rgb color values of a bitmap

In my C# (3.5) application I need to get the average color values for the red, green and blue channels of a bitmap. Preferably without using an external library. Can this be done? If so, how? Thanks in advance. Trying to make things a little more precise: Each pixel in the bitmap has a certain RGB color value. I'd like to get the average RGB values for all pixels in the image.
