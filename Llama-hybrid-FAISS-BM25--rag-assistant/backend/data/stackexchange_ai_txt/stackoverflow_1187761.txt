It's really hard to predict the future. The units (minutes, hours, days, weeks, fortnights) don't matter. Pick a unit that makes your manager happy. Just be clear that an estimate of 30 minutes, .5 hour or .0625 days is only a guess, not a fact. An estimate of 0.0625 days or 30 minutes looks really precise because it has a lot of decimal places. However, any ambiguity about the requirements, the architecture, the language, the libraries, the unit tests, or anything else will make this number incorrect. The very best you can hope for is that the average of all your estimates is reasonably close to the actual facts as they unfold. This means that half your estimates will be too low and half will be too high. It also means that some fraction of your estimates will be really, really far from your manager's hoped-for accuracy.
