I suggest using a template fragment which generates the form , but which also can be generated seperately and sent to the jquery. this preservers CSRF tokens and allows tou to parse the file with forms correctly for instance you would use: $.ajax({ url: "/uploadPicture?JustForm", dataType: ($.browser.msie) ? "text" : "html", success: function(data){ // Put the form contained in data onto the page (it's a string) $("formContainer").innerHtml(data) } }); then have your form as returned directly by your view def upload_picture(request): if request.GET.has_key('JustForm'): return YourFormObject.as_html() (disregard blatent errors, treat like pseudocode)
