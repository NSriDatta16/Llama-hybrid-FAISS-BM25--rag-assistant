We used to have this problem a lot, but much less recently. Partly for us it is about firmer project management and documenting the specification (as suggested in other answers here) but I believe more of the difference came from: Expectation management - getting the client to accept that iterative changes are still to be expected after launch, that this is normal and not to worry about it Increasing authority - we are now a well established (13 years) web developer and we can speak with a lot of expertise Simply being more experienced - we can now predict in advance most of the queries that are likely to come up, and either resolve them, mitigate them or bring them to the client's attention so they don't sting us on the day Plus, we rarely do big fanfare launches - a soft launch makes things much less stressful.
