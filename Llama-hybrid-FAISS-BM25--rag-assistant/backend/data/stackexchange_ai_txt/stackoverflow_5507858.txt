Have you considered updating the layout of the catalog page rather than making a CMS page? I suppose there are situations where you might prefer a CMS page, but you can update the layout of a category fairly easily, well about as easy as it gets in Magento, which isn't all that easy :) Login to the admin backend, go to Catalog -> Manage Categories, then choose the category you want, then click the Custom Design tab. Notice the Custom Layout Updates field. This is where you can put your layout updates. So for this category, if you didn't want to display a specific block you could do something like Which would remove the block named right.permanent.callout from the layout altogether. And if you wanted to just change the product listing to use your specific phtml file you could do something like... catalog/product/wholesale.phtml You can probably use google to find out more about how to layouts.
