Using idle CPUs to form a cluster for a webserver

This can be a dumb question. I am going to research it more but the folks may give some pointers. I have moved countries and work part time at a small but fast growing company that does web applications development. They keep a lot of their work and other applications (bug tracker etc) on a server rented from godaddy.com. That server is now very slow because of the applications running on top of it. The CEO is reluctant to buy more server CPU until the next six months (cash issues). I was wondering if I can find a software or can myself help build a system that can present a cluster of machines as a webserver e.g. some kind of a distrbuted version of IIS. I want to leverage the discarded / old hardware. I know it is an unconventional query but it has got some real practical value.
