It turns out that Manfred's answer didn't quite work for me. The app compiled, but it did not run on my Android device because the required google analytics classes were missing. Following the links he supplied, I discovered this solution which is actually a little cleaner and worked properly. In summary, I added the following dependencies to my pom.xml. The groupId, artifactId, and version were all made up by me using reasonable values: ... com.google.android.apps.analytics libGoogleAnalytics 1.1 com.flurry FlurryAgent 1.24 I then added a repository definition for where I'm storing the third party dependencies in my project's source tree: third.party.closed.source.repo file://${basedir}/../maven_repo_3rd_party I then moved the jar files to the following location: ./maven_repo_3rd_party/com/google/android/apps/analytics/libGoogleAnalytics/1.1/libGoogleAnalytics-1.1.jar ./maven_repo_3rd_party/com/flurry/FlurryAgent/1.24/FlurryAgent-1.24.jar Once I did that, my project compiled and ran exactly as if the third party dependencies were resolved from an official maven repo.
