High model fit but no significant impact of any of the predictors

I am applying binary logistic regression as my dependent variable is a dichotomous variable with 740 sample size. I have used enter method to input my variables and have designed two blocks. In block 1 I have tried to see the impact of only demographic variables and in block 2 I have added 10 new predictors. Chi-Square value has increased significantly from block 1 to block 2, Hosmer and lemeshow test has value greater than 0.05 (It was 0.000 for block 1)and -2 log likelihood has also decreased drastically from block 1 to block 2, indicating good model fit. But In block 1 I can see significant impact of some of the demographic variables, however in block 2 there is no impact of any of the predictors. Please help me with my output..what does it signify? Am i mistaking somewhere?
