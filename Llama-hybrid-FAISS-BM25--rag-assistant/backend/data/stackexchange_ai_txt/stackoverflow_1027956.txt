HTTPS C# POST 302 Moved

I am trying to create a script that logins to a webpage and grabs a report - all is working GREAT except - I am getting a HTTP/1.1 302 MovedTemporarily Date: Mon, 22 Jun 2009 13:22:04 GMT Server: Server x-some-id-1: 0J3X3VBBCGNJG9V46G5D x-some-id-2: BtQ4SsDhbryWgiVNFcVpMbt898GuPIBaWuGwAWjvsyI= Set-cookie: session-id-time=1246258800l; path=/; domain=.example.com; expires=Mon Jun 29 07:00:00 2009 GMT Set-cookie: session-id=179-5933843-4704124; path=/; domain=. example.com; expires=Mon Jun 29 07:00:00 2009 GMT Location: https://example.com Vary: Accept-Encoding,User-Agent nnCoection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 0 Response and I have no idea how to stop it. I have tried settings the httpwebrequest.allowautoredirect both "True" and "False" and nothing helps. It's trying me crazy as I can login to the website via https:// but then I get this returned?
