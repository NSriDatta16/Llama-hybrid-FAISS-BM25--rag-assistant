Why Broadleaf Commerce over Magento or ZenCart?

I have a site made in java-spring-hibernate we made our self from scratch, it shows a catalog of product and i have the logic for it. I can also manage content and product/categories with it with an administrator we have made in flex. We probably shouldn´t have gone to all the trouble since there are so many cms out there, but what's done it's done. The site renders the content managed in flex in html with jstl. Thing is now i want to add a ecommerce to it, for that we would have to add all the payment,shipment, orders logic to the administrator and the front end (cart/user). How ever, since there are already things like magento store, i was thinking maybe i should switch and leave my beautiful app to die :/. As i was researching i stumbled upon broadleaf commerce which is an ecommerce back end made in flex-spring-hibernate. It´s relatively new and it supposed to have an active development team. So i guess my question is, Why? if there are so many opensource commerce solutions do they make this kind of effort in developing ? i mean you still have to build the GUI for the users side. Whats their difference with magento, what are the pros ? should i try to integrate with broadleaf ? what are the assests oder then keeping my loved old app ?
