Scikit Random forest pred_proba gives rounded off values

I am using random forest in scikit learn for classification and for getting the class probabilities , I used pred_proba function. But strangely it outputs probabilities rounded to first decimal place Like [0.1,0.4,0.5,0.2] Is it the default output? Is it possible to increase the decimal places?
