How to make cycle over cycles in Java?

I would like to make a cycle over the following elements: [1,2,11,12,21,22,111,112,121,122,....,222222] or for example [1,2,3,11,12,13,21,22,23,31,32,33,111,112,113,... 333333333] How can I make it in Java? In my particular case I use 4 digits (1,2,3,4) and the length of the last number can be from 1 to 10. I managed to do it in Python and PHP. In the first case I used list over lists. I started from [[1],[2],] then for every element of the list I added 1 and 2, so I got [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]] and so on: nchips = sum(chips) traj = [[]] last = [[]] while len(last[0]) When I did it in PHP I used number with base 3. But it was a tricky and non elegant solution. for ($i=-1; $i -1) { $n5 = base_convert($i,10,5); $n5_str = strval($n5); $tr = array(); $found = 0; for ($j=0; $j Can it be done easily in Java?
