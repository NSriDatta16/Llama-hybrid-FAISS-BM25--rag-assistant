Compact: - you don't need to change logic of you application; - MS Sql Management studio could be use to edit,create data structure visually ;) - deployment, second time deployments more easy :) SQLite: - look in google search for the problems:), there lot of people who works with it and have problems, not form begining but during implementation "conctetical" tasks /projects - no exists native visual interface to work with dbase (exist 3party products for that but they aren't free); - again 2nd, 3 ... deployments needs more attention,time money :) ... so, for me is beeter to work with MSSqlCompact, because i am working with .net kind of projects, i have to support my results, i must provide stable application etc...
