I can not use Session In Page_Load and I got error below

why i got this error : Object reference not set to an instance of an object. when i put this code in my page_load.: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { BackEndUtils.OverallLoader(); string Teststr = Session["Co_ID"].ToString(); } ========================================================================== this session is made when user logins to my web site and this session works in other areas... thanks for your attention ========================================================================== thanks for your answers i removed BackEndUtils.OverallLoader(); but error still exists i tried Teststr = Convert.ToString(Session["Co_ID"]); and error disappeared - but i don't know why that session is null in other areas that session works perfectly = such as a button in that form what is the matter? my web page markup is like this : ================================================================================= i put this code in a button like this : string Teststr = Convert.ToString(Session["Co_ID"]); when i press that button THIS code in page Load(POSTBACK) + IN Button_Click works perfectly and shows me 23 (my Co_ID) But when i run my page in browser (first time) this code in page load shows me null. why? thanks a lot
