Minimum number of obs. for machine learning and training/test sets?

Are there a minimum number of observations for ML techniques (classification, regression) in psychology/cognitive neuroscience? In particular for training and test datasets? I found this article for sample size in biology( https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1323 ) but any for regression ML I have a 25 obs data with 38 predictors on a continuous dependent variable, I was thinking to use PLS regression as some predictors are highly correlated and predictors > N. How can I split the dataset? Any suggestions? Thanks
