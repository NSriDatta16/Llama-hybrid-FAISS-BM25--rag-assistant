Confidence intervals coming from predicted values in logistic regression models should be nonsymmetric and bounded between 0 and 1. The key is that the inverse link (the expit function) should be applied at the very end of calculation. Try the lincom command instead. Margins uses marginal standardization which employs the delta method approximation to standard errors for predicted values on the probability scale.
