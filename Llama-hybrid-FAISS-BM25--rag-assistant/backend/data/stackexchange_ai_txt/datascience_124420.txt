The importance metric in random forests is based on the idea of permuting the values of one predictor variable at a time to assess its significance in the model. This approach has several advantages over removing the variable and retraining the model to measure the effect: Consistency with Model Structure : Random forests are ensemble models composed of multiple decision trees . The structure and architecture of the model remain unchanged when using permutation-based importance. Removing a variable, on the other hand, changes the model's structure. Permutation-based importance allows you to evaluate the variable's importance within the context of the existing model. Model Complexity and Interactions: Removing a variable not only affects the model's complexity (number of predictors) but can also disrupt interactions and relationships between variables. Permutation-based importance isolates the variable's contribution, while variable removal could lead to a loss of information and interactions with other predictors. Non-Destructive: Permutation-based importance does not alter the original dataset. Removing a variable from the dataset can be problematic if the dataset is needed for other analyses or if you later realize the variable was important and want to include it in the analysis. Consistency with Other Importance Metrics: Permutation-based importance is consistent with other importance metrics like Gini impurity or mean decrease in accuracy, which are commonly used in decision trees and random forests . This consistency allows you to compare variable importance across different models and datasets.
