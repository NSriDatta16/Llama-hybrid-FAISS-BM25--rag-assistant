Post-hoc Chi Square Test for Pairwise Comparison of 3 Groups

I am trying to do something that in my mind is probably simple and I'm probably just blanking on it. I am using Stata to compare 3 groups on a categorical variable. So, as an example, I would be comparing the groups of the variable 'race' (Black, Latino, White) across the categorical variable of education (less than high school, hs/some college, college graduate). So the question that I am asking is: Do Black people, Latino people, and White people differ significantly in their levels of education and between which groups are there significant differences? I ran a chi square test (actually Fisher's exact test because of some empty cells) and now know that there are significant differences among the groups. Now, how do I check to see what the pairwise differences are (i.e., Black vs. Latino, Latino vs. White, Black vs. White)? Is there a post-hoc test for this? Or do I need to recode the variables to be more conducive to pairwise testing? Or should I instead go with a multinomial logistic regression? Thank you very much in advance for any help.
