BestPractice: How to display a many-to-many association in a view in a clean way?

I am using NHibernate and have a many-to-many association between an Employee and a Team. Now I want to display all Employees with the name of its Team member. Possibility 1: using AutoMapper and create a DTO containing the Employee properties and the name of the Team (eager load the Team) display the DTO in the view Possibility 2: create a new Entity called EmployeeTeam and map it with NHibernate/FluentNHibernate (this entity acts as the relational table between the Employee and Team in the database) load TeamEmployee by using eager loading include Employee and Team display the EmployeeTeam entity use the EmployeeTeam members (EmployeeTeam.Employee.Name, EmployeeTeam.Team.Name) Possibility 3: as possibilities 1 and 2 using a DTO for the EmployeeTeam Possibility 4: use ICriteria API use the AliasToBeanResultTransformer (didn't use this) Possibility 5: use LINQ to NHibernate I think I will still need the EmployeeTeam Entity (which is for now not in my Domain Model) What is the best practices for this problem? Any other suggestions?
