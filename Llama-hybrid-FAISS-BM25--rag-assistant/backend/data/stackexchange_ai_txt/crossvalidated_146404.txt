Conjugate prior for multivariate with known mean and covariance known to a constant

I have a linear trend model (evolving mean and slope) embedded in a larger state space time series model that I would like to constrain to be a spline. With that assumption, the mean and trend innovations $(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ are bivariate normal and the covariance between them is constrained to be a known 2x2 matrix $A$ multiplied by an unknown constant $\tau^2$, $$(\theta_1,\theta_2)\sim\mathcal{N}_2(0_2,\tau^2\,A)$$i.e., $$\pi(\theta_1,\theta_2|\tau)\propto\tau^{-2}\exp\left\{-(\theta_1,\theta_2)\,A^{-1}\left(\matrix{\theta_1\\\theta_2}\right)\big/2\tau^2\right\}$$ I am using a Gibbs sampler and would like to get a full conditional distribution for that constant and thus for the covariance or precision. I'd like to work with a conjugate prior at least as a start. This does not seem like a Wishart result, because I am drawing a scalar not a full matrix. Is it inverse gamma? Thanks.
