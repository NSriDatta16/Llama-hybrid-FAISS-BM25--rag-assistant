Cross Validation with replicates for spectral analysis

I am collecting 20 Mid-IR spectra from 10 samples by taking two measurements for each sample. I want to create a prediction model using PLS. What would be the best way to split the data between training and test sets for cross-validation, while avoiding overly optimistic results because of the replicates? One idea is to take the average of each pair of replicate but that would leave me with only 10 samples. Is there a way to create a relatively reliable model with the data I have and depending on the results, measure more samples and improve it?
