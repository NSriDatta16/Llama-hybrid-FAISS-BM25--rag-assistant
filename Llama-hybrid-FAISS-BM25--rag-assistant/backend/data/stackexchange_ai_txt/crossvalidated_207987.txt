Very different prediction intervals from ARIMA models where MA order differs by 1

I have fit an ARIMA model to a time series with function auto.arima from "forecast" package in R. I wanted to check prediction intervals for robustness by changing the ARIMA terms. Here is my R code: library("forecast", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.2") library("tseries", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.2") price = c(256, 223, 190, 170 ,140, 123, 133, 133, 125, 120, 125, 140, 166, 186, 206, 206, 206, 206, 206, 206, 229, 263, 273, 273 ,273 ,273 ,258, 239, 233, 226, 226, 226, 249, 249, 249, 249, 249, 269, 279, 279, 279, 279, 299, 316, 316, 316, 316, 316, 316, 316, 299, 299, 299 ,319, 319, 339 ,339, 356 ,356, 356, 343, 343, 333 ,343 ,442 ,599, 599, 599, 599, 549, 516, 336, 336, 336, 309, 309 ,319, 565, 665, 832, 832, 698, 632, 532, 499, 526, 526, 526, 526, 499, 466, 333 ,233, 233, 216, 200, 200, 200, 226, 239, 279, 316, 333 ,366 ,366 ,366, 366 ,366 ,333 ,349 ,349, 349 ,359 ,359, 442 ,459 ,449 ,449, 449, 449, 449, 449 ,449 ,459, 459 ,459, 459, 459, 446, 446, 446, 446, 459, 459, 439, 439, 439, 439, 482, 482, 482, 482 ,516,516, 532, 532, 532 ,532 ,532 ,549, 599, 632 ,632 ,632, 632, 599 ,565 ,532, 482, 482, 482, 482, 499 ,475 ,449, 416) ts.plot(price) auto.arima(price) arima.fit What I saw surprised me quite a bit: Why do the prediction intervals widen in the MA(3) case and hardly so in the MA(4) case?
