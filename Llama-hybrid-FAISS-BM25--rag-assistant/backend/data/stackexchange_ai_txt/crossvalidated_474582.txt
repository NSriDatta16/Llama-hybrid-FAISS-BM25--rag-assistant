Time Series Decomposition: Is it necessary (or wise) to remove outliers beforehand?

Do outliers change the outcome of time series decomposition? As far as I understand it, outliers occur in the residual-component. In the residuals plot they can be visually identified as spikes. However, if I know the outliers within a time series before applying the decomposition, does it make sense to remove the outliers in order to increase the "quality" of the decomposition?
