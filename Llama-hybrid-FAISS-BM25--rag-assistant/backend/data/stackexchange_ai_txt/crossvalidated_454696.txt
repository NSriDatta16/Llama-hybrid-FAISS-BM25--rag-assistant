I suggest using a binary logistic regression model. Calculate p as the proportion of the population infected, p = c / N, l as the link function, for example, l = ln(p/(1-p)). Then use ordinary least squares, again, for example, to find l_hat = f(t). Next, use the reverse link function p_hat = exp(l_hat)/(1+exp(l_hat)). Then convert the estimated proportion, p_hat, into a case count, c_hat = p_hat * N. At each step, there are other choices you could make. A different link function or a different regression method come to mind. You could evaluate the quality of your estimate graphically by comparing the number of cases and the estimate, the proportion and the estimate, the logit and its estimate (or other link function). Good luck and stay safe. John
