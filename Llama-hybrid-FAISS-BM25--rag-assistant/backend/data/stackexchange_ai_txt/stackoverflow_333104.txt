I've been using Spring for a few years now and the amount of XML that was required was definitely getting tedious. Between the new XML schemas and annotation support in Spring 2.5 I usually do these things: Using "component-scan" to autoload classes which use @Repository, @Service or @Component. I usually give every bean a name and then wire them together using @Resource. I find that this plumbing doesn't change very often so annotations make sense. Using the "aop" namespace for all AOP. This really works great. I still use it for transactions too because putting @Transactional all over the place is kind of a drag. You can create named pointcuts for methods on any service or repository and very quickly apply the advice. I use LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean along with HibernateJpaVendorAdapter to configure Hibernate. This lets Hibernate easily auto-discover @Entity classes on the classpath. Then I create a named SessionFactory bean using "factory-bean" and "factory-method" referring to the LCEMFB.
