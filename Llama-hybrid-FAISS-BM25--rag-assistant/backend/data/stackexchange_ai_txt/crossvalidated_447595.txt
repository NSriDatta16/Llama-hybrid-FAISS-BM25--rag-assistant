Out of sample prediction

I have a model in which I estimate the impact of price on acreage. My data is composed of 10 years. So I use these 10 years to estimate the model and get to coefficients. In next step, I want to use the model to predict the acreage for the 11th year. To do this, I have assumed that price in the 11th year equals to half of the minimum observed price in the past 10 years (which I had in my data). Now I expect that if I do out of sample prediction, since the price in the 11th year is lower than all of the observed price, the predicted acreage in the 11th year also be lower than all of the observed acreage? Is this correct? I am not getting this and am trying to figure out if there is a problem somewhere or my expectation is wrong? Here is more explanation about the estimation method and the data: First I should mention that there are some problems in this estimation. For example number of instruments are greater than number of groups. But these result is the best result that I could get regarding my data. I am only interested in the sign and magnitude of the coefficients here and want ti use them to predict acreage. I have a data set over a period 2008-2017. I estimated a GMM model based on this time period to obtain own and cross acreage and price elasticies. The dependent variable is the log of the acreage of the crop. In the next step, I need to predict the log of the acreage for year 2018. To do this I used the average of the value of each variable during 2008-2017 for the year that I need to predict the log of acreage except price. For the price I used the half of the minimum of the observed price during 2008-2017. In this case I am trying to simulate a shock in the economy that drops the price of the crop. I used the following command: generate logacr=log(acr) generate logacrl=log(acrl) generate logpl=log(pl) generate logpi=log(pi) xtabond2 logacr l.logacr l.logacrl logpl fui fzi logpi ppt pop if year 10 gen exp_logacr_hat=exp(logacr_hat)
