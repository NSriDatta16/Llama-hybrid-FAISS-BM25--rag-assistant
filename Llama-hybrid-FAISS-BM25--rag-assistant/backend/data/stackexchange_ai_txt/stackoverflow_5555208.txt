For parsing the text and getting the parts of speech you want, there are lots of toolkits http://incubator.apache.org/opennlp/ http://www.nltk.org/ etc. Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis for ideas about finding how words are used positively or negatively, if what you mean by that is connotation. I don't know of any solid platforms for doing this, but maybe you can tell us more about your problem for some ideas. In absence of a toolkit that'll do this for you, you might find that getting NPs and the ADJs linked to them would be sufficient. You'd also need negation detection. I've used this ohnlp.sourceforge.net (build on Apache UIMA) and it comes with a negation detection algorithm that is moderately decent.
