No. You can run multiple parts of JavaEE in containers that are not applications servers. Servlets/JSP/JSF you can run on a servlet container. JPA - you can use with any setup. All parts of the JavaEE "family" can be used standalone, i.e. outside of application servers. Servlet containers. JMS providers. JTA managers. Even EJB containers. EJB before version 3 provided a set of interfaces you should implement in order for your classes to be managed by the EJB container. Since 3.0 the EJB spec defines mainly annotations (from the developer perspective). Apart from that it is a specification on how the EJB container (part of application servers) should handle your EJBs Glassfish, JBoss and Geronimo (and a few others) are full-featured application servers. Tomcat, Jetty and Spring tc server are just servlet containers - they only handle the servlet/jsp part of JavaEE. They may have additional features (like the enterprise monitoring features of tc server). Hibernate is an implementation of JPA - object-relational mapping (in short - you work with objects rather than with JDBC). RabbitMQ is a message queue, and I'm not even sure it conforms to the JMS spec (part of JavaEE). GemFire has nothing to do with JavaEE The "Web Profile" includes only some parts (the most often used ones in web applications) of JavaEE - servlets, jsp, CDI, JPA, JSF, EJB (lite). It does not include stuff like JMS, JAX-WS, etc. Here is a table of what is included and what's not included in the web profile. The idea is that some application servers will be certified even if they do not implement all the specifications included in JavaEE. Caucho Resin will be such an application server that supports only the web profile.
