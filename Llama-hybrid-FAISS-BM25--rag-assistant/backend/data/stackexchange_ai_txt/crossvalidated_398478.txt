Have you ever seen anything like a theoretical approach for determining the optimal size (or perhaps some bounds for it) of the training set for a neural network? What you are referring to is the topic of computational learning theory. One way to measure it is to use Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. There are some results on VC dimension bounds of neural networks: Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension of Neural Nets
