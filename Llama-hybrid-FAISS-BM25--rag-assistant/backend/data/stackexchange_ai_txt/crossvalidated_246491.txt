As the observation errors acts multiplicatively on the true deaths, including it additively on the linear scale doesn't seem optimal to me. At least in my field, the standard would be a hierarchical model that first models the (latent) true events for reason A as expectedDeathsA = exp(x1 + x2 + f(vaccine, t) ) trueDeathA ~ poisson(expectedDeathsA) and then derive from that the two observed responses reportedDeathsA ~ binomial(trueDeathA, observationError) reportedTotalDeaths ~ f(trueDeathA, otherDeaths) where observationError could be again a function of time if needed, and the "~ f" in reportedTotalDeaths could mean any function or distribution you want. It's pretty easy to implement such a model in JAGS or STAN, but you will likely have to go Bayesian (no idea if AD Model Builder would work as well, if yes this could provide MLEs). A word of warning: the experience is that it is very hard to estimate the observation accuracy if you don't have a few cases where you know trueDeathA, or a strong prior (but then you don't really estimate the accuracy). Even with repeated observations (which you don't have if the vaccine effectiveness changes in time), small model errors / changes can have huge effects on the estimates. The idea with including the reportedTotalDeaths is helpful to avoid this problem, but I'm not sure how much benefits it generates, as you have to consider that otherDeaths could change over time as well. References A standard reference for the model without the totalDeaths would be Royle, J. A. (2004) N-Mixture Models for Estimating Population Size from Spatially Replicated Counts. Biometrics, 60, 108-115. An excellent textbook with code on these models is: KÃ©ry, M. & Royle, J. A.

These are all for species abundances, but in the end it's all count data I guess.
