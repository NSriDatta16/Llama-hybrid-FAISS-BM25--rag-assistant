I like Sandor's suggestion of using Ken Stanley's NEAT algorithm . NEAT was designed to evolve neural networks with arbitrary topologies, but those are just basically directed graphs. There were many ways to evolve neural networks before NEAT, but one of NEAT's most important contributions was that it provided a way to perform meaningful crossover between two networks that have different toplogies . To accomplish this, NEAT uses historical markings attached to each gene to "line up" the genes of two genomes during crossover (a process biologists call synapsis ). For example: (source: natekohl.net ) (In this example, each gene is a box and represents a connection between two nodes. The number at the top of each gene is the historical marking for that gene.) In summary : Lining up genes based on historical markings is a principled way to perform crossover between two networks without expensive topological analysis.
