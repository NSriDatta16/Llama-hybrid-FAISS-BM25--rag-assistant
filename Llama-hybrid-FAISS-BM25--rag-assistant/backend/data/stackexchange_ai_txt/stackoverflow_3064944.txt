DLL Export C/C++ 6.00 function invoked by VB6

I have been attemptng to create a DLL with C/C++ that can be accessed by VB6, and that's right I get error "453 Can't find DLL entry point myFunctionName in myDllName.dll" upon calling the function from a VB6 app. After searching the Web, including this site, I see that I am not alone, and I have tried the various solutions posted but error "453" is unexcapable. This is Not a COMM dll, and I believe that is possible when created via C/C++. In any case, please help, if you can. Please refer to the following simple test case below: The DLL created as a C/C++ 6.00 Win32 Dynamic-Link Library: #include // Note that I did try the line below rather than the def file, but to no avail... // #pragma comment(linker, "/EXPORT:ibask32=_ibask32@0") // Function definition extern "C" int __declspec(dllexport) __stdcall ibask32() { MessageBox(NULL,"String","Sample Code", NULL); return 0L; } The def file: LIBRARY "Gpib-32" EXPORTS ibask32 Now for the VB App: The following is the entire content of the startup Form1, Form_Load Option Explicit Private Sub Form_Load() Call ibask End Sub The following is a BAS module file that is added to the project: Option Explicit Declare Function ibask32 Lib "Gpib-32.dll" Alias "ibask" () As Long Sub ibask() Call ibask32 ' Note: This is the point of failure End Sub Thanks in advance if a workable solution can be provided, Tom
