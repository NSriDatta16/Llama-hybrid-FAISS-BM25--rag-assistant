PHP's file-oriented functions (include, require, fopen, opendir, etc...) all generally expect to be dealing with a filesystem path. That is, a path on the local server, without being mediated through a web server. That's not to say you can't provide a full absolute URL to the functions, but in general, if you don't have something that looks like a url (protocol://host/path?query#fragment), it'll be interepreted as something in the local file system. So when you stick a / in front of your include path, it's viewed as an absolute local path, starting at the top of the local file system. Without a leading / , it's viewed as a relative path, and PHP will iterate through its include path to try and find the file based on include_path + file_to_include .
