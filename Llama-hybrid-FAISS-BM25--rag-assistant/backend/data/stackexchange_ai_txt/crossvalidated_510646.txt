To answer your questions: Yes, all BO implementations should support this because it only fits the underlying GP. It is not difficult and straightforward. Yes. Again, the observation is supposed to be noisy, and hence the term $(\mathbf{K} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})^{-1}$ , where $\sigma^2$ accounts for the Gaussian noise. Note that this does assume Gaussian noise $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ . There is no agent involved in BO (at least in the conventional settings) unless one modifies it.
