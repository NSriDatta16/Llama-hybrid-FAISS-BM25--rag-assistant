Choosing Machine Learning Algorithm for categorical variables with many levels?

The data set has around 40 variables and 50,000+ rows. Target variable is categorical with 3 levels. I have reduced the number of variables to 31 by removing or combining similar variables. Among these 31 categorical variables, there are some variables which have up to 2000 levels and hence creating dummy variables is not feasible (according to my understanding). Which Machine Algorithm is suited to predict my target variable?
