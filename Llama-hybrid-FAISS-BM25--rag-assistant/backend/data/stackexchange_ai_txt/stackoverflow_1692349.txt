Catching errors or exceptions

I built a mashup of google maps and weather.com and everytime one of these server is not responding my application hangs up too.What do you think I can do to prevent or minimize hanging up of my web apps?Hanging up like you can't navigate away from that page.... I got this code on my app code to access the weather service; Public Class WeatherIn Private _path As String Private _cachedFile As String Public Sub New(ByVal path As String) _path = path _cachedFile = String.Format("{0}\WeatherInCache.xml", _path) End Sub Public Function GetWeather(ByVal arg As String) As String Return _getWebWeather(arg) End Function Private Function _getCachedWeather() As String Dim str As String = String.Empty Using reader As New StreamReader(_cachedFile) str = reader.ReadToEnd() End Using Return str End Function Private Function _getWebWeather(ByVal arg As String) As String Dim baseUrl As String = "http://xoap.weather.com/weather/local/{0}?cc=*&dayf=5&link=xoap&prod=xoap&par={1}&key={2}" Dim jane As String = arg Dim james As String = "api key" Dim john As String = "another api key" Dim url As String = String.Format(baseUrl, jane, james, john) Using client As New WebClient() Try Dim xml As New XmlTextReader(client.OpenRead(url)) Dim xslt As New XslCompiledTransform() xslt.Load(_path + "/Pathto.xslt") Using writer As New StreamWriter(_cachedFile) xslt.Transform(xml, Nothing, writer) End Using Return _getCachedWeather() Catch exception As WebException Dim xmlStr As String = " " xmlStr += " An Error Occurred! " xmlStr += [String].Format(" {0} ", exception.Message) xmlStr += " " Dim doc As New XmlDocument() doc.LoadXml(xmlStr) Dim reader As New XmlNodeReader(doc) Dim xslt As New XslCompiledTransform() xslt.Load(_path + "/Pathto.xslt") Dim resultDocument As New XmlDocument() Using writer As XmlWriter = resultDocument.CreateNavigator().AppendChild() xslt.Transform(reader, DirectCast(Nothing, XsltArgumentList), writer) End Using Return resultDocument.OuterXml End Try End Using End Function Then I used the class above on my page where I display the weather like this: 'specific zip code or could be retrieved from querystring for dynamic retrieval var jay="94576" Dim weather As New WeatherIn(Server.MapPath(String.Empty)) Dim weatherData As String = weather.GetWeather(jay) Response.ContentType = "text/xml" Response.CacheControl = "no-cache" Response.Write(weatherData) which I retrieve the data and write on the page through javascript.Most of the time its the weather.com that goes down.I got no problem with google map its reliable....anybody got a solution why my page hangs up too if the remote server is not responding?The mashup is running smoothly if the remote server is responding...
