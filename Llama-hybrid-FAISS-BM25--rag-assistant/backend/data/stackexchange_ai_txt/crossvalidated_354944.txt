Difference between pooling and subsampling

At this point in a video on LeNet1, Yann LeCunn seems to make a distinction between pooling and subsampling, with a separate gesture for each: [...] The second version had a separate convolution and pooling layer and subsampling I believe I understand what max pooling and average pooling do. What is subsampling as a distinct operation?
