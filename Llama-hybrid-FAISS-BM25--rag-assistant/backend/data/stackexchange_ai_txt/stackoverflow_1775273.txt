If you use (say) Perl, you can spawn the process off, capture the output via a redirection and filter the times. e.g. if (open(PROCESS, "myproc |")) { while( ) { if (/executing time : (\d+)/) { # $1 has the time now } } } (not compiled or tested!) Perhaps the simplest way of analysing the data is to redirect the above output to a file, and then load it into Excel. You can then use Excel to calculate averages/max/mins and std. devs (if you wish) trivially.
