For somebody with a strong math background like you, not intimidated by matrix algebra, I'd recommend Julian Faraway's 2 books: 1. Linear Models with R and 2. Extending the Linear Model with R: Generalized Linear, Mixed Effects and Nonparametric Regression Models . Alternatively, in place of Faraway's second book, you could use Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis book. These books take their time to explain the theory quite thoroughly and yet have their eye fixed on practical applications (with R). For time series and stochastic processes, I'd recommend 3. Robert P. Dobrow's "Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R" . The book is intended for an undergraduate audience but does not shy away from the math; a perfect introduction to a difficult topic that does assume a strong (non-measure theoretic) probability background. These 3 books will give you everything you're looking for in a time-efficient/effort-efficient way.
