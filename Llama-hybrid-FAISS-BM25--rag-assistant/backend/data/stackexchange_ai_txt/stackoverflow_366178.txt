For a book on how to develop software I would recommend The Pragmatic Programmer . For design you may want to look at Interface Oriented Design . Code Complete is an "A to Z" reference on developing software. You might also want to consider the O'Reilly Head First books, especially Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design , as something a little easier to start with. EDIT I don't know how I forgot about Bob Martin, but you could also read any of the books that Object Mentor has on any of it's lists. Here is their section on Software Design . In particular I'd recommend Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices (Amazon, but it's also the second book on the Object Mentor list).
