It sounds roughly like you are wondering if the proportion of measurements is predicted by training, after controlling for day, station, and individual (with interactions?). I'm unclear from your description how much replication you have for day, station, and individual; if your response is proportion of "good" motions, though, you only have 1 per person-station-day, even though you took 500 measurements. So you may be limited in what kind of model you can fit. If my rough verbal description matches your ideas, I might consider logistic regression (a GLM or GLMM), and suggest Gelman and Hill 2007 Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models as a resource. Here's some ideas with some fake data that might help get you started. #set up data frame people
