Question about Geometric Margin of Support Vector Machine

I'm trying to follow Andrew Ng's notes on Support Vector Machines and had the following question. In his notes, Ng, transforms the following optimization problem [using the notion of geometric margin] of the SVM into the following equivalent problem [using the notion of functional margin] My question is this: how are the conditions the same? I understand how $\gamma = \frac{\hat{\gamma}}{\Vert w\Vert}$ , but what is the proof of the equivalence of the "s.t." conditions?
