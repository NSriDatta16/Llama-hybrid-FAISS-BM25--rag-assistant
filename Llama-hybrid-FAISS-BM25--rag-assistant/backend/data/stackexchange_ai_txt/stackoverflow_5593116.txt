#pragma once #include "Global.h" class PlayState : public State What is "State"? That is what the compiler is complaining about. You can't inherit from a class that has not been fully defined. Looking at the file PlayState.h, nowhere do you specify the State class. CORRECTED CODE: #pragma once #include "State.h" class PlayState : public State
