From the UIView reference 's section about the beginAnimations:context: method: Use of this method is discouraged in iPhone OS 4.0 and later. You should use the block-based animation methods instead. Eg of Block-based Animation based on Tom's Comment [UIView transitionWithView:mysuperview duration:0.75 options:UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromRight animations:^{ [myview removeFromSuperview]; } completion:nil];
