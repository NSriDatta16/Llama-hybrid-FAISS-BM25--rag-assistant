Rearranging between sections in UITableView

I have a UITableView with 2 sections in it. I have enabled rearranging in my table view, but I have a strange problem. I do not want the user to be able to rearrange rows between sections (I only want users to be able to rearrange rows within their section). If I try to drag a row from the first section to the second section, it will not allow me, which is what I want. If I drag a row from the second section to the first section, it WILL let me, which I do not want. Is this a bug in Apple's frameworks or is this actually how it is supposed to behave, and how can I get the behaviour I want? EDIT: I'm experiencing some inconsistencies here. Earlier I was unable to drag a row from the first to the second section but now I can. How do I disable rearranging between sections?
