You will have to study and understand Matplotlib and its tweaks. This code will do the basic work. You can extend it. Also, please go through the references that are added at the end. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt data = {'AUC':{'RF':[0.7,0.2,0.5,0.9,0.4], 'LR':[0.9,0.25,0.35,0.99,0.55], 'SVM':[0.3,0.5,0.8,0.6,0.7] } } x = ['S1','S2','S3','S4','S5'] plt.plot(x, data['AUC']['RF'], marker='^', linestyle='solid') plt.plot(x,data['AUC']['LR'], marker='o', color='r',linestyle='dashed') plt.plot(x,data['AUC']['SVM'], marker='s', color='b',linestyle='dashdot') $\hspace{3cm}$ References - Matplotlib Official tutorial Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas Matplotlib Lines Matplotlib Markers Matplotlib Colors
