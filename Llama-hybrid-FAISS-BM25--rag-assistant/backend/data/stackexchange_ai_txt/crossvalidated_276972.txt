How to show trend in a Time series data set

I have 16 NDVI values for 16 years. I want to use this time series data set to investigate a trend in the dataset to distinguish between noise, randomness and actual trends. Can I use R to do this? Or is there any other trend software for this? I just want a method that is a bit simple to understand and run as a beginner.
