dom wrapping a substring in textnode with a new span node

Suppose, I have this paragraph: this is a paragraph containing link to an image at http://lol/atme.png :) I want to replace http://lol/atme.png with an image element. How do I do that? Its like removing the text, but adding a image element in place of that text. Help will be greatly appreciated.
