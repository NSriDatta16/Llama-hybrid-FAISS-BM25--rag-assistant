You seem to be asking specifically about cloud storage services, rather than cloud computing in general. So your Amazon example would be S3, not EC2. I think the field is a little young to be standardising on an API just yet. The services differentiate themselves in ways which rule this out. For example, S3 trades sophistication for scalability/reliability/performance: you can't do a complex SQL LIKE query. You can store and retrieve blobs of data based on a key, and that's about it. I think as such services become more and more the mainstream way to do things, standards will emerge. Users will want the freedom to switch providers on a whim, move their data around, test against free local storage, etc. The APIs used are all based on Web Standards already. Making an abstraction layer to make them look the same is fairly trivial.
