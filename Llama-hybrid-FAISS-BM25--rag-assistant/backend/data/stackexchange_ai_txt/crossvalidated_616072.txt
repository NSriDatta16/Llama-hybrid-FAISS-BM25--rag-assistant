If $x_i\sim\text{Laplace(0, b)}$ and $$y=\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$$ then $y$ is a mixture of double (two-sided) gamma distributions: $$f(y)=\sum_{i=1}^nw_i\frac{b^i|y|^{i-1}}{2\Gamma(i)}e^{-b|y|}$$ with $$w_{i\in2...n}(n)=\binom{2n-i-1}{n-i}2^{i-2n+1}$$ and $w_1=w_2$ . I'm not up for showing the derivation, but it could be done by partial fraction expansion of the characteristic function of the sum of $n$ iid Laplace random variates. A quick check in R: set.seed(1044174532) fcoeff #> Asymptotic two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test #> #> data: x and y #> D = 0.00194, p-value = 0.9918 #> alternative hypothesis: two-sided plot(ecdf(x), col = "blue") plot(ecdf(y), col = "orange", add = TRUE) From this, get the CDF and quantile functions for the distribution of $y$ : pnlaplace $root } else { uniroot(\(a) pnlaplace(a, b, n) - p, c(0, -n*log((1 - p)/2)))$ root } } To determine the minimum value of $a$ for $n=2$ (two reports), first specify $b$ and the desired confidence and power for the hypothesis test: b Next, find $x_0$ (the value of $s_0$ that will give the desired confidence level) and $x_1$ (the value of $s_1 - x_0$ that will give the desired power). $a$ is the average of $x_0$ and $x_1$ : # value of s0 to reject null hypothesis with 1 - alpha confidence (x0 [1] 3.27181 # value of s1 - x0 needed for a test with 1 - beta power (x1 [1] 2.397277 (a [1] 2.834543 Check the type I and type II errors with a simulation: mean(rowSums(matrix(rexp(1e6*n)*sample(c(-1, 1), 1e6*n, 1), 1e6, n)) > x0) #> [1] 0.050136 mean(rowSums(matrix(rexp(1e6*n)*sample(c(-1, 1), 1e6*n, 1), 1e6, n)) + n*a [1] 0.100319 Similarly determine the minimum value of $n$ to achieve the desired confidence and power given $a$ : a [1] 17 Again, check the errors with a quick simulation: # value of s0 to reject null hypothesis with 1 - alpha confidence (x0 [1] 9.574182 mean(rowSums(matrix(rexp(1e6*n)*sample(c(-1, 1), 1e6*n, 1), 1e6, n)) > x0) #> [1] 0.050118 mean(rowSums(matrix(rexp(1e6*n)*sample(c(-1, 1), 1e6*n, 1), 1e6, n)) + n*a [1] 0.099337 These functions are capable of working with large $n$ , but because of the use of nested solvers, the process of finding the minimum $n$ becomes noticeably slower as $n$ gets large: a user system elapsed #> 32.29 0.47 32.80 n #> [1] 171277
