Flex: extract data from a Tree control

So Flex provides great APIs for user-manipulation of its data-fed controls, but, for the life of me, I can't figure out how to get the data back out of the control once the user is done playing with it. Specifically, I've enabled the dragMove controls on a Tree component, but I can't figure out how to get the user-initiated changes back into XML data that I can write back to the db. When the user reorders the Tree, no change is registered in the dataProvider, and if the dataDescriptor is registering these changes, I don't know how to get the data back out. The dataDescriptor method getData() calls for a node parameter....which node? The node from its own dataProvider?? I don't get it. Any ideas?
