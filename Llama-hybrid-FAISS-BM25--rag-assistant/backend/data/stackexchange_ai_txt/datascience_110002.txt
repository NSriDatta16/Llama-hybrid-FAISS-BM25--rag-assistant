Odds vs Likelihood

Odds is the chance of an event occurring against the event not occurring. Likelihood is the probability of a set of parameters being supported by the data in hand. In logistic regression, we use log odds to convert a probability-based model to a likelihood-based model. In what way are odds & likelihood related? And can we call odds a type of conditional probability?
