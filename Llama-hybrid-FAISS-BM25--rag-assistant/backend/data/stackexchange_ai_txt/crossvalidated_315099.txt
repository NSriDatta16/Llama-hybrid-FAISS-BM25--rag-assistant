Generate n dependene moving average structure

In Chen and qin (2010) ( available here ), a moving average structure for generating moving average model introduced that is like this: $ X_{jk} = \rho_1Z_{jk} + \rho_2Z_{j(k+1)} +\dots+ \rho_pZ_{j(k+p-1)} + \mu_{j} $ which $j \in \{ 1,2,\dots, n \}$, $k \in \{ 1,\dots,p\}$, and $n$ and $p$ are size and dimension of date respectively. suppose $Z$s are standard normal variables and $\rho$s are fix for all dimensions. Chen and qin (2010) says that for Two Dependent Case , $X_{jk_1}$ and $X_{jk_2}$ dependent if $\lvert k_1 - k_2 \lvert \leq 2$. How Can I generate such dependent time series and get covariance matrix of theme?
