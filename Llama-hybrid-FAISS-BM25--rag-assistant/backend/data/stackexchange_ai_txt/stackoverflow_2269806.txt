placing Indy TIdTCPClient into a non-visual package

i All, I am trying to get TIdTCPClient to run in my non-visual component. I add the following to my .h file: #include "IdBaseComponent.hpp" #include "IdComponent.hpp" #include "IdTCPClient.hpp" #include "IdTCPConnection.hpp" ... private: TIdTCPClient *mTCPClient; It all compiles fine, but of course Indy is not included in the build yet. So I do this in my .cpp file: #pragma link "IdBaseComponent" #pragma link "IdComponent" #pragma link "IdTCPClient" #pragma link "IdTCPConnection" ... mTCPClient = new TIdTCPClient( NULL ); during compile I get: [ILINK32 Error] Fatal: Unable to open file 'IDBASECOMPONENT.OBJ' This all works if I just drop the component onto a form, the same lines are added as I manually add in my component (except the new) and it all compiles fine. I can't figure it out. Thanks
