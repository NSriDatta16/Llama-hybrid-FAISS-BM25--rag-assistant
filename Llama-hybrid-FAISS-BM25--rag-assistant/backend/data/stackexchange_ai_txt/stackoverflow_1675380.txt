I'd recommend something like this: def combine_lists(list1, list2): s = set(list1) s.update(list2) return list(s) This eliminates the problem of creating a monster list of the concatenation of the first two. Depending on what you're doing with the output, don't bother to convert back to a list. If ordering is important, you might need some sort of decorate/sort/undecorate shenanigans around this.
