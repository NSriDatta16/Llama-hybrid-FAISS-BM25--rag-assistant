Read /proc/cpuinfo to find the number of CPU/cores available to the systems. Call the getloadavg() (or alternatively read the /proc/loadavg ), take the first value, multiply it by 100 (to convert to percents), divide by number of CPU/cores. If the value is greater than 100, truncate it to 100. Done. Relevant documentation: man getloadavg and man 5 proc N.B. Load average, usual to *NIX systems, can be more than 100% (per CPU/core) because it actually measures number of processes ready to be run by scheduler. With Windows-like CPU metric, when load is at 100% you do not really know whether it is optimal use of CPU resources or system is overloaded. Under *NIX, optimal use of CPU loadavg would give you value ~1.0 (or 2.0 for dual system). If the value is much greater than number CPU/cores, then you might want to plug extra CPUs into the box. Otherwise, dig the /proc file system.
