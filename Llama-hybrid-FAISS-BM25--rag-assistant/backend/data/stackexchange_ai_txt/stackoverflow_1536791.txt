What percentage of followed hyperlinks might have their "onclick" JavaScript ignored?

As far as I know all popular web browsers execute the onclick attribute of an anchor link first, then follow the path specified by the href attribute. The problem here is that the onclick attribute only gets called when clicking with the left mousebutton (without pressing ctrl or shift for a new tab or window) or when pressing enter on your keyboard while the tabIndex is set to the link you want to follow. But there are many other ways of following a link than just those two. Ctrl + click shift + click rightmousebutton + open rightmousebutton + new tab drag & drop link to address bar and so on... My client uses onclick for conversion statistics. Which seems heavily unreliable. My question: What percentage of hyperlinks are being followed without activating their onclick attribute? All estimates are highly appreciated. I'm completely lost; I think it can be any number...
