Embedding Flash Player in a C++ or Java application?

I would like to embed Flash Player directly inside a C++ or Java application. I found an article that describes how to do this for C#: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/articles/stock_history03.html Unfortunately, I have no experience with C#, COM or ActiveX. I need someone to translate this code to C++, allowing me to embed the Flash Player into a Win32 Window. Ultimately I'd like to use this information to embed Flash into a Java application. I am looking for three main functionalities: Ability to play a Flash movie Ability to receive events (such as mouse clicks) Ability to send events Edit: I prefer an open-source solution if possible.
