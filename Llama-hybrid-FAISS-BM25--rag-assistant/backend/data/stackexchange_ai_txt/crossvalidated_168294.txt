Your understanding of how Stata reports coefficients for ordered logistic regression is correct. A coefficient for this 3-category case represents both the odds ratio for top category versus combined middle+low categories and for combined top+middle versus low. This page explains the Stata output for ordered logistic regression, and also suggests a test of whether this simple odds model is appropriate, something you probably want to examine. Your interest in whether the influence of position depended on frame (and necessarily vice-versa) required adding an interaction term to the model. Interpretation of Stata output for interaction terms between categorical predictors is explained on this page . You have to be careful in examining the odds-ratio coefficients. The odds ratio of about 2 for the (1,1) case in the interaction table toward the bottom right of your output is with respect to the (0,0) case , as are all the other coefficients in that table. The (1,1) coefficient is the only one significantly different from (0,0), and its 95% CI do not overlap the point estimates of the other 2 coefficients, supporting a situation where only the combination of "gain" for frame and "owner/partner" for position has an influence on your outcome measure. You should do a more formal analysis of contrasts (if that was your original hypothesis before you saw the data) or of the multiple comparisons before publishing. I'm not sufficiently familiar with Stata to give you a good explanation of the margins table. The second page I linked seems to illustrate some alternate ways to examine interactions in Stata.
