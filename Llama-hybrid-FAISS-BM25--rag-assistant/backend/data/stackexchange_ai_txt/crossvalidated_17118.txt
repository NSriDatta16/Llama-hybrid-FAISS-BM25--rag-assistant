Q1: The intensity function for a point process is the average number of points in a small region around some location, divided by the area/volume of the region, in the limit as the size of the region goes to 0. If you integrate the intensity function over a region, you'll get the expected number of points in the region. I've not seen the term density used for point processes, likely to avoid confusion with probability density functions . But the colloquial idea of density of points is what the intensity function captures, though probably you'd be thinking of density as integrating the intensity over some finite region and then dividing by the area of the region. Q2. Kernel methods seem the best way to estimate the intensity function of a point process. You mention the difficulty of selecting a bandwidth, but any method for estimating the intensity function is going to have that issue. Q3: The intensity function is a local feature, and so outside of that lower-right quadrant, it would be unaffected by what's happening in the lower-right quadrant. If you ask about the average number of points per unit area overall (i.e., the integrated intensity), it depends on what you mean by removing that lower-right quadrant. If you're saying that no points will ever be observed there, then clearly the overall expected number of points will be reduced. If instead you mean that the lower-right quadrant has not been observed (there may be points there but we don't get to see them), then you would probably estimate the average number of points from the observed portion.
