Excuse if this has been answered before. I need to extract features and parse from a piece of text and run some analysis. For e.g. "Plot the past 5-year sales of Apple" should give me the following Information: Company: Apple Item: Sales Period: past 5 years Action: Plot What deep learning techniques / algorithms should I be looking to use? Any pointers are highly appreciated.
