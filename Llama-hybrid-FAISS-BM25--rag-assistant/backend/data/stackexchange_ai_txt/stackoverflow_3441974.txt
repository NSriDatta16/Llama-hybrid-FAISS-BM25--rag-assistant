Combine explicit protocol specification with relative URL

I have a page that is accessed via HTTP. This page links to another page on the same server using HTTPS. What is the most elegant way, using HTML and/or Javascript, to force a transition to HTTPS while using a relative URL? Basically, I want the opposite of a protocol-relative URL . I want to explicitly specify HTTPS WITHOUT hardcoding the hostname into the URL. I'm working on a large legacy site so a solution using unobtrusive javascript with minimal changes to existing markup is ideal. I realize that enforcing HTTPS is better performed at the destination page, but that isn't an option in this case.
