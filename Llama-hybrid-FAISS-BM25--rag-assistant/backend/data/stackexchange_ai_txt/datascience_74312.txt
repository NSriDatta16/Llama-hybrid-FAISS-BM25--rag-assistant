LabelEncoder is meant for the labels (target, dependent variable), not for the features. OrdinalEncoder can be used for features, and so can take a 2d array rather than the 1d array LabelEncoder requires, and so you can use a single transformer for all your categorical columns. (You can use a ColumnTransformer to select those categorical columns, if you have continuous ones too.) But, you should not use OrdinalEncoder before OneHotEncoder anymore: OneHotEncoder has for some time now applied directly to string categorical columns.
