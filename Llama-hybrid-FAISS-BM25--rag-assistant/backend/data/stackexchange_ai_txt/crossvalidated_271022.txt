From my brief understanding on the subject, I believe you should add the extra time series in the following manner: Say you want to predict $X = (x_0,...,x_t)$. What you say you are doing with sliding window is correct thus start by Features | target $x_{t-4}, x_{t-3} | x_{t-2}$ $x_{t-3}, x_{t-2} |x_{t-1}$ $x_{t-2}, x_{t-1} | x_t$ But you also want another time series used as input, say $Z=(z_0,...,z_t) $ so I would imagine you should do it like this: Features | target $x_{t-4}, x_{t-3}, z_{t-3} | x_{t-2}$ $x_{t-3}, x_{t-2}, z_{t-2} |x_{t-1}$ $x_{t-2}, x_{t-1}, z_{t-1} | x_t$
