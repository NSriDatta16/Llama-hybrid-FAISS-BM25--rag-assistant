The domain kitchen.go.jp points to 209.20.77.104 . According to GeoIP, it is in Saint Louis, MO, which means it is in a country with a strong legal system so you can sue them or send them a DMCA notice. Contact a lawyer. Update: According to the Japanese NIC whois service (whois.jprs.jp) the contact information for the domain is the following: Contact Information: a. [JPNIC Handle] SU180JP c. [Last, First] Usami, Shinichi d. [E-Mail] s-usami@mail.usamiplanning.co.jp g. [Organization] Usami Co.,Ltd. l. [Division] n. [Title] Vice President o. [TEL] 0729-48-2801 p. [FAX] 0729-48-2807 y. [Reply Mail] [Last Update] 1999/03/04 12:51:46 (JST) form@domain.nic.ad.jp You should probably contact them. To be honest I think someone just wanted to have your editor on a Japanese domain (company webfilter policy maybe?), nothing malvolent.
