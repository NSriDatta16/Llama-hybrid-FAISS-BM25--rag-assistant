Google Maps for Flash idle event

i'm new to Google Maps Api. I compared the javascript and flash map events and found that there is an "idle" event in Javascript API. There is the following advice in the google docs: Note that you could listen to the bounds_changed event but it fires continuously as the user pans; instead, the idle will fire once the user has stopped panning/zooming. But i haven't found such an event in actionscript API. There are ZOOM_CHANGED, DRAG_END, etc events, but nothing like "idle". Am i missing something or this event was not ported to the actionscript api? As far as i understand, that is a really useful thing - to wait until a user stops at some viewport instead of immediate handling of all his pan/zoom actions (cause it will affect the performance and produce unnecessary requests for marker data). Maybe there is some workaround.
