How to analyses sensitivity for understanding which variables are the most effect on the predictive model

I have a dataset with 150 observations. The dataset has 9 input parameters and 1 output parameter. I have built a predictive model (Random Forest) using the dataset. And now, I want to know that which variables are the most effect on the constructed predictive model. How can I do? P/s: Please help me with an example because I am a newbie in R. Thanks in advance!
