To my knowledge, that's not possible with the Average method. You can however achieve the result you want to, with the following substitute: PRAS = grp.Sum(c => Convert.ToDouble(c.Field ("pAKT Total"))) / grp.Count(c => !c.IsDBNull) This only makes sense, when you want to select the "empty" rows in the group, but just don't want to include them in your average. If you don't need the "empty" rows at all, don't select them in the first place, i.e. add a where clause that excludes them.
