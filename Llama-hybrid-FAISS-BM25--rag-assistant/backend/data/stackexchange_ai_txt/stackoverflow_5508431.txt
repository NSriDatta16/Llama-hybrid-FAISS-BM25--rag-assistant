I'd use perl for this. Something like this should get you started: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use File::Slurp qw/slurp/; my $text = slurp($ARGV[0]); $text =~ s/foo\nbar/new_and_shiny/; my $newfile = $ARGV[0] . ".new"; open my $out, ">$newfile" or die "$!"; print $out $text; close $out; Replace foo\nbar with your old javascript, and don't forget to escape all those special characters ()[] etc. Jim Garrison made me edit this answer and add the following: You can go one step further and replace all the google analytics javascript in your files with a single placeholder string, say 'GOOGLE_ANALYTIC_CODE' that look something like this: GOOGLE_ANALYTIC_CODE and run the find-and-replace script on these files to replace the 'GOOGLE_ANALYTIC_CODE' with the latest javascript to create the 'deployed' version. It may take more effort now but it will definitely benefit your future self. This practice is very nicely documented in the The Pragmatic Programmer book when they dicuss the "DRY principle" (Dont-Repeat-Yourself). I can't recommend that book enough. Lots and lots of good advice there.
