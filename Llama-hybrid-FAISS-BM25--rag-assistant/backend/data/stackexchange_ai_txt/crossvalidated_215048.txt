How to calculate a confidence interval for a trimmed mean

I try to get the sample size that presents the population, I averaged randomly the 10 and then the 20 readings then I used the formula CI = 1.96 * std/root n, that gave me the CI at any (n), but how can I get the CI if the (n) has been excluded the high and low value at say 10 or 20 readings?
