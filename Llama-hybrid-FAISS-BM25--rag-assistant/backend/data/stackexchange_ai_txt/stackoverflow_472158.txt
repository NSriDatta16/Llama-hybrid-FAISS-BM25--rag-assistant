Take a look to SortedDictionary and SortedList . Both have O(log n) retrieval, the main difference is in memory use and speed of insertion and removal: SortedList uses less memory than SortedDictionary. SortedDictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data: O(log n) as opposed to O(n) for SortedList.
