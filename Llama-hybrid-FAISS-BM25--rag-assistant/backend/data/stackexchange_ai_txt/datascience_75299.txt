How to figure out if two sentences have the same meaning with AI?

I have two sentences which might be similar in meaning. Are there a useful and successful (machine learning) algorithms, which is able to determine the semantic similarity? Are there any approaches which can handle this task and are easy to use? An approach via Keras or Tensorflow as a Framework would work perfectly in my use case. Thank you!
