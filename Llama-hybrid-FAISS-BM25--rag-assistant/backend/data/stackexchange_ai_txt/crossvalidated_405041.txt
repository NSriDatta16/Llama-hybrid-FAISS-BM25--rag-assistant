Philosophical question on logistic regression: why isn't the optimal threshold value trained?

Usually in logistic regression, we fit a model and get some predictions on the training set. We then cross-validate on those training predictions (something like here ) and decide the optimal threshold value based on something like the ROC curve. Why don't we incorporate cross-validation of the threshold INTO the actual model, and train the whole thing end-to-end?
