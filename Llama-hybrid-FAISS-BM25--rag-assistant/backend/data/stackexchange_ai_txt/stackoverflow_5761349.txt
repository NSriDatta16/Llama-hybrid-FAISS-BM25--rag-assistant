Backbone.js able to do rest and localstorage?

I have been experimenting with the localstorage module for Backbone.js (https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage). As I understand it this overloads Backbone.sync and therefore stops backbone from pushing to the server(?). Ideally, I would like pass my data back to the server as well and persist it locally when online and just use localstorage when offline (you know, the perfect app). I haven't found any documentation yet. Is Backbone.localStorage a part of this? Has anyone been able to build this scenario? How is this done? (Please tell me I don't have to roll my own.) Thanks.
