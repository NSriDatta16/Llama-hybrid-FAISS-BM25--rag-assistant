Should use mixed effect logistic regression. Data format: Cluster damaged count treatment 1 1 2 1 1 0 98 1 2 1 15 1 2 0 75 1 .... damaged = 1 means damaged and = 0 means not damaged. count = # of fruits. Treatment is code for two treatment (treatment and control). The model would be $$\log\left (\frac {\Pr(Y_{ij}=1)}{\Pr(Y_{ij}=0)} \right) = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X_{i} + \gamma_i$$ Where $Y_{ij}$ = 1 if the j-th fruit in i-th cluster is damaged, = 0 otherwise. $X_i$ is the treatment received in i-th cluster. $\gamma_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ is rnadom intercept for cluster $i$ . In the program, the information in column count should be used. the common statements are: weight, count, freq, ...
