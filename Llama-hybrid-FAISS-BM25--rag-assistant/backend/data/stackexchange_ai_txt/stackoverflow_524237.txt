A solution (although something based around regex would be best) would be something along the lines of creating a replacement hash as such, which can be extended as needed. I just quickly put this together to demonstrate. I'm sure with a bit more love and care you can come up with something more elegant that works along the same lines as this implementation only works for strings with spaces. str1 = "AAAA BBBB CCCC DDDD" replacements = { "AAAA" => "CCCC", "CCCC" => "AAAA", "XXXX" => "ZZZZ" } # etc... new_string = "" str1.split(" ").each do |s| new_string += replacements[s] || s new_string += " " end puts new_string # CCCC BBBB AAAA DDDD
