The NDK itself is only for creating libraries, though if you do some web searching you will find that there are at least two sets of wrapper scripts or instructions for (ab)using its toolchain to make standalone executables linked against android's bionic libc (something you would not get from a non-android arm toolchain). The google folks do not encourage people to do this. Unfortunately, their vision of android only includes java applications, with optional native libraries in support - it does not include any "stable" means of installing or launching a native executable, in the sense that they warn the methods you might be able to use today may not continue to work in new versions. This is really too bad, as it means giving up a lot of the general-purpose-computer potential of the device.
