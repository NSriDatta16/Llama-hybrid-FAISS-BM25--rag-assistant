UIScrollView dragging affected by UIWindow transform rotation

I'm adding a video out function to my iPad app and have run into a problem with my UIScrollView. To get the proper view orientation on the external monitor, I've rotated the UIWindow based on the current interface orientation (e.g. - mirroredScreenWindow.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(- M_PI * 0.5);). The problem I've run into is that the ScrollView dragging seems to be affected by the UIWindow transform. If the UIWindow is rotated 90 degrees, horizontal drags scroll the view vertically and vice versa. Is there any way to correct this?
