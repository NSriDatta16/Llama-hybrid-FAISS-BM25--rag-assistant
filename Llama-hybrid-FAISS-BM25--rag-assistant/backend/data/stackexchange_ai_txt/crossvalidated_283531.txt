I don't think there is a correct notation here, it depends on the audience. If the intended audience includes beginners, or those without much mathematical exposure, it is useful to bold (or put an arrow over) vector, to call attention to the fact that they are not simple numbers. If the intended audience is more experienced, they are used to having may different types of mathematical objects at play, too many to call out the type of each through notation. In this case the writer assumes the reader is responsible and experienced enough to infer the type of object from context and prior statements, so much of the type specific notation is dropped. The bolding or arrowization of vectors is often the first to go, as vector are ubiquitous in all but the most elementary topics. In your specific case, if $x_i$ are already stated to refer to the components of a vector $\mathbf{x}$, and not individual vectors themselves, then $Cov(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ and $Cov(x_i, y_i)$ are simply different things. The first is a martix, the second is a number.
