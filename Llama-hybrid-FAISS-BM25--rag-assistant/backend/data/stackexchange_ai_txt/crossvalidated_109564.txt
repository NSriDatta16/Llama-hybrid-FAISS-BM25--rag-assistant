Local median and local average

I have two pictures representing two laboratory experiments. The idea is that every black band represent one sample. Now I need to use special application to measure the bands intensity, which tell me how much product from reaction I have. For every picture I can do 'background subtraction' which will give me more reliable answer. I have the option: 'local median' and 'local average' subtraction. Which one will be better for every of them? and why?
