Are Purging and Embargo better than TimeSeriesSplit?

It is well known that the classical k-fold CV does not work well when it comes to time series data. I recently found two methods called Purging and Embargo , which aim to modify the k-fold CV, so that there is no data leakage. Purging k-fold CV: The main idea is to 'purge' (remove) the observations in the training set, which at some point in time coincided with those in the validation set. Embargo: The idea of purging observations is amplified by embargo. Embargo removes the observations from the training set, which immediately follow the validation set. My questions are: Why bother doing this when you can simply use TimeSeriesSplit, which is much simpler to both understand and implement? Is there any evidence that using Purging and/or Embargo produces better results? In particular, I am interested in answering these questions in the setting of financial time series. Any references to papers and/or intuitive arguments are much appreciated. For anyone interested you can also refer to this YouTube video on financial CV, which explains Purging and Embargo. For those that have access, I leave the reference to the paper containing my original encounter with the methods: doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121012 You can also find these methods discussed in the book by Marcos Lopes de Prado 'Advances in Financial Machine Learning'. He also talks about these briefly in this YouTube video .
