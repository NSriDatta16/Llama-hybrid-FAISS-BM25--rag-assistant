N-dimension one hot features representation

I was trying to understand the features representation in this paper: DRN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for News Recommendation In 4.2 Feature construction, the news features is News features includes 417 dimension one hot features that describe whether certain property appears in this piece of news, including headline, provider, ranking, entity name, category, topic category, and click counts in last 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 year respectively I don't understand the "one hot features" here, and google around doesn't help. If there are a lot of news, how can it be only 417 dimension, or i understand it wrong
