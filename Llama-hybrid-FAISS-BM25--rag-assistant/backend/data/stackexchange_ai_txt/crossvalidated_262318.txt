Difference between confidence interval and RMSE

For a long time I have been doing chemometrics using Partial Least Squares regression to predict the composition of samples based on their spectra, and calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) as an estimate of the accuracy of the model. I am now looking into using gaussian process regression to do something similar. As a Bayesian method, GPR results automatically come with a confidence interval, but I could also calculate an RMSE just as I do with PLS. So, my question is: If I want to report the accuracy of a prediction using GPR, do I report the RMSE or the confidence interval (or both)?
