Different accuracy for different rng values

While tuning the SVM classification model in Matlab, I came across the rng function in matlab in which seed (stabilizes the random shuffling of the data in the algorithm) is changed. When the function called is rng(1) then I am getting one accuracy value (99%). When it is changed to rng(2) then I am getting another value (57%). So there is a huge change in accuracy as visible. What does this mean? Am I training it wrong? The train and test set correct rate (in %) that I am getting with different runs without changing rng are(train,test) (96, 82.8) (94.6, 95.3) (96, 85.9) (96, 90) (95, 95)
