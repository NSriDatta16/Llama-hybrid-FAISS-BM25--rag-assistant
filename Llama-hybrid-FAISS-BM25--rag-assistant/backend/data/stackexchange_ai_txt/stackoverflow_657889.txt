Best practice for DLL calling an object in the EXE

I'm building a DLL with several "master" objects that need access to the app LINQ DataContext. The DLL will serve several projects with different dataContexts, so I need the DLL can call the object that it's inside the EXE. What is the best or elegant way to do it? Edit: Clarification Code example of what I'm trying to do: 'DLL '--- Public MustInherit Class MasterObject(Of T As Class) Friend db As DataContext Public Sub New() 'How do I do something like this? db = New DataContextInTheExe() End Sub ... Public MustOverride Sub Save() end class 'In the Exe '--- Public Class Order Inherits MasterObject(Of Order) Public Overrides Sub Save() ... Me.db.SubmitChanges() End Sub end class
