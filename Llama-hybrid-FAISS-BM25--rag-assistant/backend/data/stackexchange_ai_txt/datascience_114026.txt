Different results between training and evaluation phase on the same data

I have trained a CNN and in the training phase I obtained an accuracy of 36.5%. If I call model.predict() on the same test data of the training phase I only obtain a 14.5% accuracy score. How is it possible ? It's an 8 class classification problem.
