Hrm, I cannot say that I agree with Mark or Cinder6. Well, I agree in the first part. :-) self.foo is invoking the -foo method. Plain foo is accessing the foo ivar. In most circumstances you should always go through your methods. They're there to abstract you away from the actual storage, and away from any other behavior that might be necessary. Think about what happens if you later subclassed your class. For the most part you want to be calling your own public methods in the places where you access the functionality they cover. The exception is in object init and teardown, and within property accessors themselves when you don't synthesize them. During object init and teardown, you do not want to invoke subclass implementations of methods, because those methods should not have to deal with your object in its partially set up state.
