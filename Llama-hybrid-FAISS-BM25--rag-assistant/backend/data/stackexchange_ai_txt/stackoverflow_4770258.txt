creating a drawable from sd card to set as a background in android

I am trying to use an image from the sd card and set it as the background for a relativelayout. I have tried other solutions that i have found here and elsewhere but they havent seemed to work for me. here is my code. I have commented out other ways that i have tried and didnt work. the only thing that worked for me was using setBackgroudnResource and using a resource from the app, but this was just to test to make sure mRoot was set up correctly. when I have tried all the other ways, it just doesn't set anything. Anyone know what I am doing wrong, or if there is a better way to do this? //one way i tired... //String extDir = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString(); //Drawable d = Drawable.createFromPath(extDir + "/pic.png"); //mRoot.setBackgroundDrawable(d); //another way tried.. //Drawable d = Drawable.createFromPath("/sdcard/pic.png"); //mRoot.setBackgroundDrawable(d); //last way i tried... mRoot.setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable.createFromPath(new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "pic.png").getAbsolutePath())); //worked, only to verify mRoot was setup correctly and it could be changed //mRoot.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.bkg);
