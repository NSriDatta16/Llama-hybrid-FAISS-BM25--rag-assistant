Here is a balanced algorithm: On the $i^{th}$ questionnaire, if there are $k_i$ valid responses which sum to $s_i$ , then: round $s_i/k_i$ up if $(i\! \mod k_i) round $s_i/k_i$ down if $(i\! \mod k_i) \ge (s_i\! \mod k_i)$ In the long run of this algorithm, averages like 2.5 get rounded up half the time and down half the time, while averages like 2.7 get rounded up 70% of the time and rounded down 30% of the time.
