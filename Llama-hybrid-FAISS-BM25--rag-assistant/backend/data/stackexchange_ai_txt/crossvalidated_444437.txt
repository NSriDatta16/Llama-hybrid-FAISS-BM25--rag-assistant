You seem to be confusing some things, so let me clarify. First of all, Bayesian models do not have any special connection to time-series . Same as for non-Bayesian models, using Bayesian framework you can define possibly infinite number of different statistical models. Sure, you can first estimate the model for $n$ time-series points, and then update it for the $n+1$ 'th point, but the results would be the same as if you estimated the model on $n+1$ datapoints all at once (this is so-called Bayesian updating ). Of course you can compare the estimate for the parameter from $n$ points, to the one calculated using $n+1$ points, but again, you can do this for non-Bayesian models as well. So there is no special "autoregressive" property. Moreover, from technical reasons, Bayesian updating is not simple to be done for complicated models that require MCMC sampling, so in practice you would usually just calculate the model on $n+1$ datapoints all at once, rather then updating it sequentially. As about "variability over time" of $\beta$ , let me use an example. Imagine a trivial model $$ x_{t+1} = \mathcal{N}(x_t\beta, \sigma) $$ with known $\sigma$ . In non-Bayesian setting, you could estimate the $\beta$ parameter by maximizing the likelihood function. The only major difference in Bayesian setting would be that you would assume a prior distribution for $\beta$ , and maximize (or sample from) posterior $\propto$ likelihood $\times$ prior . What follows, by assuming $\beta$ to be a random variable, setting prior for it, and plugging it to Bayes theorem, you would end up with a posterior distribution. Posterior distribution helps you to quantify how uncertain are you about the $\beta$ parameter, it does not have any special connection to time series or changes over time. In the above model, we do not assume $\beta$ to vary over time, so the model does not learn anything specific about such variability. Updating your model sequentially and looking at the changes of the estimates over time would only show you how your estimates become more precise with growing sample size. So Bayesian models do not need to behave like rolling/expanding window parameter estimation. You can implement rolling average model in Bayesian setting, but you can also implement a number of other time series models. You can plug in all the data at once and nothing would "roll". On another hand, as described earlier, you could estimate the non-Bayesian models for $n$ , $n+1$ , $n+2$ etc. points as well. Bayesian models also do not solve any problems for time-series. In some cases, with Bayesian model, if you already have model estimated on $n$ points, it could be easier to "update" the model for the new $n+1$ 'th point, but this is not always straightforward.
