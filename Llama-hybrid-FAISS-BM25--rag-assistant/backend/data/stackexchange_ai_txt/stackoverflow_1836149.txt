At GitHub (where grit was developed and is extracted from) we use Grit on both the frontend where the web application is run and on the backends where the git repositories are. We patch Grit to make every call to the Grit::Git functions (where all of the actual file access is contained) over BERT-RPC to the appropriate backend instead of executing the code locally. The file path passed to the Grit initializer is the path on the backend server in that case. So the raw repository access is done by ruby handlers running Grit on the backend servers, while the rest of the Grit namespace (Grit::Commit, Grit::Diff, etc) is run on the frontends. It's actually pretty cool. At GitHub we run something like 300mil RPC calls a month through this system.
