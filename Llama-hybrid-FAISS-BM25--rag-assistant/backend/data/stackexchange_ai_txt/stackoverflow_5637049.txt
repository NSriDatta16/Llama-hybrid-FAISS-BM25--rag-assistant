This work may have already been done for you. You may want to look up PHP's get_browser() function, along with the related browsecap.ini file. However, I would generally advise that doing browser detection is generally a bad idea. It is fundamentally unreliable because the browser can fake its user agent string. And even if the browser doesn't do it, it can still be changed or blanked out by proxies and security software.
