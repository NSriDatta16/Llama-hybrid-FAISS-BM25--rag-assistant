How to deal with the miss# how to deal with the missing values in time series forecasting?

I have dataset in which there are records of stock market hour by hour. There are some missing values like each day should posses 24 values as it is hour by hour but I don't have the value of some hours and there is one more case that the whole day is not present in dataframe . How to deal with this type of usecase ?
