Technically, yes, an unmanaged app can access any file. The odds that such an app would just happen to open the file exclusively and lock you out are however vanishingly small. The directories containing isolated storage files are not found by accident. Don't discount the possibility that it is another instance of your Silverlight app that has the file opened, that's far more likely. Having a reasonable failure mode for an IOException is always a good idea. A "sorry, couldn't do it" message is acceptable.
