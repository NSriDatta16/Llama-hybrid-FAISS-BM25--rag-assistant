asynctask sharing between activities

My app downloads files (5-12MB a piece) and accesses them from external storage. Since the download takes a minute or two when one isn't on WiFi, I'd like to be able to start the download before the user gets to the Activity where they'll want it, so that they don't have to wait. It seemed like AsyncTask was the best way to go, but then I realized that future activities (to my understanding) won't be able to check on the progress of the AsyncTask itself, the best they can do is keep checking to see if the file is readable... but what if the task is still running or lost network connectivity and needs to be retried? It seems like a waste to indiscriminately recreate the AsyncTask and download the file again if it'd be finished soon. Is there a way to access the AsyncTask (in particular, its status) from a future activity, or is there a better paradigm I should be looking at?
