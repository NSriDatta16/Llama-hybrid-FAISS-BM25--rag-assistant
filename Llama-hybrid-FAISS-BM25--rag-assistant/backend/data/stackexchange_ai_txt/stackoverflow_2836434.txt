Since there won't be any new days of the week invented (I hope!) you could just create a bool column for each day. Then, if you are running a query to find events on a Friday, it would simply be (with a bit of pseudocode): SELECT eventName FROM events WHERE fridayBool = true AND eventStartTime NOW(); In that example the name of the column you would store in an array in your code, and check today's date to see what day of the week it is, which then selects the proper name out of the array before creating the query. Not the most elegant, but it should work. Edit... Example table columns: eventID eventName eventStartTime eventEndTime sundayBool mondayBool ... saturdayBool
