Many types of neural network might be used to solve this problem, but I imagine that a relatively simple scoring function might work as well and be much easier to implement. If you can identify the likely locations of the beginning and ending of your trapezoid, I suggest trying something like average "absolute difference from a trapezoidal template shape" as a measure of machine performance.
