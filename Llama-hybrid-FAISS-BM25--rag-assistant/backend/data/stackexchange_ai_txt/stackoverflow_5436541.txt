Exceptions should indicate exceptional activity, so if you reach a point in your code for which you've done your best to avoid divide by zero, then throwing an exception (if you are able to in your language) is the right way. If it's routine logic to check for divide by zero (like for a calculator app) then you should check for that in your code before it has the chance to raise an exception. In that case, it's an error (in user input) and should be handled as such. (Stole this idea either from The Pragmatic Programmer or Code Complete; can't remember which.)
