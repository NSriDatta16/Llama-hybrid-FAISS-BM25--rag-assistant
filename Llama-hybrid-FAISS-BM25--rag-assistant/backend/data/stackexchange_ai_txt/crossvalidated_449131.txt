Your question is best answered by asking: What kind of error do you want to be unlikely? This also gives some hint on which adjustment procedure to use. Let's start with your joke example . Imagine a politician claiming in his election campaign: "Vote for me as I never state an erroneous claim in my life." Clearly this guy should control for the probability that any of his claims until election day is wrong. (Opening quite an interesting statistical question on how to adjust for multiplicity if the number of tests is unknown in advance.). Now imagine a dose finding study : Imagine experimental units that get a toxic agent in different doses each group. At which dose do toxic symptoms start to show in a way that a physiological parameter of the experimental units exceeds its safe range? It may be possible that no toxic symptoms show at all as the maximum dose is still safe. Then we don't get to know the toxic dose, so we stay with the null hypothesis. The opposite will be that at least one dose is toxic and the lowest of these doses is the answer to the research question. So you choose a multiplicity adjustment procedure that may incorporate the natural ordering of the doses and its conditional probabilities: Given a low dose is toxic, a higher dose will be toxic as well. Another more equality related example: Imagine a survey on political party preference and consumer buying habits. Your sample is divided in supporters of more than two political parties. You ask: The supporter of which party would prefer a new product X over Y? There you don't have an ordering like in the dose finding example. But again, it may happen that among all subgroups product X is not preferred and finding at least one subgroup that seems to prefer X would be an error. So you have to adjust for the opposite: Supporters of at least one party prefer X over Y. However, if the survey's intention is just to find at which party convention to advertise a product (now that's my joke) with a given budget, multiplicity correction is not necessary. You spend the budget anyway. The question is rather which subgroup would ignore the ad anyway. How to adjust in gene screening ? You have individuals separated into two groups by a certain phenotype. Now you are pretty sure that this is caused by different genotypes but you want to find significant genes. In this case, the question "is there any gene?" is of no importance: You are already pretty sure. In this case multiplicity adjustment should make sure that among the significant genes, only a small proportion is erroneuously found. This leads to an adjustment procedure for false discovery rate (FDR) which is more powerful than the family-wise error rate (FWER) used in the dose finding example. I hope this helps getting some orientation on how to choose multiplicity adjustment. I think it is not so helpful to classify the research questions and decide upon that nominal classification. Rather think of the "sachverhalt", the related facts, and the intention of the analysis. What outcome would be an error depending on what?
