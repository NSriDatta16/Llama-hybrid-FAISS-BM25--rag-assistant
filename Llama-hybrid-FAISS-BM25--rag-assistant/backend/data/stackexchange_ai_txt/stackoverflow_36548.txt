IIRC you'll also have to configure a mail transfer agent (MTA) to use mail or most email libraries. Sendmail is the most well known but is a real pig when it comes to configuration. Exim , Qmail and Postfix are all popular alternatives that are a bit more modern. There are also more lightweight MTAs that are only able to send out mail, not receive it: nullmailer, mstmp, ssmtp, etc. Postfix is default for Ubuntu. This wiki article describes how to configure it - be sure to only allow forwarding from your local address!
