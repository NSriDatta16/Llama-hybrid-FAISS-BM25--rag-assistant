How to handle "unknown" category in machine learning classification problems?

Tutorial problems come in the form of binary or mult-class classification where data are all properly labelled. In real-life applications, there are incoming data that do not belong to any category and cannot be classified. How can we handle these data which fall into "unknown" category? The universe of "unknown" can be far more than "known". So, the data for "unknown" can be too much and lead to class imbalance. How do we train the model to deal with "unknown" data? Or do we ignore it?
