Google OpenID/federated login periodically fails

I'm developing a Django app that uses python-openid. The app is running on my development server at home. Similar to stackoverflow's login mechanism, I'd like users to login to my website using their Google credentials. The code I've implemented to do this, works well for a couple weeks, and then stops working. I get stuck during the login process on the following Google page: https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/ud with this message: "The page you requested is invalid." It'll randomly start working again, but fails every few weeks or so. Going through Yahoo's login worked for months, and today has stopped working with the following message: "This page has expired, go back to the original page and please try again" on this page: https://open.login.yahooapis.com/openid/op/auth Here is the request, as captured by LiveHttpHeaders for Google: https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/ud POST /accounts/o8/ud HTTP/1.1 Host: www.google.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042513 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.10 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/login/ Content-Length:907 openid.ax.if_available=ext1&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.ns=http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0&openid.realm=http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/&openid.return_to=http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/login/finish/?janrain_nonce=2009-10-05T19%3A10%3A11ZtioiRm&openid.ax.count.ext1=unlimited&openid.ax.mode=fetch_request&openid.sreg.optional=email&openid.claimed_id=http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0/identifier_select&openid.ns.sreg=http://openid.net/extensions/sreg/1.1&openid.ns.ax=http://openid.net/srv/ax/1.0&openid.identity=http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0/identifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=AOQobUcnzec0bpeZRztjqPrr5TQUA0aPL7SIuOPOMgWxex2HRAP09AyJ&openid.ax.required=ext0&openid.ax.type.ext0=http://schema.openid.net/namePerson&openid.ax.type.ext1=http://schema.openid.net/contact/web/default HTTP/1.x 400 Bad Request Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate I'm not sure what's going on here, and would love some help.
