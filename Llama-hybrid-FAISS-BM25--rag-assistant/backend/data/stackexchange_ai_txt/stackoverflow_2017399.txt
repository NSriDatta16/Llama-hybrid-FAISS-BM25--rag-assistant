Depends on whether or not the relationship (lets call it R) is symmetric. If so then person1, person2 is fine since R(person1, person2) = R(person2, person1). If they are not symmetric then the names should probably reflect an "agent and patient" relationship. So use a word to denote the agent and one to denote the patient, e.g. Befriender, Friend.
