Within an artificial neural network, a neuron is a mathematical function that model the functioning of a biological neuron. Typically, a neuron compute the weighted average of its input, and this sum is passed through a nonlinear function, often called activation function, such as the sigmoid. I attach an image from an AI course that illustrates it (note that in this particular case the weighted sum contains also a bias term). The output of the neuron can then be sent as input to the neurons of another layer, which could repeat the same computation (weighted sum of the input and transformation with activation function). Note that this computation correspond to multiplying a vector of input/activation states with a matrix of weights (and passing the resulting vector through the activation function). If you are interested in neural networks, not only from the engineering point of view but also in how these artificial neurons resemble real biological neurons, a classic book which could still be interesting is Parallel Distributed Processing by Rumelhart and McClelland
