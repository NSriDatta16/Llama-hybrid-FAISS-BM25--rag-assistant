You can just use a variable to keep it short, like this: echo ' var xmlSource = "source1.xml"; '; Use that in an if caluse as well, then just reference that in your code: url: xmlSource, There are other ways of course, using a cookie ( the cookie plugin ), putting the text right in the document.ready handler, etc...whichever seems most elegant to you I suppose. I recommend the variable from the PHP side or a cookie...both of these options allow the document.ready code to stay outside the page in an external script, and not downloaded by the user each time.
