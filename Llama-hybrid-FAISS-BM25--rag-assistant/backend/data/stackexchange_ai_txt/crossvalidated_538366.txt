Why mse decreases while cosine similarity fluctuates?

I am using deep neural networks to predict continuous variables, and I always get that: the mse of both the training and validation almost keeps decreasing smoothly; the cosine similarity between the prediction and label of the training increases smoothly; while, the cosine similarity between the prediction and label of the validation increases but with large fluctuation. I cannot figure out why point 3 happens, and I seldom find this phenomenon when using boosting tree methods.
