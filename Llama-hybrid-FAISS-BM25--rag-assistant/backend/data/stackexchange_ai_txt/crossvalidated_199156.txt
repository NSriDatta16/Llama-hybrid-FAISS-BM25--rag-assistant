Outlier similarity

I have a group of sensors where each sensor records 10 different binary data points which is then saved as an integer that can range from 0 to 2^10 - 1. To make sure that's clear, to put it another way each sensor takes 10 measurements and sets or clears the corresponding bit (1st measurement set/clear bit position 1, 2nd measurement set/clear bit position 2, etc) depending on the value that was measured. The records come at an interval of about every minute. I needed to do outlier analysis against the particular sensor and then against the whole group of sensors so to do that I used KMeans clustering and it works well. What I'd like to do now though is add a "similarity score" to show how much of an outlier a particular reading is again against that sensor and then against the group of sensors. For example, I'd like to be able to say something like that a particular reading is X% similar to the average of previous measurements. It seems like it should be easy but I guess my issue is just the format of the data. Each measurement is independent so I am working with just 1s and 0s of a particular bit position. Obviously I can easily count on and off values and then calculate their mean for the single sensor and then the group of sensors but then how do I take a single sensor reading of all 10 measurements at a given time and determine something like a similarity score? I'm not a statistician so I hope what I am asking for makes sense. Thanks.
