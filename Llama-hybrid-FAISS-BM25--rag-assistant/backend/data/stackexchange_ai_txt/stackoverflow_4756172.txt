Help to make a decision on which programming language

We're developing a system which can be best described as a layer above social networking. It's extremely data heavy, would involve a huge user base, data base would be beefy basically, but it wouldn't involve complex computations. The most complexity would involve fast retrieval of data. Now, we have programmers who're comfortable with JAVA as well as PHP. The front end is nailed - Javascript, HTML, CSS. But we're having a huge debate on what to go with for the back end. We consulted numerous blogs and forums and have a consensus on the pluses and minuses. To sum it up, people say that it's a pain to host Java but it's extremely scalable, whereas PHP is fast and easy to host, but not entirely OO or sturdy. We're still not able to reach a decision. For a system like ours, does it even matter what we go with? Because at the end, it's the performance boosters that matter.... or am I entirely wrong in thinking that? Any input will be appreciated. Thanks in advance!
