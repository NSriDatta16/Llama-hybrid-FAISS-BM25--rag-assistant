Magento e-Commerce cannot generate reports

Good day, My magento cannot generate reports from the admin panel. I get the following error: This report depends on timezone configuration. Once timezone is changed, the lifetime statistics need to be refreshed. Last updated: Oct 21, 2010 3:04:33 PM. To refresh last day's statistics, click here." I follow the instruction and refresh the statistics, still same problem. I confirmed the timezone is right and didn't change before... Please help.
