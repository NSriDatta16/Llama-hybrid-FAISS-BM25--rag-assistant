Any better way to handle legancy URLs in J2ee than URLRewrite

How should I handle large set of legacy urls and URL aliases in J2EE. I can't use wildcard mapping for the urls as they are provided by hand by the users of my application so there is no enforced url schema. If I use URLRewrite with every single URL as a separated mapping I'll get something that at least in a theory will be quite slow O(n). Should I create my own filter that will maintains the mapping as a dictionary so that I get O(log(n)) complexity? Or maybe the URLRewrite is smart enough to use a proper tree for urls that do not use wildcards?
