Make sure you're not running in debug mode, as that will certainly cause the toolbox to disappear and not support drag and drop. Also, the toolbox won't be there if you're not looking at a file type that supports it or have a project open. To show the toolbox in VS 2008 go to the View menu and select Toolbox or hit CTRL+Alt+X.
