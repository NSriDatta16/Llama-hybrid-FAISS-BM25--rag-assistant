My understanding is that chunked encoding can only be used in a HTTP response. A chunked request body would have the property of being incompatible with a 1.0 server, and in any case, there would be no way of a user-agent knowing that the server was a 1.0 server until it had already sent the request. But I agree it's unclear from the documentation.
