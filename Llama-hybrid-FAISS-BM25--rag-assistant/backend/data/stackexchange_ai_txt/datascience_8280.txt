I was thinking to calculate the average amount of money, say for the last ten transactions, and check how far is the next transaction amount from the average. This sounds like a good start. I'd look into Local Outlier Probabilities. For a given data point you could calculate the distance from n nearest neighbors and figure out if the data point under consideration is an outlier. basic overview can be found here I'd also consider the source, destination, volume and frequency of transactions as features.
