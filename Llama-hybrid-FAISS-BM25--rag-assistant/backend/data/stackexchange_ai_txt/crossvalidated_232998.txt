Traditional logistic regression requires that the response variable be zero or one (or an integer, in the case of binomial regression). If you somehow know the student's admission chance (how on earth do you know that?) then you need to use a different distribution, one which takes values on $[0,1]$ rather than $\{0,1\}$. The usual distribution to use in that case is a beta distribution, but there are others.
