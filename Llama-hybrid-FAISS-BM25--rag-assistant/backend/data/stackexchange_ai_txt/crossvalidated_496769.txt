Adding on to 5: The trick of transforming random variables to bits works for any independent pair of absolutely continuous random variables X and Y , even if X and Y are dependent on each other or the two variables are not identically distributed, as long as the two variables are statistically indifferent (Montes Gutiérrez 2014, De Schuymer et al. 2003); equivalently, their probabilistic index (Acion et al. 2006) is 1/2 or their net benefit is 0. This means in our case that P( X Y ) = P( X > Y ). In particular, two independent normal random variables X and Y are statistically indifferent if and only if they have the same mean (they remain so even if their standard deviations differ) (Montes Gutiérrez 2014). In this case, to generate unbiased random bits this way, sample an independent pair of statistically indifferent, absolutely continuous random variates, X and Y , and compare them. If X is less than Y , output 1; otherwise, output 0 (Morina et al. 2019). Because they are statistically indifferent, this method will output 1 or 0 with equal probability (see the appendix in my Note on Randomness Extraction ). (Note that statistical indifference also makes sense for discrete and singular random variables, but in this case an additional rejection step will be necessary if X and Y turn out to be equal [Morina et al. 2019].)
