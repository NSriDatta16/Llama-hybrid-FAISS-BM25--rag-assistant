Chi-squared test for continuous variables (averages)

I'm looking for a suitable statistical test for my situation. The best way to describe it is a "Chi-Squared test for continuous data". Please tell me otherwise. Here is a made-up scenario: Say we spend a few days observing whales and sharks in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Here are the counts in a contingency table: | |Atlantic |Indian |Total | |----------|---------|-------|------| | whales | 8 | 2 | 10 | | sharks | 1 | 5 | 6 | |----------|---------|-------|------| | Total: | 9 | 7 | 16 | Here I use the Chi-squared test to determine if the observations of whales/sharks are independent of ocean location. Let's consider another metric: the average weight of the animals. Here again, is the table: | |Atlantic |Indian |Avg. | |----------|---------|-------|------| | whales | 6.9 | 7.2 | 7.1 | | sharks | 2.3 | 2.9 | 2.5 | |----------|---------|-------|------| | Avg.: | 4.3 | 5.4 | 4.9 | Instead of total counts, I now have averages for the total of the populations along the side and last row. Here is my question: is the average weight of an animal independent of the ocean? Which test do I use now? Just as a side note, the population sizes of each category might be very uneven such as a ratio of 1:999. I appreciate your help in advance.
