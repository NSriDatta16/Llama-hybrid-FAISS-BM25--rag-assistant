When sharing an image with Intent.createChooser, my file disappears!

private void share() { Intent share = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND); share.setType("image/png"); share.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, Uri.parse("file://" + filename)); startActivity(Intent.createChooser(share, "Share Tag")); } I implemented this simple function to be called from a menu, yet after I call it, the file I shared completely disappears -- it's as if the share is deleting it off of my storage. Why is it doing this, and how do I stop it??
