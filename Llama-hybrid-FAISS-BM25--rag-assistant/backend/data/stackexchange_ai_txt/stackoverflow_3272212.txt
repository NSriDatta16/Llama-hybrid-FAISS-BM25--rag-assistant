What exactly is happening in your OS's TCP/IP stack (possibly in the python layers on top, but that's less likely) to cause this is a mystery. As a practical workaround, I'd set a timeout longer than the delays you expect between requests (10 seconds should be plenty if you expect a request every 2 seconds) and if one occurs, close and reopen. (Calibrate the delay needed to work around freezes without interrupting normal traffic by trial and error). Unpleasant to hack a fix w/o understanding the problem, I know, but being pragmatical about such things is a necessary survival trait in the world of writing, deploying and operating actual server systems. Be sure to comment the workaround accurately for future maintainers!
