This doesn't warrant for a warning or pragma. There are too many places where it is intended to discard the result, and I'd be quite annoyed getting a warning/error from the compiler just because the method was decorated with some dodge attribute. This kind of 'warning' should be annotated in the IDE's Editor, like a small icon on the gutter "Warning: Discarding return value" or similar.
