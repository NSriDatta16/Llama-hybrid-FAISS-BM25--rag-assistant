We see that pLSI describes a process for generating documents with topic distributions p(z | d) seen in a particular document in the collection as opposed to generating documents with arbitrary topic proportions from a prior probability distribution. This may not be crucial in information retrieval where the current document collection to be stored can be viewed as a ﬁxed collection. However, in applications such as text categorization, it is crucial to have a model ﬂexible enough to properly handle text that has not been seen before. Thus probability of documents in pLSI are points (one point - one document from your collection), while in LDA, there is full topic simplex to use (of course, after training you have dirichlet distribution), so there are no problems to take new document.
