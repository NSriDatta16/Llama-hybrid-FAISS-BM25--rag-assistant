That's an interesting question, I presume you are using the data from all the recorded online Dominion games. If so, you have enough data to do some very complex modeling. Here's something to think about: You probably can't identify a single card that's better in isolation from the rest of the 9 cards in the current set. You could take the set of other cards into account by multilevel modeling, where each set of 10 cards nests the "card of interest" variable. One way to do this would be to do logistic linear mixed modeling. If you only look at counts of wins for each 200 cards, you will ignore how the cards influence each other within the currently playable set of 10 cards. The very least you should do, as suggested by others, is a logistic regression.
