Positive lag-1 autocorrelation after differencing a stationary time series

In the following post it is trying to explain why the lag-1 autocorrelation is negative after first differencing a stationary time series. Why does differencing time-series introduce negative autocorrelation It argues that $\psi_j$ are decreasing and less than one. However, if we consider ARMA(1,1) with $\theta = 0.5$ and $\phi = 0.9$ , above claim violates and lag-1 auto correlation is not negative. Because $\psi_j = 1.4(0.9)^{j-1}$ for $j \geq 1$ . Does anyone know whether the explanation given in this post holds for specific cases? Edited: If $\{X_t\}$ is a mean zero stationary time series with autocovariance function $\gamma(h)$ . Let $Y_t = X_t - X_{t-1}$ . \begin{align*} Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-1}) & = Cov(X_t - X_{t-1}, X_{t-1} - X_{t-2})\\ & = \gamma(1) - \gamma(2) - \gamma(0) + \gamma(1)\\ & = -\gamma(0)[1 - 2\rho(1) + \rho(2)]. \end{align*} Variance of $Y_t$ : \begin{align*} Var(Y_t) & = 2[\gamma(0) - \gamma(1)]\\ &= 2\gamma(0)[1 - \rho(1)] \end{align*} where $\rho(h) = \frac{\gamma(h)}{\gamma(0)}$ . Then autocorrelation function of $Y_t$ is \begin{align*} Corr(Y_t, Y_{t-1}) &= \frac{Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-1})}{\sqrt{Var(Y_t)Var(Y_{t-1})}}\\ & = -\frac{1 - 2\rho(1) + \rho(2)}{2(1 - \rho(1))}. \end{align*} \begin{align*} -\rho(1) & So, I think it is not always the case that the lag-1 autocorrelation of the differenced series is negative. But, if it is negative it can't exceed -0.5, which sometimes used to identify over-differenced series. Any feedback about this procedure?
