Getting the slack variables from an SVM with SKlearn

A support vector machine learned on non-linearly separable data learns a slack variable for each datapoint. Is there any way to train the SKlearn implementation of SVM , and then get the slack variable for each datapoint from this? I am asking in order to implement dSVM+, as described here . This involves training an SVM and then using the slack variables as a 'deviation value', used as privileged information when training an SVM+.
