I think the only way to implement this is the hard way... by measuring the amount of data that has been sent/received on each socket in the last (so many) seconds, and holding off on sending/receiving more data until enough time has passed to limit the total average bandwidth to what you want it to be. I've implemented this logic using non-blocking sockets and select(), and it's doable (albeit not easy).
