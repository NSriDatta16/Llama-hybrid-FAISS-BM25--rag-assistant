PCA on accounting data

I'm working with a large dataset of accounting data along with business characterization data across 20 years. I would like to use PCA to reduce the variables' dimension (currently I have about 60 variables and 133k individuals) in order to eventually highlight interesting links between the variables and between business types. I have several questions before diving into it: a lot of accounting variables are correlated by construction. Can it be an issue in terms of applicability or interpretability? the dataset gathers data from highly different types of business (this information is held by the business-characteristic kind of variables and I also have some knowledge on this). Therefore, could it hide "intra type of business variability"? And could it be an idea to run multiple "intra PCA" with only individuals belonging to the same category of business? should I account for the temporal character of the data? Hoping it is not too vague and might be answered. Thanks a lot.
