Calculate effects on survival time from Cox proportional hazard model?

Novice stats question here: When I run a cox model over daily survival data as a function of 3 covariates, the results: Fixed coefficients coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p var1 -0.02306065 0.9772032 0.004961884 -4.65 3.4e-06 var2 -0.11755938 0.8890877 0.007519678 -15.63 0.0e+00 var3 0.01145542 1.0115213 0.032680554 0.35 7.3e-01 show that var1 and var2 increase survival time and the effects are statistically significant. I further interpret this to mean that an additional unit increase in var1 reduces the daily hazard by a factor of 0.977 on average -- that is, by 2.3 percent. Similarly, each unit increase in var2 reduces the hazard by a factor of 0.889, or 11.1 percent. My question is: can I convert these interpretations into something like each unit increase in var1 increases mean survival time by n days on average, or each unit increase in var2 increases the probability that survival will exceed 2 days by p% ?
