What hobbyist developer should do: (I am not an expert; I have listed down all my thoughts. Please correct me, If I am wrong) Need to learn the language(C, C++, or Java) thoroughly. Many of us fascinated towards computers and programming and we started learning and building pieces of software for fun. Many book you can find on amazon.com about best practices. One can go through that. Learn concepts like OOPs, Design Patterns, UML. Before all these, one should ask "why" for every answers. Which will help you understand, best ways of modeling the system. Many C programmers when moved to C++, they uses Class like a container for storing all there variable and methods. So how to create a class, why I have to create an abstract class. So "Why" is useful. Pick up core concepts, like Operating system, Computer organization, Computer Architecture, Algorithms, software engineering etc. Most of us are just programmers (designation says "Software engineer"). We all know how to code and get the working solution. Beyond this, most of us don't know anything about computers. Because, many programmers are from different streams of engineering. Learned these programming concepts and started building applications and joined as software engineers in some company. But we (other stream) never learnt these concepts. So need to pick up these concepts which will help in understanding and coding better. Participating in conferences (like Microsoft TechEd), which helps understanding the upcoming technologies. Writing the blog about the best practices, your findings, new concepts, work around solutions. Blog will act like a discussion book, where visitor will tell their views, which will help you understanding the concepts better. Subscribing to RSS from blogs. This is really helpful. Amazon.com. I found amazon.com is really helpful in picking up the right book for learning new concepts. user reviews and also check for list of books.
