Best (scala & other languages that target java vm) optimizations

I was just reading about scala's implementation of generics specialization , and it really caught my attention the increase of speed they achieved with this feature. I was wondering what other features have the languages that target the java vm implemented that actually made them perform better than java? I know that the further the generated code moves away from java, the further its performance drops. So I really wonder what other features can a language implement to achieve better performance in java. Please don't answer this question talking about scala's really nice features on top of java, I'm talking strictly about performance. Also if you have suggestions that still weren't implemented, please do answer! Thank you!
