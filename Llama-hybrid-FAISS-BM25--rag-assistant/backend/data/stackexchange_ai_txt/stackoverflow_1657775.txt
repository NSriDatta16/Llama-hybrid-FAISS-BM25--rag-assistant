Not exactly what you are looking for, but you might be interested in checking out jSecurity . It is a well thought out security framework that handles authentication, authorization, and fine-grained permissions. But from what I can gather, much like Spring Security , they try not to make assumptions about how this data is stored and organized. (I haven't found, for example, a reference implementation for User, Roles, Permissions, etc. in a database.) Note that the JSecurity project has permanently moved to the Apache Software Foundation and is now known as the Apache Shiro project.
