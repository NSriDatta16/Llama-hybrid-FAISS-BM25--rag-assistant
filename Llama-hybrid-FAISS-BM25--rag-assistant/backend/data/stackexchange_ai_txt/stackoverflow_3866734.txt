I thought I'd share a situation where my team decided to include .c files. Our archicture largely consists of modules that are decoupled through a message system. These message handlers are public, and call many local static worker functions to do their work. The problem came about when trying to get coverage for our unit test cases, as the only way to exercise this private implementation code was indirectly through the public message interface. With some worker functions knee-deep in the stack, this turned out to be a nightmare to achieve proper coverage. Including the .c files gave us a way to reach the cog in the machine we were interesting in testing.
