Passing extra data to find_or_create

Something I've always wondered about rails is the ability to pass extra data to find_or_create methods in rails. For example, I can't do the following User.find_or_create_by_name('ceilingfish', :email => 'an_email@a.domain', :legs => true, :face => false) I could do u = User.find_or_create_by_name('ceilingfish') u.update_attributes(:email => 'an_email@a.domain', :legs => true, :face => false) But that's uglier, and also requires three queries. I suppose I could do User.find_or_create_by_name_and_email_and_face_and_legs('ceilingfish','an_email@a.domain',true, false) But that kind of implies that I know what the values of email , legs and face are. Does anyone know if there's a really elegant way of doing this?
