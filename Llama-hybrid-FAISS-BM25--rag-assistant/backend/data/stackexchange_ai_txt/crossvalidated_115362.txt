Theoretical insight, institutional knowledge, and good research in the field should be your guide about what $X$s to match on. There is no deterministic variable selection procedure that will tell you which variables to choose. Here are some general guidelines. The Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA) will be satisfied if $X$ includes all of the variables that affect both (not either, but both) participation and outcomes. Including $X$s affected by the treatment, either ex post or ex ante in anticipation of treatment, will invalidate the assumption. For example, if an agent knows that the vaccine is coming, he may adjust his pre-shot behavior. Including instruments – variables that affect participation and not outcomes – is also a bad idea. They will not help with selection bias and may worsen the support problem drastically. For example, if some people are encouraged to take up treatment, you don't want to condition on that. The inclusion of irrelevant variables in the propensity score specification can increase the variance since either some treated have to be discarded from the analysis or control units have to be used more than once or because the bandwidth has to increase. In short, the kitchen sink approach is definitely not recommended. The CIA cannot be tested without experimental data or "over-identifying" assumptions (as in the case of the pre-program test or other false placebo tests). If you have enough historical data, I would definitely try the latter on your carefully curated set. Response to edit: I can't comment on the kidneys since that is too far outside my area (other than pies, which I know something about). Urban seems like a variable that affects both participation and outcome through the costs associated with travel to the hospital for treatment and examination. It might pick up some of the unobservables that keep us up at night. The anticipation story I have in mind is that people may adjust their behavior if they know they will be treated in the future, for example by changing their diets.
