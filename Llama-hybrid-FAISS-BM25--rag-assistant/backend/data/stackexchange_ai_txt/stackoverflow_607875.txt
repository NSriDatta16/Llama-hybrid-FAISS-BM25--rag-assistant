I prefer to keep things as simple as possible. Each project I work on operates out of its own directory. I keep a sub-directory called "source" that contains ALL project related artifacts - documents, PSDs, zips, you name it. I'll organize it organically over time as warranted, rather than trying to map out a complex directory structure ahead of time - usually only bits and pieces get used so I end up confusing myself if I take that approach. Since I do my development work on OS X, a quick Spotlight search gets me the exact file I need pretty quickly without having to slog through lots of files. Google Desktop search offers similar functionality on a PC.
