Are there any practical advantages of LSTMs over transformers?

There are a number of articles noting that transformers have significant advantages over "traditional" RNNs like LSTMs. And the industry as a whole have been moving away from LSTMs. My question is, in the domain of NLP, do LSTMs (or GRUs) have any practical benefits/advantages over transformers?
