Are neural network a viable way to determine the outcome of sport events? (Annual awards)

I am currently working on a binary regression network that would try to predict the annual awards of a sport league. (The NBA namely) I have done some testing and I am quite discouraged by the data I have gathered. I cannot even get good results on the training set and I wonder it its because of the problem itself or I have some bug in my code. (I do not use ML libraries/frameworks) So the way I imagined it would go is that I construct a network with multiple hidden layers and quite a lot of nodes in them so it could seperate the cases. The output layer contains a single node (with Sigmoid but I have been trying out different activation functions in every layer) and the error function is a Binary Cross-Entropy function. The features include traditional statistics like points per game, rebound, assist etc. I believe I have about 16 of them. Now, I have different training sets, divided by the season. That is about 200 players in one season. Only one of those have a label of 1, all the others have 0s. Would this problem be too complicated for an ordinary NN? Is it a problem that there is such a big difference in the number of passes and fails? Maybe too many features? (P.s I haven't tested my code on basic, more conventional problems, the XOR and other more complicated classifcation problems worked but I have not done any regressin yet.)
