Accuracy is 100% but model.predict is totaly wrong! what could be the problem? (Autoencoder NN)

Its an Autoencoder model that receive 4 different vectors { (1,0,0,0) , (0,1,0,0) , (0,0,1,0) , (0,0,0,1) } The encoder transforms the vectors to vectors size 2, which get inside an "NLPN channel" which is a channel with nonlinear phase noise, and then goes to the decoder that reconstructs the original vector. Architecture: 4->50->2->NLPN->2->50->4(Sotmax) The loss function is mse between the input, and the input ( self.model.fit(self.x, self.x) ) The code is pretty basic: the first cell is just some simple functions defined, then its the autoencoder class, then its the training, and then its the prediction which shows that for each vector 1,0,0,0 and so on, the decoder predict (~0.25,~0.25,~0.25,~0.25) which shows that the NN has no idea what it's doing CODE: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nFymmEloUSa1yjS7e5CPGsKwqP1HjS57?usp=sharing
