I had the same question recently and bump into the nice notebook here https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/interactive-intro-to-dimensionality-reduction In general, the idea is to run your dimensionality reductions, transform data and visualize to see if it is now possible to create clusters on it (like in your case). You can see than using for example PCA and its principal components how realistic is to use them to cluster the data. Here you are definitely limited by the amount of axes. Alternatively, one can think about the reconstruction of the data (from Hands-on book from GÃ©ron) X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X_train) X_recovered = pca.inverse_transform(X_reduced) And calculate the mean squared distance between the original data and the reconstructed data. In this case the error shows not the best DR technique but what technique reduces dimensions more accurately and/or makes it possible to recover the original data set. It might be useful in some cases as well
