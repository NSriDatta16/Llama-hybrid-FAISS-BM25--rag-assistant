I would suggest using the Chow Test for constancy of parameters. Construct an appropriate (common) XARMAX model for each stage and 1 globally (collectively). Generate the F value which tests the equivalence of the model parameters. If you don't have time series your model would be a simple OLS. if however you have time series data and I guess you do then identifying and constructing the XARMAX model night require software like SAS/SPSS or AUTOBOX (which I am involved with).
