Its just a matter of reading the headers ( How do I read any request header in PHP ) and parsing / interpreting this to read the "user-agent", you may be able to find an existing PHP script or maybe just plain regex that will help in figuring out which user-agents are mobile and which are regular pc's / laptops. There are a lot of different headers, as it indicates the operating system, so as many different mobile OS'es as there are there would be user-agent headers so the script needs to have a list of all valid ones. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_user_agents_for_mobile_phones
