If the version of your application changes (I am uncertain exactly which version number it is) then new deployment creates a new folder for storage. There are 2 ways in which isolated storage stores the data: Isolation by user and assembly Isolation by user, domain and assembly In both cases, when the assembly changes the directory changes. I do not know what the best way to keep the data between deployments is, but that is the reasoning for it.
