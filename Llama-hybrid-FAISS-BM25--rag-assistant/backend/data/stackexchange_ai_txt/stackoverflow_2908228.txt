VB.NET - DirectX.AudioVideoPlayback gives incorrect frame size?

Hey, making a media player and need to know something. I have a menu which reads file info, but for some reason, when I open a video that I KNOW is 1280x720, the width and height come up as 1292x758. Edit: When I open a video which is 640x480, it says it's 656x518 That, and an extra preview box pops up due to: labFR.Text = "Frame rate: " & Strings.FormatNumber((1 / AudioVideoPlayback.Video.FromFile(labinput.text, True).AverageTimePerFrame), 3) This needs to be playing so I can get the frame rate, but how to I close it once I have the frame rate? Working in VB.NET Framework 4.0. (VS2010) Answers to either of these problems are highly appreciated.
