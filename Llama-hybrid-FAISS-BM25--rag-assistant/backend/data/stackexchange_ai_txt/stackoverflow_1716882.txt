ASP.net style sheet + postion of web controls

I am a novice at website building. I downloaded a free css from a website and applied it to my project. Here's a screen shot http://www.csstemplatesweb.com/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/product_images/get_educated_scr.jpg . I dragged and dropped some ASP web controls(buttons and labels) on the page(using absolute positioning) from the toolbox. Now I want to my web controls to stay within the text area of the template(the area with the pic of guys wid a laptop) and not float away on resizing and when I run the web page on different resolutions. Please help me.
