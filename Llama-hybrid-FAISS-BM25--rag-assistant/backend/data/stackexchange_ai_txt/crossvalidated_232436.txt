The OP is correct -- median is not linear since additivity does not hold, but homogeneity of degree $1$ holds. Additivity does not hold We show by counterexample that the additivity does not hold: let $x=(0,1,2)$ and $y=(2,0,0)$ and let $f$ be the mapping from a vector to the median of its elements. Now, $f(x)=1,~f(y)=0$, so, \begin{equation} f(x+y) = f((2,1,2)) = 2 \neq 1 = f(x) + f(y). \end{equation} Homogeneity of degree 1 holds The homogeneity of degree $1$ indeed holds as postulated in the answer:multiplying by a scalar does not change the order (except by reversing it if the scalar is negative, but this does not change who is in the middle), so if the median of $x$ is $x_i$, then also the median of $a\,x$ is $a\,x_i$. For even number of elements, the reasoning works if the median is defined to be the average of the two middle elements.
