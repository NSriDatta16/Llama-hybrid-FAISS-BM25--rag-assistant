Chart controls for ASP.NET

I am looking people's opinion and experience on using chart controls within an ASP.NET application (web forms or MVC) primarily but also in any kind of project. I am currently doing my research and I have a pretty big list of controls to evaluate. My list includes (in no particular order): ASP.NET controls: DevExpress XtraCharts ( http://demos.devexpress.com/XtraChartsDemos/ ) Dundas Chart for .NET ( http://www.dundas.com/ ) Telerik RadChart for ASP.NET AJAX ( http://www.telerik.com/ ) ComponentArt Charting & Visualization for ASP.NET ( http://www.componentart.com/ ) Infragistics WebChart ( http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/aspnet.aspx#Overview ) .net Charting ( http://www.dotnetcharting.com/ ) Chart Control for .Net Framework (Microsoft's) ( http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/24/new-asp-net-charting-control-lt-asp-chart-runat-quot-server-quot-gt.aspx ) Flash controls: FusionCharts v3 ( http://www.fusioncharts.com/ ) XML/SWF Charts ( http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/index.php ) amCharts ( http://www.amcharts.com/ ) AnyChart ( http://www.anychart.com/home/ ) Javascript: Flot ( http://code.google.com/p/flot/ ) Flotr ( http://solutoire.com/flotr/ ) jqPlot ( http://www.jqplot.com/index.php ) (If I missed some that worth to be compared against the above please let me know.) What I am looking is opinions on using any of the above so I can form my own and help others do the same, based on what I read here. I do not care which one is better. What I care for is why someone likes one of the above and what do these controls offer as a distinct advantage. I am interested in developer's opinion and I would like to find out which things are difficult doing with any of the above controls and which things are easy to achieve. AJAX compatibility (build in to the controls but also manual), ASP.NET compatibility, input capabilities, data binding options, performance, how much code does one need to write in order to create a chart, are some of the things that I would want to read about. I have already done my research on StackOverflow for relevant questions but there is nothing on the level of detail that I would want to read in order to make a responsible decision.
