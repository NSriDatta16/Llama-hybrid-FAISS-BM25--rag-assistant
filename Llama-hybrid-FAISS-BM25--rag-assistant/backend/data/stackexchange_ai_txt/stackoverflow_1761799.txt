How do I refresh/reload a Chrome Extension?

I'm developing an extension in Chrome 4 (currently 4.0.249.0) that will show the user's StackOverflow/SuperUser/ServerFault reputation in the status bar. I've designed an options page to get the user's profile IDs and I save them to localStorage and read them well in the extension. It all works great. The problem is I cannot find a (programmatic) way to refresh the extension upon options saving. I tried calling location.reload(); from the extension page itself upon right clicking it - to no avail. I pursued it further and tried looking at what Chrome's chrome://extensions/ page does to reload an extension, and found this code: /** * Handles a 'reload' button getting clicked. */ function handleReloadExtension(node) { // Tell the C++ ExtensionDOMHandler to reload the extension. chrome.send('reload', [node.extensionId]); } Copying this code to my event handler did not help (and yes, I tried replacing [node.extensionId] with the actual code). Can someone please assist me in doing this the right way, or pointing me at a code of an extension that does this correctly? Once done, I'll put the extension and its source up on my blog.
