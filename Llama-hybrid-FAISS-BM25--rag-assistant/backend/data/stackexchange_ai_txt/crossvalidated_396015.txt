This issue for interpreting a confidence interval in that manner is more that the frequentist statistical theory says the true parameter value is constant so a randomly generated interval will either contain or exclude that fixed parameter value (slightly different look than yours). If you want to make that kind of probability statement, a Bayesian credible interval will allow for it because it allows parameters to be random variables and via the incorporation of prior information and current information you can make a probability statement about an interval containing a parameter which is a random variable (contrary to a fixed value of a parameter). The coin question depends on the definition of probability for whoever you ask.
