iPhone & iAd: do I need to integrate this programmatically?

it looks like the library in the interface builder has an iAd I can drag into my .xib file. But this doesn't seem to be the right way since I'm weak linking the iAd framework and potentially devices that don't have iOS 4.0 won't work. Therefore, I need to add the banner programmatically (i.e., NOT use the interface builder), correct?
