Android Tabs Layout

I have an Tab Activity with 4 tabs. Each of tab is showing me the list view. Suppose i m on 4th tab and dragged the list view to the last position and after that i click on 3rd tab and again when i go to 4th tab it is not refreshing and showing me the last visible screen. Actually i want to show the list view again from 1st element. is tabs refresh automatically or we need to do it programmatic?? pls help me..
