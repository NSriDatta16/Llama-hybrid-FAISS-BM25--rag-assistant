I learned Scala by writing a suite of tests for my Java-based application. I used ScalaTest, and found it easy. I understand that ScalaTest offers a greater range of testing styles, including the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style employed by Specs. The greater scope of ScalaTest appealed to me because different styles lend themselves to different types of testing; for example, BDD is commonly used for unit testing, whereas the FeatureSpec style would be more appropriate for integration or acceptance testing. Another consideration is support. Although I cannot speak for the Specs community, I can report that support from the author of ScalaTest has been quick, encouraging, and very useful.
