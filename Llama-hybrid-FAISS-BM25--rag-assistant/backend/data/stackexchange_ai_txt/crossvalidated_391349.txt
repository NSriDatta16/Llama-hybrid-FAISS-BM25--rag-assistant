I refer the book Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (MÃ¼ller and Guido) translated from French : "The neural networks are expecting all features to vary/change in a similar way, ideally a mean of 0 and a variance of 1". So I do not think to use a discretisation is a good idea, so to avoid bins feature or one-hot encoding is wise I guess.
