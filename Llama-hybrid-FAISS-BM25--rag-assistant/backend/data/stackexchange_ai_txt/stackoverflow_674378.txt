how to make acts_as_list behave with groupings

I have a small rails app that is using acts_as_list to implement drag and drop via ajax. The app has 3 main models: forms, sections, and questions. As it is designed, forms have many sections, and sections have many questions. I want a user to be able to do 3 things: reorder the sections in forms reorder the questions in the sections dnd a question into a different section as well. I have a setup that can handle #1 and #2, but I am having problems with #3. You'll find the view snippet below. Any ideas on where to start with #3? "> " style="cursor: move"> ">
