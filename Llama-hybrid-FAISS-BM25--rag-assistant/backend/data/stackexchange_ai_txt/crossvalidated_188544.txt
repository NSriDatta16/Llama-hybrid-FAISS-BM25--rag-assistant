what I know is ADF and KPSS are used for the same thing, is the time series is stationary or non-stationary but they have opposite null hypothesis statement. in the case of ADF null hypothesis is the time series is non-stationary and in KPSS the null hypothesis is that the time series is stationary. but sometimes it may happen that they give different result in that situation it's best to see some other perspective of the given time series. hope this clears your doubt
