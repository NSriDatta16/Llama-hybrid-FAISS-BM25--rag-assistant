UIview hittest problem?

I am using in one parentview - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event to findout hit when the user touches the view.it works fine.it returns childview correctly.I move those views in the parent view.but I added UIGestureRecogniser to the subview for dragging inside subview .but when i drag inside the subview , it takes hitTest Method and it moves...the dragging event is not fired...any help please?
