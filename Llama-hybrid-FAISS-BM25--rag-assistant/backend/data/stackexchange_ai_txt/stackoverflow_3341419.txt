It seems to me you can get the same result if you just transform the data first, then pass it to the plot method. For instance (time series data in months binned by year): data(AirPassengers) # time series in months (supplied w/ default R install) AP = AirPassengers library(xts) X = as.xts(AP) # need xts object to pass to xts binning method ndx = endpoints(X, on="years") # binning method requires indices for desired bin freq X_yr = period.apply(x=X, INDEX=ndx, FUN=sum) # X_yr is the binned data
