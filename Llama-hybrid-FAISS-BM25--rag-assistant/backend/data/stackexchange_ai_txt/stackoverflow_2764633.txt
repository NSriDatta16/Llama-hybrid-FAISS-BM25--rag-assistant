Your code would fail if self.turnnow is an empty tuple: >>> var = () >>> print "%s" % (var) Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 2, in TypeError: not enough arguments for format string >>> print "%s" % (var,) () This is because a parenthesized expression in Python does not automatically become a tuple if the tuple would have only one element. (expr) is equivalent to expr . (expr, ) is equivalent to a one-element tuple holding expr as the first element. So, try adding a comma after self.turnnow in the second print statement.
