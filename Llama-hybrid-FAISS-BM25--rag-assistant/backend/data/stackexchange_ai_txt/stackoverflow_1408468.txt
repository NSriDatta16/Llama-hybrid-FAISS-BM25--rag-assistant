You'll probably want something like subversion even if you're working by yourself so that you have a history of all your changes. You might want to see what a piece of code looked like once upon a time to remember why you made a change. Having source control is also useful when you check in often. If you check in often, you'll always be in a state to roll back often too. Many times you could start going down one path to solve a problem and then realise it was the wrong path to go. Many times you could just keep barking down the wrong path and end up building a terrible solution - only because you didn't want to lose all your work. By checking in often, the last point of "happiness" is not far away so even if you go down the wrong path you can always roll back and try again and make a more elegant and simple solution. Which is always a good thing so you can understand and maintain what you wrote in the future.
