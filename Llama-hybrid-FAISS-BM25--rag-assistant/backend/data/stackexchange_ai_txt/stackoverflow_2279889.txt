Is there a API from Flex/Flash to list all the UIComponent?

I am trying to create an API utility using Adobe AIR where given a component name it should list all it methods, variables, and other properties of that component. But I could not find an API to list all the UIComponents of Flex/Flash. is there an API to lookup all the UIComponent or if there is no such API, can anyone tell me how do i lookup the components? Note: I have tried using flash.utils.describeType() but it is not able to suit my requirement as the input to the method is passed dynamically using TextInput. ~Jegan
