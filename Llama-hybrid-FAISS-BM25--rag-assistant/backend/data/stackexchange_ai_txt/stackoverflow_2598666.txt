format string (postcode) in ruby

I need to re-format a list of UK postcodes and have started with the following to strip whitespace and capitalize: postcode.upcase.gsub(/\s/,'') I now need to change the postcode so the new postcode will be in a format that will match the following regexp: ^([A-PR-UWYZ0-9][A-HK-Y0-9][AEHMNPRTVXY0-9]?[ABEHMNPRVWXY0-9]? {1,2}[0-9][ABD-HJLN-UW-Z]{2}|GIR 0AA)$ I would be grateful of any assistance.
