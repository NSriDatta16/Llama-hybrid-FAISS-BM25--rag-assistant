How to best handle the storage of historical data?

I'm trying to determine how I should store historical transactional data. Should I store it in a single table where the record just gets reinserted with a new timestamp each time? Should I break out the historical data into a separate 'history' table and only keep current data in the 'active' table. If so, how do I best do that? With a trigger that automatically copies the data to the history table? Or with logic in my application? Update per Welbog's comment: There will be large amounts of historical data (hundreds of thousands of rows - eventually potentially millions) Primarily searches and reporting operations will be run on the historical data. Performance is a concern. The searches shouldn't have to run all night to produce results.
