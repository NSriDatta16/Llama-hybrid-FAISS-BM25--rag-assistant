How can I prove bottleneck layer of my CNN auto encoder contain useful information?

I am using CNN autoencoder to create a state representation layer which I will later be feed into my Reinforcement Agent. So I trained my CNN autoencoder and it is giving nice state representations. But I have following questions, Can my autoencoder layer be overfitted If there's a overfit will it cause rubish information in my bottleneck layer?
