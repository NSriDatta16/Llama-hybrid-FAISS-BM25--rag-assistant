As you stated, in some ways, the Bayesian inference solves your problem. However, it has to be considered that, roughly speaking, the less data, the more the priors speak. So in the presence of very little data, the prior distributions would have more influence, and consequently your inference can be highly conditioned by the choice of prior. In that sense, the Bayesian inference does not (always) solve your problem. Note that this property is not related to MCMC but to Bayesian inference.
