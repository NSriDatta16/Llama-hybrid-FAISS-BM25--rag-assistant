Unstructured data not template based to structured data

I am working on a project where my goal is to extract data from a large diversity of pdf that does not follow a template (i.e unstructured data not template based). My ORC part works well and now I am trying to extract data from the raw text. During my research I have mainly seen data extraction from unstructured template based data. The only things I see for now that could work, would be to use a regex, for example, to find a date, however, I don't really know what the date is related to, or to use NER, but I don't really see how to start. I am not limited to NLP. I can also use computer vision on the pdf or other methods. example of input: example of output: { date : "27/06/2019", place : "saint-paul", patient-name : Liliane marie SUZANNE" patient-birthdate : "14/08/1957", doctor : "METE", type : "radiologie du thorax", ... } Any informations or solutions is welcome.
