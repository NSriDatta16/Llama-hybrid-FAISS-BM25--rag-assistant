This problem can be modeled with a standard binary classification since you labeled data. Time can be considered a feature which can be encoded relative to outcome date. Random forest would be a good algorithm to try. You need to rearrange the data to be tidy data where each LEAD_ID is in a single with row with all features for that id in the same row.
