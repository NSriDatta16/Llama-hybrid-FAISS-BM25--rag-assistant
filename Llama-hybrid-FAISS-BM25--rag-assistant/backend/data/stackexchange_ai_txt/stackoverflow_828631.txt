upgrade to C# 3.5 and use a Add->New Item->Linq to Sql Class... by far the easiest way i've ever seen, you can just drag from server explorer the tables you want... otherwise... it's much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down, As previous poster i'd recommend SqlConnection and SqlDataReader, etc. Before .NET 3.5 we had an ancient helper method that simply did something like the following DataAccessLayer dal = new DataAccessLayer("Connection String"); SQLDataReader sr = dal.getDataReader("SQLCOMMANDSTRING"); sr.Close(); dal.runProcess("SQLCOMMANDSTRING"); etc.. for some specifics on how to use the SQL objects check the following: http://www.developerfusion.com/article/4278/using-adonet-with-sql-server/2/
