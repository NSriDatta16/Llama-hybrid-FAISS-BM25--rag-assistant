This is a common issue with incorporating economic data, they just aren't collected very often! Basically, you have two choices: Some time series models will let you forecast at higher frequencies than they were trained on, i.e. fit a model to monthly data then forecast daily prices. Fill in the blanks to bring all of your data into the same timeframe. There are nice na.approx and na.locf methods in the zoo package for this. The indicator trick can work well here too. A not-very-basic third option is solve the open research of question of the correct multiple timeframe model for incorporating macro-economic data into fundamental stock price models. As a hint, try tree models like random forests.
