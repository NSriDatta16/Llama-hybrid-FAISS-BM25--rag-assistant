ASP.NET/MVC with HTML 5 local storage key/value pair

We are developing several asp.net MVC applications that need to exist in both a connected/disconnected state. Out of the several connection strategies available (Google Gears, Microsoft Sync, etc) we decided on HTML 5 w/ local storage utilizing javascript key/value pair. Ensuring the disconnected state is functional in Internet Explorer is a high priority. Does anyone know of resources available online or otherwise to help us in this endevour? For example, one excellent resource we have found http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2011/01/12/asp-net-and-html5-local-storage.aspx
