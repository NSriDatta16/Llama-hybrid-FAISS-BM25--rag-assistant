Time series training data lag

Assume we have data for two years, 2021 and 2022. When training, we use 2021 data to predict 2022 outcomes, resulting in model 1. Now during inference, we use 2022 data to predict 2023 results. Assuming the trend changes in 2022 and we have few months of data in 2023, is it possible to make model1 more accurate? A plausible method is to retrain model using the combined data from 2021, 2022, and the available months in 2023; however, this will not work because we need to use 2022 as target variable (which make 2022 unusable)
