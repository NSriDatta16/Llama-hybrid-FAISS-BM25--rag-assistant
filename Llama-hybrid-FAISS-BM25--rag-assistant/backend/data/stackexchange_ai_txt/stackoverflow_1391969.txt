Best answer is: don't. The "Mac Way" is to provide just a .app that the user can drag into /Applications or ~/Applications. The .app is really a directory that contains all the program's assets: code, properties, imagery, etc. The only time you need to build an installer package is when you're modifying the system. In the Mac world, that's seldom the right answer.
