Have a look at the Touches sample project . Specifically these methods could help you: // scale and rotation transforms are applied relative to the layer's anchor point // this method moves a gesture recognizer's view's anchor point between the user's fingers - (void)adjustAnchorPointForGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { if (gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) { UIView *piece = gestureRecognizer.view; CGPoint locationInView = [gestureRecognizer locationInView:piece]; CGPoint locationInSuperview = [gestureRecognizer locationInView:piece.superview]; piece.layer.anchorPoint = CGPointMake(locationInView.x / piece.bounds.size.width, locationInView.y / piece.bounds.size.height); piece.center = locationInSuperview; } } // scale the piece by the current scale // reset the gesture recognizer's rotation to 0 after applying so the next callback is a delta from the current scale - (void)scalePiece:(UIPinchGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { [self adjustAnchorPointForGestureRecognizer:gestureRecognizer]; if ([gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan || [gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { [gestureRecognizer view].transform = CGAffineTransformScale([[gestureRecognizer view] transform], [gestureRecognizer scale], [gestureRecognizer scale]); [gestureRecognizer setScale:1]; } }
