MySQL queries - how expensive are they really?

I've heard that mysql queries are very expensive, and that you should avoid at all costs making too many of them. I'm developing a site that will be used by quite a few people, and I'm wondering: How expensive are mysql queries actually? If I have 400,000 people in my database, how expensive is it to query it for one of them? How close attention do I need to pay that I don't make too many queries per client request? Edit: TomTom couldn't be more correct with his answer. According to perormance tests on the sites linked to in the comments (and a couple sites I found through a "mysql queries per second" search), I won't be encountering problems for quite a while - mysql can do thousands of queries per second with a remote server.
