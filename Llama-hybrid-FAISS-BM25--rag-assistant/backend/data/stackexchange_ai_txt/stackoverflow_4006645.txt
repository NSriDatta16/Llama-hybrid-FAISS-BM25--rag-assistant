ORM or straight SQL?

Possible Duplicate: Using an ORM or plain SQL? Would you elect to use an ORM or some kind of home spun DAL? And why? The advantages of an ORM seem obvious - better structure / organization, better language fit etc. But I worry about performance issues. Anyone have war stories to share? Any insights on not so obvious risks or rewards would be much appreciated.
