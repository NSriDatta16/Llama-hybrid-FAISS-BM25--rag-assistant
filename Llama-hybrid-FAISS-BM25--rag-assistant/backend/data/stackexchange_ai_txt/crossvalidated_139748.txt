I have limited experience on multi-class but I usually (try to) test both methods. The problem is that most implementations only implement one alternative ( libsvm based implement one-vs-one) so you have to implement the other "by hand" (that is create an outer loop that call the binary SVM with the appropriate classes) which is not something you always have time to do. Also there is a problem with this approach - the one-vs-one approach in libsvm use the same $\gamma$ and C for all pairwise SVM, so "to be fair" you need to do the same with your implementation of one-vs-all done by hand or you also implement the one-vs-one by hand.
