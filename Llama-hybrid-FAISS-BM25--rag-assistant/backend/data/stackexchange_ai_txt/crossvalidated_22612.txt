Your research question is a bit vaguely defined at the moment. You will certainly need to decide if and how you are going to control for the length of conversations. Also, what is the point of knowing that speakers use different amounts of codeswitching? Is this of interest because there are different characteristics of speakers you want to associate with codeswitching; or are you just trying to get a feel for the range of codeswitching behaviour? In any event, it becomes an interesting and non-trivial problem. Whatever your question, it seems unlikely that a single test will give you a useful answer; unless you just want to demonstrate that not all speakers codeswitch the same amount (which would seem to me to be a relatively trivial finding). Pasted below is some R code of how I would start analysing this. The first few lines are just to generate some data - I don't know whether it is plausible or not. Where to from there would depend a bit on refining your questions. Poisson regression is not the same as logistic regression although both are examples of generalized linear models. Poisson regression is specifically designed for counts; logistic regression is for binomial distributions (ie proportions). However, because you have length of conversation as a factor, it seems likely that your data will be "overdispersed", in which case you may get around the problem through using a quasi-poisson model. In fitting a generalized linear model to data where the randomness isn't normally distributed you use "analysis of deviance" rather than "analysis of variance". Hope this helps. # Generate data # This doesn't matter to you, so long as you can get your data in the format where # one column is the speaker and the other is the number of code switches in a particular # conversation. # speaker
