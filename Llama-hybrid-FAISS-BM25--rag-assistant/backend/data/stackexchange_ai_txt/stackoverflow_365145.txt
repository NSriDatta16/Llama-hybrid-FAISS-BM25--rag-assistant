I don't think you should supply a Gui for active directory. Most organization that use active directory manage it with the standard active directory tools. If you want to handle the case of small shops. Then make the groups internal to the application DB. You will still be able to use the active directory users. But the group management and membership will be internal to your application. This will avoid most problem of dealing with the complex rules of active directory, and still benefit from single sign on. One more thing to note. The group names should be customizable. Most places have naming convention for group names.
