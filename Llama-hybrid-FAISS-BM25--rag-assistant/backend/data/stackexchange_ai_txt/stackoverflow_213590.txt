As for: "Windows File Explorer-like Icons or Thumbnails view" They are built in in swing. File explorer icons are accessed through FileSystemView class ( it is used by JFileChooser ) when the L&F is Windows of course. FileSystemView.getFileSystemView(); Icon driveIcon = fsv.getSystemIcon( new File("C:\\")); And the Thumbnails icon can be retrieved with the sun.com class that are discouraged by Sun sun.awt.shell.ShellFolder getIcon( boolean largeIcon ) But this one may not perform very well some times ( due to native resources handling I think ).
