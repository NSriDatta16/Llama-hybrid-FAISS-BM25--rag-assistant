What's the best way to analyse the colours in an image (Java)?

I don't have much experience doing image analysis so I thought I'd ask more enlightened individuals :) Basically what I want to do is analyse an image and work out what the most common colours are (these will be averages obviously). Does anybody know of an effective way to do this? If at all possible I'd like to avoid using any third party libraries, but everything will be considered at least. Like I said, I don't have much experience with image analysis so please be patient with me if I don't understand your answers properly! I've tried Google but there doesn't seem to be anything resembling what I'm after. Maybe my Google-Fu just isn't good enough today. I'd really appreciate any pointers you guys could give! Thanks, Tom
