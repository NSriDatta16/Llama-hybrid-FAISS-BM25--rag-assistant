If you are dealing with clinical data ( e.g. , medical imaging , EMR , or physiologic monitoring data ), you can follow Ramesh Sridharan ( @rameshvs ), Matteo Fumagalli ( @mfumagalli ), and Jos√© Ignacio Orlando ( @ignaciorlando ). They are great on that. Although you may be looking for something more broad in terms of data analysis, clinical data analysis has great fundaments for best practices, since it is a critical domain. Hence, you can try to look more into this field. Additionally, you can look at some literature. You have some interesting literature coming from this field [3, 4], however; if you want to take a look at medical data analysis for breast cancer you can also follow my ( @FMCalisto ) work [1, 2].
