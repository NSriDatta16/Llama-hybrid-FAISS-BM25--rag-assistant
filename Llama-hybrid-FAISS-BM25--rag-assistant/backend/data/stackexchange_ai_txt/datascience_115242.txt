Select the best feature selection method for classification

I am trying to make predictions (using Weka) on a tabular dataset. It is a categorical dataset which is encoded by label encoder . I got a good result for SVM and Logistic Regression, namely the accuracy is around 85%. The dataset is high-dimensional and I like to fine-tune my accuracy. So, I am thinking about the feature selection method. I found different feature selection techniques, such as CfsSubsetEval , Classifier Attribute eval , classifier subset eval , Cv attribute eval , Gain ratio attribute eval , Info gain attribute eval , OneRattribute eval , principal component , relief f attribute eval , Symmetric uncertainty , Wrapper subset eval . I would like to know which one would be the best for the dataset that shows good accuracy with Logistic Regression or SVM?
