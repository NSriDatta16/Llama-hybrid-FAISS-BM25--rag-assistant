Just try: SELECT p.product_id, p.name, AVG(pr.rating) AS rating_average FROM products p INNER JOIN product_ratings pr ON pr.product_id = p.product_id also this is meaningless expression: WHERE p.product_id because it is completely equivalent to WHERE p.product_id and i doubt that you have ids below zero
