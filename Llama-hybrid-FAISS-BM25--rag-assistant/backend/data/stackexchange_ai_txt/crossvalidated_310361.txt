Assuming you are not using F4 as both a class and predictor... Its possible you have very, very strong class separation. It isn't common, but it can happen, particularly if this strong separation is accompanied by a fairly small dataset. Assuming you have a binary class variable, try plotting the roc curve for each of your 3 predictor variables. This should help you determine if one of the predictors is carrying most of the predictive power. Another thing to keep in mind is that random forests begin to look a lot like single decision trees when the number of predictor variables is small (with only 3 predictors, the mtry parameter can only take on a few values). So in this case, it is very likely RF and decision trees will perform equivalently, or nearly so.
