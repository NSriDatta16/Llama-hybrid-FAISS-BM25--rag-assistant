Which averages in a set are probably identical

Suppose there are $N$ types of blocks. The blocks are labelled with their types. The average weights of the types are in the set $\{w_i\,|\,\,i . In other words, at least one pair of block types shares an average weight. The variances of each block type are unknown, but samples fall into a normal distribution. I draw $M_i$ samples of block type $i$ . From my samples, I would like to find out which block types have the same weights. For example, suppose block type $A$ has an average weight of $1$ , while types $B$ and $C$ have average weights of $2$ . I draw the following weights for the three block types: Block type A: 1.03,0.89,0.86,0.77,1.36,1.09 (mean=1.00, stddev=0.213) Block type B: 2.51,2.26,2.83,3.02,1.62,2.34,2.02,2.84 (mean=2.43, stddev=0.439) Block type C: 1.99,2.14,2.07,2.01,1.75,1.96,2.1 (mean=2.00, stddev=0.119) I would like to use this data to infer that types $B$ and $C$ likely share an average weight, while type $A$ has a distinct average weight. One potentially na√Øve idea I came up with was to run pairwise t-tests between the means of different types of blocks, to quantify the extent that I suspect the means are identical. Then, I could cluster this data into sets of blocks that likely share means. I don't have a rigorous justification for this method, however, and it is possible it is not statistically sound. Does anyone know an algorithm which attempts to solve this problem? Does anyone have any other suggestions for what I could do?
