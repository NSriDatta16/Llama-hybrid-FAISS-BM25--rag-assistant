jQuery drag drop slower for more DIV items

I have got a hierarchichal tags (with parent child relationship) in my page and it will account to 500 - 4500 (can even grow). When i bound the draggable and droppable for all i saw very bad performance in IE7 and IE6. The custom helper wont move smoothly and was very very slow. Based on some other post i have made the droppable been bound/unbound on mouseover and mouseout events (dynamically). Its better now. But still i dont see the custom helper move very smoothly there is a gap between the mouse cursor and the helper when they move and gets very bad when i access the site from remote. Please help me to address this performance issue. Am totally stuck here.. :(
