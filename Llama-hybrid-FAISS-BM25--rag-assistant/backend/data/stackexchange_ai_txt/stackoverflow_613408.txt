Assuming you want to use the .NET, the Informix CSDK (not the DRDA one) and ADO.NET the easiest way to get connected is to use add the database to Visual Studio's list of Data Connections (View -> Server Explorer, then click the "Connect to Database" button, then just fill in the form (This assumes you installed the Visual Studio Extensions with the CSDK...)). Then go into the project's properties, go to the setting tab, add a new setting with a type of '(Connection String)' and for the value put: Database=mydatabase;Password=mypassword;Server=myserver;User ID=myuser" So in the app.config it will look something like this: Also make sure the database and server has been configured in the hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) and/or with the Informix Database Connection Tool 'inetd32.exe' located in the Start Menu somewhere... Also if you so feel inclined you can drag tables and such from the database in the Server Explorer window onto a opened XSD file in Visual Studio to have it automaticlly add the connection string to the configuration and setup everything to give you a typed dataset and it will handled the CRUD layer for you... (Though you might get a bunch of errors because VS cannot pull the Informix schema using the latest drivers for some reason...) Anyway, you can then use the connection string like: IfxConnection myconnection = new IfxConnection(MyApplication.Properties.Settings.Default.MyConnectionString);
