AppleScript (Studio) is not able to register to any system notification, notifications can only be accomplished in Objective-C. By the way DiskArbitration.framework is much faster than diskutil. An alternative could be a folder action or a launchd agent which observes /Volumes. But it's quite circuitous to pass the information to the main application Hope this helps
