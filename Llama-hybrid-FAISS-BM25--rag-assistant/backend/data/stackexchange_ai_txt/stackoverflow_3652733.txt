There's no 100% reliable way to do this, of course. You can have a look at the Readability source code here Basically, what they're doing is trying to identify positive and negative blocks of text. Positive identifiers (i.e. div IDs) would be something like: article body content blog story Negative identifiers would be: comment discuss And then they have unlikely and maybe candidates. What they would do is determine what is most likely to be the main content of the site, see line 678 in the readability source. This is done by analyzing mostly the length of paragraphs, their identifiers (see above), the DOM tree (i.e. if the paragraph is a last child node), strip out everything unnecessary, remove formatting, etc. The code has 1792 lines. It does seem like a non trivial problem, so maybe you can get your inspirations from there.
