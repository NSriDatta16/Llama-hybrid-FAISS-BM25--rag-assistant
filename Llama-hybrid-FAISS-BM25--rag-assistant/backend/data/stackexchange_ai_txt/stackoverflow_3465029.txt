One could use http://powershellmsbuild.codeplex.com/ for 3.5. It'd be nice if there was a NuGet package for it that one could leverage via NuGet package restore . 4.0 has a Windows Powershell Task Factory which you can get in the code gallery has been rolled into MSBuild Extension Pack (one of the top task libraries - 400+ Tasks & recommended in Inside MSBuild) has PowerShellTaskFactory (download the help file from the download section of this example release to have a peek).
