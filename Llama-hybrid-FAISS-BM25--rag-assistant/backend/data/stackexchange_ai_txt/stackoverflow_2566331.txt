Well here are the options: Setup a server to save the data for the user, and use xhr to create/edit/remove data ( Google App Engine (GAE) offers a lot of free storage space). Use Web Storage which is implemented in Firefox . Use Flash Local Storage . Wait until Web SQL Database is implemented in Firefox.. A mixture of all of the above. If you write a Firefox extension (or in the future you could make a Jetpack and use the Page Mod JEP 107 which is being developed) then you can also read/write/delete files to the HD .
