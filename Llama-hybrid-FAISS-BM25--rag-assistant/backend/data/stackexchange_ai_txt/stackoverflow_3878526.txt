If you like SQLite, why don't just use SQLite? Since it does have a BLOB datatype, you can always store your encrypted data as a BLOB and decrypt it upon retrieval. Just have Ruby do all the encryption and decryption. I am not sure where you would want the key(s) to be, but you can store them in another column if you need a different key for every "chunk," or have one key for the entire application (in this case you could have it configurable on Ruby).
