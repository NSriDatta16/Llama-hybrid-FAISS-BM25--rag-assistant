I've put together the major strokes of a model. Unfortunately, I don't know of any stats packages that implement this model, so you'd need to code it yourself. I recommend Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath for a great introduction to how to build your own statistical models and program them in a PPL like Turing or Stan. The model I'd suggest is a random walk on a latent variable. This model will go something like this: You have an underlying latent variable that's normally distributed. (This is the same as a probit model.) We have a set of "cutpoints" as in the ordered probit (or logistic) regression that need to be estimated. McElreath discusses how to implement an ordered logistic regression in his book. The latent Gaussian variable for each participant follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a Gaussian process with an exponential kernel. (This sounds fancy, but don't worry -- it's not as complicated as it sounds, and Statistical Rethinking goes over Gaussian processes well).
