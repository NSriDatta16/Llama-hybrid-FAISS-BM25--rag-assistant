I knowt his is an old question now... but IE7 is overzealous with caching the HTTPXML object... so you have to either: put some random data at the end of your url (as rmurphy said) use the $.post() method instead, as IE doesnt cache POSTs set your cache timeouts in the server response so that IE doesnt cache: Cache-Control = "no-cache" Pragma = "no-cache" Expires = "0"
