I am not aware of any way of doing something like this since it would require storage of metadata not related to actual content of the file. Even if it's only in memory while Vim is running, I don't know of a way to do it. Doesn't mean there isn't a way since my knowledge of Vim is limited. But it seems like something Vim wouldn't do.
