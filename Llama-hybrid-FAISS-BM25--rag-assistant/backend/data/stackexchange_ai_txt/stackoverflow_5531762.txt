Document text in XML

I understand the differences between XML and HTML, but one particular aspect is not clear to me. XML is usually described as both a language that describes data, as well as a document markup language. Because of the former definition, XML is often compared to other data-describing formats such as JSON. Because of the latter definition, XML is also often compared to other document-markup languages, such as HTML. I realize XML can function as both, but if XML is to serve as a document markup language, can document text appear between closing tags, in the same way it can with HTML? Take the following HTML: Some text, and some more text. Ignoring the initial XML Declaration, is the above also valid XML? Note that the fragment text. is not enclosed in any tags: it appears between two closing tags. This is, of course, necessary in a markup language like HTML, where the goal is to format text. But most examples of XML I see use it to describe data , like: Blah blah Blah blah In the above example, text never appears between closing tags. So, is text (content) allowed to appear between closing tags in XML?
