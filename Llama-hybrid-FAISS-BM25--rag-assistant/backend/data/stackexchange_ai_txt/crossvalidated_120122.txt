You may have artefacts arising from restrictions on what is possible physically or on what is recorded (at the simplest, integers only). Completely anonymous $Y$ and $X$ don't suggest any confident guesses about how that arises, but it looks as if some $Y/X$ are favoured and I would certainly look at the distribution of that ratio. Also, if so it's not in my experience useful to look for separate models unless you really are mixing quite different situations. (For "physically" read "biologically" or whatever adverb makes sense.) The more I look at this, the more I guess that lines such as $X/k$ or $kX$ are evident for integer $k$, because the values themselves are integers. A different but possibly related point is that to me these data cry out for transformations. If they are all positive, logarithms are indicated. I fear that you have zeros, in which case what to do is open to discussion. For example, a line at $Y = 0$ may be guessed at from your graph. If there are zeros, some swear by $\log(Y + \text{constant})$ or cube root should help. Whatever helps you see patterns more clearly is defensible. A point of terminology: skewness in statistics is described with reference to the tail that is more stretched out. You're free to regard this terminology as backwards. Here both variables are skewed to high values or positively or right-skewed. UPDATE: Thanks for the extra graphs, which are most helpful. Almost all guesses appear confirmed. (The bottom line, so to speak, is $Y = 1$, not $Y = 0$.) The stripes are artefacts or secondary effects of using integers, which may well be the only, or at least the most practical, way of measuring what you are measuring (about which the question remains discreet). The log-log and other plots expose the discreteness. So despite the discretion, the discreteness is confirmed. There are pronounced modes (peaks in distribution) for the ratios 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 and 2/1. As before, I wouldn't advise modelling different stripes differently without a scientific reason to distinguish them or treat them separately. You should just average over what you have. (There may be known methods with this kind of data to suppress the discreteness. If people in your field routinely measure millions of points for each plot, it is hard to believe that this has not been seen before.) The correlation should certainly be positive. Apart from a formal significance test, which here would be utterly useless as minute correlations will qualify as significant with this sample size, whether it is declared strong is a matter of the expectations and standards in your field. Comparing your correlation quantitatively with others' results is a way to go. Detail: The skewness is still described the wrong way round according to statistical convention. These variables are right-skewed; that jargon fits when looking at a histogram with horizontal magnitude axis and noting that skewness is named for the longer tail, not the concentration with more values.
