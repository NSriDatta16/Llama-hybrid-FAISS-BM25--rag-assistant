what would be the best solution to arrange items on Magento?

my client is asking me to arrange items freely. Let's say I have five items. Item 1,2,3,4,5. My client wants to move item 5 to item 1 and item 4 to item 2 and so on. I have never seen such feature before. I am not even sure how to implement it. What would be the best solution??
