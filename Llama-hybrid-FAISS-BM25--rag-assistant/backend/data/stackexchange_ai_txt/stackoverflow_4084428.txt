I am sure there are more elegant answer there and would come in the replies. But for some simple answers: L2 = ['A','B','C','D','A','B'] L3 = [3,2,1,2,2,1] L4 = zip(L2, L3) L5 = [] L6 = [] def freduce(l): for x, y in l: print x , y if x in L5: k = L5.index(x) L6[k] += y else: L5.append(x) L6.append(y) freduce(L4) print L5 print L6 Output: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] [5, 3, 1, 2] [Edited answer for understanding the second implementation] >>> L3 = [3,2,1,2,2,1] >>> L2 = ['A','B','C','D','A','B'] >>> range(0, len(L2)) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] >>> Hence in for i in range(0, len(L2)): ... i becomes an index Using this index, you could extract information from L3 and L2 by doing: key = L2[i] num = L3[i] Then you add information to the dict l2_sum[key] = l2_sum.get(key, 0) + num Here l2_sum.get(key, 0) returns 0 if the key is not present otherwise the current value. I hope it is clear enough.
