Fisher's method for P-value more conservative than OLS?

I am currently observing an interesting phenomenon in my analysis. I have a simple logistic regression model for independent Inds. The model is as follows: $$\operatorname{logit}(Y) = \beta_0+\beta_1X $$ My data $X$ can be stratified by gender (2 groups), each about equal sample size. I have tried two methods: OLS using all data OLS for each gender and Fisher-combine p -values There are lots of the same model run (all SNPs on a Chromosome), and it seems that Method 2 would result in a more conservative p -value, ~ 10 times larger than the p -value from Method 1. And this results is true for all the SNPs (~20) that I am interested in (SNPs with a p -value less than $5 \cdot 10^{-8}$). I'm not sure if this is true for all, and if there's a rigorous way to show it.
