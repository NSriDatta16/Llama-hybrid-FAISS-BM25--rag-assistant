If you don't mind getting your hands dirty, it isn't that difficult to write an RTF to HTML converter. Writing a general purpose RTF->HTML converter would be somewhat complicated because you would need to deal with hundreds of RTF verbs. However, in your case you are only dealing with those verbs used specifically by Crystal Reports. I'll bet the standard RTF coding generated by Crystal doesn't vary much from report to report. I wrote an RTF to HTML converter in C++, but it only deals with basic formatting like fonts, paragraph alignments, etc. My translator basically strips out any specialized formatting that it isn't prepared to deal with. It took about 400 lines of C++. It basically scans the text for RTF tags and replaces them with equivalent HTML tags. RTF tags that aren't in my list are simply stripped out. A regex function is really helpful when writing such a converter.
