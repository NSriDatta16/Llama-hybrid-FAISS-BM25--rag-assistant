Spectral Analysis in R - the periodogram

I am doing a spectral analysis in R using the spec.pgram() function. Suppose I have observations for $y_1$ to $y_n$ which are a time series with annual observations. From my understanding if I run: per a) per$spec stores the periodogram values for frequencies $1/n, 2/n, \ldots, 1/2$. b) per$freq appears to give these frequencies. The frequencies with large per$spec values are the dominant frequencies. My question is: (1) why do we use the frequencies $1/n, 2/n, \ldots, 1/2$ instead of using all the frequencies from $1/n$ to $1$. Is this simply because the periodogram is symmetric? (2) I noticed that if the data I used is a time series with freq= 2 (has two observations per year) then the periodogram in R shows frequencies from $1/n$ to $1$ instead of $1/n$ to $0.5$. Why is this? I am a little confused what R is doing. A detailed explanation would be appreciated (for example this happens when I run spec.pgram for the sunspotz data in the astsa package).
