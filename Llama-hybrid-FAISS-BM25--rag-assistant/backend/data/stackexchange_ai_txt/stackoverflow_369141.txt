How do you manage and organize your game components?

in my spare time I'm engaged with writing a little game using Microsofts XNA framework. Reviewing the very first prototype which I wrote to get aquainted with XNA, I found it annoying that there is no possibility to structure my (drawable) game components in a hierarchical manner. I was close to implement a kind of Composite (Drawable) GameComponent in order to do that. But before reinventing the wheel I ask you: What is your preferred way to manage and structure hierarchically related game components? Thx, Prensen
