Why Do Neural Networks Prefer Dense Features

Reading through this tf-ranking notebook there is an interesting note that typically networks take in dense features, this is true in my general experience. But I am wondering why, if I were to pass in a categorical feature as a one hot encoded representation would it be worse? https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/ranking/blob/master/tensorflow_ranking/examples/handling_sparse_features.ipynb#scrollTo=aQ-VTA56sOTA
