Efron and Tibshirani's new book Computer Age Statistical Inference offers an intuitive understanding to what is being estimated. Let me summarize their message graphically. The (Bayesian) underlying idea is that observations come from a mixture of two distributions: $\pi_0 \: N$ observations from the null density $f_0(z)$ $(1-\pi_0) \: N$ observations from alternative density $f_1(z)$. What is observed is the mixture of those two: $f(z) = \pi_0 \cdot f_0(z) + (1-\pi_0) \cdot f_1(z)$ The (Bayesian) definitions are: $\text{Fdr} = \frac{\pi_0 \: (1-F_0(z_0))}{(1-F(z))}$ (a fraction of the tail areas) $\text{fdr} = \frac{\pi_0 \: f_0(z_0)}{f(z)}$ (a fraction of the tail densities) As shown below, Fdr is equivalent to the Benjamini hocherg FDR when $\pi_0 \approx 1$ (which is the case in most bioinformatics studies)
