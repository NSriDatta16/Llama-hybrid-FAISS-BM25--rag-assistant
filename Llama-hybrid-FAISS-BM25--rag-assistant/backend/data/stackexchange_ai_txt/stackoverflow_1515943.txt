Application.UserAppDataRegistry and version number

*Or: "Where the %#%Â¤/ am I supposed to store my settings?" Why is the product version number included in the Application.UserAppDataRegistry registry key? I think it's really annoying. Doesn't this just encourage developers to stick with version number 1.0.0 forever, since changing the version number will cause the user to loose all settings (unless extra effort is made)? If I strip away the version number, it will of course work "better" (the way I see it), but the framework still creates the registry key with the version number. What am I overseeing?
