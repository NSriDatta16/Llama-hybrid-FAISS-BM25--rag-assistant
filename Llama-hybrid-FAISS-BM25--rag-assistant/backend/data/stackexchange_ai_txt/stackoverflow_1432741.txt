Have a look at Haxe ... you can compile Haxe to swfs as well, and unlike AS3, it supports generics ... edit: Haxe can target flash10 ... unlike ActionScript 3, Haxe even can use alchemy opcodes: http://haxe.org/api/flash9/memory ... plus the generated bytecode is faster ... actually Haxe is a much better tool to leverage the potentials of the AVM2
