It's probably due to ColumnTransformer 'remainder' parameter. If you see on the docs , ColumnTransformer will drop the features that wasn't specified. remainder{‘drop’, ‘passthrough’} or estimator, default=’drop’ By default, only the specified columns in transformers are transformed and combined in the output, and the non-specified columns are dropped. (default of 'drop'). By specifying remainder='passthrough', all remaining columns that were not specified in transformers will be automatically passed through. In your case, since you only mentioned the categorical columns, the remaining columns might be dropped. Perhaps try setting remainder='passthrough' ?
