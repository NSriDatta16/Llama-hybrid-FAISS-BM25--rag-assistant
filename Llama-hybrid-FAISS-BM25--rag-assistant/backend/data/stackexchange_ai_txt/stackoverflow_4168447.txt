Printing XAML - Missing Font issue

Possible Duplicate: Xps printing from windows service I have a custom .TTF font that is referenced in a XAML document. ex: render me if I view the xaml document in IE the font renders just fine If I print the xaml to an .xps file, the font will render just fine when I view the .xps document in IE if I try to print the xaml document to a regular printer, the font is not rendered, and a default face is used instead. if I try to print the .xps document to a regular printer the font is not rendered, and a default face is used instead I have tried embedding the font as a resource, I have tried referencing the font file directly both in the XAML and in the code-behind of the xaml. I can take a plain html file, reference the font and print it to the regular printer, and it renders just fine. how can I get this custom font to print correctly in this XAML document?
