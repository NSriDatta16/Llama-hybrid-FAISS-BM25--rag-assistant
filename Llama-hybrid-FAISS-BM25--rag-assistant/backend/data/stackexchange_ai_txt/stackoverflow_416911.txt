How do I access the child rows of an Infragistics Web Grid row?

I need to modify the contents of the child rows of a hierarchical Infragistics web grid when it is expanded. I can get the parent row from "e.Row" in the following code. But how do I get its child rows to edit? For that matter, how can I get the rows from any band other than band 0? protected void CustomerActivitiesGrid_ExpandRow(object sender, RowEventArgs e) { UltraGridRow expandedRow = e.Row; }
