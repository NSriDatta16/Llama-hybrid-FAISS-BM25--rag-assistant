Standard notation for [sampling from] a conditional probability

I am looking for the correct formal notation of sampling from a continuous conditional probability. In [ 1 ] (Table 4.3) they write: $$\text{sample } x_t^{[m]} \sim p(x_t | u_t, x_{t-1}^{[m]})$$ Should the word 'sample' be used? And does $x_t$ in $p(x_t|..)$ per definition refer to the chosen $x_t^{[m]}$? In my case I have some conditional probability $p(s|o)$, which is a probability function, for example Normal, and depends on $o$: $$p(s|o) = \mathcal{N}(s;o,\sigma^2)$$ And then I want to sample from this distribution: $s \sim p(s|o)$. With this I want to say that sample $s$ is taken based on a normal distribution probability with $o$ as mean. Is this correct? [ 1 ] Thrun, S., Burgard, W., & Fox, D. (2005).
