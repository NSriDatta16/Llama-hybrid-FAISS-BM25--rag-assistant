The solution here depends on the specifics of your problem, as the 'right' answer will vary based on length of time the page is left open, size of DOM elements, and request latency. Here are a few more things to consider: Keep only the newest n items in the cache. This works well if you are only likely to redisplay items in a short period of time. Store the data for each element instead of the DOM element, and reconstruct the DOM on each display. Use HTML5 Storage to store the data instead of DOM or variable storage. This has the added advantage that data can be stored across page requests. Any caching strategy will need to consider when to invalidate the cache and re-request updated data. Depending on your strategy, you will need to handle conflicts that result from multiple editors. The best way is to get started using the simplest method, and add complexity to improve speed only where necessary.
