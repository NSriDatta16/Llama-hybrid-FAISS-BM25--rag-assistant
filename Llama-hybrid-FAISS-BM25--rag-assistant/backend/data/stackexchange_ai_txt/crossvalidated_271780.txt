Why do I compare these two models using a likelihood ratio test?

I would appreciate it if someone could help me answer this. I recently carried a logistic regression model using the following basic formula: y ~ x + factor1 + factor2 My supervisor suggested it would be good to carry out a likelihood ratio test, comparing the above model output to the output from: y ~ factor1 + factor2 I understand that the LRT compares the goodness-of-fit of two models, but I dont understand why the second model (null model) would be y ~ factor1 + factor2 and not y ~ x?
