The fragment (everything after the # in a url) doesn't get passed to the server. So the Fragment property will always be empty when you attempt to get it from a request. The Fragment property is typically only used when constructing URLs. There's no easy way to get the fragment on the server. Typically you would have to use javascript to retrieve the fragment.
