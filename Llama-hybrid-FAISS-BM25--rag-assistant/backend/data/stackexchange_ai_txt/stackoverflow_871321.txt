You should also take a look at Working with legacy code by Michael Feathers: http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242430219&sr=8-1 I think one of the most important things you can put in place to facilitate this are tests to ensure that everything still works post refactoring/pulling out into separate modules. Add to this by introducing a continuous integration system that runs your tests when you check something in.
