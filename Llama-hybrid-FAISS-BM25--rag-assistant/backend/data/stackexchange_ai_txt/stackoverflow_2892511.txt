How should I start playing with 3D?

I'm a developer for just about 6 months now, and since I enjoy programming I've started little programs such as encripters, calculators, tools, stuff to play with DropBox (hehe), stuff that play with bitmaps, drawing graphics, and even a program to update the MSN display image according to the artwork of the music you're listening yo on iTunes. One of my other hobbies is 3d modelling ( completely amateur ) and I'd like to mix these hobbies together! So I've read a little about it and figured I'd have to have good notions on geometry, math, point spacial position (which I do, from my 3d modelling experience), but I don't know how to use API's for it, so I've 'simulated' simple 3d with a simple program I've made (a spinning cube ). Here are some questions: 1) What would be a nice 3d development tool for a .NET programmer like me? 2) Is there a way of using 3d models made in 3DS Max ? (I intend on modelling characters) 3) What knowledge should I have in order to render it, and move it around ? 4) Which API should I use ? NOTE: Not a dupe, I'm asking for directions specific for .NET development possibly using 3ds MAX, and there were no questions about it so far EDIT: I've got three answers that seem quite nice, so let me specify a little and maybe you can tell me what's the more appropriate tool. What I'd like to build soon would be like: portable (click'n'run, no need to install, and (hopefully) no need to send DLL's along) "3D embedding" in winforms application, like a picturebox you could render in. Real winforms application-like (having all System api's like IO, Drawing and etc) The development enviroment would be nice if it: Had the possibility to import existant 3D models (not a must, but a plus) Had the ability to create 3d models programatically (a must) Possibly has a tool for materials and textures (that would be a huge plus) Is Well known (high availability of tutorials, questions in S.O., forums..) And it would be really nice if I could use C# all the way :)
