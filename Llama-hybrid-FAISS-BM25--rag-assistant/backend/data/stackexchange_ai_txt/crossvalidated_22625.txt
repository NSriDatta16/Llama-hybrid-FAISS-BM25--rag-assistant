Time series analysis in Python

I am a beginner to time-series analysis. I have the model below; y is sales of product and x is tweet-rate: $y_t=ay_{t-1}+by_{t-2}+...+cy_{t-m}+dx_t+ex_{t-1}+...+fx_{t-n}$ What is this model called? I guess it's called an AR model but I am not sure since the dependent variable y is on R.H.S as well. How do I fix the lag period, $m$ and $n$? Can $x$ and $y$ have different lags? How can I use Python to build this model and also predict the sales for $t+1\ldots t+n$? Any solution for this without using rpy.
