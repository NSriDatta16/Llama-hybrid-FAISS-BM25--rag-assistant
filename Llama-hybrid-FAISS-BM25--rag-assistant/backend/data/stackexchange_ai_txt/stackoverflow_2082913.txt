Unless you're prepared to write your own script debugger, there doesn't seem to be a way to run the debugger in a different thread than the engine. Behind the scenes, QScriptEngineDebugger uses a class called QScriptEngineDebuggerFrontend , which in turn uses a class called QScriptEngineDebuggerBackend , which in turn makes many direct calls to the engine and installs its own agent into the engine. Long story short, there's a lot of coupling between the debugger and the engine. An alternative is to encapsulate your time-consuming C++ function inside a class which runs the time-consuming function in a background thread and emits a signal when the time-consuming function has completed. Then, connect the signal to a function in your script to process the results. Refer to the following documentation on how to connect signals from your C++ objects to functions in your script: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qtscript.html#using-signals-and-slots
