There is an idea in OOP that you should only inherit from abstract classes and interfaces. The article seems to tacitly assume this. Thus, the comment about versioning relates to the relative advantages of using an abstract class vs. an interface. C# and VB encourage excessive use of inheritance since classes are not sealed by default. See: Why aren't classes sealed by default? Why aren't classes sealed by default? Why does the 'sealed' keyword exist in .Net? http://oredev.org/2010/sessions/c-s-greatest-mistakes
