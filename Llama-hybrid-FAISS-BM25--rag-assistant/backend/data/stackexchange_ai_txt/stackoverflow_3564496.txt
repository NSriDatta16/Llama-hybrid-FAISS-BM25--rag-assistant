You could use the same type of unique identifier in a database that you would in a bound localisation value (if it were in a WPF or Silverlight binding expression). That is, your lookup values would be: Something unique (machine requirement) Something still readable (human readability requirement) Your specific menu lookup values could be something as simple as "menu.home" for the "Home" menu string, "menu.view" for the "View" menu string etc. That type of naming keeps them both organised and meaningful, so take time to choose good names. Hope this helps.
