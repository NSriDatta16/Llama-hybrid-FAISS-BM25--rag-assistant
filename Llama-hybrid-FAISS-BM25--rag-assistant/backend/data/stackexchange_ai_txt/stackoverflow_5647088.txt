In your example I would either send a 302, redirecting him to an error page, or a 200 with a custom error page right there. This will be the most user friendly version. Edit: If you want to opt for something in the 4xx area of status codes, make sure the webserver supplies an appropriate error page. The average user will not be happy to see a white screen with "403 - Forbidden". 403 with a custom error page is a good solution to this problem.
