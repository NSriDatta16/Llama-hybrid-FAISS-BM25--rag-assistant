Can Latent Class Analysis be included among the "Machine Learning" methods?

My question is a "semantic" point of view and it's very easy. Given that Latent Class Analysis (LCA) can be defined as a form of "unsupervised learning", I was wondering whether we can consider LCA among the broad umbrella of "Machine Learning" techniques? From a broader perspective, this question may be translated to "what qualifies to be a "Machine Learning" method" - but in here I am particularly interested in understanding whether we can consider LCA among the broad ML umbrella, or - instead - if not, and why not.
