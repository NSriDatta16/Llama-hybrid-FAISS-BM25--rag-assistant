sql query taking too long

I have simple "insert into.." query which is taking around 40 seconds to execute. It simply takes records from one table and inserts into another. I have index on F1 and BatchID on the tbl_TempCatalogue table 146624 records are affected. select itself is not slow, insert into is slow. The complete query is: insert into tbl_ItemPrice (CATALOGUEVERSIONID,SERIESNUMBER,TYPE,PRICEFIELD,PRICE, PRICEONREQUEST,recordid) select 296 as CATALOGUEVERSIONID ,ISNULL(F2,'-32768') as SERIESNUMBER ,ISNULL(F3,'-32768') as TYPE ,ISNULL(F4,'-32768') as PRICEFIELD,F5 as PRICE ,(case when F6 IS NULL then null when F6 = '0' then 'False' else 'True' end ) as PRICEONREQUEST ,newid() from tbl_TempCatalogue where F1 = 450 and BATCHID = 72 Thanks
