Yes. Java doubles will hold their precision better than your given epsilon of 0.00001. Any rounding error that occurs due to the storage of floating point values will occur smaller than 0.00001. I regularly use 1E-6 or 0.000001 for a double epsilon in Java with no trouble. On a related note, I like the format of epsilon = 1E-5; because I feel it is more readable (1E-5 in Java = 1 x 10^-5). 1E-6 is easy to distinguish from 1E-5 when reading code whereas 0.00001 and 0.000001 look so similar when glancing at code I think they are the same value.
