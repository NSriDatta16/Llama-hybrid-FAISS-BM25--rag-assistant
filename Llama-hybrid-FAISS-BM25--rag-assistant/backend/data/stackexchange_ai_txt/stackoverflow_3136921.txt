Embedding XQuery in Java

I need to retrieve some details from a MusicXML (xml) file in Java. I managed to read xml files in java - but through a web service (where I have to be online, connected to internet when I'm running my code). I came across XQuery where you can easily extract info from an XML file. But I need to embed XQuery in java (i.e. use xquery in java code), precise without using a web service. Is there any possible way, how I can embed XQuery (reading info from XML file), in java code? Greatly appreciate any insight, suggestions and ideas. Many thanks in advance
