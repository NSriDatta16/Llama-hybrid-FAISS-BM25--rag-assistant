What is the simplest ReLU network that can learn an upside-down v pattern?

Input: $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$ Expected output: $f(x) = \begin{cases}x &\text{for } x \leq 5\\10 - x &\text{for } x > 5\end{cases}$ So basically you have a neural network with one input neuron and one output neuron. Let's say the output has the identity as an activation. What is the simplest network with ReLU activations that fits this function?
