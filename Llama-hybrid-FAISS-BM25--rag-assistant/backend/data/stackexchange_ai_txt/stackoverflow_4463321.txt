Magento Associated Product Options

I have imported all of my products as configurable and their options as simple product types, all the simple products have the correct size attributes and the configurable products have the right attribute_set . What is the best way of associating the product options with their products? I would rather not do this with SQL, or manually if I can help it! Thanks in advance
