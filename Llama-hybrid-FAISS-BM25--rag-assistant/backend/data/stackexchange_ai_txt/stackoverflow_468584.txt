As Mark and Martin already pointed out Telerik support is second to none, so you would surely get help in their forums/support threads. I'm currently working with their Reporting product and honestly I have not experienced any problems so far. I've read that they had problems with the toolbox in x64 bit machines, but it has been resolved in the latest service pack, so you might want to make sure you are using the latest version first. However adding the items manually to the toolbox would definitely work and if you are having problem with that too, it sounds more like a Visual Studio problem to me. Also looking at their system requirements , VS Express editions are not supported, so this might be the case as well. Looking through their help, I find a whole section about their reportviewer and how to use it - check it out: http://www.telerik.com/help/reporting/aspnetreportviewerembedding.html
