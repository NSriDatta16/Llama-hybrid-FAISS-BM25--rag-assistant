Are exact logistic regression and conditional logistic regression the same?

I have seen these two terms in practice. Are they actually referring to the same method? If not, what is the main difference between the two methods? Conditional logistic regression is commonly used in case control studies, where matched case and control subjects are compared using this model adjusted for matching covariates. For example, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30318-7/fulltext I have seen exact logistic regression being proposed in some clinical trial protocols for some binary outcome with small sample size. But for conditional logistic regression used in case control studies, I am not sure if it is for small sample size. Therefore, I am not sure if the two methods are referring to the same thing.
