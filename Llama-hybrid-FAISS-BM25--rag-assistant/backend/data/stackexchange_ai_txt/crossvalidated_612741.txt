Odds "ratio" in logistic regression?

Odds ratio, as the word itself demonstrates, refers the ratio of odds. Hence, we need 2 events in computing odds ratio. But in simple logistic regression, given that we are interested in estimating is the relative likelihood of event A over the event of not A , why should we call it odds “ratio” not just “odds”? Perhaps is it just because odds with the denominator of 1 is called odds ratio?
