Android Maps: Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY

I'm trying to use Android Maps, following the instructions in Hello MapView . I've added in the Manifest, and I'm building against the 'Google APIs' target, which claims to be API version 7. So I don't think I'm doing anything obviously wrong, but the project refuses to build with this error: [2010-12-22 13:34:32 - FMS]Installing FMS.apk... [2010-12-22 13:35:01 - FMS]Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY [2010-12-22 13:35:01 - FMS]Please check logcat output for more details. [2010-12-22 13:35:01 - FMS]Launch canceled! logcat is telling me the following (not very enlightening): D/PackageParser( 55): Scanning package: /data/app/vmdl67147.tmp I/PackageParser( 55): com.android.fms: compat added android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE E/PackageManager( 55): Package com.android.fms requires unavailable shared library com.google.android.maps; failing! W/PackageManager( 55): Package couldn't be installed in /data/app/com.android.fms.apk D/AndroidRuntime( 206): Shutting down VM It is possible I haven't set up the Maps API key correctly - when I got it using keytools , I didn't specify an alias_name , though this didn't seem to cause an error. Can anyone help?
