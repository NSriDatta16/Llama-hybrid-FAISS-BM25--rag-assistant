Sqlite Optimization: Read only scenario

I use SQLite for a number of application on the desktop and PDA. Most operations are readonly, as SQLite functions as a data store for reference material in my applications. Basically, I am looking for suggestions on improving performance in a scenario where you know the access to the data is only read-only. Maybe via various pragma settings? etc... SQLite performance is excellent, however on the PDA when you have multiple databases I can see a small performance hit. I dont think this is a problem with SQLite, just the reality of the speed of a PDA. However, having said that, maybe there are ways to improve it. Good advice and well put. I am hoping for something more specific in telling the engine about what I am doing. For example, telling the engine there will be no multiple writes to the DB, or modifying the cache handling in some way. However, I am glad you called attention to the "design" aspect of the database as a leading issue.
