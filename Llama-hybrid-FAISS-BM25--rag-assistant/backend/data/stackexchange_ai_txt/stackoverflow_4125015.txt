Repair / get data from corrupted SQLite file

My applications uses SQLite for data storage. Everything was ok, but one day someone corrupted the data file and now application cannot read it. I cannot understand what is wrong specifically, but there are two things I know: 1) $result = sqlite_query($query,$db_path); When this code runs with the old backup (which, by the way, doesn't contain all the data), everything is fine, $result becomes a correct value. When it runs with the corrupted file, $result becomes null . 2) I opened this corrupted SQLite file in notepad and it seems to be fine (its structure is just like the structure of the old one). The only idea I have is to parse that corrupted file. Where can I get SQLite files specification? Or maybe there is another way?
