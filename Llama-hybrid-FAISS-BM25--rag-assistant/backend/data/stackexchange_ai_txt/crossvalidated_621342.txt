Comparing different methods for modeling Value at Risk (VaR) - understanding VaR backtesting results

I estimated the Value at Risk of a time series of log returns with different approaches and models. Now I want to compare the models and find the model that most accurately estimated the Value at Risk. Therefore I use different VaR-backtesting approaches (e.g. the unconditional (Kupiec) or conditional (Christoffersen) coverage tests for the correct number of exceedances). Per model, I get the test statistic and the $p$ -palue of the UC and CC Test. Assuming for all models, all test-statistics are small enough ( $p$ -value larger 0.05), so that I can not reject the Null Hypothesis, that the VaR estimate is correct. My assumption is: The higher the p-value the higher the likelihood of a good model. So I would prefer a model with a p-Value of 0.6 over a model with a p-Value of 0.4. Is that correct? I have related questions: Evaluate Value at Risk (VaR) models with different VaR backtesting approaches - averaging p-values? Choosing one method for modeling Value at Risk (VaR) over another - determining the "best" model
