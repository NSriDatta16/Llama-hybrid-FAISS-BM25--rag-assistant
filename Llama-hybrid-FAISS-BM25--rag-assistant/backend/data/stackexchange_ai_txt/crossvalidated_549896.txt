How to recognize the probability distribution of a posterior in Bayesian Analysis

I am studying Bayesian Statistics and one of the things I'm finding challenging is the need to recognize how the likelihoodâ‹…prior maps to a particular distribution, even though it doesn't look exactly like the PDF of the distribution. This is may be done to sample from the posterior without having to solve the difficult or intractable integral used as a normalization factor. I have spent a good deal of time looking for a resource that teaches this skill, or at least a list of the forms the common distributions might take, but I haven't found anything yet. It seems like Normal, Binomial, Multinomial, Gamma, Beta, and Exponential are all important to be able to recognize. Does anyone have tips on how to identify the distribution of a posterior or clear resources?
