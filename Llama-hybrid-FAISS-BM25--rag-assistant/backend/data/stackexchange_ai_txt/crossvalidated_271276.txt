My metric is 0.65*accuracy + 0.35*recall. How do I convert that to continuous loss function?

I have some data (14000 examples, with 1000 features, very sparse). My goal is to predict 50 binary values for each example, and there usually are multiple positive values. I want to train a logistic regression and a feedforward neural network, but to do so I need a smooth loss function - meaning a function that has a continuous derivative. What function's optimum values are the optimum values of this metric? What if the metric was e.g. 0.3*precision + 0.5*recall + 0.2*accuracy? Or F1 score? My current solution is to use binary crossentropy, and then select such a threshold for the probability that maximizes the given metric. That feels very "hacky" though.
