UIImageView subclass touch detection

I have a subclass of UIImageView that I need to know when is touched. (Full code below.) I have found and read both this and this . They were mildly useful, but neither really worked. Not only is my touchesBegan:withEvent: method not being called, the button behind the image is being pressed. Here is my code: Header file: @interface MathKeyboardKey : UIImageView { } @end Implementation file: @implementation MathKeyboardKey - (id)initWithImage:(UIImage *)image { if (self = [super initWithImage:image]) { //init here } return self; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"-- I AM TOUCHED --"); } - (void)dealloc { [super dealloc]; } @end Calling code: { self.userInteractionEnabled = NO; mathKeyboardAccess = [[MathKeyboardKey alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"mathKey.png"]]; CGRect frm = mathKeyboardAccess.frame; frm.origin = CGPointMake(80, 171); mathKeyboardAccess.frame = frm; mathKeyboardAccess.userInteractionEnabled = YES; [self addSubview:mathKeyboardAccess]; } This view is being added as a subview of another (the MathKeyboard ). The superview cannot have user interaction enabled, as it is covering another view (the system keyboard). When I attempt to add MathKeyboardKey to the system keyboard view, it doesn't show up. If I try to use a UIButton, it never shows up, no matter which view I place it in. Question, in case it isn't apparent, is: how do I detect touches in this UIImageView subclass?
