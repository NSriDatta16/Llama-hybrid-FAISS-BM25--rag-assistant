Your code is correct. The path /external/audio/media is the content provider path not the path int the actual filesystem. Are you sure you have MP3 files on the card? Check in the music app you can see files. If you can't in there, I sometimes find (especially on the emulator) that the indexing doesn't always run. Force the SD to get reindexed of all media by unmounting the SD card and remounting (Settings/SD card & phone storage/Unmount SD card).
