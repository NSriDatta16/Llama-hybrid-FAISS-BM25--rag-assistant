If you fit the model with a conditional logistic regression, not making any random-effect assumptions about ID , it works > library(survival) > clogit(switch~independ+strata(ID),data=d) Call: clogit(switch ~ independ + strata(ID), data = d) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p independy 3.665 39.041 1.406 2.606 0.00916 independz 1.704 5.494 1.151 1.480 0.13888 Likelihood ratio test=13.02 on 2 df, p=0.001492 n= 639, number of events= 24 That suggests there's an issue with estimating the random effects or their variance, which is spilling over into estimation of the regression coefficients. Since most of the information about the regression coefficients will come from within- ID comparisons, if you aren't interested specifically in the ID variance component you might be better off with conditional logistic regression. [This approach doesn't always apply -- sometimes there is substantial between-stratum information, and sometimes the variance components are of substantive interest -- but it's nice and simple when it does apply]
