Isn't the depth of a convolutional layer, the number of colors (or colorspace size)?

I have been going through a CNN tutorial and noticed that depth of a convolutional layer is equal to the number of filters. But, shouldn't the depth be the number of colors in the image? I mean, if it's RGB then, depth is 3 right? Am I missing something here?
