What is the expected number of steps before the spider exits? Markov Chain

A little spider lives in a rectangular box of which the sides are 3 and 4 cm long. It can only sit in one of the four corners marked with the numbers 1,2,3,4 (clockwise). Assume in Corner 2 there is a bigger spider ready to eat the little spider and in Corner 3 there is a hole leading to the outside through which the spider can escape. If the spider in Corner 1, what is the expected number of steps before the spider exists? Here is the Markov chain transition matrix $${\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 15/47 & 12/47 & 20/47\\ 15/47 & 0 & 20/47 & 12/47\\ 12/47 & 20/47 & 0 & 15/47\\ 20/47 & 12/47 & 15/47 & 0 \end{bmatrix}}_{4\times 4}$$ In my notes my lecturer says we have to solve e1 = 15/47+12/47+20/47(1+e4) e2 = 20/47+15/47(1+e1)+12/47(1+e4) e3 = 20/47+12/47(1+e1)+15/47(1+e4) e4 = 12/47+15/47+20/47(1+e1) I don't really understand. Anyone can explain why?
