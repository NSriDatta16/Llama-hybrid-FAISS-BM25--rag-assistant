Should I use dummy variables or just assign numerical values to categorical predictors in regression / PCA?

When wanting to apply PCA or Linear Regression on some data set, I understand that the explanatory variables (features) should have numerical values. My current situation is that out of 79, I have 43 Factorial variables, which I intend to transform. 1st Option - Is to convert each factorial variable to X dummy variables. which gives a lot more features, of course. 2nd Option - Is to assign numerical value to each factor level, without order relevance, e.g. convert feature that gets the following levels: {"Interior", "Exterior"} , to get the following levels: {0, 1} What do I need to consider before using each of the options? Or, how to determine which option serves me best \ determine if that's the correct approach? My end goal is to predict continuous variable using the explanatory variables (If that's something to consider).
