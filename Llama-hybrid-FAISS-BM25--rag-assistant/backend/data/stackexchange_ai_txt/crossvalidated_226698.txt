Logistic Regression - confused about one independent variable

I have a question regarding a binary logistic regression. Its about the plausibility of the influence of one independent variable. I am analyzing the influence of the size of a farm on the use of the plough. Here I am showing the average values of this describing variable (there are all in all six variables). In the analysis I take the logarithm of this variable. group 1 (n=66): non-user of plough (average value of farm size 267 hectares; log of farm size=2,2; histogram below) group 2 (n=181): user of plough (average value of farm size = 333 hectares; log farm size = 2,2; histogram below) Edit: Regression results + collinearity diagnostics: The results say, the larger the farm size, the more likely it is to belong to group 1. Although the farm size in this group is obviously much lower. I can find no errors in the data, but I am surprised about this result. Would You say that these results are an indication for misspecification or problems within the data? I think taking the logarithm leads to an re-adjusting of the farm size variable. However,I dont like to make this process undone, because I am analyzing further three dependent variables with the same set of independent variables.
