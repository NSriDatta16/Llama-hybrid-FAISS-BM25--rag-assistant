Predicting from the posterior of a random coefficients model

I've got a model that looks like this: $$Y_{ig} = \left(\beta_{everyone} + \beta_g\right)X_{ig} + Z_{ig}'\gamma + \epsilon_{ig}$$ in R, this is library(lme4) example = lmer(Y~ X + Z + (0 + X|g)) I want a conditional estimated distribution of $Y|G=g,X=x,Z=z$ For lm, gam, etc, this is just predict(example) as the mean of a normal distribution with the same variance as the residuals of the model divided by n-k. Is there anything different in a mixed model/random coefficients case? I don't think MCMC is appropriate, as I don't want to estimate the probability of being ins a certain group $g$ -- I want a distribution for a certain $g$. If indeed the same intuition is applicable, how would I code this? I'm relatively new to mixed effects models, so any advice is appreciated.
