I personally agree with Andy Lester in that the true key is to understand the platforms of your target audience. Yes globally Chrome might have a 3-5% market share, or something like that, but if your not-for-profit organization was targeted towards developers you might have a much higher rate of adoptions. So in addition to what everyone has said here, know your audience. I know with my website targeting technology people, I see about a 30% FireFox, 55% IE, 12% Chrome, and the rest are others for my visitors. Vastly different from the norm due to my audience.
