For eclipse i use this: window -> preferences -> java -> editor -> save action -> check the checkbox for organize imports (there are a lot of other useful stuff there too, like formatting, making fields final and so on..). So when i save my file eclipse removes the unessacry imports for me. In my opinion, if you don't need something then remove it (or let it be removed by eclipse).
