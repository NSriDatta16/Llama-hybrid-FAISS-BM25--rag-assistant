With continuous variables though, it does seem like the main effect term is still a meaningful value because continuous variables have meaningful averages. A problem is that continuous predictors might not be centered around their mean values when introduced into the model. The main effect‚Äù reported for X is typically its association with outcome when Y = 0 in the data presented to the model , and vice-versa. Thus re-centering Y affects the apparent "main effect" of X, and vice-versa. From the modeling perspective there thus isn't a unique "meaningful value" for the "main effect" of a continuous predictor involved in interaction terms. See this page for a worked-through example. If you keep that in mind and center your data so that the mean of each continuous predictor equals 0, you can then interpret a "main effect" coefficient as the association with outcome when the interacting predictors are at their mean values. With an interaction, however, the effects of predictors on each other's associations with outcome and scenarios other than associations at mean values may be of more interest.
