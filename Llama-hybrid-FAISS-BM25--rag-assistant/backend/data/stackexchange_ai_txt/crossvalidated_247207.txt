MCMC provides the user with a procedure to obtain samples from some target distribution (typically a posterior distribution in the Bayesian framework). The way the procedure works is that the distribution from which samples are obtained from converges to the target distribution. Convergence diagnostics are required to assess when the sampling procedure has converged to sampling from the target distribution. If the diagnostic indicates that the sampler process has not converged to sampling from the target distribution MORE samples will need to be drawn (and/or more of the initial samples drawn should be discarded (burnin-in) as they are not from the target distribution) The Geweke diagnostic is pretty simple. It compares the mean of the samples drawn from the end of a chain of MCMC output to the mean of the samples at the beginning of the chain using a $z$-test like statistic. The variance of the two means is computed using spectral densities (b/c the MCMC output is not independent). As for a cut-off you can compare to the standard normal critical values $z_{\alpha/2}$ where $\alpha=0.05$ or something similar.
