With the Apache web server, you could use mod_rewrite to beautify the URLs so that users don't have to type in everything. For example, users open mywebsite.tld/search/ and the request will be processed by mywebsite.tld/search/searchJob.php without the user noticing it. This has another big advantage: You can organize the files as you want, and change the file names arbitrarily - you'll only have to change the URL mapping when you move or rename a PHP file. As an aside: Users will almost never type in a full URL, normal users click through the main page or use enhanced address bars (like the Firefox address bar which shows history items) to open a web page.
