Can I put an Image(s) on a Canvas and have them be moved around by the mouse?

I want to dynamically create and put some Image (mx.controls.Image) objects on a Canvas and I want them then to be able to be repositioned by the user via the mouse. Can this be done? Note, I am not looking for drag and drop. I just want to change the X and Y coordinates of Images with the mouse. Thanks!
