iPhone - UIWebview doesn't save authentication to sites

For these purposes, let say I have an application which contains a single UIWebview. I'm loading a request to any of these sites: facebook, gmail, twitter, etc., and receive a login screen. The thing is - that if I log in and relaunch the app, I will have to go through the login screen again. In Mobile Safari/Google app for example I would retain my login cookie/session details/whatnot and wouldn't need to enter my user credentials again. That is the behavior I want to have. Stuff I tried: sending cookies from the NSHTTPCookieStorage via the NSURLRequest. Persisting the cookies myself to NSUserDefaults, but no luck. How can I achieve the behavior Mobile Safari & Google app has?
