see Using ROLLUP to aggregate data in SQL implementation: DECLARE @SOMETABLE TABLE (SUBMARKETER INT, GRADE CHAR, MARKETER INT, DATE DATETIME, TOTAL INT) INSERT INTO @SOMETABLE SELECT 1415, 'A', 22, '02/25/2009', 26 UNION SELECT 1415, 'B', 22, '02/25/2009', 93 UNION SELECT 1415, 'C', 22, '02/25/2009', 1175 UNION SELECT 1415, 'D', 22, '02/25/2009', 510 UNION SELECT 1169, 'B', 500, '02/25/2009', 1 UNION SELECT 1169, 'C', 500, '02/25/2009', 3 UNION SELECT 1393, 'C', 500, '02/25/2009', 2 UNION SELECT 2, 'B', 500, '02/25/2009', 5 UNION SELECT 2, 'C', 500, '02/25/2009', 111 UNION SELECT 2, 'D', 500, '02/25/2009', 18 SELECT CASE WHEN SUBMARKETER IS NULL THEN 'Marketer Total' ELSE CONVERT(VARCHAR, MARKETER) END MARKETER, SUBMARKETER, GRADE, TOTAL, DATE FROM ( SELECT MARKETER, SUBMARKETER, GRADE, SUM(TOTAL) AS TOTAL, CONVERT(VARCHAR,DATE,101)[DATE] FROM @SOMETABLE WHERE DATE >= '2/25/2009' AND DATE attention : this will work fine if MARKETER, SUBMARKETER and DATE columns are NOT NULL. If there will be NULL values of theese fields in table, that will became an issue to filter out useless grouping.
