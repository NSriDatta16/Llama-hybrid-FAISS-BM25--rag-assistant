Why is a random forest regressor better than a random forest classifier when predicting a category?

I am building a model that recommends the optimal golf club based on data I have gathered. Since the model prediction should be a category, ie. a golf club, I would assume I would have to use a classifier algorithm. However, I have label encoded the types of golf clubs in an ordinal way from 1-14 (1 being the club with longer distance shots and 14 being the one for shortest shots) and have run both random forest regressor and classifier with scikit-learn and the regressor is more accurate. Why is this?
