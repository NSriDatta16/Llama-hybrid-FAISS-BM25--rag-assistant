Keeping the child node's position relative to that of its jQuery resizable-enabled parent?

Is it possible to keep the position of children relative to their jQuery resizable parents? Sorry if my wording is a little confusing. You can see it in action here . What I want to have happen, is when those "tiles" are dragged into a different shape, have the elements stay in the bottom-left corner of the tiles. Is it possible to accomplish this with pure CSS? Thanks!
