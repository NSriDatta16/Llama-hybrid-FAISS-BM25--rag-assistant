Inter Portlet Commuication (IPC) is not possible across different WARs using IceFaces 1.8.x. It will be possible when IceFaces 2.0 is out, an Alpha is already available. However, it is possible to do some sort of IPC using IceFaces 1.8.x. The "Advanced Topics" chapter of the Icefaces Develpers Guide covers this topic: The use of Ajax Push allows portlets to be updated based on server-side events that change the state of the current view. This can be a powerful feature that can also be leveraged to do a form of interportlet communication (IPC) in certain configurations. IPC is only mentioned in the Portlet 1.0 spec (JSR 168) but is formally defined in the Portlet 2.0 specification (JSR 286). It is architected as an Event/Listener model. However, it is possible to use the ICEfaces Ajax Push mechanism to update portlets based on changes to the underlying model. The way to do this currently with ICEfaces is to: Deploy the portlets that need to communicate in the same archive (.war file). Use application-scoped beans to manage shared state between the portlets. Use the ICEfaces Ajax Push feature to trigger client updates when the shared state changes. For an example of how to do this, review the sample ICEfaces Chat portlet.
