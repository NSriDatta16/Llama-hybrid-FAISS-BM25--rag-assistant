Searching for a dataset that targets difficult words

I am trying to find a dataset in which dataset targets words that are difficult. I understand there would be different levels of difficulty for each individual , but if we considered an average individual, I want to detect the difficult words that would be present in a sentence. Example: Yes, may be today's Britains are not responsible for some of these reparations but the same speakers have pointed with pride to their foreign aid - you are not responsible for the people starving in Somalia but you give them aid surely the principle of reparation for what is the wrongs that have done cannot be denied. IN the above sentence, the model should detect the word - reparations successfully.
