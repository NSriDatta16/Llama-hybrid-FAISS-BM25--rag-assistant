Each one of the 569 leave-one-out CV's will create 1 prediction, e.g. P(+) = 0.43 . Then you need to apply a threshold to this probability value which will binarise it to 0 or 1 . You then compare this binary prediction with the actual label, as a result of which your prediction for that fold will result in one of {TP, TN, FP, FN} . Since you have only one prediction per fold, constructing a confusion matrix does not sound intuitive. You can calculate the mean accuracy, mean recall, and mean other confusion matrix based metrics by taking the average of all LOOCV results, but for the reasons explained above, constructing a confusion matrix per fold does not make much sense. As for the merits of LOOCV and what to be aware of, I won't repeat what is given in this link , which I think is detailed.
