Hudson keeps failing with Phing AND Ant. Any hints?

Let's just skip right to the good stuff... errors I'm getting from the console when running Ant: phpunit: [exec] PHPUnit 3.2.16 by Sebastian Bergmann. [exec] [exec] Class /var/lib/hudson/jobs/Goals/workspace/Goals/AllTests could not be found in /var/lib/hudson/jobs/Goals/workspace/Goals/AllTests.php.

[xUnit] The plugin hasn't been performed correctly: java.io.IOException: No test report files were found. Configuration error? GitAPI created [workspace] $ /usr/bin/git tag -d hudson-Goals-31 [workspace] $ /usr/bin/git tag -a -f -m "Hudson Build #31" hudson-Goals-31-FAILURE So, any ideas what's going wrong? I get it to build just fine locally. On my VPS we get all this mess.
