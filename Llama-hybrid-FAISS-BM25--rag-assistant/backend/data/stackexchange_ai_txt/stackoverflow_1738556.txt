Detect if connection has been established

I recently began learning network programming under Linux and it seems I can't figure out the right way to detect if a connection to remote host has been established. ATM all non-established connections are registered in a epoll instance. Once an event with the EPOLLOUT flag set to 1 arrives, the connection is marked as established. As easy as this, but I'm doing this right ... Is there a better way of doing this? And if not, does waiting on a socket to become writeable is a good way to guarantee that connection has been established?
