Why do you want to do this and why don't you want to upgrade the Delphi version? Without the deprecated tag you really have no clean option to filter the use of deprecated methods. So it depend on where you want to make the concession: renaming catches the error at compiletime (unless there is another method/function with the same name within scope). all other methods are only caught at runtime. And this has a risk of slipping into the production code. What you can do, is create a deprecated log. This won't piss off anybody, and it is no complete disaster if it enters production code. But if your tests have full coverage, you will catch all the culprits. You only have to check the log file after a (test)run. And of course the best way, is to use grep to find all the occurences of the code and change it.
