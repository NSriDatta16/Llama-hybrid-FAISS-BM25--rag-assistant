I am not sure what virtual directory means by you. But I don't think pulling files directly from File System is always a bad idea. It is simple and you don't have to worry about the Directory structure (which sometimes quite troublesome to 'simulate'). Since you mentioned asp.net, I would recommend you that instead of hardcoding the root of your storage, you can pull that out to web.config file.
