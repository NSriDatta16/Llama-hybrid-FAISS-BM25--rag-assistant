Significant interaction and not significant correlation

I am currently working on my master thesis and need help. Basically, the correlation is not significant in most of the cases (except the one between the 2 DV). Despite this, I got a significant interaction between the IV and Moderator using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. My assumption is that the insignificant correlation is due to the fact that it does not take into account the influence of the Moderator (e.g. correlation between IV-DV). Respectively, in my case, one moderator influences the IV-DV relationship in a positive way and another in a totally opposite way. So I assume it cancels each other out and that's why there is not correlation. What do you think about that and how can I prove it? Or better justify my reasoning? I plotted the lines of the two-way interaction effects. It looks almost symmetrical. Would it be an argument to explain my reasoning that on average the correlation canceled each other out?
