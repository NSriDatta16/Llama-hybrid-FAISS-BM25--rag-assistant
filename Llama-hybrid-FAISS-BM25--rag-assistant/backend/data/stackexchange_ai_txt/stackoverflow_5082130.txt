NSImageView and NSUndoManager

I have a image on the view and user can drag and move the image or rotate the image with finger touch. I want to do Undo the action performed by user. Like if the image is move to new location and then user press undo button, image should move back to the previous location. Or if user rotates the image and then press undo button it should rotate image to its previous angle. It would be helpful if I get any sample example for the same. Thanks in advance
