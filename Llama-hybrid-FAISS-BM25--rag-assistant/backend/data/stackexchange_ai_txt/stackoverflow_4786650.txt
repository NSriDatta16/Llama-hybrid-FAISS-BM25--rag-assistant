NavigationBar javascript won't load in Safari/Opera

My JS script navigation bar fails to render on an aspx custom navbar in Safari, but it works fine in IE and Firefox. The bar won't expand upon bar clicking in Safari/Opera. The HTML that is generated from the aspx page will operate fine in all browsers, yet I lose my webresources(pictures) in Safari/Opera. Trouble is, I need to get this working on all browsers, and instead of creating a new navigation bar from scratch, I'd like to see if I can tweak and fix this one. I am using the Infragistics UltraWebListBar. Any ideas? DEFAULT.ASPX NavBar
