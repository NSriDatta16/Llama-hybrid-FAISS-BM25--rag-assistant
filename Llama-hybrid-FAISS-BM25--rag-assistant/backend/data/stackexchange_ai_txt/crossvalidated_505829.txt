If one picks a probability distribution $\pi$ on $\mu$ and minimises the integrated risk, this is equivalent to running a Bayesian decision analysis with this prior distribution. In this case the optimal solution is the posterior mean $$\hat\mu(x)=\mathbb E^\pi[\mu|x]$$ and the estimator is always biased. There is thus gains to be found by reaching outside unbiasedness.
