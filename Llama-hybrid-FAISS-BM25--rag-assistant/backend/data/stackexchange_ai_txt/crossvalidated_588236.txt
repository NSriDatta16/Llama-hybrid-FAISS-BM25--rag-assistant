Reframing a HMM problem as an RNN

Inspired by this question I have been considering how one would reframe a HMM problem as RNN problem. For HMMs we have some observable timeseries $y(t)$ which corresponds to a set of hidden states $q(t)$ . The transition probabilities between hidden states are described by a probability matrix $\bar{A}$ . For a Markov process, it is possible to derive an expression for the probability that the hidden path $Q$ corresponds to the observation $O$ i.e. $P(Q|O)$ . One can then use some optimisation algorithm -e.g. Viterbi to find the most probable path $Q*$ which maximises $P(Q|O)$ . But how does this formulation translate to an RNN? With RNNs we talk in the language of training data, nodes, layers etc. and I can't see how to map this to the HMM language...
