C# DataTable - row's elements become null

I have the weirdest bug - My application executes a code that causes 10 lines of results to be added to a DataTable, which is then shown on an Ultragrid. Once in ~20 runs, the following scenario happens: 1. The first row is added to the data table: DataRow drNew = dtResults.NewRow(); -- filling it with values -- dtResults.Rows.Add(drNew); The row is not null, as I have a breakpoint after checking this: if(drNew.IsNull(0)) . 2. The second row is added the same way, but after addition the following if is true: if(dtResults.Rows[0].IsNull(0)) . Any idea how this thing can happen? Thanks a lot. Edit - changed the title to be more accurate, thanks. Edit 2: I've tried to catch RowChanging and RowDeleting events and check inside them whether dtResults.Rows[0].IsNull(0) or e.Row.IsNull(0) , but I can't catch those at the time the first row changes its content from values to nulls.
