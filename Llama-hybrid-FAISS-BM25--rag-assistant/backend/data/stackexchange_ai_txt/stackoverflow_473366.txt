Prevent "Send error report to Microsoft"

I'm working on a rather large project, and its unlikely will catch everything. I've found the event that notifies me of unhandled exceptions, however I haven't found a way to programmatically shut off the windows error dialog. Ideally, if there is an unhandled exception, I would like to have that event fired, provide a dialog box telling the user that there is a problem, and then to close gracefully. Is there any way to do this? I realize I could wrap the highest layer in a try catch, but I was hoping for something a little more elegant.
