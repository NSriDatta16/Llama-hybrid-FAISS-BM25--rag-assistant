How to set facebook page order

I have a facebook page where I want to add an app as a page. In the old version you could drag'n'drop the tab order, but now I can't find any way to change the order of the pages. This is my test page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/edit/?id=192515850771209&sk=featured#!/pages/Mtest/192515850771209 The page with the red "M" is my app that I want to be able to set the order where it appears in the list. Thanks, Rob
