Qt-GUI with several "pages", how to synchronize the size of several QWidgets

I am currently writing a wizard-style application using Qt4. I am not using the wizard class however, since going next/back does not make sense from every step in the process. The user starts off at a "hub"-window with five buttons, each of which take him to another window at a different stage of the process. At the beginning all but the first button of the hub are disabled. After clearing each stage, the user will be directed back to the hub and one new button/stage will get enabled. Since every stage has significantly differing objectives, I coded every single stage as a single QWidget that gets instantiated in the main() function. To switch between the widgets, I simply hide() the one I am leaving and show() the one I am going to. However, this leads to problems if the user resized or moved one widget, since the next widget will always show up at its default position instead of the new one. Is there a way to synchronize the widgets' sizes and positions? Or, better yet, is there a more elegant way to deal with those different windows than switching between several hidden widgets? Thank you in advance!
