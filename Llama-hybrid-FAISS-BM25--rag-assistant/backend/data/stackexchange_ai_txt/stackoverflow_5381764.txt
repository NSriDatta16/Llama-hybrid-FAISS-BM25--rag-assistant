why is this verbatim string not working as I expect for a unit test assert and showing a strange value in debugger?

QUESTION: Why does the debugger show "directagents\a\aanodide" instead of the value of the verbatim string @"directagents\aanodide". UPDATE This seems to be a ReSharper quirk. To Reproduce: Enter a literal string with a "\a" in it. Apply the refactor "Change to Verbatim Sring" "\a" becomes invisible in th verbatim string "\a" is not really gone. More evidence from immediate window showing Hand Typed VS. Copy/Paste.
