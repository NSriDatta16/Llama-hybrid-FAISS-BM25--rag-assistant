AI tools/LLM models to analyze excel data

I have a bunch of excel files containing information of employee attendance. I want to use NLP-based search to ask questions like: Which employee has taken most leaves?; What dates witness a high number of leave requests?; Which gender accounts for most leaves?, etc. Are there any AI tools or LLM models that I can use to get answers to such queries by studying excel data? NOTE: The tool should provide python APIs such that I can integrate it with my application.
