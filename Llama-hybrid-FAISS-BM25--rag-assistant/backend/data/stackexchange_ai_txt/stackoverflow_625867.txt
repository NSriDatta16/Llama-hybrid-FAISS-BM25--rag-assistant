You're returning a stack-based pointer (a pointer that resides in the stack of the called process) that will be released whenever the Marks::name() method ends. This is basic C/C++ memory management question, so I encourage you to read some books on the topic. There are several ways of doing this correctly. For example, reserving the memory for the string in the calling function and passing this pointer to the function: In the main() method: char name[30]; Marks test1; test1.name(name); (here name has the correct value) with the corresponding method: char* Marks::name(char* temp) { cout But there are other ways of managing static and dynamic memory for strings.
