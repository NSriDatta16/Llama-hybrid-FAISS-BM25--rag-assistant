For SQL Server stuff there is pretty much no one on the planet who has the chops of Itzik Ben-Gan. He has several books on T-SQL itself and does an excellent job of getting you into theory and the inner workings of the language as well as the engine. http://www.solidq.com/insidetsql/ Just to give you an idea, most people who work with SQL Server have come across the ubiquitous blog of Pinal Dave, this post from his blog about Itzik is a pretty good testimony on this guy. http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2009/11/01/sql-authority-news-advanced-t-sql-with-itzik-ben-gan-solid-quality-mentors/
