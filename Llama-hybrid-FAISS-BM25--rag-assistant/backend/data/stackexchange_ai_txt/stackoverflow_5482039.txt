Pull variables from separate function

If I have two public functions and I want to pull a variable from one inside of another, what is the best way to accomplish this? I know about 'global' but this method seems like it could cause me problems down the road. Imagine I have something like this: class myCMS { public function process_apples() { $a = $_POST['$apples']; } public function display_apples() { echo $a; } } How would I go about using display_apples() to report $a from process_apples() ? Im new to PHP, so feel free to let me know if I am violating some best practicing for organizing my code.
