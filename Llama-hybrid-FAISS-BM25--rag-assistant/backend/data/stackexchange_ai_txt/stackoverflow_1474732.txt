The most simple approach is to precede the formula with the fragment b = input("Enter b:") c = input("Enter c:") d = input("Enter d:") A few things to note: this will require console IO, so you best start the script from a console input() causes the string entered to be eval()'ed, meaning that it gets processes as if it was a Python expression. This is useful for numbers, but may have confusing side effects; consider using raw_input() , along with float() instead.
