Depends on what do you mean by better. I'm keeping performance out of question as the difference in performance between the two approaches will be very minimal (if at all there is any) and can be ignored. Then it is entirely a design question. Things for which you need to find answers are: Do you want your clients to seamlessly replace SaeStorage with Storage, and SaeStorage is a special type of Storage? If yes then extend otherwise don't. Is SaeStorage just a behavior? For example Storage is a storage device and the way they save things varies. SaeStorage is just one of the ways you save things. Then use second approach, which is kind of a strategy pattern . Even if SaeStorage is a special storage you might want to use strategy pattern to decouple behavior from interface.
