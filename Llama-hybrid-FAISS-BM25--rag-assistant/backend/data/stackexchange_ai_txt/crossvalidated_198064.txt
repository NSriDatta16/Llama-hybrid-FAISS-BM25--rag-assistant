Tensors often offer more natural representations of data, e.g., consider video, which consists of obviously correlated images over time. You can turn this into a matrix, but it's just not natural or intuitive (what does a factorization of some matrix-representation of video mean?). Tensors are trending for several reasons: our understanding of multilinear algebra is improving rapidly, specifically in various types of factorizations, which in turn helps us to identify new potential applications (e.g., multiway component analysis ) software tools are emerging (e.g., Tensorlab ) and are being welcomed Big Data applications can often be solved using tensors, for example recommender systems , and Big Data itself is hot increases in computational power, as some tensor operations can be hefty (this is also one of the major reasons why deep learning is so popular now)
