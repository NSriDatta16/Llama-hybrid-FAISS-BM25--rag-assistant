Go to Windows -> Preferences : In the dialog, select Java -> Code Style -> Formatter and select Edit . Under the line wrapping tab, Function Calls -> Qualified invocations , you select indent by one , or Default Indentation at the bottom drop down menu (Indentation policy) This one is probably set to Indent on column ... this is what you do NOT want. Edit and note : I use Helios SR1. I think the options are the same on Ganymede or Galileo though.
