Unless this is a reserved term in some domains, uniform sampling means [for me] sampling from the Uniform distribution. Here is the outcome from an iid Uniform sample of size 1000 over the unit square: As clear from the above, the simulated points are irregularly located over that square. However, by simple virtue of the law of large numbers, the coverage of any subset of the unit square by the sample will converge to the surface of this subset.
