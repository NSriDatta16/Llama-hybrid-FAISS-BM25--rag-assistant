Setting bounds to a div, via keyboard control

Ok, I have removed my code from here in favour of uploading the lot here: http://www.project-vanquish.co.cc/jRPGrid-v0.4b/index.html (please ignore any SQL errors) Clicking on a Grid-Node - moves the character to the position (boundries enabled) Dragging the character - moves to the position (boundries enabled) Using the keyboard cursor keys - moves the character (no boundries). I would like to set the boundries of the #character to be #map, via keyboard - the boundries work with the mouse
