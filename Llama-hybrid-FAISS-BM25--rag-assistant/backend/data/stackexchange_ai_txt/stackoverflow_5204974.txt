Often I find useful user interaction related tasks in UIResponder class , which is the super class of UIControl - UIButton . Read about – touchesBegan:withEvent: , – touchesMoved:withEvent: , – touchesEnded:withEvent: , – touchesCancelled:withEvent: in http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html You may find ways to customize user interaction for your UIButton . By the way, I don't think there will be any problem subclassing UIButton , no matter what you've heard, as long as your implementation is correctly added to the super class implementation, or does responsibly override it altogether.
