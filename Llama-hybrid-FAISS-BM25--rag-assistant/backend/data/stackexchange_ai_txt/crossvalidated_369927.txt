My normal disclaimers apply. I would start by looking at the data with my eyes to get a sense of the time-domain characteristic scales, and make sure my sampling was sufficient. That means hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly. All those times would have to be in the input data. I would look at the data with my eyes to get a sense of the spatial distribution, which includes the diameter of "storms", and the center-track to center-track variation storm-to-storm. This would give me both the spatial sample-to-sample distance, and the width of the whole spatial field. Let's say that I had that kind of data, how do I pre-process it to accelerate convergence? Options can include: center by central tendence, scale by tendency of variation use PCA to change to an "eigen" domain, and work in those terms detrend Use Fourier methods to pull out the clearly cyclic stuff Use time-series over very long times to pull out seasonality and trending this list is potentially infinitely long.... The "why" I use drives the "what". If my phenomena is stationary then center + scale (#1) is great for moving all the values close to one (reduce numeric runaways) and making scales more human-comprehensible. If I have spanned all data, and there isn't a whole lot of variation (not very common in weather) then PCA can be deeply amazing for dimensionality reduction. If my phenomena is fundamentally linear then detrend allows me to do a pre-process that makes the learner spend more of its training cycles doing the hard work instead of non-value-returning work. If my phenomena is clearly cycling (think electric circuits, electric motors, or acoustics) then Fourier isn't a bad way to recontrive the domain simple and informatively. If my phenomena is fundamentally, and non-chaotically autoregressive then the time-series approach isn't bad. Again it speaks to the "physics" of the problem and re-contrives it so the learner has a much simpler job. Good news: Weather is less crazy than the stock market. Bad news: Weather is much tougher than many other problems.
