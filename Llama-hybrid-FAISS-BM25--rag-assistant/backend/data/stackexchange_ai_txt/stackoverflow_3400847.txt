A python module for global parameters - is this good practice?

I'm a mechanical engineering student, and I'm building a physical simulation using PyODE. instead of running everything from one file, I wanted to organize stuff in modules so I had: main.py callback.py helper.py I ran into problems when I realized that helper.py needed to reference variables from main, but main was the one importing helper! so my solution was to create a 4th file, which houses variables and imports only external modules (such as time and random). so I now have: main.py callback.py helper.py parameters.py and all scripts have: import parameters and use: parameters.foo or parameters.bar . Is this an acceptable practice or is this a sure fire way to make python programmers puke? :) Please let me know if this makes sense, or if there is a more sensible way of doing it! Thanks, -Leav
