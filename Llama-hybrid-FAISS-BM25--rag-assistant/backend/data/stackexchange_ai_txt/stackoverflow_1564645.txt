To install PostgreSQL contrib modules on Ubuntu or Kubuntu (or similar Linux distributions): Install the contrib package: sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib Change to the database owner account (e.g., postgres ). CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp"; If you are trying to install non-"trusted" modules, you need to be a superuser to install them. Otherwise, you only need to have CREATE privilege on the database you are trying to use the module on. For versions before 9.1, do step #1 above, and then: Restart the database: sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart Change to the database owner account (e.g., postgres ). Change to the contrib modules' directory: /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/ Use ls to see a list of the following modules: adminpack autoinc btree_gin btree_gist chkpass citext cube dblink dict_int dict_xsyn earthdistance fuzzystrmatch hstore insert_username int_aggregate isn lo ltree moddatetime pageinspect pg_buffercache pgcrypto pg_freespacemap pgrowlocks pg_stat_statements pgstattuple pg_trgm pgxml refint seg sslinfo tablefunc test_parser timetravel tsearch2 uuid-ossp Load the SQL files using: psql -U user_name -d database_name -f module_name.sql For example, if your administrative user was named postgres and your database was named storage and the module you wanted was cube , you would type: psql -U postgres -d storage -f cube.sql
