SQL group by: using where-clause logic to filter results based on aggregate functions

I have a basic group by/avg statement: select url, avg(contentping+tcpping), count(*) from websites ws, ping pi where ws.idwebsite = pi.idwebsite and errortype is null group by url order by avg(contentping+tcpping) asc; What I want to do now is to drop any results which have a higher than average ping of 500. How can I do this...?
