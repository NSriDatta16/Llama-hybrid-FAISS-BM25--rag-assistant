Most CPU varieties don't allow memory-to-memory moves. Normally the CPU can access only one memory location at at time, which means you need a temporary spot to store the value when moving it (a general purpose register, usually). If you think about it, moving directly from one memory location to another would require that the CPU be able to access two different spots in RAM simultaneously - that means two full memory controllers at least, and even then, the chances they'd "play nice" enough to access the same RAM would be pretty bad. The chip designers might have been able to pull some tricks to allow direct copies from one RAM chip to another, but that would be a pretty special-application kind of feature that would just add cost and complexity to solve a very uncommon problem. You might be able to use some special DMA hardware to make it look to your program like memory is being moved without that temporary storage, at least from the perspective of your CPU.
