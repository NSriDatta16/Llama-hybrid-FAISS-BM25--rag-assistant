You cannot rely on ADF to identify whether this time series is stationary for two reasons. This time series looks like it could have a seasonal trend, but ADF only tests for presence of a unit root. ADF will not help you if there's a seasonal trend. This looks like a sample size of 30 or so, i.e. well within the range where most of the information you have on this time series is going to come from your priors. You should really just ask yourself, do you expect your time series to be stationary or not? What is this a time series of? For instance, if these are quarterly earnings, I would not expect them to be stationary before taking first differences. But if it's GDP growth rates, I'd look at that and go "Looks ok."
