Use gl_VertexID built-in attribute. I honestly don't see how are you going to search the color (given the index) in you color array. Instead, I would create a special buffer object for vertex color and draw color buffer into it (bound as a target Texture Buffer Object). A geometry shader in this case would generate line strips with desired color, like this: - create point at 0 - create point at 1280 - get color from the palette, pass it to fragment shader This operation is pretty cheap for HW, would give you exact color for each vertex, based on the palette data you provide.
