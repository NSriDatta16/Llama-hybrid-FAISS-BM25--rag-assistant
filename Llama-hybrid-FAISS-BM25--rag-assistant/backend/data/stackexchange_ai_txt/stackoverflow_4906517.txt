Most likely you want to extend normal GEF drag and drop to contain also Image drag support. When you drag items inside GEF editor you can drag them as Figures (actually it is bit more complex, it is using Request-Command pattern). But when your drag goes over the editor borders you need to be able to provide ie. Image out of this data. SWT Provides support for multiple different Drag Data Transfers like this: dragSource.setTransfer(new Transfer[] { FileTransfer.getInstance(), ImageTransfer.getInstance() }); So I believe that you want to find a way in GEF DragTracker to also include this ImageTransfer to the OS Drag. DragTrackers are GEF way of handling drag, and are returned in EditPart's function getDragTracker() I am not totally sure how that can be done, but extending own DragTracker that is also able to provide also OS level Image should do the trick. Case is quite similar to copy pasting, and in basic GMF editor it is possible to copy paste items as images outside the editor to any tool that is accepting images.
