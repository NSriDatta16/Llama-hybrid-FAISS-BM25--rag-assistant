Can a time series model be adequate and still have a few lags sticking out?

I needed to find an adequate model for a time series using SAS and I found two slightly different models that were adequate according to the white noise test. All of the transformations and things I added to the model were also significant according to SAS but there are still about 4 lags that are slightly sticking out for the auto correlations and partial auto correlations. The four lags that are sticking out are spread out between lags 30 and 100, the entire data has 397 lags, and it's the same lags that are slightly sticking out for both the auto correlations and partial auto correlations. Is it possible that a model can be adequate but still have a few lags that slightly stick out?
