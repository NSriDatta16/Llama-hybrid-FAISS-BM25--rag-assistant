VAR regression between I(1) and I(0)

I am considering two time series and I would like to to a VAR regression between them. The ADF test rejected stationarity in only one of them, so the time series would be I(0) and I(1). I understand the two processes can not be cointegrated since one of them is I(0). Can I proceed with a VAR regression of the 'levels' of the two variables? Should I consider doing a VAR of the I(0) in levels and the differences in the I(1)? Should I still consider a VECM?
