Yes. It is known as "Rapid Application Development" or RAD. Under RAD, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are developed using a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) GUI editing software. In practice, most of these tools are imperfect and still require some manual modification of the generated code. So, even when using these tools, you should consider them to be more of an aid to automation or simplification of your workflow but not a complete replacement for writing UI code. For Android applications (which are typically written in Java), the Android Studio IDE comes with a mechanism for creating some parts of the UI via drag-and-drop. For iOS, Apple's Xcode tools package includes Interface Builder , which lets you construct the UI for iOS apps via drag-and-drop. For web applications, the Polymer Designer and Google Web Designer may be of interest. Not that you should be writing native desktop applications, but if you are... For Java, the NetBeans IDE features a very high quality GUI editor which generates Java code using the Java Swing classes. For C++, QtCreator features a high quality GUI editor using the Qt framework.
