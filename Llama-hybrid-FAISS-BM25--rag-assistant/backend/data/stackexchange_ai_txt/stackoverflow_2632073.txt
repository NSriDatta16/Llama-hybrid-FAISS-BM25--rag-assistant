The $_POST , $_GET , and $_COOKIE globals are pre-sanitized if global XSS filtering is turned on (it's on by default). That's one of the reasons why your code extends the Kohana classes, so that housekeeping stuff like input sanitization is taken care of for you. They encourage use of the input library methods, though, so there's no reason not to use them. They may just use $_POST in the validation examples because they want to explain the different libraries independent of one another. Their code to instantiate a validation class should be: $post = new Validation( $this->input->post() ); And yes, by all means use them together! It's all meant to fit together nicely.
