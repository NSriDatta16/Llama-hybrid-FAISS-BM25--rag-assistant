Sampling error for proportion with finite population - which correction to use?

I am trying to calculate sampling error for a questionnaire that was answered by some of the participants in a program (say about . I want to calculate the sampling error for the proportion of the respondents that answered "yes" to a "yes/no" question. I have seen some sites that use this formula for the calculation: Sampling Error = Z * (p(1-p)/n)^0.5 * ((N-n)/(N-1))^0.5 where Z stands for the Z score for the selected confidence level, p stands for the expected proportion (the sample proportion is used) N is the size of the population (all the program participants in my example) n is the number of respondents. I have also seen discussed a different formula: Sampling Error = Z * (p*(1–p)/n)^0.5 * (1–(n/N)^0.5) The two formulas yeald very different solutions. My friend ChatGPT says the first formula is more conservative but there are contexts where the second formula is a good choice too, but cannot explain what the difference is, what the pros and cons are for each formula or which situations would call for using one or the other. Could anyone shed light on the subject? Many thanks.
