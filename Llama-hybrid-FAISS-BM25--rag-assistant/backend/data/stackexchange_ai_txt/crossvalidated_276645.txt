Arrows of underlying variables in PCA biplot in R

At the risk of making the question software-specific, and with the excuse of its ubiquity and idiosyncrasies, I want to ask about the function biplot() in R, and, more specifically, about the calculation and plotting of its default, superimposed red arrows, corresponding to the underlying variables. [To make sense of some of the comments, the plots initially posted had a sclaing problem of scarce interest, and are now erased.]
