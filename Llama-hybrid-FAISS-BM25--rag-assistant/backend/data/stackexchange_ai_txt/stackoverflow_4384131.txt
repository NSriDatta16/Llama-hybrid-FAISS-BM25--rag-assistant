Direct from Django model field reference : Field.null If True , Django will store empty values as NULL in the database. Default is False . Note that empty string values will always get stored as empty strings, not as NULL . Only use null=True for non-string fields such as integers, booleans and dates. For both types of fields, you will also need to set blank=True if you wish to permit empty values in forms, as the null parameter only affects database storage (see blank ). Avoid using null on string-based fields such as CharField and TextField unless you have an excellent reason. If a string-based field has null=True , that means it has two possible values for “no data”: NULL, and the empty string. In most cases, it’s redundant to have two possible values for “no data;” Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL . Field.blank If True , the field is allowed to be blank. Default is False . Note that this is different than null . null is purely database-related, whereas blank is validation-related. If a field has blank=True , validation on Django’s admin site will allow entry of an empty value. If a field has blank=False , the field will be required. Field.default The default value for the field. This can be a value or a callable object. If callable it will be called every time a new object is created.
