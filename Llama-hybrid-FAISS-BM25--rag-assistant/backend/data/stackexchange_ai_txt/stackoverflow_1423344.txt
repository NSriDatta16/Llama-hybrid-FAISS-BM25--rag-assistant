This is a good place to use a generator function to skip the lines of ---- 's and yield something that the csv module can read. def readCleanLines( someFile ): for line in someFile: if line.strip() == len(line.strip())*'-': continue yield line reader= csv.reader( readCleanLines( someFile ) ) for row in reader: print row This should handle the line breaks inside quotes seamlessly and silently. If you want to do other things with this file, for example, save a copy with the ---- lines removed, you can do this. with open( "source", "r" ) as someFile: with open( "destination", "w" ) as anotherFile: for line in readCleanLines( someFile ): anotherFile.write( line ) That will make a copy with the ---- lines removed. This isn't really worth the effort, since reading and skipping the lines is very, very fast and doesn't require any additional storage.
