XML or SQL?

I am just beginning to get into desktop application development, and have chosen C# to do so. After making some basic programs, I am wanting to get into more useful creations for myself. I was thinking about making a Project time tracker, as well as a password safe type program of my own. Both of these require taking in information that needs to be stored. The way I have come across is to use a SQL server for the storage aspect, but from what I have gathered that requires me to have a SQL server installation on all the computers I plan to use these programs with does it not? So I have been leaning towards XML, as it seems to be more mobile and open, but is this a viable option for data storage? And can it be properly encrypted when I get to that step in my password safe program? Which of these should I begin to implement in my desktop based applications, or is there an alternative I have missed that would be better.
