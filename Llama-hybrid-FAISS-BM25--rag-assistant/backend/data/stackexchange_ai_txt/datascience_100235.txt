Low P value in Chi-squared test but low coefficient in logistic regression

I ran a chi squared test on multiple features & also used these features to build a binary classifier using logistic regression. The feature which had the least p value (~0.1) had a low coefficient (=0) whereas the feature which had a higher p value (~0.3) had a high coefficient (~2.9). How do I interpret this? Is it possible for a feature to have low p value but have zero coefficient?
