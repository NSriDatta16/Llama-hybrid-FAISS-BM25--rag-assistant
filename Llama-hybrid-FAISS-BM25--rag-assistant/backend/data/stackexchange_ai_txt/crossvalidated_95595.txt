What kind of stochastic processes can Ljungâ€“Box_test apply to or assume?

Ljung-Box test tests zero autocorrelation in a time series. I wonder what type of stochastic processes the test assumes on the time series? For example, whenever autocorrelation exists? By assumption, I mean the one that holds under both the null and alternative hypotheses. So the null will be the assumption plus zero autocorrelation. (Therefore the alternative will be the assumption plus nonzero autocorrelation.) Thanks! :)
