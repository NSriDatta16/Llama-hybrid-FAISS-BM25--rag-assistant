i need drag n drop in jquery?

I'v bean searching for a such plugin and I think found it http://batiste.dosimple.ch/blog/posts/2008-05-18-1/jquery-drag-and-drop-and-resize-event-delegation.html but the problem is .. how can I define events? .. when the object gets dropped or re-sized I call a function that print all changes in some like name:div1; top:10; left:12; width:100; height:19; .. Is that possible fir this plug-in or any other? if there is any plug-in that does it all?
