Why is gradient descent not used for ARIMA model estimation?

Gradient descent is used for linear and logistic regression. It seems to me that could be used equally well for estimating the coefficients of an ARIMA model once the order parameters (p,q,d) have been determined. But it seems that Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is the preferred method. Why is Gradient Descent not used? What advantages does MLE have over GD and SGD ?
