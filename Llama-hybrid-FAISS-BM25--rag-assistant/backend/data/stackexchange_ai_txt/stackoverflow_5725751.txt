ASP.NET has a profile provider that's built to store a user's profile. You could use your own provider that's session backed if you really only want the profile to last for the duration of the session. Your last comment makes me think you want to use isolated storage on the client machine; I don't think you can access isolated storage on the client from a browser w/o an ActiveX control or something like that.
