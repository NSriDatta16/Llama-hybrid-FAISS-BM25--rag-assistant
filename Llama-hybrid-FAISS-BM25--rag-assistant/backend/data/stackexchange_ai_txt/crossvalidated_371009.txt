How to forecast a set of different time series?

I am trying to forecast a large set of time series that feature very different characteristics. The figure below shows three exemplary series: My first idea was to identify periodical repetitions as they are present in the upmost subplot. For this I followed the advice from this answer . I hoped that for very periodic data I would find significant peaks in the power spectrum of the time series and could thus distinguish between series with and without repetitive patterns. However when I used the scipy's periodogram function on the data I was not able to get a distinctive difference for the three example time series, as shown in the following figures: Periodogram of time series #1: Periodogram of time series #2: Periodogram of time series #3: What different method can I use to identify periodic patterns and utilize this information to optimize forecasting?
