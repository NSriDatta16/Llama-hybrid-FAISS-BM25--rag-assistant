More "accurate" depends on What you define as accurate (for example the technique that will give you the closest predicted to the actual observed values) and The nature of your data. Linear regression for example is most accurate when the nature of the phenomenon you study is indeed linear. If not other techniques might prove more useful. If you are only interested in prediction I would recommend Machine Learning techniques like Random Forest or Support Vector Machines to you: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html . Considering that your data is financial the financial task view on CRAN might also be a good starting point: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html .
