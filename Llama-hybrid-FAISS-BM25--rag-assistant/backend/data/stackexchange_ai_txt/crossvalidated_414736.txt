With 10k rows that small number 25 of features should be no problem. And, if it should show a problem, you could try regularizing. Deep neural networks generally are for big data problems, with only 10k rows go for something more traditional, start out with logistic regression. Mixed data is no problem for logistic regression. Then you could compare results with decision trees and random forests.
