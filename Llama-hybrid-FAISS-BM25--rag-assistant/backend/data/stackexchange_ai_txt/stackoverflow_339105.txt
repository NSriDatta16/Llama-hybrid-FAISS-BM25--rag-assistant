RoR: FasterCSV to hash

I'm really struggling with grasping how to effectively use FasterCSV to accomplish what I want. I have a CSV file; say: ID,day,site test,tuesday,cnn.com bozo,friday,fark.com god,monday,xkcd.com test,saturday,whatever.com I what to go through this file and end up with a hash that has a counter for how many times the first column occurred. So: ["test" => 2, "bozo" => 1, "god" => 1] I need to be able to do this without prior knowledge of the values in the first column. ?
