"Pragmatic" trials: what are they?

On twitter, a trialist Stuart Nicholls critiqued a recently published study by saying: Further to the very interesting paper by Dal-Re they flag several examples that question usage of the term pragmatic. Can a phase 3, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, dose increment randomised trial really be called 'pragmatic'? The research article in question is linked here . The paper by Dal-Re is here . And their recommended "pragmatism" tool is here . I might differ with Nicholls because my sense is that with the nature of the treatment and with the N of 171 patients, this is probably an underpowered study... but does that make it pragmatic (as opposed to, say, confirmatory?). I feel like I'm missing the point. What, in fact, is a pragmatic trial? When is a trial not pragmatic in the sense that it is of no use, and when is a trial not pragmatic in the sense that it is a confirmatory trial?
