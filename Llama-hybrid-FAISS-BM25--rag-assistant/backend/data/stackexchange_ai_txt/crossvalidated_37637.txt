I may be missing something here but is there any reason you can't use a standard t test? You have two outcome groups, your goal is simply to determine whether they have different mean dosages. It does require that you swap you IV and DV, but in this instance that may be ok. If you don't need to control for any other variables, the t test will give you the probability that there is a significant difference between the two groups in terms of original dosage. As a simpler model, it will be more easily interpretable and widely understood than logistic regression - important for any peer reviewed work. Further, you can use Cohen's D to get an effect size measure if you need that.
