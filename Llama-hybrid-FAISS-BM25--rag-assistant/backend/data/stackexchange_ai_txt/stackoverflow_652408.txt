Silverlight Video Stretching

What I want: To be able to resize the actual video inside the SL player with JS as I drag the corner. What I have so far: http://resopollution.com/granicus/silverlight_test/test_silverlight.html (try dragging the corner, it crops the video, not resizing the video). I'm using jquery to dynamically resize the outer div and the OBJECT tag in here... XAML: Any ideas if it's possible to be dynamically altering the actual size of the video itself?
