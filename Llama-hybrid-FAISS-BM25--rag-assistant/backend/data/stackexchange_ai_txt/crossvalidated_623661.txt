Can MCP or SCAD penalized regression be rephrased as a Bayesian regression with a particular prior on the coefficients?

So given that the coefficients of a ridge regression with a squared L2 norm penalty corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of a Bayesian regression with Gaussian priors on the coefficients and LASSO regression coefficients with L1 norm penalty to the MAP estimate of a Bayesian regression with Laplace priors on the coefficients, is there any known prior distributions in Bayesian regression that would lead to the MAP estimates being equivalent to MCP or SCAD penalized regression ? Or could they be approximated by ridge or lasso regressions but with a particular choice of adaptive penalties (in the same way that LASSO can be approximated by adaptive ridge regression with adaptive penalties)? In which case they might still have some empirical Bayesian interpretation?
