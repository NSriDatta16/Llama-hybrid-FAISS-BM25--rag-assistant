Organizing my own external libraries in revision control

I want to set up a SVN repository to "revision-control" my projects. Currently my workspace looks like this, and I intend to keep it like that: \workspace \myPrj1 \myPrj2 \myLibBase \myLibA \myLibB myPrj1 is using myLibBase and myLibA . myPrj2 is using myLibBase and myLibB . I will have more Projects coming up, that will use the libraries. I've written and am writing the libraries myself. While I am working on any of the projects I constantly tried to improve not just the project but also the libraries: find bugs, add features, etc. Now how do I organize this in a repository? This is my idea, but is it the best solution? I will always use the workspace as the project root. I will always include the libraries a project is using in the snv project folder I will always have additional snv projects for the libraries Then in the repository the above example would look like this: \repository \myPrj1 \myPrj1 \myLibBase \myLibA \myProj2 \myProj2 \myLibBase \myLibB \myLibBase \myLibBase \myLibA \myLibA \myLibB \myLibB Having it like this ...concerning the projects: Whenever I check-in a working-copy of a project, I always have all sources, including the libraries check-in together. So when I check-out a revision, I always get all sources (including the libraries) as they were at the moment of the check-in. ...concerning the libraries: Additionally I can check-in a working-copy of a library in the libraries svn project, when I think it is a nice and stable version. That version could then be checked-out when I create a new project. Can somebody confirm that this is a good idea? Best practise? Is there a better approach? Can I find documentation/tutorials/.. on this topic? On the web? In a book?
