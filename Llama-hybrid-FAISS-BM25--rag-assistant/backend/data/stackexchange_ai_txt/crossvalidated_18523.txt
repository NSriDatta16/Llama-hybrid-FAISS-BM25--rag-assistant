You're going to have a little bit of trouble modeling a series with 2 levels of seasonality using an ARIMA model. Getting this right is going highly dependent on setting things up correctly. Have you considered a simple linear model yet? They're a lot faster and easier to fit than ARIMA models, and if you use dummy variables for your different seasonality levels they are often quite accurate. I'm assuming you have hourly data, so make sure your TS object is setup with a frequency of 24. You can model other levels of seasonality using dummy variables. For example, you might want a set of 0/1 dummies representing the month of the year. Include the dummy variables in the xreg argument, along with any covariates (like temperature). Fit the model with the arima function in base R. This function can handle ARMAX models through the use of the xreg argument. Try the Arima and auto.arima functions in the forecast package. auto.arima is nice because it will automatically find good parameters for your arima model. However, it will take FOREVER to fit on your dataset. Try the tslm function in the arima package, using dummy variables for each level of seasonality. This will fit a lot faster than the Arima model, and may even work better in your situation. If 4/5/6 don't work, THEN start worrying about transfer functions. You have to crawl before you can walk. If you are planning to forecast into the future, you will first need to forecast your xreg variables. This is easy for seasonal dummies, but you'll have to think about how to make a good weather forecasts. Maybe use the median of historical data? Here is an example of how I would approach this: #Setup a fake time series set.seed(1) library(lubridate) index
