found the problem...the constructor for the map was wrong...it should be like this... Public Class DesignMap Inherits ClassMap(Of Design) Public Sub New() Table("DesignList") Id(Function(x) x.DesignId) Map(Function(x) x.DesignType) References(Function(x) x.Designer, "DesignerId") End Sub End Class problems of working in both C# and vb.net at the same time i guess..!! and "Matthew Talbert" was correct...making all the properties Overrideable is important.. thanks guys...:)
