Your going to want to look at a few things to determine 'idle' and also explore the sysinfo() call (the link points out the difference in the structure that it populates between various kernel versions). Linux does not manage memory in a typical way. Don't just look at loads, look at memory. In particular, /proc/meminfo has a wonderful line started with Committed_AS, which shows you how much memory the kernel has actually promised to other processes. Compare that with what you learned from sysinfo and you might realize that a one minute load average of 0.00 doesn't mean that its time to run some program that wants to allocate 256MB of memory, since the kernel may be really over-selling. Note, all values filled by sysinfo() are available via /proc, sysinfo() is just an easier way to get them. You would also want to look at how much time each core has spent in IOWAIT since boot, which is an even stronger indicator of if you should run an I/O resource hog. Grab that info in /proc/stat, the first line contains the aggregate count of all CPU's. IOWAIT is in the 6'th field. Of course if you intend to set affinity to a single CPU, only that CPU would be of interest (its still the sixth field, in units of USER_HZ or typically in 100'ths of a second). Average that against btime, also found in /proc/stat. In short, don't just look at load averages. EDIT You should not assume a lack of user input means idle.. cron jobs tend to run .. public services get taxed from time to time, etc. Idle remains your best guess based on reading the values (or perhaps more) that I listed above. EDIT 2 Looking at the knob values in /proc/sys/vm also gives you a good indication of what the user thinks is idle, in particular swappiness. I realize your doing this only on your own box but this is an authoritative wiki and the question title is generic :)
