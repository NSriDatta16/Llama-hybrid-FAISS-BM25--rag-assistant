There are 2 solutions to your problem. 1) Setting the alpha of the keyboard to 0 will make the keyboard invisible... which may be all you want. The cursor will appear. 2) UITextField implements the UITextInputTraits Protocol. It will always call the keyboard when it becomes the first responder. You will need to inherit from either it or anther class to change that default behavior. Good luck. If you tell us what your trying to accomplish we might be about to suggest a more elegant way of accomplishing it. Have fun.
