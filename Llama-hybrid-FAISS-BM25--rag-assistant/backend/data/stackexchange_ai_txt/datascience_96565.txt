How should I implement machine learning for multi-tenant website?

The company I work for has a website for personal use to track leads and opportunities. I implemented a linear regression algorithm to predict a score for opportunities which is trained on the historical data of the company (I got an accuracy of about 85-90%). Now the company would like to make their website available for other users too. I would like to know how should I train this model for multi-tenant so that it predicts based on the data of the company using it or should I train the model on a sample dataset and use that to predict for all users. Also, since in the beginning, the company will not have any data, how should I train the model? As I am a beginner in machine learning, maybe I am missing some concepts used for this type of problem. Any resources are also welcome.
