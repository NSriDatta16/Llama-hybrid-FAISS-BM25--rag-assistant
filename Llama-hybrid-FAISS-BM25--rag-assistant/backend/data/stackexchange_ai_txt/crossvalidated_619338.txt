How does lowess handle gaps in time series?

I have been using the lowess smoother to calculate trends for time series data for a while now but until now my data was always without gaps. I now have to work with data where there are quite large gaps in time (~2h for minute sampled data so ~120 missing samples) and by reading the documentation and looking at the actual implementation of the lowess smoother in the statsmodels package I couldn't really find out how it handles missing data. The produced trend for data is obviously not correct and the console output confirms that this somehow causes a problem since I get warnings regarding dividing by zero or another invalid number. Any fraction of data over 0.03 results in a trend that reaches 1e26 while the data is closer to 0.4. Lower values produce a trend which does not follow the data as it should with such a low value. Does anyone know how exactly gaps are handled or if I have to divide my data into chunks without gaps? EDIT: I just found the error, numpy and python integers have different sizes so for my data some timestamps were suddenly negative resulting in the spiky trend.
