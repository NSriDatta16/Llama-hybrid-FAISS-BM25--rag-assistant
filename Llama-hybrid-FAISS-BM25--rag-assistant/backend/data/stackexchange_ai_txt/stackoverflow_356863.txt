If this number will be ever be referenced by humans, I encourage you to follow these guidelines in your solution: What is the best format for a customer number, order number? If you can't synchorize with the database to see what the next number will be, and you can't use GUIDs or a comparably long random string, then you need to include some sort of local value in the ID. e.g., if all clients will be on a known network, you can end each number in each client's ip address D block. Or, if clients have to login and each user can login only once at a time, you can include their userid in the number somewhere.
