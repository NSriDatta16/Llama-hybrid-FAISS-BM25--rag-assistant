Embedding bold font in AS3 Flash dynamic field

I have already googled and read a lot of different topics relating to this problem, but still cant solve mine. I have this dynamic text field in a movieclip, and I embeded upper case, lower case and numbers. I exported that movieclip, then used it in my class and it's loading data from xml. However, after I embedded the bold fonts, it stopped displaying data from xml, if I use regular, it's fine. Then I created a font symbol and add the bold font in the library, it still doesn't give me anything. Does anyone know how to solve this problem? thanks.
