As already said by Paparazzi , the paper is about Monte Carlo method, not Markov Chain Monte Carlo . MCMC is just a part of a broader family of Monte Carlo methods (i.e., informally, using simulation to solve statistical problems). This is actually described in the referred paper [...] I was convalescing from an illness and playing solitaires. The question was what are the chances that a Canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? After spending a lot of time trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method than "abstract thinking" might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. [...] So it's pure Monte Carlo: he simulated a number of plays and then counted the number of events of interest among the all simulated events. It was obtained using a direct simulation. Actually MCMC was discovered later with Metropolis algorithm being the first MCMC algorithm as described in A Short History of Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Subjective Recollections from Incomplete Data paper by Robert and Casella (2011).
