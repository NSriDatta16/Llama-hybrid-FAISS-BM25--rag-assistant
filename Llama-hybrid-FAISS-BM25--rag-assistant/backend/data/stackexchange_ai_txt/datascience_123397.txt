Graph embeddings are like codes that turn complex relationships in a network into simple numbers. These numbers represent how connected nodes are in the graph. Think of it like turning friendships on social media into scores that show how close people are. These embeddings are used to solve problems like recommendation systems (suggesting friends or products), fraud detection (finding unusual connections), and understanding networks in biology or social science. They help computers understand and make predictions about these relationships in a simpler way.
