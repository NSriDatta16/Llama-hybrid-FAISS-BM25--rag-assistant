Yes. It is possible. Why would someone do it? Is is being used as a fragment anchor. This is not the case in your example because there is no name attribute. But if it had a name="myfragment" and the page file name was page.html , then page.html#fragment would automatically scroll the browser to that point on the page. It is being used only for styling purposes. This could be a reason for doing it, but it is not a good reason, because styling can be accomplished either way. It is being assigned an href attribute programmatically with javascript. For example, I could have a script that selects all the a tags with a specific class and assigns an href based on the text value, such as $("a.cs_import").attr("href",getHref(this.text())); , where getHref(innerText) is a javascript function that gets the URL from the description text. There is almost always a better way to do things than this, but there are some circumstances that warrant it.
