I don't think it matters. You can run a 64-bit from your Desktop, an external drive, etc. the same way you can run a 32-bit app. I think the difference is purely for organization. Or say you are developing a 32-bit and a 64-bit version of an application, you could install both of them and run them side by side by putting them in the separate Program Files folders.
