Your 'question' consists of way too many parts (the dragging is a different question entirely, one I advice you to look up on Google). And the adding part is easy. The hard part is; where are you getting those images from? Assuming you have an array with image names, it would be something like this; for( NSString *imageName in (NSArray *)imageNames ) { UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:imageName]; UIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:image]; // .. you might want to set a frame to your imageView .. // [self.view addSubview:imageView]; [imageView release]; } Of course, this is not what you want, but with the little information provided, it was the best I could do with my spare time.
