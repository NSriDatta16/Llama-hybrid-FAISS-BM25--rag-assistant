I say most companies have cowboy coding because their management simply doesn't care about the development process...they just want things done quickly. Of course the better companies..and the ones you want to work for should have a process in place. I find Agile methodologies & practices such as Scrum, Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration, and Iterative development are most used by these companies. I've recently taken the challenge of starting at a large organization that has cowboy coding..and i'm introducing agile methodologies to change processes here and improve quality a bit.
