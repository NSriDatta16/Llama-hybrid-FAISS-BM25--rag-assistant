You should not give up on logistic regression. It might very well be that the log-odds of the binary outcome variable is not linear in the predictor $x$ , but then you can try to represent the predictor via regression splines . There are many examples on this site, for instance How to achieve linear relationship between predictors and logit of outcome? or Are splines overfitting the data? . After fitting the model look into some model diagnostics, see Interpreting residual diagnostic plots for glm models? . If you post [a link to] your data I could have a look.
