Most Efficient Machine Learning Algorithm for Text Analysis

Looking at Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks for NLP , Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) seem to be suitable not only for image recognition, but also for NLP. Are CNNs in general the best choice for NLP text analysis, e.g. for sentiment analysis? If not, is there an overview or comparison of different algorithms with regards to recognition performance (F1 score or something similar)?
