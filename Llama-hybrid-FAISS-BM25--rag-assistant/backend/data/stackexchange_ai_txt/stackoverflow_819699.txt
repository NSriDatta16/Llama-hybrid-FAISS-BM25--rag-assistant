How to take screen shot of an email inside "apple mail" and "entourage" in Mac OS X?

I want to write an AppleScript or Cocoa application in Mac OS X which will take screen shot of the email inside AppleMail and Microsoft Entourage. I did this by writing a simple AppleScript code but it takes the screen shot of the page. If email is a long one, I am unable to take screen shot of following pages. Do you have any suggestion? Thanks.
