Is this similar to what the Pulse app does? If the table view doesn't automatically handle this for you, you may have to subclass UITableView and implement your own gesture responders. Shouldn't be too difficult thoughâ€”just handle flicks and drags. You could also try enabling/disabling user interaction on one of the table views based on user scroll/flick direction.
