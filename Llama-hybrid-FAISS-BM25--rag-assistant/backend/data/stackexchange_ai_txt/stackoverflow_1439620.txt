You'll have to do this programmatically, I don't think this is possible in Interface Builder. Just do something like UITextView *myTextView = [[UITextView alloc] init]; myTextView.text = @"some text"; //some other setup like setting the font for the UITextView... [self addSubview:myTextView]; [myTextView sizeToFit]; in the appropriate method of you view (e.g. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event ) or your view controller.
