You need to begin by infiltrating the local hacking gang, posing as an 11 year old who wants to "hack it up". Once you've earned their trust you can learn what features they find hardest to crack. As you secretly release "uncrackable" software to the local message boards, you can see what they do with it. Build upon your inner knowledge until they can no longer crack your software. When that is done, let your identity be known. Ideally, this will be seen as a sign of betrayal, that you're working against them. Hopefully this will lead them to contact other hackers outside the local community to attack your software. Continue until you've reached the top of the hacker mafia. Write your thesis as a book, sell to HBO.
