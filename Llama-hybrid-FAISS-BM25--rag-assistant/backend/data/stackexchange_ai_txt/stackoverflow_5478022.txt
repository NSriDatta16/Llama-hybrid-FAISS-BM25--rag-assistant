See related articles here on SO: Injecting Mouse Input in WPF Applications Simulate Mouse/Keyboard Input In WPF Move the mouse in wpf EDIT: concerning the specific "drag" need, here is another link (from the NUnitForms project here: http://nunitforms.sourceforge.net/ ) about a MouseController utility code that contains mouse simulation methods: http://nunitforms.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/nunitforms/trunk/nunitforms/source/NUnitForms/MouseController.cs?view=markup It has a Drag method. You could test if this works. I know, it's especially designed for WPF, but it's worth a try. Plus, if it's only about mouse mouvement, I don't see a problem if you need to reference Winforms assembly.
