Can someone please explain the link between fitting a GARCH model and the optimal exponential smoothing parameter? There are quite a few versions of exponential smoothing methods (for a taxonomy, see Table 7.8 in Section 7.6 of Hyndman & Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: Principles and Practice"). I assume you are talking about the simple exponential smoothing (coded $(N,N)$ in the table) where $$ \hat x_t = \lambda x_{t-1} + (1-\lambda)\hat x_{t-1} $$ using the notation of the weigted average form of the model as introduced in Section 7.1 of the textbook. Meanwhile, the GARCH(1,1) model in its simplest form (w.r.t. the conditional mean equation) is $$ \begin{aligned} r_t &= \sigma_t\varepsilon_t; \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega + \alpha r_{t-1}^2 + \beta\sigma_{t-1}^2; \\ \varepsilon_t &\sim i.i.d(0,1). \\ \end{aligned} $$ The conditional variance equation of the GARCH(1,1) model is indeed similar to the simple exponential smoothing, especially once we put hats on the conditional variances to denote predicted values ($\hat\sigma_t^2$) and estimated values ($\hat\sigma_{t-1}^2$): $$ \hat\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha r_{t-1}^2 + \beta\hat\sigma_{t-1}^2. $$ However, this equation exhibits a few differences from the simple exponential smoothing: It includes a constant $\omega$. It includes the lagged squared return $r_{t-1}^2$ in place of the lagged conditional variance $\sigma_{t-1}^2$. Including $\sigma_{t-1}^2$ would make the equation infeasible in practice since the conditional variance is not observed, while the return $r_{t-1}$ is. Its coefficients need not sum to zero. An IGARCH(1,1) model would come the closest to exponential smoothing. There we have $\omega=0$ and $\beta=1-\alpha$, hence $$ \hat\sigma_t^2 = \alpha r_{t-1}^2 + (1-\alpha)\hat\sigma_{t-1}^2; $$ but still there is $r_{t-1}^2$ in place of $\sigma_{t-1}^2$. $r_{t-1}^2$ is a proxy for $\sigma_{t-1}^2$, albeit a noisy one, so this looks pretty much like simple exponential smoothing. But strictly speaking, I don't think you can directly claim this: I am guessing that $0.855$ and $0.861$ also happen to be the optimal smoothing parameters. However, if $\sigma_{t-1}^2$ were observable and you could estimate a simple exponential smoothing model for it, you would probably get parameter estimates similar to the ones from IGARCH(1,1); namely, $\hat\lambda$ would be close to $\hat\alpha$.
