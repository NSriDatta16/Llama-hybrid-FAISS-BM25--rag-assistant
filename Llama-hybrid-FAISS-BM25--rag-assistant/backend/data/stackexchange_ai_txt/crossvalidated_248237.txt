MCMC applied to networks

I was looking a paper, article, book... about MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) methods applied to networks (networks of people, computers,...) I haven't found something "useful", but maybe I am making this up and I hasn't been applied. So, do you know some resources where I can look?
