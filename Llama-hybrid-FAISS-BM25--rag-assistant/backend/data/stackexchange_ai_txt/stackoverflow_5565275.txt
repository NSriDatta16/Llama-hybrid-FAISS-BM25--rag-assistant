It doesn't seem like Pixastic provides an interface for this, specifically, but there is a property in the options giving you the resulting canvas: var options = {}; Pixastic.process(image, "action", options); options.resultCanvas; // This canvas object you can use to obtain a "data URL": options.resultCanvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg') Uploading 'canvas' image data to the server The "data URL" is a tiny header (see the so-post linked) and the file content in a string. You can post this to the server for storage.
