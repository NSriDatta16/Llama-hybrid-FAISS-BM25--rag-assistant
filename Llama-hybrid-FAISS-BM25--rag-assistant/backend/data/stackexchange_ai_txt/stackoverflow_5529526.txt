Postal code (ZIP) worldwide (not just US) optimized data structure (not SQL, CSV or Google API) for long and lat retrieval

Does any one know of database structure such as this http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity that is optimized for super fast retrieval of long and lat based on either ZIP or (City, State, Country) parameters? Maxmind's database does not support any other retrieval than IP retrieval, at least not to mine knowledge. So if you know how to do it preferably in Java, I'm all ears. This should not be SQL type database or CSV file or Google API solution. Thous are just to slow. Especially if you want to offer search results sorted by distance. Paid solutions are also option. The data structure doesn't have to be free.
