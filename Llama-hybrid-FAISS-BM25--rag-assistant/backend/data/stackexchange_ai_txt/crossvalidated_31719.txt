What I've seen is an interpolation of the data in order to match the length (and even the sampling) of the data. This was particulary used (successfully, I must say) in the classification of variable stars using PCA, where the data where the actual light curves of the stars. For more details, see the paper of Deb & Singh (2009) . I must add, however, that if you are going to do PCA interpolating data, maybe Functional Data Analysis techniques are more suitable (I've been thinking in writing a paper with this method, in fact, and compare it with the PCA approach).
