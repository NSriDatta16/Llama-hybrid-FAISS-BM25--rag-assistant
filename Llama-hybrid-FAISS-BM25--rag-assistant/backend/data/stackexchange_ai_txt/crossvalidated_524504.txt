Is a dependent variable with both negative and positive values in a linear regression an issue?

The dependent variable is continuous and has negative and positive values as it is a percent change. My question is, can one use such a variable as a dependent variable in a linear regression model? If not, what type of transformations are feasible or how could this potential problem be addressed? I have considered transforming my continuous variable to a categorical variable ("positive" for values above zero, "negative" for values below zero, and "average" for values equal to zero) and perform a multinomial model instead of a linear, with the "average" as the reference category. Thanks for the help!
