Applying regression methods would render useless, as we usually feed binary (or multiple) categories as target variable in classification problems. However, if you have somehow got probability values for each sample, you can perform regression as well - I can't think of such a rare case, though. If you are looking for prediction probabilities, Logistic Regression is the best call. Having some experience with sklearn, I can tell that SVM, by default, does not compute probabilities. If you wish to obtain those prediction probabilities, SVM uses another set of algorithms, which cause serious slowdown in process and extra computational cost.
