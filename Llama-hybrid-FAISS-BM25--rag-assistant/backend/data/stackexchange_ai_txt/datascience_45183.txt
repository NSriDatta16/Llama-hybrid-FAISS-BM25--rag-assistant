How to learn irrelevant words in an information retrieval system?

Right now my recommender system for information retrieval uses word embedding stogether with Tfidfs weights like written here: http://nadbordrozd.github.io/blog/2016/05/20/text-classification-with-word2vec/ Using Tfidf improves results. But I have the problem that irrelevant keywords (high frequent words) still have a large impact. Can I learn a system such that it learns on which words to pay attention - preferred in an unsupervised way? What can you suggest for a better information retrieval using word embedings?
