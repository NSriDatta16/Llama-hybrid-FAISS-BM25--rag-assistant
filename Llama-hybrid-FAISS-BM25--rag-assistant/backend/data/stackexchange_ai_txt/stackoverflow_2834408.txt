Protocol Buffers might be exactly what you want. It's a Google creation that, in their words, is "a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible way of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols, data storage, and more." Their official docs show implementations in Java, C++ and Python. However, the protocol is simple and has been implemented in a lot of languages (I use a C# implementation, for example.) IMHO, there are other methodologies in this area, but nothing quite meets the sweet spot of proto-buffers in terms of simplicity and performance across a variety of languages.
