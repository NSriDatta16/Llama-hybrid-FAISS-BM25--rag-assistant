CodeIgniter Production and Developpement server on the same domain. (no subdomain)

I googled this many times but now I have to ask it here. I want to make a workflow for a website for Developpement/Production. My constraint is that I use Facebook Connect (Facebook Graph now) so I need to have the dev and prod on the same domain and server. (to be able to log in and test the features) I thought I will edit the CodeIgniter Index.php to redirect if I have a specific user agent (I can edit the one of my firefox) You think it's a good Idea or you have a better one ? And now comes the eternal question : how can I deploy this the easy way ? should I use Capistrano or Phing ? or simply a script with SVN ? Please help me, I'm totally new to this Deployment thing. I used to work directly in production for my little websites or on other domains. but now it's not possible anymore.
