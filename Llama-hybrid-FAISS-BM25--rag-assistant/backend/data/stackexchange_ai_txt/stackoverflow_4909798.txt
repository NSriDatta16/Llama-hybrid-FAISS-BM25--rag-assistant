Will the new ActionBar API be included in the Fragment backport?

With the blogpost yesterday regarding us getting a healthy dose of Fragments all the way back to 1.6, I was wondering, will the ActionBar APIs be included in this backport? They appear to be somewhat linked together, from the API Docs at the least. However, I could see the Fragments being separate from the ActionBar, but not visa-versa. Anybody have any news? Thanks -- Selig
