Yes, a laptop will work just fine for getting acquainted with some deep learning projects: You can pick a smallish deep learning problem and gain some tractable insight using a laptop so give it a try. The Theano project has a set of tutorials on digit recognition that I've played with and moded on a laptop. Tensorflow also has a set of tutorials . I let some of the longer runs go overnight, but nothing was intractable. You might also consider availing yourself of AWS or one of the other cloud services. For 20-30 dollars you can perform some of the bigger calculations in the cloud on some sort of elastic computing node . The secondary advantage is that you can also list AWS or other cloud services as skill on your resume also :-) Hope this helps!
