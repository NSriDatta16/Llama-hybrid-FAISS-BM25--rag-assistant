Is there a way to determine the important features (weight) for an SVM that uses an RBF kernel?

Using sklearn, I did both a linear kernel SVM and a rbf one. While the rbf gave really great results, I can't determine the important features that the algorithm kept (or used more). I know that "coef_" does only work for a linear kernel, since for rbf the data space is no longer finite (or at least, it changes [I think]). Is there a way to actually determine the important features for an RBF kernel SVM ? Thanks,
