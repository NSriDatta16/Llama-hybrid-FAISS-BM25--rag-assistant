You can do this programatically with a Panel. You could also use Visual Studio's Designer GUI to create a UserControl, which is more reusable, since you will be able to drag and drop it on to any form at design time. Sorry if I misunderstand the question. public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); Panel p = new Panel() { BackColor = Color.PowderBlue, Location = new Point(10, 10) }; p.Controls.Add(new Label() { Text = "Hello", BackColor = Color.PaleGreen, Location = new Point(20, 20) }); p.Controls.Add(new Button() { Text = "Woof", BackColor = Color.Orchid, Location = new Point(60, 60) }); this.Controls.Add(p); } alt text http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5861/captureek.png
