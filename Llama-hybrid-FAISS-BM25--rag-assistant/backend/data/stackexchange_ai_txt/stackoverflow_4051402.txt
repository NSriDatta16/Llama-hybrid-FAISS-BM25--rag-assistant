Shopping Cart Libraries for Zend Framework

currently i am designing a shopping cart in Zend Framework. I decided to write code for user/roles/product catalog from scratch which i have already done and tested. But for other things i need you guys to guide me which are the best classes/libraries to build this system system. I need following functionality as Order Inventory Accounts Paypal Integration UPS/USPS/Fedex Integration. and thanks for your time. Note: I have already gone through magento modules, its bit difficult to extract from it what i need, so it will be last resort for me.
