This will be a two-part answer, the first part a direct answer to the question, and the second part a commentary. Part 1: A simple, and exact, way to do it is to use the Hypergeometric distribution, as follows. I am going to translate your problem into an "urn" model. We have 61 balls, corresponding to the 61 years of observations. 32 of these balls are "above" the average, and 29 are "below" the average. If I choose 11 balls without replacement - corresponding to the last 11 observations - what is the probability that they are all "below" balls? The probability is easily calculated using any number of stat packages, or a calculator, as approximately $0.01\%$ . Part 2: However, this isn't really telling you what you want to know, in a formal statistical sense. To see this, consider whether you even would have done this test had, say, 5 of the last 11 observations been below the average, or what test you would have done if it had been the last 9 observations below average instead of the last 11 observations. The fact that you observed what appeared to be a highly unusual result, then tested the significance of exactly that result, pretty much cancels out the value of the significance test - as it's based on "samples from a finite population that I think are highly unusual" rather than "random samples from a finite population" as the test calculation assumes. In an informal sense, it's OK to say "I thought this was a highly unusual result, and it is!" But it shouldn't be cited as a formal statistical test result. Edit in response to comments: To lend support to the validity of the Hypergeometric, I've constructed a simple example in code. We have 61 observations, 29 of which are "below" and 32 "above". We randomly rearrange them a million times, count the number of times that the last 11 observations have $0, 1, 2, \dots, 11$ "below" values, and compare to what the Hypergeometric distribution tells us to expect: obs The red dots indicate the observed frequencies, and the black lines are the Hypergeometric probabilities. There would be red lines too, except that the black lines overlay them. This is at least supporting evidence for the statement that the Hypergeometric is indeed the distribution to use in this circumstance.
