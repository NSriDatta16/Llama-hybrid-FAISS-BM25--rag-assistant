$S_n$ is simply the sum of $n$ consecutive dice throws. Now, let’s think of a realization: $S_n=\{2,5,11,14,15,20...\}$ , i.e. throws are $2,3,6...$ . The known numbers are the values of $S_n$ take, e.g. for this realization $5,11,14$ are known numbers but $9,10,12$ are not. Let $m=12$ , then $T_m$ is the number of known numbers $\leq 12$ , which is $3$ here. So, it is like the number of dice throws needed for reaching $m$ . One more throw, and you leave $m$ behind. So, if it was $m/T_m$ , then you’d get average number of throws needed to reach $m$ , which is quite relevant to average dice throw (i.e. $3.5$ ); and $Y_m$ is the reciprocal of it. That’s why, in the limit, $Y_m$ is expected to converge to $2/7$ .
