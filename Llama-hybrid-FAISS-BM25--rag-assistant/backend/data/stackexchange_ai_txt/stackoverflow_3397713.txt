Using IPv4 address, with browser signature ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']) hash. If the vote come from different user, but in the same IP address, with the same browser, in a close timeframe window, it is probably a fraud. If the time is too close, leading to an automated process, a captcha would solve it (but no one likes captcha on polls).
