which database to use

I am developing an App in which I need to authenticate password, store user personal information and setting details / preferences. All these are user-mobile specific or rather App specific and are unique for each user,the password and settings info should not be lost once phone is switched off or user exits the App, which data storage rocedure is recommended for such App?
