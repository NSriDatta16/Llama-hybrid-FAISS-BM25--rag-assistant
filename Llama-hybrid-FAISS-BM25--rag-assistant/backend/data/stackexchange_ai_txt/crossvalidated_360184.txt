The question is quite broad but I can point you in a direction which may be helpful. You will definitely want the R forecast package, to start. Information at this link is helpful as an intro-to-ARIMA-in-R. It describes how you can (i) decompose your data, (ii) achieve stationarity, (iii) understand autocorrelation functions (ACFs), and (iv) firring your ARIMA model using auto.arima() . The end of this link could be helpful for you in determining which model is best for your purposes. It walks through the basics of the Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC), the Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the Box-Ljung test. Read the article to understand what all of these mean, and how they could be helpful for you. This post may help you understand the constants when coding ARIMA in R. This extremely informative chapter will give you a more thorough walkthrough that you may be desiring. It goes over all of the concepts mentioned above, along with in-depth examples and illustrations to get you started. It also goes into the basics of forecasting, though only considering ARIMA in your forecasting endeavors may not be advised.
