The original proof for TD(0) given in [1] is a proof for convergence in the mean. Since this is not convergence in probability, there is no need for the Robbins-Monro conditions. However, there is a proof for convergence in probability given in [2] that does require the Robbins-Monro conditions to hold. [1] Sutton, R. S. (1988).
