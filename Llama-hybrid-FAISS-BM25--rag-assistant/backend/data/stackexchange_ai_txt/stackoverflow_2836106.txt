There is a constructor with the line number and line position . I can't see anything that takes SourceUri though... I believe you can populate it using the serialization streaming context - but that would be pretty fragile. I think it's best to regard it as something which is effectively only provided by system-thrown XmlExceptions. I don't think that makes it useless - just less flexible than it might be. (I suspect the vast majority of XmlExceptions that are thrown in the world are thrown by the system rather than by user code.)
