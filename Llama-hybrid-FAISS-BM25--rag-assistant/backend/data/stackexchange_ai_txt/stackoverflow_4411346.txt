Be warned that adding System.nanoTime() or the like will add 300 nano-seconds or more to the section of code measured. It is possible in ASM, but I suspect won't give you the results you want. Have you tried doing a performance test of the method. i.e. calling it for 2 seconds to see what the average call time was. This can be accurate/stable to a nano-second if you call it long enough.
