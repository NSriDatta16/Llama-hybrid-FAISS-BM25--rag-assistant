What neural network architecture can I use to take advantage of clusters in the data?

What neural network architectures can I use to take advantage of clusters in the data? In particular, I'm interested in doing a classification problem in which I believe that each cluster behaves slightly differently but that there are still trends across the data points across all clusters. My current thoughts are to augment the data points to use a one-hot encoding based on which cluster each data point is in, but I'm not sure that this is effective.
