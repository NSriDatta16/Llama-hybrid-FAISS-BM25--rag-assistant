C# would be a good choice for this. FileStreams are easy to work with, and could be used for reading and writing the data in chunks. Also, reading WAV file headers is a relatively complicated task (you have to search for RIFF chunks and so on), but writing them is cake (you just fill out a header structure and write it at the beginning of the file). There are a number of libraries that do conversions like this, but I'm not sure they can handle the huge data sizes you're talking about. Even if they do, you would probably still have to do some programming work to feed smaller chunks of raw data to these libraries. For writing your own method, normalization isn't difficult, and even resampling from 48ksps to 44.1ksps is relatively simple (assuming you don't mind linear interpolation). You would also presumably have greater control over the output, so it would be easier to create a set of smaller WAV files, instead of one gigantic one.
