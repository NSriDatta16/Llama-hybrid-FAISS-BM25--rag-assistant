Streams will perform better for large files since not all of it needs to be read into memory at one time (depending on the type of stream of course). Although there are certainly reasons to store files in a database, generally speaking I would recommend against it. It makes it more difficult to backup your database (larger file means more time to backup and restore), more difficult to view the files outside of your application (can occasionally be very useful, especially when debugging), and can be significantly more expensive since it will take up additional bandwidth, processor, memory, and storage.
