Diagnostic checking of GARCH model with Student-$t$ errors

I used R to fit a GARCH model with Student-$t$ distribution to a financial time series. How should I check for independence of the standardized Student-$t$ errors? Is it correct to run the usual Jarque-Bera test? Could you provide me with any reference on how to perform diagnostic checking on GARCH models with Student-$t$ distribution?
