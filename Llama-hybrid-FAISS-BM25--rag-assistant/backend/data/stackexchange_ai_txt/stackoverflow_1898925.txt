A little more information might be helpful. If you want to re-lay-out the images, have a look at the Swing LayoutManager class. You can put the image in an ImageIcon, the ImageIcon in a JLabel, and the layout manager can position and re-position the JLabels on a JPanel. If you want images to be draggable, convention is to put the JLabel into another container component (as labels do not usually support mouse or tab events). You can look those classes up in the Swing tutorial . There are also plenty of additional frameworks for making Swing work better for you -- some listed here Alternatively, JavaFX also provides a quick way for doing Java GUIs that can be quicker and easier to write (if you don't mind learning a new scripting language). For example, it makes adding animation (the images swooshing into place) easier.
