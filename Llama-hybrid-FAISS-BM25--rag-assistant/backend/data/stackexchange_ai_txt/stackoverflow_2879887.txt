You're going to have to post more information about your rails and more code. Since link_to works properly with the :confirm option. I can suggest two things, Try link_to "Delete", project, { :confirm => "Are you sure?", :method => :delete } (early versions of rails didn't handle options without {} well. Look at the html generated for that fragment and see if it has the javascript, if it doesn't, try placing a plain old link_to with a confirm in another part of your code and check that.
