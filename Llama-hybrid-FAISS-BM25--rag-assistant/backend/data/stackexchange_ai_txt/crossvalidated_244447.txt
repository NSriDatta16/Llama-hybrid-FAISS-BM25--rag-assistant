Building a predictive model on time-series data whose quality decreases with age

Suppose you have a time series dataset over the period of 10 years, and are trying to build an elastic net model. You know that for this particular dataset, the noisiness of its records gets worse with age ; you observe that after 5 years, using the older data actually harms the prediction accuracy more than it helps. Suppose that the noise gets so bad for certain features at some age that substituting the mean of future values is preferable to using recorded values, and some other features do not suffer from the noise problem. How would you optimize for the amount of training data to use with 20 features and an unknown amount of noise affecting each feature differently with age? My intuition is that this choice (amount of training data history to use for each feature, up to the point where the mean potentially gets substituted) should be done inside the inner cross-validation loop, but I'm not sure if that's really necessary.
