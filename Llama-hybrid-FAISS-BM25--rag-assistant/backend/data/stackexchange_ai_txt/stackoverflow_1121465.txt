Use Blane's Pegasus Library ( http://pegasus.codeplex.com/ ). You could use his XmlSerializationHelper class which makes it a snap to turn objects into XML and vice versa. Or you could use Isolated Storage (I would provide a link to MSDN if I wasn't a new user and restricted to one hyperlink per post). If you use IsolatedStorage, consider using Blane's IsolatedStorageHashtable class.
