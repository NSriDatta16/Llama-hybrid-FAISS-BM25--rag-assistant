Is a grid-like network more efficient than a random network?

Imagine two different types of street networks with the same number of nodes and where edges are weighted according to their length. Both network types cover the same geographic area (say 1kmÂ²) and have the same node density. The first type is a grid, where every street goes in one of two possible, perpendicular directions and where every street is the same length (network (a) below). The other type corresponds to more random networks, where streets don't follow a particular order, their length and their directions varying randomly ((b) and (c), for instance). In each network, you have eight points of departure/arrival, labelled A to H. You measure the average shortest path distance from every point to every other point. Would the grid network have shorter shortest paths on average? Intuitively, I would assume not. I would say that the grid network would have less variable shortest paths, since you don't risk a big detour, but you are also unlikely to find a shortcut. However, I was looking to see if there are any reasons why a regular network might be more efficient than a more random one.
