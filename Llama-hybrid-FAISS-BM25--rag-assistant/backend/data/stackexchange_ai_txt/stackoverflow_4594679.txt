Yes there is a limit (Actually there are a few). The file size of your filesystem. Since MySQL (all engines) stores the table in a maximum of 1 file (InnoDB can store multiple tables in one file), the filesystem's file size limit will be restrictive of how many rows you can have. Now, if you're using a modern filesystem, it won't be too bad. See this list for more information: Comparison of filesystem limits . The row pointer in the storage engine (MyISAM for instance is 6 bytes by default, 7 bytes max). Granted, these numbers are huge (256TB default, 65,536TB max for MyISAM), but they are there. Data type of your primary key. If you use INT , you're capped at 2.1 billion rows (4.3 if you used unsigned). If you used a BIGINT , you're capped at 9.2x10^18 rows (18.4x10^18 if unsigned). Of course this doesn't apply to tables without an auto-incremeneted PK. InnoDB's maximum tablespace size is 64TB, so that's the max table size in Inno. There may be more, but that's what I can think of... Check out this documentation page for more information...
