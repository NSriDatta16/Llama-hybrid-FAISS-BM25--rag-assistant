Neural network weights are trained by using some optimization method. Optimization doesn't care about physical impossibility unless you tell it to . It sounds like in your problem you'd like to enforce a particular monotonic constraint on the network, because doing any activity takes some positive amount of time. There's some literature about how to enforce monotonicity on neural networks. Here's an example of an early publication in this vein. Joseph Sill. "Monotonic Networks". California Institute of Technology. 1998. Monotonicity is a constraint which arises in many application domains. We present a machine learning model, the monotonic network, for which monotonicity can be enforced exactly, i.e., by virtue of functional form. A straightforward method for implementing and training a monotonic network is described. Monotonic networks are proven to be universal approximators of continuous, differentiable monotonic functions. We apply monotonic networks to a real-world task in corporate bond rating prediction and compare them to other approaches.
