How does scaling affect Logistic Regression?

I have searched a lot on the web for this question, but I never seem to find a consistent yet straight forward answer. Simply put, the question is: How exactly does scaling affect logistic regression? What should you expect from a logistic regression classifier when the data is scaled and when it is not? Is there any difference between min-max scaling and standard scaling in terms of logistic regression?
