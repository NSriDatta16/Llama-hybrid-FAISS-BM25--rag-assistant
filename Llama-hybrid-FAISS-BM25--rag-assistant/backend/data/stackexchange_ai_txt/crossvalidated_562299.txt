A dirt-simple solution is to add a regularization term, so your loss function is $\text{loss} + \lambda \text{ReLU} (i_3 - O)$ . This adds a penalty whenever your inequality is violated, so the model will tend to respect the constraint. While this solution is inexact, It will be more challenging to solve this exactly because constrained optimization is not something NN libraries are designed for.
