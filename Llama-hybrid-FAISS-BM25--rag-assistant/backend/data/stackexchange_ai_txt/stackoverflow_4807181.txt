Magento - Multiselect color attribute

is it possible to create products in Magento with one or more colors ? For example a T-shirt can be "red", "white" or/and "red and white" (composed with 2 or more colours) ?? I want to have a multiselect in the color attribute and not only one colour in a list box. Is that possible ?
