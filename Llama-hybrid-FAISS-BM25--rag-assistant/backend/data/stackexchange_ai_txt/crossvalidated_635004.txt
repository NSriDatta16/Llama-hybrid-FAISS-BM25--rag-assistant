Would ratio of intragroup distances make sense for comparing two distributions?

Given two distributions a and b , we can assess the distance between them using e.g. the Wasserstein distance, Energy distance or Cohens'd. By dividing the metric values with the standard deviation of the combined distribution, we can make these metrics scale-invariant. I wonder whether the following metric would make sense, too? distance(a + b) / mean[ distance(a) + distance(b) ] , where a+b represents the combined distribution and distance could be the standard deviation the absolute distance of all pairs within a distribution the log-ratio of all pairs within a distribution It's a simple and very likely not new idea, but I haven't came across it in literature or books and wonder how it relates to other metrics.
