One thing you could try, would be to add a second loss term that uses also the latent representation of the VAE. The idea being that anomalies should also be outliers in latent space. That way you would have another channel that provides information about your outliers. There was a paper by Zong et al., DEEP AUTOENCODING GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL FOR UNSUPERVISED ANOMALY DETECTION from the NEC labs at ICLR 2018 that used this approach. Please see https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJJLHbb0- I have no idea how good that would work for your images. In the paper they used very small datasets.
