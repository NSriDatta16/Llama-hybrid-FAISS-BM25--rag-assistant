What is the appropriate output file from T-SQL query of table that has XML as datatype

I created a batch script that calls a T-SQL file and output it to text file. The T-SQL file contains select statement of a table to get the information of column with XML as datatype. The file will then be sent with either contents as body of email or as an attachment. However, when I open the text file, I see a long list of information similar to the one below: CREATE_INDEX 2009-05-29T12:54:28.463... What I'm expecting is to see contents look like the one below: CREATE_INDEX 2009-05-29T12:54:28.463 54 SERVER\INSTANCE Domain\username dbo AdventureWorks dbo ni_ChangeAttempt_DBUser INDEX ChangeAttempt TABLE CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX ni_ChangeAttempt_DBUser ON dbo.ChangeAttempt(DBUser) If the above is not possible, I expect to see the output of query look like the one below: Event Post Time Server Name ----- --------- ----------- CREATE INDEX 2009-05-29T12:54:28.463 Server\Instance My question is: What is the appropriate output file to which to send the query results so that I can have a more meaningful and more organized view of the results? ADDITION: Please see below the contents of the batch script: osql -E -S SERVER\INSTANCE -d -iD:\scripts\qryddl.sql -oD:\scripts\qryddl01.txt -w2000 -n -h bmail -s -t -f -h -a " Database Object Changes from " -m D:\scripts\qrydll.txt ADDITION 2: The qrydll.sql just have this contents: use GO SELECT EventData FROM dbo.ChangeAttempt The table dbo.ChangeAttempt has this structure: Column Name Data Type ----------- --------- EvenData xml AttemptDate datetime DBUser char(50)
