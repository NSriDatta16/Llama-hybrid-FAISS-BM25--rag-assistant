Although a rowid uniquely identifies a row in a table, it might change its value if the underlying table is an index organized table or a partitioned table . Also, rowids change if a table is exported and imported using EXP/IMP. This implies that rowids should not be stored away for later re-use as the corresponding row then might either not exist or contain completely different data.
