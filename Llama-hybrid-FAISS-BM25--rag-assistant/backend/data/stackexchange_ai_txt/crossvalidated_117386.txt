When there are multiple predictors, and the predictor of interest is ordinal, it is often difficult to decide how to code the variable. Coding it as categorical loses the order information, while coding it as numerical imposes linearity on the effects of the ordered categories that may be far from their true effects. For the former, isotonic regression has been proposed as a way to address non-monotonicity, but it is a data-driven model selection procedure, which like many other data-driven procedures, requires a careful evaluation of the final fitted model and the significance of its parameters. For the latter, splines may partially mitigate the rigid linearity assumption, but numbers still must be assigned to ordered categories, and results are sensitive to these choices. In our paper (Li and Shepherd, 2010, Introduction, paragraphs 3-5), we gave a more detailed explanation of these issues, which are applicable to all regression models with an ordinal predictor of interest. Let $Y$ be an outcome variable, $X$ be the ordinal predictor of interest, and $\bf Z$ be the other covariates. We have proposed to fit two regression models, one for $Y$ on $\bf Z$ and the other $X$ on $\bf Z$, calculate the residuals for the two models, and evaluate the correlation between the residuals. In Li and Shepherd (2010), we studied this approach when $Y$ is ordinal and showed that it can be a very good robust approach as long as the effect of the $X$ categories is monotonic. We are currently evaluating the performance of this approach on other outcome types. This approach requires an appropriate residual for the regression of ordinal $X$ on $\bf Z$. We proposed a new residual for ordinal outcomes in Li and Shepherd (2010) and used it to construct a test statistic. We further studied the properties and other uses of this residual in a separate paper (Li and Shepherd, 2012). We have developed an R package, PResiduals , which is available from CRAN. The package contains functions for performing our approach for linear and ordinal outcome types. We are working to add other outcome types (e.g., count) and features (e.g., allowing interactions). The package also contains functions for calculating our residual, which is a probability-scale residual, for various regression models. References Li, C. & Shepherd, B. E. (2010).
