Is it possible to use Bayesian networks to predict numerical values? (non-categorical)

Is it possible to use Bayesian networks to predict numerical values? (non-categorical) For example is it possible to build a Bayesian network in the case of a house price prediction? I found answers for categorical model predictions but not numeric ones... Thanks a lot for your help,
