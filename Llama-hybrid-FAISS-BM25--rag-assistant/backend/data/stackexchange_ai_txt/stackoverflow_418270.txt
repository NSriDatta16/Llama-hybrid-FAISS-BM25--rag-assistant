Practices to prevent/control image content

Dead code is easily recognised and eliminated by having code reviews, however, when it comes to images - unused images still get into our version control. Is there any clean way of organising graphic content so that a direct correlation exists between web pages and image files? In our current project, we use create master PNG files then export the required layers for development purpose. Recently I figured out that there is some bloat in the images folder. Doing a search for image names in code helps but it is very painful when it needs to be done for hundred odd images. So asking the forum for suggestions
