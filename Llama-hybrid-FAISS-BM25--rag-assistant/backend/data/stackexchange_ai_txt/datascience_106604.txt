You are finding about Semi-supervised object detection algorithm and Weakly-supervised object detection. Semi-supervised object detection uses Supervised-learning term (Your handmade labeled data) and Semi-supervised learning term (Unlabeled data). Weakly-supervised object detection uses coarse-grained data which is imperfect, inaccurate, or partial. For surveying Weakly-supervised object detection, I recommend this 2 surveys. https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07918 Weakly Supervised Object Localization and Detection: A Survey https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12694 Deep Learning for Weakly-Supervised Object Detection and Object Localization: A Survey For Semi-supervised object detection, I don't know surveys direct on it. so I recommend two papers. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05031.pdf Semi-Supervised Object Detection with Adaptive Class-Rebalancing Self-Training (CVPR 2021) https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/d0f4dae80c3d0277922f8371d5827292-Paper.pdf Consistency-based Semi-supervised Learning for Object Detection (NeurIPS 2019) and Most of them uses 'Self-training' scheme in 'Pseudo-label' in 'Semi-supervised learning'. so I recommend a survey on Semi-supervised learning. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-019-05855-6 A survey on semi-supervised learning ('Machine Learning', 2019)
