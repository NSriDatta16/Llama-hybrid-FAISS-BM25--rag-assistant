are there best practices or tricks for indexing/monitoring a drive for files?

I need to find and monitor all the photos on a hard drive or a folder for a photo organizer. Currently I'm doing this naively: recursively traversing, manually marking folders as indexed, and repeating that process to catch when photos are added or moved. The problem is with a large enough folder tree this is very expensive, so I'm looking for tips to do this differently and/or tips on keeping it a low cpu process. Ideally solutions would be not platform-dependent. EDIT: I'm using xulrunner currently, but could compile a module do platform specific stuff. What about the first run? Is there no solution (even platform-dependent) besides running through the entire folder tree manually.
