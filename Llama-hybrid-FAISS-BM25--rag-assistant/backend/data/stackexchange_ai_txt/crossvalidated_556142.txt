I am not aware of a parametric model for an action potential but using Fourier analysis you can get a decomposition in sines or cosines that may recreate your curve very accurately. To do that you need to digitize the curve you are showing and get the Fourier spectrum.The book I used decades ago is "The FFT, Fundamentals and Concepts" by Robert W. Ramirez. It is good but I am sure there are more updated sources.
