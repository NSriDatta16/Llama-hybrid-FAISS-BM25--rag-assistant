Sparse Pattern Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Context of Problem I am trying to troubleshoot communication issues between process sensors of a large manufacturing company. I have been given 1-year worth of data for 1,000 distinct processes (observations), as well as signals coming out of sensors at each plant.The company uses 10,000 different sensors across different plants (which are my features), however since only a subset is used at any given plant, the matrices are immensely sparse. Aside from sparsity and imbalanced issue (only 5% of the processes (observations) experience alarms), the main challenge is that we do not know if the alarms were caused by single-day communication issues or issues that accumulated over time and surpassed thresholds, and therefore information loss is very critical. Now I have transformed the time-series into feature matrices (heat-maps) where the x-axis corresponds to time, and the y-axis are the 10,000 sensors/ features. I am trying to classify the sparse images, like the one shown below using a convolutional neural network, however the sparsity results in loss of data as I perform convolution. So my questions are: 1) Whats the best method to deal with sparsity in convolutional networks (to avoid information loss as much as possible)? 2)Are there additional methods that can assist with this classification problem, given that the duration of event of interest is not known?
