Community License Agreement for Commercial (SaaS) software?

I've got a commercial SaaS application, an online collaboration/lean project mgmt tool. I want to offer a "Community Edition", with specific limitations on how the software can be used, for free. For example free for groups using it to manage open source projects free to K-12 teachers to use in the classroom free for authors collaborating on Lean/Kanban/AgileSoftwareDevelopment books and research papers. free for community conference organizers, user group organizers, etc. The license would grant use of the software with limitations. The software itself can enforce limitations on the number of users/projects. I'm looking for a license agreement / EULA that I can use to specify what uses the software can be used for (see above). It would restrict the users from using it in different ways, such as for commercial use, managing consulting projects, client work, etc. I've been combing the web for good examples of such agreements, and so far coming up short. Any ideas? To be clear, this would not be an open source license of any kind. It would cover the use of commercial software, for specific "community" uses, as we define them.
