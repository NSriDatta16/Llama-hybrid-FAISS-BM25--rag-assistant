Array representation of linked lists

I am reading Algorithms in C++ book by Robert Sedgwick. It was mentioned that linked lists can be represented by arrays. Can any one show the simple implementation of linked lists using arrays ? Is it possible to implement Josephous problem using array implementation of linked lists ? If possible a sample implementation would be helpful. Thanks!
