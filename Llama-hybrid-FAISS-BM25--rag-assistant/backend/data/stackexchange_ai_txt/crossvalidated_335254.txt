Bayesian hierarchical model with multidimensional input

I'm faced with the following statistics problem that I thought a Baysian hierarchical model would give useful results, but I'm not sure how to apply it. A summarised description: I have daily sales numbers of a range of products (let's call them product A, product B, etc) in a range of shops at different locations (shop 1, shop 2, etc). For each product-shop combination I want to estimate the distribution of sales per day , assumed to be normal (so not trying to take temporal behaviour into account yet, only looking for the average sales rate and uncertainty on it). How do I model this, making sure that the estimate is informed by both the general behaviour of the specific shop (How well do other products sell in this shop?), but also the general selling rates of the specific product over the range of shops? (If product A is very popular across shops, it seems reasonable to assume this should influence our inference about product A in shop 2). A simplified variety of this problem, with for example only sales data of product A over a range of shops, seems 'easily' solvable with a 2-stage hierarchical model. But I don't seem to find a guide on how to implement both dimensions of information. Any suggestions?
