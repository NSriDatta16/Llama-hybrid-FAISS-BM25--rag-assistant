Backpropagation vs Genetic Algorithm for Neural Network training

I've read a few papers discussing pros and cons of each method, some arguing that GA doesn't give any improvement in finding the optimal solution while others show that it is more effective. It seems GA is generally preferred in literature (although mostly people modify it in some way to achieve results they need), then why majority of software solutions seem to use backpropagation only? Is there some general rule of thumb when to use one or another? Maybe it depends on type of NN or there exists some state of the art solution which generally outperforms others? If possible I'm looking for general answers: i.e., "if the NN is huge, GA is better", or "GA is always better but has computational performance issues" etc...
