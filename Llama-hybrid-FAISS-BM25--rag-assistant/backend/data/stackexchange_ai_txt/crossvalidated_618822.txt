Correct equation for Q learning

I start learning Q learning algorithm. However, I can not understand which is the correct equation for q learning. I found different equation from different sources. Source 1 Reinforcement Learning with Q tables Source 2 Q-learning Source 3 What Is Q-Learning: The Best Guide To Understand Q-Learning I would like to know which one is the correct equation. If all are correct then how could I derive one from the other?
