Training and Test Loss keeps decreasing. How to speed up?

I'm training a deep convolutional graph neural network. I noticed that for a particular learning rate (0.001, represented by the red/orange/blue solid lines), the training and test RMSE keep decreasing even after 500 epochs. Is there a way to speed this up? I tried using a higher learning rate (0.01, shown in gray), but that lead to a higher test RMSE.
