Multiple Apache2 vhosts are pointing to the same website

I'm running Apache2 on Ubuntu 10, and I have my site configuration files laid out numerically and in order. My default server is psychedeli.ca, but I also run another site off the same box at mahoganytales.com. Currently, both of these domains point to the same site (the one for psychedeli.ca). The declaration NameVirtualHost *:80 is in my ports.conf file, so I'm pretty sure my global server config checks out. How can I fix this? Here are my vhost files: 001-psycho DocumentRoot /var/apps/psycho/public ServerName psychedeli.ca 002-mahogany DocumentRoot /var/apps/mahogany/public ServerName mahoganytales.com
