Rails - Best way to implement Optionnal Fragment Caching for testing purposes

I'm using fragment caching a lot and it is essential to me for good performance. However, due to the complexity of the caching I'm using, I need to offer my testers, a way to disable/enable caching as a session variable. (On a user basis only) I was thinking about implementing a cache_disabled? method, and I now check for it's value everywhere I use cache. Now, I'm stuck with the following piece of caching, and I can't figure out how to nicely integrate this check : 'LOTS_OF_CONTENT' %> I need the content to be called when caching is disabled or content isn't cached yet. thanks for your creativity! (Please keep it DRY)
