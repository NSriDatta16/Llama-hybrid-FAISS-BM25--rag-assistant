Create jquery plugins

Hello I am writing some jquery plugins, i read some tutorials finding all clear. But I can't find a tutorial that explains how to add events (better say call functions), for example I want to call a function on myplugin open event. I want to do something similar to the jquery dialog events, just like something the open event: $('#adialog').dialog({ open:function() { //I know this will be called on open of a dialog, how to do in my plugin? } }); . So what i want to have is this: $('#somediv').myplugin({ onOpen:function()// this is not clear how to do it in plugin { //do stuff here }, background-color:'red',//this is clear, $.extends defaults options text:'blablabla',// this is clear $.extends defaults options ......... }); I want simply to know how to add "events" to my plugin, where "events" stand for events methods of a plugin, just for example in http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#events the Event tab has events who can take some functions.
