bgiframe with jQuery UI 1.8.9 Dialog and jQuery 1.5

So I am using jQuery UI's dialog box. But as I have a read there is a common bug within IE6 (which is unfortunate that I have to make sure this works for) where dropdown lists do not pay attention to z-index queues. I have also read that there is a handy plugin out there called bgiframe to take care of my overlay woes. I have found 2 different ways people say to use it, and neither work. I may just be doing something really stupid but I need to get this working. including jQuery.bgiframe.js Version 2.1.1 Here are the 2 ways I have attempted to use it without working: (I have included all jQuery-UI, jQuery, and bgiframe in the page that I am working on) The documentation from the actual plugin says do this: $("#selectDropdownThatNeedsFixing").bgiframe(); This cause a jQuery exception saying saying Object expected. The second way that I saw from the following page: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog/dialog basically you just set bgiframe: true when you initialize the dialog: $( ".selector" ).dialog({ bgiframe: true }); This does not error out, but the problem still exists within IE6 when I test it out. Am I missing something? Which way am I supposed to use bgiframe? Any direction would be much appreciated. Thank you for your help!
