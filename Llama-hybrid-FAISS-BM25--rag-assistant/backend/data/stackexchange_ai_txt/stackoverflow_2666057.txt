Is there a way to make eclipse report a general "catch (Exception e)" as an error/warning (in java)?

I'm trying to encourage a best practice of not catching general exceptions in Java code. eg: try { ... } catch (Exception e) { // bad! ... } Is there a way to flag this as an error/warning in Eclipse? I know PMD picks this up, but I'd rather avoid integrating it into everyone's build environment at the moment.
