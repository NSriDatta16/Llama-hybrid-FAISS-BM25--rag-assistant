The other thing that's worth taking into account (although it involves similar deep rabbit holes as the other aspects of diversity metrics mentioned in other answers and comments) is that diversity measures with low $q$ (as in @RogerVadim's answer), i.e. richness and similar metrics, are sensitive to sample size. There are 126 total breeding pairs at site 1 vs. 468 at site 2. Here are the rarefaction curves mentioned by @RogerVadim: library(vegan) ## site1 and site2 from OP example above r1 There are 32 species at site 1; if there were only 126 breeding pairs at site 2, we would expect to see only 34 or 35 species rather than the 53 actually observed. (You can do these computations and draw the plot slightly more elegantly if your data are organized as a species-by-site matrix with zeros filled in for species that are not observed in any samples at a particular site.) subset(r2, Sample == max(r1$Sample)) There are various ways to deal with issue; here I'm just pointing out a possible source of confounding/confusion.
