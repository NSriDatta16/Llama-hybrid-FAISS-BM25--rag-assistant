Unbalanced dataset is a common issue in all areas and does not specifically concern computer vision and problems dealt by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To tackle this problem you should try to balance your dataset, either by over-sampling minority classes or under-sampling majority classes (or both). Arguably, a good choice would be SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) algorithm, as mentioned above. Here you can find a comparison of different over-sampling algorithms. If you're a Python user, imbalanced-learn is a nice library that implements many useful techniques for balancing datasets. On the other hand, if you're trying to classify images, a nice way to increase your dataset size is to augment it (i.e. by creating reasonable synthetic examples, e.g. similar images but rotated/shifted tiny bit with respect to original ones). You might sometimes find it useful to augment the minority classes to achieve better balance. Keras ImageDataGenerator class is a good tool for this purpose.
