Does XGBoost has anything to do with logistic regression?

If the objetive is binary:logistic, then it actually running a logistic regression and the weights of the records are changing in every step? Or the XGBoost still creates decision trees sequently? How can I interpret that logistic word in xgboost? Thank you!
