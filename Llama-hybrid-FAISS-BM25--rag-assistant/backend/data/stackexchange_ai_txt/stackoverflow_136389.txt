Hrm, this is a sticky situation. You pretty much HAVE to violate MVC to get it working nicely. I'd do something like this: class MyObserverClass It is a bit hacky, but it's no more hacky than many other core rails things I've seen. All you'd need to do to make it threadsafe (this only matters if you run on jruby anyway) is to change the cattr_accessor to be a proper method, and have it store it's data in thread-local storage
