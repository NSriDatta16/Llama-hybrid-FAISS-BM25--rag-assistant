Sampling is used during VAE training and during inference. The idea is that the data are encoded as random draws from a particular distribution. That distribution's parameters depend on the input data, because they are determined from the inputs. By contrast, an ordinary autoencoder maps the data to a vector deterministically, without any sampling. For a Gaussian VAE, each input is encoded to 2 vectors, one for means and one for standard deviations. Suppose your latent representation is 2 dimensional. You have a mean vector $\mu = \begin{bmatrix}\mu_1 \\ \mu_2 \end{bmatrix}$ and covariance $\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}\sigma_1^2 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_2^2 \end{bmatrix}$ . Then you use the re-parameterization trick to draw a random vector from this distribution. Then the decoder reconstructs the data. A more expansive discussion can be found here: What are variational autoencoders and to what learning tasks are they used?
