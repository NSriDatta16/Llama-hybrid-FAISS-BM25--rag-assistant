To obtain the AIC or BIC criteria in ARMA models, you need to find the number of estimated parameters in the model (except for the residual variance) including the constant term if it is estimated as mentioned in " Time Series Analysis and Forecasting by Example ", by SÃ¸ren Bisgaard, Murat Kulahci, page 164. So the number of estimated parameters in ARMA(p,q) that contains an intercept or constant term is $p+q+1$ and $p+q$ when you don't have an intercept. See for example Section 6.5 in " Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R " by Jonathan D. Cryer, Kung-Sik Chan.
