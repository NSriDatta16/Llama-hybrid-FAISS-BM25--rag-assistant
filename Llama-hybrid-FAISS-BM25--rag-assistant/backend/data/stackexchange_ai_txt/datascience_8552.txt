Find most representative image

I have 1,000 photoshoot-quality images of pianos on white background with very little noise (people in the background, etc). How would I go about finding the piano image that looks most like the others? Alternatively, how would I find five pianos that look most like the "average" piano. I'm particularly looking for python libraries that may be helpful (I'm currently looking at skimage).
