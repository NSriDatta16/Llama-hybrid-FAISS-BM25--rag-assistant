x is not "November's value" it is "time" and its value depends on how you have time coded. I don't know how Excel does this (I wouldn't do statistics in Excel), but in R you could do what you propose like this: month which gives an equation of 95.967 + 458.2*month which means that predicted traffic goes up by 458.2 per month. But doing this (linear regression) on time series data isn't really a great idea. However, if you plot the data and add the line plot(month, traffic) abline(m1) You see that the line fits the data pretty well, except for one month
