What are 'standard' parameters to try when hyperparameter tuning?

I'm curious what parameters people tend to tune for various models and the values they try. For instance, on this post , the author had a go-to set of parameters he would use for tuning. What is the basis on which I should choose parameters/values? Should the set of parameters/values change depending on the problem/project I'm working on? Relatedly what are your go-to parameters/values for models (e.g., the ones in the post i.e., LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest, KNeighbors, SVM, XGB)?
