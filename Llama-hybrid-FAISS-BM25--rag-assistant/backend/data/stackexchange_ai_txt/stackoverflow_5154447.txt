Is there a way to determine a line from which XHR was issued in firebug or web inspector?

Is there a way to determine a line and filename from which XHR was issued in Firebug or Web Inspector (maybe Opera Dragonfly/IE Developers Toolbar)? If there isn't, what is the best way to find that out? Just searching the codebase for the URI called? (often it will be constructed, though)
