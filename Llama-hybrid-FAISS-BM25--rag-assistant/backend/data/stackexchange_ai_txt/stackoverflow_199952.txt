Perhaps you could draw an analogy with strings and regular expressions? You describe what you are looking for, and let the compiler figure out how for itself. It makes your code much simpler and clearer. As an aside: I find that the most useful thing about pattern matching is that it encourages good habits. I deal with the corner cases first , and it's easy to check that I've covered every case.
