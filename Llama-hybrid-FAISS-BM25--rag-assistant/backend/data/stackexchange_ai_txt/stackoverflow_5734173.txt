JSONP or "JSON with padding" is a communication technique used in JavaScript programs running in web browsers to request data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the same-origin policy. JSONP takes advantage of the fact that browsers do not enforce the same-origin policy on tags. To prevent cross-domain scripting, browsers normally block XMLHttpRequest (XHR) requests to other domains. JSONP works around this by wrapping or "padding" the JSON response such that it can be executed as a script. For this reason, both the server and the client must support JSONP. The client adds a new tag to the page, rather than creating an XHR, and typically informs the server what function name should be used for padding: The server then wraps the JSON response in a call to that function, which must be implemented by the client: response({ "example1": "somedata", "example2": "moredata" }); Many client-side Ajax libraries abstract away the details of JSONP requests, allowing client code to treat them as normal JSON requests. jQuery api example $.ajax({ url: 'http://www.example.com/api/getdata', jsonpCallback: 'jsonCallback', contentType: "application/json", dataType: 'jsonp', success: function(json) { console.log(json); }, error: function(e) { console.log(e); } }); Security Note: Be sure that you trust the server providing the JSONP response as this method allows the page to return a script that will be executed within the context of your page. Connecting to an untrusted service could give them access to your otherwise secure information. References Wikipedia Page JSONP jQuery API
