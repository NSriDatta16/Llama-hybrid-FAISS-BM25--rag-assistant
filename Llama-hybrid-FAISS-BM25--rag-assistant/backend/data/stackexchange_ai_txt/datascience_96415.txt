Bayes error and human error are two different concepts. Bayes error is the theoretical lowest error possible on a task, there can be no lower error rate. Human error is the empirical lowest error that a human can perform. Since Bayes error is theoretical, for most non-trivial tasks Bayes error must be estimated based on domain knowledge. Human error can be found by having human perform the task. A popular example is ImageNet. Current machine learning systems are better than humans error (top-5 error rate of ~4-5%) and rapidly approach Bayes error rate (top-5 error rate of
