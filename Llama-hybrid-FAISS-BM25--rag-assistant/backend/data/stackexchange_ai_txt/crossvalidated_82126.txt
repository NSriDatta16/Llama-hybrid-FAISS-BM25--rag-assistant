How to make a Neural network understand that multiple inputs are related (to the same entity)?

I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this but here goes: Sometimes times two or more inputs of a neural networks can often be related to a single "real world" entity. E.g : Height and weight of a person to predict the probability of disease in population or price and volume of a stock to predict the market. When a single training set contains data about a number of these entities, how can we make a neural network understand that two inputs (or more) are related to the same entity? Amongst all the people I have asked, the general consensus seems to be: Neural Networks do not work this way It is not possible Such a grouping of data is not required Neural Networks are supposed to find the relationship amongst inputs, you are not supposed to feed it the relationships The training data set need to be reworked / reconfigured I have never heard of such a thing So, obviously this is not in the mainstream. Has anyone heard of any research in this direction? P.S . If you agree with the above opinion (it can't / shouldn't be done) please provide a reason why.
