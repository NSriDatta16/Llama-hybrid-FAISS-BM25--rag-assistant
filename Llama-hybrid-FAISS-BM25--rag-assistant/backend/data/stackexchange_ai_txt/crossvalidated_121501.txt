Temperature prediction using NN and SVM

I am trying to develop a NN or SVM model to predict surface temperature based on several features such as air temp, humidity, wind speed, sunshine etc. I have collected data so I do have the true surface temperature values. I have already tried regression but I also want to try non-parametric models. I am pretty sure that the month, time of day and the day in the month are also factors that can help predict pavement temperature in a more accurate manner. I am using Weka for this purpose. My question is that in creating the NN model can I simply add these 3 new features (time, day, month) as new columns in the training set? Will the model realize that it is dealing with time and date? Any help is greatly appreciated!
