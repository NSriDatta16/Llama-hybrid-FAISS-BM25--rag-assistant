A question about the multistart heuristic and pseudo convergence

I'm teaching myself MCMC methods and I encountered this passage in a book that I am not able to make head or tails of: The phenomenon of pseudo-convergence has led many people to the idea of comparing multiple runs of the sampler started at different points. If the multiple runs appear to converge to the same distribution, then—according to the multistart heuristic—all is well. But this assumes that you can arrange to have at least one starting point in each part of the state space to which the sampler can pseudo-converge. If you cannot do that—and in the black box situation you never can—then the multistart heuristic is worse than useless: it can give you confidence that all is well when in fact your results are completely erroneous. Can anyone explain this a little better?
