When a probability density function is defined to be finite?

In "Pattern recognition and machine learning" by Cristopher Bishop, Chapter 2.3.6 (pag. 100) says that The gamma distribution has a finite integral if $a>0$ , and the distribution itself is finite if $a \ge 1$ When a probability density function is defined to be finite ? Can you make me an example of a finite pdf, and one of an infinite pdf?
