well, actually there is an heuristic to get some meaningful start values, see the paper "A geometric interpretation of v-SVM" and references therein. The idea is the following: "v is an upper bound on the fraction of margin errors, a lower bound on the fraction of support vectors, and both quantities approach v asymptotically". This number cannot exceed the quantity 2*lmin/l, where l is the total number of SVs and lmin is the minimum between the number of positive and negative SVs (labels +/-1). Notice that this means that for inbalanced problems, you will have to work with lower values of v, so you will tend to overfit data.
