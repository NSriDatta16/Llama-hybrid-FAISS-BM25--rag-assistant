Are you using OO? If so, then you should definitely keep it one class per file, and name the files intelligently... class Page { ... } should be findable somewhere like classes/Page.php or includes/Page.class.php or similar. If you just have a bunch of global functions, you should group them in files, e.g. includes/functions/general.php . To elaborate, your functions folder may have... array.php string.php form_validation.php request.php general.php html.php If you are organising your files like this, a better idea is to use a class and make the functions static, e.g. string::isAlphaNum($str) . This is a better idea because it only introduces one new term to your global namespace, instead of a bunch of them needlessly. If you are using PHP 5.3, you could also look at namespaces.
