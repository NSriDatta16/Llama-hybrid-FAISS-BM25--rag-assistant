As you've stated it, yes. However, I highly doubt that non-smokers would have zero tar deposits in their lungs, particularly on average, given the presence of second-hand smoke, possibly wood fires, etc. Keep in mind that tar deposits is going to be a continuous variable, and for any continuous variable $Z,$ $P(Z=z)=0.$ In Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell's book Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer , pp. 66ff., the authors go into a bit more detail of exactly that scenario. The sham data they use has far lower numbers for the tar deposits for non-smokers, but they're not identically zero. You are quite correct in your healthcare scenario. What that means is that you cannot use the frontdoor criteria as-is. You would need to change your population, or your variables, or your whole approach (perhaps backdoor would work, here?). What's different in the healthcare scenario is that Healthcare Intervention is not a completely continuous variable, so that the probability of it being zero for certain subgroups can be identically zero.
