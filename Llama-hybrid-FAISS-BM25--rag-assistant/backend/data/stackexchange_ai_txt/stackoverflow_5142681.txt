I had faced the same problem sometime back. The issue was that the implementation of the TransformerFactory or Transformer classes loaded was different from what Java intends it to be. There was also a System property that we had to set in order to solve it. I will try and get that for you in a moment. EDIT : Try this System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory", "org.apache.xalan.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl");
