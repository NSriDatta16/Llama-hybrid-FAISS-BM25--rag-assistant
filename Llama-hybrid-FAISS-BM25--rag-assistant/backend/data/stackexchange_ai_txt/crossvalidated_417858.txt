For example, in the case of a simple pendulum, polar coordinates are the most appropriate ones. I have the data for the x,y cartesian coordinates of the pendulum at various times. I would like to be able to jump from this to the angular data at a given time. I feel that this is a form of dimensionality reduction. Could we use auto-encoders for this or are methods such as ISOMAP or CDA more appropriate? And you're correct. An autoencoder could work here, since it's a nonlinear problem, but would not simply tell you that the latent dimensionality of the two-dimensional position distribution is $\theta=\operatorname{tg}((x-\bar x)/(y-\bar y))$ . It would only allow you to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of your problem, one, since the radius is invariant. I feel that PCA would not work well for this problem as I need to perform a non-linear dimensionality reduction. Your intuition is right, since PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction method.
