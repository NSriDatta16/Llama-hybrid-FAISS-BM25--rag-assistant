I would recommend a neural network with three outputs labels Rain, Dry, Cloud. If you have data with label "20 % rain" then weight of instance will be 0.2. If the are no "rain" label should contain "false". Other approach is to 3 different regression classifier with same converting convention. I think regression would work better. Neural networks will be good choice because it can do all three regression/classification at once and they can influence on each other. Additionally the training algorithm is straightforward.
