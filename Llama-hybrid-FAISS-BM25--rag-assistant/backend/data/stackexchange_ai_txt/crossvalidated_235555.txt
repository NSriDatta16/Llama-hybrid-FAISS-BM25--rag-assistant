There're many implementations of RNN with the LSTM architecture on python. Tensorflow , Keras and Theano come to mind. If you must work in R, your best bet is the mxnet package, which has an implementation of the LSTM recurrent neural net with an example on NLP. This package is quite new so don't expect smooth sailing.
