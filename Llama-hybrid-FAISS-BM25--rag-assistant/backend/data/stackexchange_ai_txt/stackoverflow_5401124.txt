XML schema represent different fragment with ref

I have this schema : Fragment 1: fragment2: fragment3: from the answer of question how xsd can represent different xml file? I can say that I can represent A and B and C in different partitions by using ref in the schema However my question the schema use Item with ref to reduce repeating the names definition. How can I distinguish between ref that represent other fragment and ref that just used to in schema to avoid repetitions my regards
