Using SimpleSession Storage in a WPF/Winform/WindowsService Client project

There is a requirement for a WPF client and Windows Service for an existing S#arp Architecture project and I was wondering what ISessionStorage to use? I have used SimpleSessionStorage in some of my integration tests already and the Northwind sample test project also use the same in MappingIntegrationTests. I have also heard that the Contrib project is going to have support for Winforms and WindowsService but I haven't found any ISessionStorage implementation in that specific to Winforms/WPF/WindowService. So I am assuming SimpleSessionStorage should work for both WPF/Winform and Windows Service? Same question on Google groups
