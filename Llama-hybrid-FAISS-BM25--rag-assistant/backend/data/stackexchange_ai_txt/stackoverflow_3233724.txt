If you really want the code all in one method, you're talking about potentially blocking all of the UI and so forth on a synchronous HTTP request method and response call. The method to put this all "inline" is sendSynchronousRequest:returningResponse:error on NSURLConnection [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:returningResponse:error:] i.e. NSError *error; NSURLResponse *response; [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:request returningResponse:&response error:&error]; ... do something with the NSURLResponse to enjoy with your data appropriately... I would personally encourage you to look at an alternative for most of this sort of thing towards the asynchronous methods.
