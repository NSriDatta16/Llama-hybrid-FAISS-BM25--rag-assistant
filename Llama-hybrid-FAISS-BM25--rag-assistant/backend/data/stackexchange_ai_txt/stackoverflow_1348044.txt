The problem procedural programmers often have when starting object-oriented programming is they keep designing procedures and try to organize them as objects . That doesn't work. Object-oriented programming is a different design methodology ; a different way of thinking about the roles and responsibilities you distribute throughout your code, not just a different coding methodology. When you get past the "dog is-a mammal" metaphors (which never translate to real applications), I would recommend this book: Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations . It was the first book I read where I finally got why I had to stop viewing (in my case) C++ as "C with classes thrown in".
