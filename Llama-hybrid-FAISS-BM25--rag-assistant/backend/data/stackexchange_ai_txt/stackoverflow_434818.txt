RCP + JNLP\WebStart App will not start

I've followed this example: RCP+JavaWS but the app just briefly comes up and goes away. I've turned the console on and it quickly goes away too. I've tried adding: -console, -consoleLog, and -noExit to my application-desc args and I have searched my Application Data dir to no avail. Does anyone have any ideas where I could look to find the log for this? Or, does anyone know what args I could add to make it log to the console? Thanks in advance. Eclipse 3.4 Java 1.5
