Get the first element of a list idiomatically in Groovy

Let the code speak first def bars = foo.listBars() def firstBar = bars ? bars.first() : null def firstBarBetter = foo.listBars()?.getAt(0) Is there a more elegant or idiomatic way to get the first element of a list, or null if it's not possible? (I wouldn't consider a try-catch block elegant here.)
