Put your business logic in domain and keep your domain separte. I prefered Presenter -> Command (Message command use NServiceBus) -> Domain (with BC Bounded Context) -> EventStore -> Event handler -> Repository (read model). If logic is not fit in domain then use service layer. Please read article from Martin fowler, Eric Evan, Greg Young and Udi dahan. They have define very clear picture. Here is article written by Mark Nijhof : http://elegantcode.com/2009/11/11/cqrs-la-greg-young/
