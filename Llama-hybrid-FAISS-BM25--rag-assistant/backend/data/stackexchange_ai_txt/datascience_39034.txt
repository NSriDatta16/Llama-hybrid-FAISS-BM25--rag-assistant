How to train ML model with multiple variables?

I am trying to learn Machine Learning concepts these days. I understand in a traditional ML data, we will have features and labels . I have following toy data in my mind where I have features like 'units_sold' and 'num_employees' and a label of 'cost_$'. I would like to train the model to learn these features and label for a particular 'city' and 'store'. For example if I perform Linear Regression, the model learn intercept and coefficient for the city and store it relates to. When I input units_sold and num_employees for next year, I get the prediction. city store units_sold num_employees cost_$ New York A 10 4 11000 New York B 12 4 11890 New York C 14 5 15260 New York D 17 6 17340 London A 23 5 22770 London B 27 6 25650 London C 22 3 21450 Paris A 4 2 5200 Paris B 7 3 9590 I'm trying to brainstorm about it and would like to know how to approach this problem?
