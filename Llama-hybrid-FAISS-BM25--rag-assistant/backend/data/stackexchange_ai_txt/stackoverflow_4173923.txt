Boolean search ignoring word

I have been doing lots of successful boolean searches however 1 word seems to be stopping it from displaying the expected results. Below you can see the table structure at the top, with special attention to the tags content for this test product. The code in text incase the screenshot is too small: SELECT id, name, description, price, image FROM products WHERE MATCH(tags,name,description) AGAINST ('hot*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) If I do a search for "hot" which is one of the tags, it returns 0 results. However if I do a search for "drink" which is another tag it finds the product! I can't seem to understand why!
