Something to consider at the Oracle level: Ensure the LOB column is created (or altered) with the CACHE and ENABLE STORAGE IN ROW clauses -- otherwise every read for every row will require a two direct path reads, which will be slooooow. Smaller LOBs will be stored inline, and larger LOBs will then be stored out-of-line.
