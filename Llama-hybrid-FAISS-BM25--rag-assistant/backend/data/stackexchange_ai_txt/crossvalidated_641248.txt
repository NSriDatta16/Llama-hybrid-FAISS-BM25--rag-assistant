Metric for Bayesian ground truth recovery

I am developing a new Bayesian model and want to compare it to already existing Bayesian models with the same hyperparameters using a simulation study. I generated 50 datasets and fit 4 different models. Is there an evaluation metric with which I can compare the recovery of the ground truth parameters? Since I am using Bayesian inference, I have a posterior distribution of the parameters. My current approach is calculating the MAE per trial and model and comparing the distributions over the trials with boxplots: The main problem with this is the scale differences between parameters (see left and right). Is there a metric, that does not have the problem with the different scales? $R^2$ does not work, because for each trial I have only one ground truth value, and thus get $R^2=-\infty$
