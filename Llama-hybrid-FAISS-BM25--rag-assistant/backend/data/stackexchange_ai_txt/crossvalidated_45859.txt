You can actually measure whether your sample size is "large enough". One symptom of small sample size being too small is instability. Bootstrap or cross validate your PCA: these techniques disturb your data set by deleting/exchanging a small fraction of your sample and then build "surrogate models" for each of the disturbed data sets. If the surrogate models are similar enough (= stable), you are fine. You'll probably need to take into account that the solution of the PCA is not unique: PCs can flip (multiply both a score and the respective principal component by $-1$). You may also want to use Procrustes rotation, to obtain PC models that are as similar as possible.
