Does Discretization improve Classifier Performance?

I am trying to understand the basics of how and when is it ok discretize a variable. Below are some papers that support Supervised Discretization: Improving Classification Performance with Discretization on Biomedical Datasets Feature selection via discretization On the other hand, there is Visual Revelations Frank Harrel's page on problems caused by discretization and a lot of other posts that discourage binning What is the benefit of breaking up a continuous predictor variable? Is binning of continuous data always bad for statistical tests? Therefore, if I take the target class into account to decide the bins, it would help in feature selection in classification, but not arbitrary binning of continuous values ? There is also an argument that says tree models do implicit binning, and that by pre-binning, we are not giving complete information to the model. Does binning of ranges make sense for a Random Forest? Appreciate any clarification.
