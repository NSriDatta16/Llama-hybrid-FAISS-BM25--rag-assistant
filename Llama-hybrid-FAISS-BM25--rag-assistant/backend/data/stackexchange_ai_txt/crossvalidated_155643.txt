what is difference between t-test and 10-fold validation?

one of famous significant test is t-test which can conclude is our result by chance or not using previous results and their variance. Also when we use 10-fold validation we break our dataset to train and test chunks and learn&test iterativly over them. Then we can calculate our average and variance of our results. what baffle me is that what is the exact difference between a significant test like t-test and 10-fold validation?
