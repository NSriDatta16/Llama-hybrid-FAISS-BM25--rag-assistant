You have a column that is called Index , while Index is a reserved word (keyword) in SQL, so you'll have to make sure that NHibernate escapes that column. When you're defining your mappings in classic hbm.xml files, you can define that NHibernate should escape that column by mapping it using backticks, like this: So, in Fluent NHibernate, in the mapping where you map your class to the Element table, try defining the mapping like this: Map (x => x.MyProperty).Column ("`Index`"); (Note that backticks are not equal to quotes!) By doing this, NHibernate will generate an SQL statement where the Index column is escaped; like this, for example: SELECT Id, ParagraphId, [Index] FROM [Element]
