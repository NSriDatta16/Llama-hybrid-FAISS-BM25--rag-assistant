A quick gander through reflector tells me that List Sort methods utilize quicksort http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort through System.Collections.Generic.GenericArraySortHelper SortedList uses Array.BinarySearch to figure out where to insert stuff on each Add Enumerators don't have sorting logic Quicksort is a good sorting choice for most situations though it can approach O(n^2) if you're really unlucky with the input data. If you suspect your input data to be a huge pile of data in an unlucky (already sorted) order for quicksort a trick is to randomize the data first (which is always cheap) and then do the sorting on the randomized data. There are a few tricks the quicksort algorithm can implement to mitigate the problem of sorting already sorted (or nearly sorted) input data, I don't know whether the BCL implementation does any of these.
