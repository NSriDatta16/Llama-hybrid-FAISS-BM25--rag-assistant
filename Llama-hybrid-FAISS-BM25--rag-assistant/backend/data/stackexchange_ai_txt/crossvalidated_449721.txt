What math classes are relevant for machine learning?

I'm a math & cs student interested in machine learning, especially the areas of (deep) reinforcement learning and NLP. According to the current state of research, which advanced math subjects (apart from the basics like calculus, linear algebra and probability) seem like they are going to be the most important for future theoretical work on ML? (convex optimization? game theory? information theory?)
