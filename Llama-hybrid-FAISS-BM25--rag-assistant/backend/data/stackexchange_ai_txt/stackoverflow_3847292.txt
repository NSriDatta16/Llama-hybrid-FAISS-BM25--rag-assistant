ts comes from the stats package included with base R. It is useful for regular time series such as monthly, quarterly, annual, ... series common in goverment statistics. ts is used by arima() and other time series methods provided by base R and its stats packages. HoltWinters which you used here is one such example. timeSeries is one of many add-on time series classes; this one comes from Rmetrics . Several CRAN Task Views discuss these more: TimeSeries , Econometrics as well as Finance . Try the documentation on ts and/or HoltWinters to come to grips with the required format. ts uses either a fixed delta (eg 1/12 for monthly data) or frequency .
