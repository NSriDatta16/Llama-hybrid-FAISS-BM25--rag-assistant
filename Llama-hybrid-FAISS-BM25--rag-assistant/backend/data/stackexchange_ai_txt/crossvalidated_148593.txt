VECM model output - where is the long run relationship?

So I'm getting the following EViews output, but where on earth is the long run relationship? Do I have to estimate it separately using OLS? If you have to estimate it yourself via OLS, I've already done that, but the regression gives me a very high intercept, so the second time series does not drive the first one much. This causes my model to be inaccurate at forecasting in an environment where there is a strong bear or bull market (as has been the case with rates recently) because my long run relationship remains artificially high due to the high intercept. Would it be completely inaccurate for me to model a long-term relationship of my own (e.g., a dynamic moving average of some sort)? Thank you! EDIT: I think it's the Cointegrating Eq I'm looking for, but still, why does it give virtually no slope for the 1Y coefficient (-0.006946)? It doesn't tie with the OLS I run, which gives something closer to 10Y = 75 + 0.3 1Y, whereas this model seems to imply the long run relationship is 10Y = 108 + 0.0 1Y. EDIT2: I found that you can remove the intercept by going to Quick > Estimate VAR > Cointegration tab. This makes my model far better from a forecasting standpoint, but I question whether or not it remains mathematically valid (I was taught you shouldn't run a regression without an intercept). And I still don't get why my OLS differs from the long run model EViews gives me.
