R libraries for deep learning

I was wondering if there's any good R libraries out there for deep learning neural networks? I know there's the nnet , neuralnet , and RSNNS , but none of these seem to implement deep learning methods. I'm especially interested in unsupervised followed by supervised learning, and using dropout to prevent co-adaptation . /edit: After a few years, I've found the h20 deep learning package very well-designed and easy to install. I also love the mxnet package , which is (a little) harder to install but supports things like covnets, runs on GPUs, and is really fast.
