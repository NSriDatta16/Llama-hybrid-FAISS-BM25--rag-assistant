You always have to remember that correlation is not causality! No correlation coefficient will tell you the causal relationship of your variables. The only way you can identify causation might be to run linear regression with lagged variables (if you have time series data) and see what seems to predict the other based on time. Otherwise only logical reasoning will help. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation
