It sounds like you have a Binomial outcome and not a normal one, i.e., the numbed of missed selection out of the number of total selection. Hence, it would be better to fit a mixed effects logistic regression and not a linear mixed model. That is something along these lines model Moreover, you have a rather complicated random-effects structure. Are you certain you need all these random effects? Unless your data have very rich correlations, you may experience convergence problems fitting such a model.
