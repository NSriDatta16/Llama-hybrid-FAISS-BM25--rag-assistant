Are they XLS or XLSX files? for XLSX apparently you can use the RMS SDK to work with encrypted XLSX storage format. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767782(VS.85).aspx Looking at it though its just a spec with almost no code samples so best of luck with that. once you have access to the underlying xml you can use standard xml namespace from .net or java to work with the file. 2003 (XLS) format, unless you use a propietrary 3rd party vendor solution that supports programmatic access (not aware of any specific products) you are out of luck.
