I don't think you would be overdoing it by putting a lot of constants in a single file. Just keep it well organized with good formatting and documentation. I dont think subclassing is want here. A subclass implies a certain relationship among objects. First off, you aren't really creating an object, so creating a subclass does not really fit the model here. Also, using a subclass here may just complicate things. For example, you will have to import multiple java files if you want to use several types of constants in another class.
