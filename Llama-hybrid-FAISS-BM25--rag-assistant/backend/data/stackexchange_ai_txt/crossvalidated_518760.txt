Stratification McNemar Test in R

I have categorical data before and after a condition (paired data) about preferences (yes/no) and I have other variables such as sociodemographic values (sex, ethnicity, etc). What I need to know if those preferences have changed before and after a condition and if those other variables like sociodemographic play a role. What I preliminary thought about is a McNemar's Chi-squared test stratified by those sociodemographic variables. Is it correct? and if correct, do you know any R package? Should I think about conditional logistic regression with sociodemographic as weights?
