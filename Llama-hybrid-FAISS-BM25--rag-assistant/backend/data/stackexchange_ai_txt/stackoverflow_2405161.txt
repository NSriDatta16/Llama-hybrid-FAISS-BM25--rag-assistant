This is the solution I came up with. My tags have id's like 'slide-jump1' so I created a new variable called currentPageNow that creates a selector based that combines #slid-jump with the variable base.currentPage. I then add the 'cur' class based on that variable and remove it from the current one. You'll need to add class='cur' to your initial link to begin with. Hope this helps, sorry it's a bit disorganized but I'm in a hurry today. base.setCurrentPage = function(page, move){ // Only change left if move does not equal false if(move !== false) base.$wrapper.scrollLeft(base.singleWidth * page); // Update local variable base.currentPage = page; $('#SliderNav a.cur').removeClass('cur'); var currentPageNow = '#slide-jump' + base.currentPage; $(currentPageNow).addClass('cur'); };
