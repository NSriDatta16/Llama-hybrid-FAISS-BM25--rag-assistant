Internet Explorer exposes a COM accessible interface you can use. If you really have to. I'd recommend against it - its comparatively slow, error-prone, cumbersome and resource-intensive. What solves your problem more elegantly is using WinHTTPRequest . In your Project, reference "Microsoft WinHTTP Services, version 5.1", and then go on like this: Dim HttpRequest As New WinHttp.WinHttpRequest Dim TargetUrl As String Dim TargetFile As String Dim FileNum As Integer TargetFile = "C:\foo.doc" TargetUrl = "http://www.websiteurl.com" HttpRequest.Open Method:="GET", Url:=TargetUrl, Async:=False HttpRequest.Send If HttpRequest.Status = 302 Then TargetUrl = HttpRequest.GetResponseHeader("Location") HttpRequest.Open Method:="GET", Url:=TargetUrl, Async:=False HttpRequest.Send If HttpRequest.Status = "200" Then FileNum = FreeFile Open TargetFile For Binary As #FileNum Put #FileNum, 1, HttpRequest.ResponseBody Close FileNum Debug.Print "Successfully witten " & TargetFile Else Debug.Print "Download failed. Received HTTP status: " & HttpRequest.Status End If Else Debug.Print "Expected Redirect. Received HTTP status: " & HttpRequest.Status End If Hard-coding "C:\foo.doc" does of course not make much sense. I'd use the file name the server supplies in the response headers ( "Content-Type" or "Content-Disposition" , depending on what you expect).
