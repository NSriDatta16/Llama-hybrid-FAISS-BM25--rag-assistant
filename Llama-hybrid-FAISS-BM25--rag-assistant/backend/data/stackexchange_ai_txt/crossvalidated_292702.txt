Without knowing a lot more about the model, nor the data used, it is hard to answer these questions with and rigour. That aside, the values you provide would make the think it is a reasonable model and does not necessarily overfit the training data. for your second question, my first line of action would always be to plot the training and test accuracy over each epoch (iteration), then look at how the curves develop. I generally hope to see a test curve that shadows the training curve, always a little lower. Here is a diagram with a short explanation taken from the amazing cs231n course from Stanford.
