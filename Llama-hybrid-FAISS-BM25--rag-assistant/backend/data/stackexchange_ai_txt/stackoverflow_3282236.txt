how to get list of all column names from given table in sqlite 3 ? (table might be empty)

now I use: PRAGMA table_info(table_name) construct, but it don't allow me to narrow search result to only column names, as it turns out much of unwanted data. That is array of arrays Array ( [0] => Array ( [cid] => 0 [name] => id [type] => INTEGER [notnull] => 0 [dflt_value] => [pk] => 1 ) [1] => Array ( [cid] => 1 [name] => name [type] => TEXT [notnull] => 0 [dflt_value] => [pk] => 0 ) [2] => Array ( [cid] => 2 [name] => timestamp [type] => INTEGER [notnull] => 0 [dflt_value] => [pk] => 0 ) [3] => Array ( [cid] => 3 [name] => note [type] => TEXT [notnull] => 0 [dflt_value] => [pk] => 0 ) ) it would be better for the result to be Array ( [0] => id [1] => title [2] => timestamp [3] => note ) but SELECT name from PRAGMA table_info(table_name) doesn't work
