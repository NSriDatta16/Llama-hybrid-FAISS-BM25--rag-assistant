There is no "native" support like you see with LINQ to SQL. However, there are third party add-ins that will allow you to do something similar with nHibernate. My favorite is this one: http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernateaddin To use it: Create a data connection to a database that contains the structure you are going to code against (your development database). Add a new NHibernate plug-in item (via add new item) to your project that will contain you domain objects. In the property window add the data connection string from the data connection you just created (this isn't automated yet). Finally, you drag and drop your tables from your data connection to the NHibernate plug-in object and when saved your mapping files and you domain objects are generated. To use it you create a data connection to a database that contains the structure you are going to code against (your development database).
