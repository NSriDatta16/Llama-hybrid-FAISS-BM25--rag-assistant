When is the input of a transformer a matrix?

I have a question about the format of the input of the transformers, depicted in the image below: (taken from the [page](https:// blogs.oracle.com/datascience/multi-head-self-attention-in-nlp)). When is the input X a matrix? I think in the question answering problem area X is just a vector and in other tasks like recommendation X is a matrix, but I am not sure...
