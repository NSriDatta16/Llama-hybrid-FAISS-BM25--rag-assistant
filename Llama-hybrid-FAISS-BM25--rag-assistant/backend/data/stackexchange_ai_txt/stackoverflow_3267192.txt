2 VisualSVNServer instances pointing to same SVN repo?

Would it be possible/safe to run two instances of VisualSVNServer pointing to the same repo? I've searched around and not had any luck finding anything related specifically to this question. The only reason I ask is because we have a need to enable Windows Authentication/Integration over http, and svn authentication over https. It does not seem to be an option to run both within a single instance of VisualSVNServer. If not, do you know of alternative solution that would allow for this? Edit : Received the following answer from VisualSVN Support Thanks to Subversion design, repositories are ready to be accessed by several server instances simultaneously. We haven't experimented a lot with such configuration, but I think it's possible. Am I understand properly, that you are going to store your repositories on a network storage and run two VisualSVN Server instances on different machines? Please take care about the server.pid. file. In the current release, this file is stored in the repositories folder. So there will be a collision between two instances of VisualSVN Server. We are going to fix this problem in the upcoming release. You can easily relocate the server.pid to another destination by adding the following command to the "C:\Program Files\VisualSVN Server\conf\httpd-custom.conf" file: [[ PidFile "C:/Tmp/server.pid" ]]"
