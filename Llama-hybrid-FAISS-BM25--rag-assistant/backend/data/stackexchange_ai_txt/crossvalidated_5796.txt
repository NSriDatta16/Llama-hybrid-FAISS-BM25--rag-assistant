Gaussian process classification (using Expectation Propagation) is probably the state-of-the-art in machine learning. There is an excellent book by Rasmussen and Williams (downloadable for free), the website for which has a very good MATLAB implementation. More software, books, papers etc. here . However, in practice, KLR will probably work just as well for most problems, the major difficulty is in selecting the kernel and regularisation parameters, which is probably best done by cross-validation, although leave-one-out cross-validation can be approximated very efficiently, see Cawley and Talbot (2008).
