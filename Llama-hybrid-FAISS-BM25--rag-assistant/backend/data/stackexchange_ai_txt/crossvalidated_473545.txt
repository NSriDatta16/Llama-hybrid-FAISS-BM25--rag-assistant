I have found this great resource: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/training This is part of what came in it So we train the generator with the following procedure: 1- Sample random noise. 2- Produce generator output from sampled random noise. 3- Get discriminator "Real" or "Fake" classification for generator output. 4- Calculate loss from discriminator classification. 5- Backpropagate through both the discriminator and generator to obtain gradients. 6- Use gradients to change only the generator weights.
