Advantages of log file: Local Don't need anything special to read it (just a text editor) Advantages of database storage: You can filter more easily (give me all WARN level entries that occured last tuesday) You can format the output however you want, because that is handled by the front end. Display it in tables, lists, have ajax search, nice graphs, etc. It's scalable! If you have 3 web servers, you can have them all writing to the same log file. Downside of database storage: If you're doing a lot of logging you can peg your database by having each request logging multiple times.
