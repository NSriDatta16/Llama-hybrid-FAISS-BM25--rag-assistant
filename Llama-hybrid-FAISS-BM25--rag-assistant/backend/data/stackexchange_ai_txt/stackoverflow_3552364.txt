Yes it's possible. An image is just a two dimensional array of pixels and it's possible to reorganize them freely. One easy way is to create new image and sample pixels from original image thru some distortion function. $original = read_image_pixels(); // using GD or some other way for ($x = 0; $x Edit: This can be generalized even further. Many familiar effects like blur and unsharpen are convolution filters. They are pretty well explained at the GameDev article . We can think the above sin-distortion as a convolution filter with spatially variable kernel (coefficient matrix).
