If you are more focused on the results than hardcore statistical validity and soundness, then this is the domain of machine learning (Link is Wikipedia). More precisely: classification (again, Wikipedia. Your classes are "Type 1", "Type 2" and "Type 3"). Borader applicable terms are artificial intelligence (but this includes various other tasks such as simulating swarm behaviour, and optimal path finding) and data mining (but which includes various non-learning data analysis methods, such as outlier detection and clustering; it is more of an application area for machine learning). As you want to predict the package, you are dead on target with classification/ML. There are various methods around. Literally thousands. Probably a good introductory approach to the general idea is decision trees, because it is less heavy on the statistics but can actually be computed by hand. More advanced techniques include Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, SVM etc. Well known books include: Ian H. Witten, Eibe Frank, and Mark A. Hall (2011). Data Mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques ("The Weka book") Christopher M. Bishop (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Russell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter (2003), Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (This one is a bit broader in focus, Peter Norvig is at Google, but was involved in the AI part of the famous AI-ML stanford online classes that got Coursera started; you can still watch the classes on YouTube ).
