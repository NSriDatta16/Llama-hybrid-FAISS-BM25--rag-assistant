regression analysis in questionnaire

I am performing both descriptive analysis and a logistic regression on a questionnaire`s data that I have sampled regarding Fibromyalgia. Data consists of symptoms that are dependent dichotomous variables, disability that are dependent ordinal variables and physical activity that are independent and numerical variables(data is number of times exercised) + binominal(walk=yes/no swim=yes/no physio=yes/no) What kind of analyses are the best to investigate the symptoms to the full? Are there any possibilities to make logistic regression and put results together in a large table? Basically, does physical exercise affect symptoms and disability? Thanks
