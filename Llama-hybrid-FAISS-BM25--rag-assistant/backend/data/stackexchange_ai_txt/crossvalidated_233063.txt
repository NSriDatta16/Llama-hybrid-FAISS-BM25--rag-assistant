Make prediction equation from logistic regression coefficients

I have created a logistic regression in R and would like to use the trained model to create an predict function (lets say in Excel). How can I convert the coefficients into a predict equation? glm(formula = is_bad ~ is_rent + dti + bc_util + open_acc + pub_rec_bankruptcies + chargeoff_within_12_mths, family = binomial, data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.8659 -0.5413 -0.4874 -0.4322 2.4289 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.9020574 0.0270641 -107.229
