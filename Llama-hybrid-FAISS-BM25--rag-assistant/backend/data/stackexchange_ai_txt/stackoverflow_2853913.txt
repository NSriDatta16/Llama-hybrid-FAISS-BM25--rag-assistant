It's not a managed solution, but I've had acceptable results using Dan Bloomberg's leptonlib C library, which comes with a VC9 project and an example of using the library from C# via a managed C++ wrapper. It includes an implementation of orientation detection, but I have found its accuracy is only good when the images are mostly mixed-case alpha text in non-uniform layouts (paragraphs and discrete text rather than tables/grids). Using additional preprocessing and heuristic analysis (based on other methods in the same library) I have managed to improve the accuracy on the edge cases as well, though it still only hits around 87% total accuracy on my (fairly large) sample set.
