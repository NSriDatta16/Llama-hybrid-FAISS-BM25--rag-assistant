For the average web developer, screen and print are probably the only ones to worry about. Even the iPhone ignores the handheld media type: iPhone OS ignores print and handheld media queries because these types do not supply high-end web content.

Those users typically will have some kind of assistive technology for their computers (like a screen reader or magnifier), and it's really hard to know which ones they might be using and if they would also support the alternate stylesheets. Unless you're targeting these users specifically (and know what kinds of technologies they are using), it's probably better to stick with the de-facto standards.
