Best way to package a class for use in another app?

I've written an Android app which various abstract classes that perform useful functions. These functions could be leveraged in other apps. I want to share a class module with another programmer, but I don't want to share the source code. I would like to share a .class file but I'm not sure how to do the following: Compile an Android .java file into .class What does the receiver of the .class file have to do to use that .class in their project? (using Eclipse environment)
