Question about AlphaGo Zero's Neural network architecture?

The following text is quoted from the AlphaGo Zero Paper 2017 from Nature. My question is regarding the eight features. The input to the neural network is a 19 × 19 × 17 image stack comprising 17 binary feature planes. Eight feature planes, Xt, consist of binary values indicating the presence of the current player’s stones (Xit=1 if intersection i contains a stone of the player’s colour at time­step t; This sounds like the t means time and the eight features are the latest 8 board states. If this is the case, this will be my question. 0 if the intersec­tion is empty, contains an opponent stone, or if t I have the feeling the eight features should be the combination of rotated (4) and reflected (2 ) board states of the current board state. Please correct me if I am wrong. History features Xt, Yt are necessary, because Go is not fully observable solely from the current stones, as repetitions are forbidden; similarly, the colour feature C is necessary, because the komi is not observable. Board repetition can be easily prevented by keeping tracking of all previous board states and when a new move is attempted, just compare against all previous board states. The same is for komi. Keeping 8 previous board states to prevent repetition doesn't sound right to me. What if the repetition happened to the last 9th board state? If this is not a serious paper published to the Nature, I would highly doubt this is wrong.
