show only one div within an iframe (javascript, JQuery...)

First just let me say I'm open to ideas on a different approach altogether. I have and iframe as such: [Your user agent does not support frames or is currently configured not to display frames. However, you may visit the related document. ] The page being loaded with the iframe has a div called loginInnerBox. I only want to display the loginInnerBox and everything inside of it. Any ideas on how to do this? I was thinking of using Jquery or javascript of some kind to remove everything else on the page loaded by the iframe, not sure how to access that though... Just to be clear I want everything on my page outside of the iframe to remain intact. I want the equivalent of saying $.('testloadlogin').load('../security/login.aspx' #loginInnerBox) which would just get loginInnerBox's html and place it in the testloadlogin div. However I need the back-end processing from the other page which is supported by iframe, but not by the Jquery load. The markup of the page loaded by the iframe is ....... .... Do you need more information than that? I tried this, it had no effect: [Your user agent does not support frames or is currently configured not to display frames. However, you may visit the related document. ] function loadlogin() { $(' *', this.contentWindow.document).not('#ctl00_CLPMainContent_Login1').hide(); }
