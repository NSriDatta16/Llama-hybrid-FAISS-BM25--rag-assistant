Ok, found it. My project uses precompiled headers so in some header file that is included from StdAfx.h someone included list. When I added #pragma directives on top of the StdAfx.h everything worked. The thing that confused me is that when I added #pragma in .cpp file in front of #include "StdAfx.h" nothing worked (warnings were still displayed). Since list was included in precompiled headers, it had the same warning settings no matter what the .cpp file specified later on. But, the strange thing is that even if I could not override settings in .cpp file, I could override them by specifying compile properties for that same file. How is that any different?
