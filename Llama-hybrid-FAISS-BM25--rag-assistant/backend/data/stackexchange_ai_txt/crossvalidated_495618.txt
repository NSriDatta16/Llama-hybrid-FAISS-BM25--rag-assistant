Issues with logistic regression using `glmnet` package

I'm trying to use the glmnet package to build a logistic regression model, but I keep getting sensitivity and specificity of 1.000. My data contains two factor predictors: family and gender as well as a numerical predictor result and uses a response variable autism . Can anyone see any glaring issues with the code? I've been trying to figure this out for hours. # assemble data for training and testing train.factors
