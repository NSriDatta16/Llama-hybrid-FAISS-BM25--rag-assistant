Providing dynamic data to webpage

I have a web page that displays dynamic data which changes every 2 seconds. Data is selected from various data sources including Oracle. Currently, the page reloads every 10 seconds and runs a PHP script which retrieves the data and displays the page. I have other pages that gives a different view on the same data. This means the same query is run again for them as well. If I have 4 of these pages with 10 concurrent users each, suddenly the data retrieval happens 40 times every 10 seconds, obviously not ideal. I have some ideas on how to improve this situation, but I thought I would ask from some ideas from other experts that might have come across a similar situation. I'm not bound to PHP, and my server is on a Linux platform. Regards Marius
