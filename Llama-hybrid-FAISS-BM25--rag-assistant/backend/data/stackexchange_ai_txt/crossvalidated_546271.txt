How to compare replicated time series

I have several cell cultures at different salinities. I have 4 replicates at each salinity. You can get an example of the data, with 2 salinities, here: ID=c("F58.0.1", "F58.0.1", "F58.0.1", "F58.0.1", "F58.0.1", "F58.0.1", "F58.0.1", "F58.0.1" ,"F58.0.1" ,"F58.0.1" , "F58.0.2" , "F58.0.2" , "F58.0.2" ,"F58.0.2" ,"F58.0.2" ,"F58.0.2" ,"F58.0.2" ,"F58.0.2" , "F58.0.2" , "F58.0.2", "F58.0.3" , "F58.0.3" , "F58.0.3" ,"F58.0.3" , "F58.0.3" ,"F58.0.3" , "F58.0.3" ,"F58.0.3" , "F58.0.3" , "F58.0.3" , "F58.0.4" ,"F58.0.4" ,"F58.0.4" ,"F58.0.4" ,"F58.0.4" ,"F58.0.4" ,"F58.0.4" , "F58.0.4" ,"F58.0.4" , "F58.0.4" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1", "F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.1" ,"F58.50.2", "F58.50.2", "F58.50.2" ,"F58.50.2" ,"F58.50.2" ,"F58.50.2" ,"F58.50.2" ,"F58.50.2" ,"F58.50.2" ,"F58.50.2", "F58.50.3", "F58.50.3", "F58.50.3", "F58.50.3", "F58.50.3", "F58.50.3", "F58.50.3", "F58.50.3" ,"F58.50.3", "F58.50.3" ,"F58.50.4", "F58.50.4" ,"F58.50.4", "F58.50.4", "F58.50.4", "F58.50.4", "F58.50.4" ,"F58.50.4", "F58.50.4" ,"F58.50.4") salinity=c(0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 , 0 ,50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50 ,50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50) day=c(0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20,0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20,0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20,0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20,0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20,0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20,0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20,0 , 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20) cells=c( 8 , 7, 9 ,13, 19, 20, 20, 19, 18, 21, 8, 8, 10, 21, 26, 25, 33, 40, 51, 71, 8, 7, 10, 8 ,9 ,8 ,5 ,1 ,1, 0, 8 ,7 ,6 ,14 ,16 ,16 , 23, 30, 37, 42,8, 7 , 7 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 6 , 6 , 8 , 6 , 7 , 6 , 7 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 5 , 8 , 7 , 5 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 8 , 7 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 4 , 4) data Which looks like this: The 95% CI at salinity 0 is huge, there was a lot of divergence between replicates. There was also one culture/replicate that didn't work, I tried deleting it, but the CI is even bigger (because then I only have 3 replicates, I guess). Also, I don't know how to statistically detect outliers in this type of data, I don't know if I should really delete it or not. But the main question is, how can I statistically compare these time series? (the values, the trend...and I don't know what else I should look at). How can I say wether the cells grow different or not at 0 and 50g/L salinity? I saw a post in which they recommended adding a model and then comparing the models. But I have no experience with this type of data and I don't know which type of model whould I use.
