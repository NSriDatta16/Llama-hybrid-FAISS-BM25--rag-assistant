More details about the other customizations you've done to get yourself to this point might help people troubleshoot your problem. When I tried your "create the block programmatically" code I got the following error. Warning: include(/path/to/magento1point4.dev/app/design/frontend/base/default/template/widget/grid.phtml) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /path/to/magento1point4.dev/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Block/Template.php on line 189 I added a simple phtml template to the above location and was able to insert the block via a layout file succfully after that So I suspect something you've done along the way already is tripping things up. Also, a Magento version would help things. Line 526 of the current version of community edition is a comment. All that said my best guess is things are failing in the getOutput method of the Layout class. I'd add some logging to the function on your dev server to see what Magento is trying to do/instantiate when it bails on you. public function getOutput() { $out = ''; if (!empty($this->_output)) { foreach ($this->_output as $callback) { Mage:Log('Trying to get the block ' . $callback[0] . ' and call its ' . $callback[1] . 'method'); $out .= $this->getBlock($callback[0])->$callback[1](); } } return $out; }
