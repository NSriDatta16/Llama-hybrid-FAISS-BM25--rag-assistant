Because approach nr. 2 actually uses 100 bits of storage, plus some very minor (constant) overhead, while nr. 1 typically uses four bytes of storage per Bit structure. In general, a struct is at least one byte large per the C++ standard. #include #include struct Bit { int data : 1; }; int main() { Bit a[100]; std::bitset b; std::cout prints 400 16 Apart from this, bitset wraps your bit array in a nice object representation with many useful operations.
