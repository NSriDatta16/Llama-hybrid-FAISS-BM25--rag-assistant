LINQ: transform an array [,] into array[]

I know this is kind of a dumb question, but does anyone have an elegant (or non-elegant) LINQ approach to transform a 2D array (object[,]) into a 1D array (object[]) comprised of the first dimension of the 2D array? Example: // I'd like to have the following array object[,] dim2 = {{1,1},{2,2},{3,3}}; // converted into this kind of an array... :) object[] dim1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
