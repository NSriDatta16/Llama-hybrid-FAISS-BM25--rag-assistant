There's also an increasing trend of reimplementing languages that are traditionally considered "interpreted" onto a platform like the JVM or CLR -- and then allowing easy access to "native" code for interoperability. So from Jython and JRuby, you can easily access Java code, and from IronPython and IronRuby, you can easily access .NET code. In cases like these, the ability to "leverage the compiled language behind the interpreter" could be described as the primary motivator for the new implementation.
