Making a "ping" inside of my C# application

I need my application to ping an address I'll specify later on and just simply copy the Average Ping Time to a .Text of a Label. Any help? EDIT: I found the solution in case anyone is interested: Ping pingClass = new Ping(); PingReply pingReply = pingClass.Send("logon.chronic-domination.com"); label4.Text = (pingReply.RoundtripTime.ToString() + "ms");
