Your machine is pretty well optimized for floating point, so you probably won't save much by going to fixed-point fractions. You say there's no single bottleneck, but there may be multiple, and if you manage to shave any one of them, then the others will take larger percentages of the remaining time, drawing your attention to them, so you can shave them too. You've probably done this, but I would make sure not only that the time-consuming functions are as quick as possible, but they are being called no more than necessary.
