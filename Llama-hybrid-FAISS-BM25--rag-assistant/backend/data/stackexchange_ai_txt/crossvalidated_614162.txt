Standard deviation of several average±sd

After years of uncertainty, I need to make this question. I have a conducted several experiments with X replicates each. I obtain then a dataset, where each "observation" is a single experiment and the values are each average±SD of those replicates. Now I need to calculate the Average and SD of the whole study. While it is easy for the mean, Which is the mean of the averages, I don't know how to measure the final SD, including the original error. Do I need to use some sort of formula of propagation error?
