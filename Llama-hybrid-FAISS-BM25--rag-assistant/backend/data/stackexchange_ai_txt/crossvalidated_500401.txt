What does p(x, z) mean in probabilities?

I'm trying to understand variational autoencoders, and it is not as straightforward as I thought - not knowing much about probability theories. It is related with the Bayes theorem that I learnt from this amazing tutorial . However, the example in the video to make people understand the concept, and using it in context of VAE is kind of a different level. The equation that explains the encoder looks like this: $$p_\theta(x,z) = p_\theta(x|z)p(z)$$ Where $p_\theta(x|z)$ is the likelihood, what is the probability of $x$ is true given $z$ is true. $p(z)$ is the prior, what is the probability of $z$ is true in general. But what is $p(x, z)$ ? Is it a function with two parameters $x$ , and $z$ ? Or is like the case of $p(z)$ , just with knowing not just $z$ , but $x$ as well, and the probability of both events are true?
