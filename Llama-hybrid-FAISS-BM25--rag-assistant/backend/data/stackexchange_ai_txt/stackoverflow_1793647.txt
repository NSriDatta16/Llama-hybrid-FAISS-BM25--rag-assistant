I think this is difficult to solve in CSS. I like the suggestions other users have made with 'display:inline-block' and setting the height to be fixed. They both have minor drawbacks, but the situation will be better than it currently is. If you are going to solve this "properly", we first need to agree what the proper solution is. I think it would be to have two columns, and for each element that has to be added, it is appended to the end of the currently least-full column. This won't necessarily result in elements alternately being placed in column 1 then column 2. Sometimes two (or more) small elements will be placed in column 2 to compensate for a large element in column 1, for example. I doubt something as complicated as this is possible to define in CSS (but I've been surprised by what can be done before). It could be done using Javascript though. You could have a solution that does a fairly good job if Javascript is disabled using a purely CSS solution, and if Javascript is enabled you could arrange them more elegantly. I'm not sure it is worth the effort of implementing this though. Some of the existing suggestions seem reasonable compromises, and if it were me, I'd probably go with the inline-block solution, but I thought I'd throw this idea out anyway.
