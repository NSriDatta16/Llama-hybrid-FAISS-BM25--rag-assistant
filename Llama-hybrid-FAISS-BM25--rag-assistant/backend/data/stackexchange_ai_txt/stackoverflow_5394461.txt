OpenERP Events Organisation Web Integration

Does anybody knows how exactly can OpenERP's Events Organisation module be integrated with a website for event registration? Basically, a registration form on a website should be able to send information to the module, but I have no experience with this, neither with OpenERP or its web integration, but we would like to implement it. For instance, the module information says that it helps on getting the payments -the registration process should charge participants' credit cards- but it doesn't says anything on what exactly that means and how should it be done. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks.
