I would say to them... I'm the solo developer of this project. And when you leave or hand it off we'll have 0 developers. All the more reason to use source control. The code belongs to the company not you and the company would like some accountability. Checking in code doesn't require too much effort: svn ci -m " implement ajax support for grid control Next time someone new wants to make some changes on the grid control or do something related, they will have a great starting point. All projects start off with one or two people. Source control is easier now than it ever was--have they arranged a 30 minute demo of Tortoise SVN with them? It's just a prototype, maybe I'll have to rewrite from scratch again. Are they concerned about storage? Storage is cheap. Are they concerned about time wasted on versioning? It takes less time then the cursory email checks. If they are re-writing bits then source control is even more important to be able to reference old bits. I don't want to pollute the Source Control with incomplete versions. That's actually a good concern. I used to think the same thing at one point and avoided checking in code until it was nice and clean which is not a bad thing in and of itself but many times I just wanted to goof around. At this point learning about branching helps. Though I wish wish SVN had full support for purging folders like Perforce.
