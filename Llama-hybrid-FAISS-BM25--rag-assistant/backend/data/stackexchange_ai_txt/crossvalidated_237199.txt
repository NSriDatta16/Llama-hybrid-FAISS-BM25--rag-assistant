(You won't get an "$F\,$" test statistic, because this is a non-normal GLM.) However, you can test a categorical variable or the interaction as a whole. This is called a 'simultaneous test'. To do this, you fit a nested model by dropping the variable in question. Then you perform a nested model test. Since you have a Gamma GLM, that would be a likelihood ratio test and the test statistic would be distributed as chi-squared. Nonetheless, you would get a test statistic and a p-value. To test the organ:site interaction in R , e.g., you would do: nested.model = glm(biom~fyear+organ+site+fyear:organ+fyear:site, # removed organ:site data=data, family=Gamma(link = "log")) anova(nested.model, GLM, test="LRT") Some other notes: Be aware that the test of a 'main effect' (i.e., organ ) in the context of a model that includes interaction terms that contain the variable in question only tests if the levels of that variable differ within the reference level of the interacting variable. If that is meaningful in your case (it could be, but often isn't), you can use the procedure I describe above. If it isn't meaningful, the question itself isn't meaningful unless all the encompasing interaction terms are sufficiently non-significant that they can be dropped entirely from the model. Then the model without any interaction terms would become the new 'full model' from which you could fit nested models to test those variables. Also, my guess is that the year variable can be considered an equal-interval continuous variable. I would probably set the first year equal to 0 and the remaining years 1, 2, 3 . That would most likely give you a better model and eliminate the singularity.
