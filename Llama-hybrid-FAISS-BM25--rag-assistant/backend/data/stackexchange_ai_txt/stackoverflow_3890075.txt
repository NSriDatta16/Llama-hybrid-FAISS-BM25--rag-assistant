HTML Snapshot for crawler - Understanding how it works

i'm reading this article today. To be honest, im really interessed to "2. Much of your content is created by a server-side technology such as PHP or ASP.NET" point. I want understand if i have understood :) I create that php script (gethtmlsnapshot.php) where i include the server-side ajax page (getdata.php) and i escape (for security) the parameters. Then i add it at the end of the html static page (index-movies.html). Right? Now... 1 - Where i put that gethtmlsnapshot.php? In other words, i need to call (or better, the crawler need) that page. But if i don't have link on the main page, the crawler can't call it :O How can crawler call the page with _escaped_fragment_ parameters? It can't know them if i don't specific them somewhere :) 2 - How can crewler call that page with the parameters? As before, i need link to that script with the parameters, so crewler browse each page and save the content of the dinamic result. Can you help me? And what do you think about this technique? Won't be better if the developers of crawler do their own bots in some others ways? :) Let me know what do you think about. Cheers
