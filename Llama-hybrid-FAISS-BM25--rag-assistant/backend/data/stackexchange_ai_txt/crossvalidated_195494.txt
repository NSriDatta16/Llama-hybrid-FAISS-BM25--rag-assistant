Difference between neural network architectures

Can someone explain to me the differences between the following neural network network architectures? How are they different in their prediction settings? Which networks are still used today, and why? Multi-layered perceptron Feedforward neural network Recurrent neural network Hopfield network Restricted Boltzmann machine Recursive neural network Convolutional neural network
