From the code you've posted there isn't an instant answer. My advice to debug this is: if you've copied the code exactly from that article then add something (a messagebox?) to the empty catch handler - `catch (Exception){ } use the debugger to put breakpoints in the LoadModel and SaveToIsolatedStorage methods use these breakpoints to step through the Load and Save code - is the code correctly loading and saving? To be honest, with problems like this, doing a little investigation yourself is much better than asking questions on here (IMO!)
