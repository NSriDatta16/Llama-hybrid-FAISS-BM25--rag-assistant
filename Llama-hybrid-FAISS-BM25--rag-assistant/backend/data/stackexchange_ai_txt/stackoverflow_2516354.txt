Yes it's possible. But you have to implement it yourself, not with auto properties. Your properties do not necessarily need to only work with member variables though that is the default. Remember that properties are actually turned into Getter and Setter methods and you can do a lot of work within their scope. Though this practice is usually discouraged. Good practices states that property access ought to be quick and not block the client code for long perieds of time. You could simply do this: public MyType MyProperty { get { if (_myProperty != null) return _myProperty else return XYZ; } set { _myProperty = value; } }
