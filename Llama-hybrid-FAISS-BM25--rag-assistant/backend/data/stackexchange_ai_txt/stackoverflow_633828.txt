Wrap an ArrayList with the Map interface. The ArrayList uses only a few bytes itself. Each node needs two pointers, one for the key and one for the value. Use sequential search to look up values. As long as there are only few entries, performance will be OK[*]. This will give you the leeway to use real maps for the few vases where you have a large number of values. *: Say your average map size is 10. Todays computers can compare roughly 100 million keys per second, so each lookup will take less than five microseconds on average. If the performance is still too bad for your use case, you can try to sort the array by key and use binary search.
