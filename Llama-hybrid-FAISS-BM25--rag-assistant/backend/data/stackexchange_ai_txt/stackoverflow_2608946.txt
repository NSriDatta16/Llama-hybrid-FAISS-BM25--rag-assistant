It may be hard to find any general resources on the subject, because it is quite specific area. I have implemented some population dynamics and I know that it is not easy to get all the behavior correct to ensure that the population does not die off or overgrows. It is relatively easy if you implement a simple scenario like in predator-prey model , but tends to get tricky as the number of factors increases. Some advice: Try to make behavior of agents parametrized Optimize the behavior parameters using some soft method, a neural network, a genetic algorithm or a simple hillclimbing algorithm, optimizing a single parameter of the simulation (like the time before the whole population dies off combined with average growth factor)
