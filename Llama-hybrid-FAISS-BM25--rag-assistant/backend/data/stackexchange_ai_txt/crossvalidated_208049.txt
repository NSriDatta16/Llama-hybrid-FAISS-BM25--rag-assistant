Comparing Self-Report Data to Binary results

I have two sets of data: DES scores (self-report) and whether dissociation was experienced during an experiment (yes or no). My sample size is 83 (71 no, 12 yes). I want to know if high DES scores are related to those 12 people experiencing dissociation. To my understanding this means I have a discrete independent variable and a binary dependent variable. Is that right? What would be the best way to compare these? I have an feeling independent t-test or Pearson correlation would be wrong. Would I need to do a logistic regression?
