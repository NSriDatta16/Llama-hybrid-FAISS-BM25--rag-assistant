The Bloomber GUI carries a vast amount of information in a very compact format:- Fixed cell monspaced characters are used so that data falls naturally into rows and columns, experienced users can locate the figure they are looking for instantly. Fonts are used to indicate (I think!) age and importance Colours generally indicate the direction of the change (blue = increase) (red = decrease) Traders stare at these screens obsessively, either waiting for some trigger price or trading volume on an individual stock, or, trying to divine an overall trading pattern in a market segement which they can take advantage of. Most of these conventions stem from when a Bloomberg terminal was just a "dumb" teletype with colours. But they work, they are fast and efficient and traders have years of familiarity with the conventions. This is similar to the user interface used by travel agents to book flights. Its essentially the same interface that was used in dumb terminals from the 80s. There is a "modern" GUI interface available but experienced agents just hate it and continue what is effectively an emulation of a dumb terminal.
