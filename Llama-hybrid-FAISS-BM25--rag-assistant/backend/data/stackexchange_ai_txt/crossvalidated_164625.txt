GARCH vs SV for Forecasting

I believe I am aware of how GARCH family and stochastic volatility models differ in their construction and assumptions on the volatility states, (i.e. GARCH family assumes deterministic volatility states while SV assumes stochastic volatility states). My primary goal is to improve 1-step ahead forecasts, mostly for financial and macro-economic times series. I will be doing a lot with energy commodities; crude oil, coal, and natural gas are some examples. For a series $\{y_t\}$, I will judge my models' performance with a log-scoring rule of the form $$ \sum_{t=s}^T\mathrm{log} P(y_t|\mathbf{y}_{t-1}) $$ where $\mathbf{y}_{t-1}=(y_1,...,y_{t-1})$, $1 \leq s It goes without saying that I can always run both types of models and compare them on the basis of this score, but given the overwhelming number of models at my disposal it would be very convenient to know beforehand which class of models, GARCH or SV, are more likely better suited for the task. Specifically I am interested in the following: For the purpose of probabilistic forecasting of financial and macro-economic time series: Is it known whether one class of model has a tendency to perform better than the other in general? From a computational standpoint, is one class of model significantly more convenient to estimate in a Bayesian paradigm than the other. Specifically for computing the posterior predictive log score above? Will a GARCH and SV model tend to produce similar forecasts in general, or will these differ drastically between the 2 classes of models? Moreover are the consequences of misspecifying a SV process by modeling it as a GARCH or vice versa likely to be very significant in a univariate time series, or is it usually "not that big of a deal". (I know this one is probably a real big "it depends", but if there is any general consensus, practical experience or a paper related to this topic it would be greatly appreciated) . I know these are very broad questions. If anyone has recommendations on how to make this question more answerable I welcome constructive comments.
