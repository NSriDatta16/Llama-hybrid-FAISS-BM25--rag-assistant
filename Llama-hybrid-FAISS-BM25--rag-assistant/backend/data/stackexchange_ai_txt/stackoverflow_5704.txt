Is there a lightweight, preferable open source, formattable label control for .NET?

I have been looking for a way to utilize a simple markup language, or just plain HTML, when displaying text in WinForm applications. I would like to avoid embedding a web browser control since in most of the case I just want to highlight a single word or two in a sentence. I have looked at using a RTFControl but I believe it's a bit heavy and I don't think the "language" used to do the formatting is easy. Is there a simple control that allows me to display strings like: This is a sample string with different formatting. I would be really neat if it was also possible to specify a font and/or size for the text. Oh, .NET 3.5 and WPF/XAML is not an option.
