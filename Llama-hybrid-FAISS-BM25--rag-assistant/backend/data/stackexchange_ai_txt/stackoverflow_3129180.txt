Where can I obtain a list of User Agents for SEO bots?

I am implementing a simplistic filter on how much of my site unregistered users can acces. Naturally, I want to give SEO bots free reign/access to most of the site. I know this is simplistic. But its not worth doing anything more complicated. I need to compile a list of names of user agents I will allow, for this, I need a list of the names of the bots, starting with Googlebot (I don't even know if that is the official spelling of Gogles web crawling bot). Anyone I would like a link to a definite resource that gives the names of the SEO indexing bots?. I tried http://www.user-agents.org/ but the granularity is not fine enough - it appears to list every user agent ever created!
