Categorical independent variable and logistic regression

I am creating a logistic regression model as follows. The dependent variable is outcome of a game (Win/Lost) and the independent variable is the degree of MOON on the day of match. So when I take a match, I get the value of Moon in degrees (1 to 360). I feel that degree is just a measurement from a fixed line of reference point and hence I have to consider the position of Moon as a categorical variable by dividing the 360 degrees into groups and noting the group in which Moon existed during a match. So I divided the degrees into 12 groups of 30 degrees (based on sun sign) each and note the position of Moon. Am I right? Can I still divide the whole 360 degrees into 27 divisions (83 or 249 divisions) to get exact information? Can I have 27 or 83 possible outcome for a single categorical variable? Let me know if I need to explain my question further. As of now i have a sample of 900 entries.
