C# 4.0 introduces a lot of dynamic language properties. Looking at articles such as this one " C# 4.0 goes dynamic " will shine a light on where C# came from, where it is, and how it compares with Ruby. The real kicker isn't the language so much as the framework. Going from Rails to MVC is an obvious first choice, avoid the ASP.NET WebForms side initially as the culture shock of drag-n-drop controls with ViewStates and "a little magic" may be a bit much to start with. And there are many articles showing C# programmers how to use Ruby and RoR because Rails is the hotness. You may want to read those as well because though you know Ruby/RoR already, many of these still compare similar language and framework features - such as comparing AR to LINQ.
