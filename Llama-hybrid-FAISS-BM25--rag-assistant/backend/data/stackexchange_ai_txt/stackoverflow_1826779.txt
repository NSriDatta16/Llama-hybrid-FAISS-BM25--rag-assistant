I dont know much about replication specifically, but sp_readerrorlog is a very useful stored procedure allowing you to access the DB logs from within the database instance. If required it may allow you to respond more appropriately based on the specific error messages rather than just SUCCESS/FAIL branches from a agent job. You can of course send an email directly from a stored proc too, customizing the recipients based on who can best respond to the error (or the time of day - day/night shift coordinators for example). Also perhaps it would be more appropriate to send an email if the job succeeds rather than fails, considering your potential failures include network disconnectivity? You might want to set up an exchange rule on your end to monitor this inbox and fire off an error notification to your admin if it doesnt receive an expected success message....humans are very good at filtering out constant stimulus and the lack of a success message could easily be missed. Exchange on the other hand is always (usually) vigilant.
