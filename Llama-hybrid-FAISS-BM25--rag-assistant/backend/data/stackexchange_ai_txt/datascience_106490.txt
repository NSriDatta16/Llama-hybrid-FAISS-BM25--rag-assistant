If you are asking how to integrate this, I would leverage existing search technologies such as storing documents in mongo database or using solr indices just to name a few.. If you are asking on the implementation details, take a look on topic modeling , tf-idf , cosine similarity , synonym replacements , k-nearest neighbors to get you started. A lot of these techniques could either be used at index time on incoming documents or at query time to perform minimum work to reduce search space scope even if your documents & queries are dynamically changing. You'll probably want to allocate a test set of ranked documents expected to be returned by sample queries so you can benchmark your improvements.
