Flot. Time Series. One Tick Per Day

I'm currently trying to create a flot graph where the x axis is a time series and has one tick per day. So for example if I was showing a graph for November I'd get a tick for each day in November. My xaxis config looks like this :- xaxis: { min: Date.UTC(2010, 0, 0, 0, 0), max: Date.UTC(2010, 1, 0, 0, 0), mode: "time", minTickSize: [1, "day"] } I think at the moment flot is trying to auto scale the xaxis so I'm actually getting one tick every 3 days. Thanks in advance.
