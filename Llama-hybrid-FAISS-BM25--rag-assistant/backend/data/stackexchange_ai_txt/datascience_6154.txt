The notes that accompany Stanford CS class CS231n : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, by Andrej Karpathy , do an excellent job of explaining convolutional neural networks. Reading this paper should give you a rough idea about: Deconvolutional Networks Matthew D. Zeiler, Dilip Krishnan, Graham W. Taylor and Rob Fergus Dept. of Computer Science, Courant Institute, New York University These slides are great for Deconvolutional Networks.
