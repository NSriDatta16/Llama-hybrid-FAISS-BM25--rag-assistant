I know this is not quite the same but, in a heavily used asp.net site using old fashioned data adapters, I used to open the connection to the database on page init and close it on page prerender. However I found that when the site was under more load the pages began to crawl. I read somewhere that it is always best to open as late as possible and close as early as possible. Now I open the context in each method, however due to linq 2 sql and its deferred execution I am not sure if this makes much difference. I would run the SQL profiler during busy moments to see where the bottle neck lies...
