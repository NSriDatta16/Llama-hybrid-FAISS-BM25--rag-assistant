Without any additional data description, i would try out something along these lines: Cluster the shapes of the sales curves using methods for longitudinal data clustering (K-means for longitudinal data / frechet distance...) Classify your products by using the features that you have as predictors and the cluster label as response (CHAID trees / random forests...) Predict class of new product will result in a probable future sales curve ? It will highly depend on the quality of the classifier though, but I think it's worth a try. hope this helps, and let us know what did you end up doing - will be interesting to hear.
