A simple and practical way of doing it could be to remove the trend from the data (you can do this fairly easily in Excel) and then calculate the standard deviation of the stationary time series (i.e with the trend removed). You should do this without the most recent data point in it (i.e. where the jump occurred). You then calculate how big the increase is from the stationary time series point. You can then calculate how many standard deviations the increase represents. If it is three or more standard deviations then you could argue that this increase in accidents is significant. Having said that, if you have noticed similar increases in the past then it is likely that there is some dynamic at play that is causing these increases (for example, there could've been bad weather in all of the years where there was an increase, or some similar dynamic). It won;t be possible for you to tell this without having access to other data that may be correlated or causally linked to the accident data.
