Yours is a common mistake due to Apple's unhelpful UI. Before validating and submitting your app via Xcode's Organizer, you must login to iTunes connect and submit all the information about your app (description, screen shots, etc.). Once you've submitted everything but the binary via iTunes Connect, your app will be in a "Waiting for Upload" state. Now if you go into Organizer and click "Validate Application..." you'll get a response. Once your app has been validated, you can click "Submit Application to iTunes Connect..." and cross your fingers for a quick acceptance.
