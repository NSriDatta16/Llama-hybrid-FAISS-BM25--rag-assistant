How to measure variable contribution to an observation in a non-linear model?

Based on my model, if I decline someone due to their score, it should be able to provide some reasoning as to which variables mainly contributed to the decision to decline. Typically in Logistic Regression models, this is a simple exercise where you calculate (Beta * X) for each variable and pick 1 or 2 variables which caused the biggest score drop. However, this isn't very straightforward for non-linear models. I would appreciate any ideas on handling something like this. Thanks.
