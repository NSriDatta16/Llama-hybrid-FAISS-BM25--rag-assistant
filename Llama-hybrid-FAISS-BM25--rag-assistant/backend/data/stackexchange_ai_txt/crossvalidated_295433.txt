Not directly answer your question but, It is important to keep in mind the difference between basis expansion and Kernel method / SVM . We can "expand data" using basis expansion in different ways. For example, polynomial expansion, splines, Fourier series, etc. These basis expansion have little to do with SVM, kernel trick. SVM with polynomial kernel provides use a "computational effect" ways to do polynomial basis expansion. Search Kernel trick for details.
