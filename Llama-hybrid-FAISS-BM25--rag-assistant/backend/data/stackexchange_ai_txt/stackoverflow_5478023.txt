Caching sessions in locmem:// means that you lose the session whenever the python process restarts. If you're running under the dev server, that would be any time you save a file. In a production environment, that will vary based on your infrastructure - mod_wsgi in apache, for example, will restart python after a certain number of requests (which is highly configurable). If you have multiple python processes configured, you'll lose your session whenever your request goes to a different process. What's more, if you have multiple servers in a production environment, locmem:// will only refer to one server process. In other words, don't use locmem:// for session storage.
