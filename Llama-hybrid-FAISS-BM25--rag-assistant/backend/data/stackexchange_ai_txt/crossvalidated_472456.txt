It so happened that 4 team members in my group of 18 happened to share same birth month. Let's say June. What are the chances that this could happen? I'm trying to present this as a probability problem in our team meeting. There are several other good answers here on the mathematics of computing probabilities in these "birthday problems". One point to note is that birthdays are not uniformly distributed over calendar days, so the uniformity assumption that is used in most analyses slightly underestimates the true probability of clusters like this. However, setting that issue aside, I would like to get a bit "meta" on you here and encourage you to think about this problem a little differently, as one that involves a great deal of "confirmation bias". Confirmation bias occurs in this context because you are more likely to take note of an outcome and seek a probabilistic analysis of that outcome if it is unusual (i.e., low probability). To put it another way, think of all the previous times in your life where you were in a room with people and learned their birthday month and the results were not unusual. In those cases, I imagine that you did not bother to come on CV.SE and ask a question about it. So the fact that you are here asking this question is an important conditioning event, that would only happen if you observe something that is sufficiently unusual to warrant the question. In view of this, the conditional probabiltity of the result you observed, conditional on your presence asking this question, is quite high --- much higher than the analysis in the other answers would suggest. To examine this situation more formally, consider these the following events: $$\begin{matrix} \mathcal{A}(x,y) & & & \text{Seeing } x \text{ people with same birthday month out of } y \text{ random people}, \\[6pt] \mathcal{B} & & & \text{Deciding the observed outcome warrants probabilistic investigation}. \ \end{matrix}$$ Most of the answers here are telling you how to estimate $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{A}(4,18))$ but the actual probabilty at play here is the conditional probability $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{A}(4,18) | \mathcal{B})$ , which is much , much higher (and cannot really be computed here).
