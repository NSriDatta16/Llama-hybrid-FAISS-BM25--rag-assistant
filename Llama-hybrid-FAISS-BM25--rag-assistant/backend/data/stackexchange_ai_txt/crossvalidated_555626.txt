Causal Inference Short Time Series

I am trying to analyse causal inference associated with an intervenion using either Difference-in-Differences or Interrupted Time Series Analysis. I have a discrete time series consisting of data covering a four year period, which could either be aggregated by month [allowing for 24 observations in both the pre- and post-intervention periods] or quarterly [8 observations in each period]. Ideally, I assume that aggregation by month would be preferable....however there is a distinct possibility that there will be a large number of zero value observations, which I assume would make the use of regression techniques more complex. Were aggregation to be undertaken by quarter there would likely be less zeros, but much potentially insufficient observations for ITS [as the preferred method]. Does anyone know of reliable models for use in regards to data with either a small number of observations or data with large numbers of zero values? Any help hugely appreciated.....
