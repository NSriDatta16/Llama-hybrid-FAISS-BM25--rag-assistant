For classifiers the critical issue is the ratio of variance within groups to variance between group means. With SVM the shape of the groups can be more complex than a simple linear discriminant analysis but the same principle holds (SVM can be viewed as remapping a complex group shape into a simple one). What this means is that overall variance across the dataset can't predict performance in a classifier. If the data cleanup has removed irrelevant variations then the classifier should work better. If the variations removed by the cleanup are relevant to the classier it will be worse.
