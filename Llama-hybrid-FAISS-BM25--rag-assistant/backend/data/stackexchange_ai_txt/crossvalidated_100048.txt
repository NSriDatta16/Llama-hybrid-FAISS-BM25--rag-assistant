A Markov process is a stochastic process with the Markovian property (when the index is the time, the Markovian property is a special conditional independence, which says given present, past and future are independent.) A Bayesian network is a directed graphical model. (A Markov random field is a undirected graphical model.) A graphical model captures the conditional independence, which can be different from the Markovian property. I am not familiar with graphical models, but I think a graphical model can be seen as a stochastic process.
