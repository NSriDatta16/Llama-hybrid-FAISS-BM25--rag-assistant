This is not only fine, but good practice and the whole point of having interfaces as abstractions. See LSP on wikipedia. It allows you to use any implementer of IList (so, not just List , in case you want to change the internal implementation). As for "will it compile and run" question - the answer is yes and yes, however, I encourage you to try for yourself . You will learn more and faster than posting here... As @Dan Tao comments, try for yourself, but confirm (either here or with experienced colleagues).
