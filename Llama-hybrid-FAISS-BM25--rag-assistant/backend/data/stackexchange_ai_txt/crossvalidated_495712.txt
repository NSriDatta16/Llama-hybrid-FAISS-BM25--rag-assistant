Unless I've very much misunderstood, this is a straightforward classification problem: you have five continuous predictors, $Q \in \mathbb{R}^5$ , and 10 possible categories, $m \in \{1,2,\dotsc,10\}$ , and you can produce as much training data as you like by simulating from the neural network. You can use almost any classification algorithm for this, and the suitability of different classifiers will depend on the distribution of the features $Q$ within and between categories. Multinomial logistic regression is a good place to start, and this will automatically estimate the probability that each sample belongs to each category.
