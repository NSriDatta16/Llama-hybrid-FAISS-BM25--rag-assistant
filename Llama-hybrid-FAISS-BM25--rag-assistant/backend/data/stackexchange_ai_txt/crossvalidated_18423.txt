How can I compare two classifications?

My job is to develop a classification that groups together diagnoses of similar cost and procedures of similar cost, by similar anatomy. For instance a hip replacement would not be in the same group as a heart transplant as they cost different amounts and are not clinically similar. We revise this huge classification yearly and I've been tasked to prove that changes we make, make it 'better'. I know :-( Numerically we used to look at reduction in variance, does this way of grouping explain more variance than this way of grouping? However, a lot of the clustering decisions are based on clinical reasoning, not numerical. Two procedures may cost the same but you may not put them in the same group as one requires anaesthetic and one doesn't! This obviously cannot be measured in the same way. I'm not wanting to assess the accuracy of the algorithm (ie has the patient dropped into the right group for what is wrong with them) but a method of comparing the way groups are defined. Thanks!! I couldn't add a comment to your question so I've added here: The classification is used to collect costs from hospitals. Each hospital calculates the average cost to them to deliver the service described by each group within the classification (there are around 1500 groups within the classification such as Heart transplants, disorders of spleen, procedures on lymphatic system etc..). These hospital level costs are collated to provide a national average for each group which in turn is used to calculate a tariff for the government to pay those hospitals for that service. The variance I described is the variance in costs reported - one hospital may say it costs them £2000 to do a hip replacment, another may say £8000. If we say there are 20 different ways to define a hip replacement (different kinds of surgery), 19 of the 20 may cost around 2K while one may cost £20k. It would be appropriate to move that 20K hip replacement into a different group with other 20K procedures. How could we show statistically that making this change has improved the quality of the costs within each group by reducing the cost variance in each group? Hope that makes sense!
