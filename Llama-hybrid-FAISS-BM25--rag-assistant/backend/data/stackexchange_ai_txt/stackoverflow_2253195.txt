We have a tool now that measures the complexity of our code modules. It runs on our PL/SQL modules, but I believe that there are tools available on other environments. There are various sections throughout, but it was quite an eye-opener to management when several of our key modules were marked as 'untestable'. We combined with an imact analysis tool that help highlight duplicate functionality, and approached packaged this all up as an assessment of 'technical debt'. As we could present this on a module-by-module basis, it would have been easy to identify the perpetrators (we did, but didn't report it). As it was, the organisation was more geared to improvement going forward than finger-pointing. (As an aside, all code is now submitted for review, and an accompanying code-analysis must be supplied. Things are definately getting better here.)
