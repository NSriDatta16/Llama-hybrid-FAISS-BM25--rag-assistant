Thread safety... what's my "best" course of action?

I'm wondering what is the "best" way to make data thread-safe. Specifically, I need to protect a linked-list across multiple threads -- one thread might try to read from it while another thread adds/removes data from it, or even frees the entire list. I've been reading about locks; they seem to be the most commonly used approach, but apparently they can be problematic (deadlocks). I've also read about atomic-operations as well as thread-local storage. In your opinion, what would be my best course of action? What's the approach that most programmers use, and for what reason?
