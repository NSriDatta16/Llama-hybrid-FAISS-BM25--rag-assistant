Python: Installing man pages in distutils based project

I have a Python project which is basically a set of command line scripts and a helper package. As these scripts have a number of command line options I decided to create a manual page for each script and used ronn ( http://rtomayko.github.com/ronn/ ) to write manuals in Markdown and generate mdoc from it. The question is: how to generate and install man pages in distutils based project? I came up with the following solution: create an simple install.sh script which generates and installs manual pages. I call this script from the overloaded 'install' command and pass specified prefix to it... you can check actual code here: http://github.com/novel/lc-tools . I don't quite like this solution as for the simple task I have to add some hacks to setup.py and implement a shell script as well. Moreover, I use ${PREFIX}/share/man for man page path and it's not correct for all systems, e.g. FreeBSD seem to install 3rd party man pages to /usr/local/man (i.e. no share/ ). Are there more elegant ways to do this?
