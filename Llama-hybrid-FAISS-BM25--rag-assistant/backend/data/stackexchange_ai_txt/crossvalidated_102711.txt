1) It is never acceptable to suppress an intercept except in very rare types of DiD models where the outcome and predictors are actually computed differences between groups (this isn't the case for you). 2). Heck no it doesn't. What it means is that you may have a higher degree of internal validity (e.g. the model fits the data) but probably a low degree of external validity (e.g. the model would be poor in fitting experimental data obtained under similar conditions). This is generally a bad thing. 3) Suppressing the intercept will not necessarily do that, but I assume the predictor was continuous valued. In many situations, process completion times are analyzed using an inverse transform, e.g. $x = 1/t$ where $t$ is the time taken to complete a process. The inverse of the mean of inverse transformed data is called a harmonic mean and represents the average complete time for a task. $$\mbox{HM} = \frac{1}{\mathbb{E}(x)} = \frac{1}{\mathbb{E}(1/t)} $$ You can also use a parametric exponential or gamma or weibull time-to-event models which are types of models built specifically for predicting completion times. These will give results very similar to the inverse transformed outcomes.
