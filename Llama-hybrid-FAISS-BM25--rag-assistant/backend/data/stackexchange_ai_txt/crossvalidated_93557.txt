Updating set of probabilities for sampling with features importance

I'm currently working on some algorithm and I'm kinda out of idea for a problem I'm trying to tacle. Basically I'm trying to subsample the features of a dataset. I want to subsample that given this critera : if the feature is relevant it has a high chance of being drawn if the feature is not relevent it has a low chance of being drawn if it is not yet know if the feature is relevant or not it has an average chance of being drawn In fact I'm drawing a subsample my feature at random than build a model that gives me the feature importances then I'm drawing my features again with the critera I explained above and then repeat that until I'm satisfied with my model. The only thing that I have left to do is to find the right "formula" that would ponderate well the score that will help me calculate the probabilities to draw my variables. Given the nature of the problem I would also like that if a feature is relevant in a certain set of feature and not in another it evens out. I'm really open for all ideas. Thank you.
