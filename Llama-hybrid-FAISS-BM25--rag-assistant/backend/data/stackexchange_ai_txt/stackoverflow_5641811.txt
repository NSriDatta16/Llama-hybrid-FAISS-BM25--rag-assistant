Recommendation for Jquery Calendar plugin with multiple months displayed

I'm looking for a way to display multiple months and allow the user to select a date range across those months by clicking and dragging their mouse. As you may know, looking for jQuery plugins (a plugin would be best at this point due to time constraints) can bring back mixed results and it's tough to know which one to trust. All that to say, can anyone recommend a quality plugin which offers the functionality I've described? Thanks in advance.
