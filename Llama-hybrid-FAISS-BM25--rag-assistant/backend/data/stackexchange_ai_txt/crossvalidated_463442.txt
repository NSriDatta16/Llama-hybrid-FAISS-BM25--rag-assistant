How to model toxicity curves

I have curves, describing survival of cells in a toxic agent: One curve per cell line, the concentration of the agent on the x-axis and the fraction of survived cells on the y-axis: I'd like to draw a smooth curve through these points. I thought I might use Hill equation (which is essentially a logistic function). However, logistic function is always $ , while my survival curves start at exactly 1 and can even rise above (cells multiply, and there are measurement errors). Or should I work with the absolute number of surviving cells? This is somewhat problematic, because experiments on different cell lines start with different number of cells:
