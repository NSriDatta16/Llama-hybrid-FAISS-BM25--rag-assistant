Can you calculate Confidence Intervals for a logistic regression if you just have Estimate, OR, and p value?

I have this data that is the result of a logistic regression. df , class = c("spec_tbl_df", "tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")) And unfortunately I don't believe we have access to the original "raw" data anymore that this regression was based on. I've been asked to provide the confidence intervals. Normally I would export these at the time of the regression, but since I don't have access to that anymore, I was looking for another route. It seems like you MAY be able to calculate confidence intervals from a p-value but I apologize, I wasn't quite clear how I could apply this to the results of this regression. Is it possible? And if so, could someone help me do it?
