This looks like a good application for semantic segmentation . In fact, there have been contests in the past that address something very similar to your problem (e.g. http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/semantic-labeling.html ). The goal in semantic segmentation is to classify each pixel in an image with its class. It's a fairly popular deep learning application these days. Typically, the training data comprises many pairs of an optical image (like you have) with a mask which specifies the class for each pixel in the image. To create a dataset for semantic segmentation, I'd use the optical image as an input, and generate masks like the one in your second picture to be the target output. I'd probably employ several semantic segmentation models available online and see which ones work best. If you're looking for tutorials, a Google search for "semantic segmentation tutorial" turns up quite a few results. I even managed to find a few that are applied to aerial imagery! I won't post the links here, but I'm sure you can find them. Finally, Papers With Code lists quite a few research papers (with code!) that may be useful to you.
