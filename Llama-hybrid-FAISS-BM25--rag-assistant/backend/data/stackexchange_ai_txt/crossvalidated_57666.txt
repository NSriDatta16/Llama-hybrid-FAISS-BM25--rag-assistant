(Hoermann and Leydold 2003) provide one application of such a problem with a discussion of an algorithm. In this case we have points on a CDF and a PDF, and we want to write the CDF as an interpolating spline and use the fact that the PDF gives the first derivatives of the CDF. Moreover, it also includes the constraint that a CDF is never decreasing. In this case the purpose is to invert the CDF to get an approximation of the quartile function. This is pretty specific, but it may give you enough inspiration to solve your problem. Hoermann, Wolfgang and Leydold, Josef. (2003). Continuous random variate generation by fast numerical inversion.
