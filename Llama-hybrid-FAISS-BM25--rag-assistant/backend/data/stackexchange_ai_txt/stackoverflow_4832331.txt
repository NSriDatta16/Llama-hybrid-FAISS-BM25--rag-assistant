C++ Macro text manipulation

I would like to write a C++ macro taking arbitrary argument like: #define MANIP(...) \ //Implementation Such that writing MANIP(m_a, m_b, m_c); expands to f(a, b, c); g("a", "b", "c"); Is this possible? Thank you in advance for helping me with this seemingly extravagant question :)
