Use X509Certificate without requiring passphrase

I have a certificate that I need to use in order to access a web service. The problem is that whenever I try to use the X509 certificate it asks for a passphrase (PIN). Is there any way of providing the passphrase directly, without it popping up the same window every time? The certificate uses a dongle made by Oberthur Technologies, if it's of any help. Here's the code I use to get the certificate: X509Store store = new X509Store("MY",StoreLocation.CurrentUser); store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly | OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly); X509Certificate2Collection collection = (X509Certificate2Collection)store.Certificates; if(collection.Count != 0) userCert = collection[0]; // everything's ok up to here And here's where I use the certificate: HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(new Uri(url)); req.ClientCertificates.Add(userCert); // add the certificate I just got // ... WebResponse ret = req.GetResponse(); // here's where it asks me for my passphrase
