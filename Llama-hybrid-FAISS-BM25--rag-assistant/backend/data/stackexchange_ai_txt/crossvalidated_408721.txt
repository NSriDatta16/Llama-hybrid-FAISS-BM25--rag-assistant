R: How can I calculate the F-statistic of a logistic model in R?

I am running a logistic regression in R and I noticed that the output does not include the F-statistic which shows the overall significance of the model. In another post , the formula for the F-statistic is given for a linear regression. My question is, is the F-statistic a valid measure of significance for the logistic model? if so, how can I calculate it?
