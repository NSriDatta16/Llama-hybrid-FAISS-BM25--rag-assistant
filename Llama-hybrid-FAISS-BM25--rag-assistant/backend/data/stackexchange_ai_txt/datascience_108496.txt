Interpretation of statistical features in ML model

I have a data like as shown below (working on classification problem using traditional classification and DL based approaches) I see in feature engineering tutorials (and tools) here and here , they usually compute basic statistics features based on numeric column such as max(loan amount) , min(loan amount) , sum(loan amount) , stddev(loan amount) , average (loan amount) etc. I understand all these are done in an attempt to increase the predictive power of the model. However, my question is what does it mean when max(loan amount) or std dev(loan amount) is an important feature? can help me understand what insight does it convey? how to interpret this feature? can explain in simple english? Let's assume we run a random forest model and in the feature importance we see that max(loan amount) is the top most feature. What does it mean? I am looking for meaning to understand the insight that it communicates. This question is not about the model. It's simply about the meaning of the term/feature std dev (loan amount) or max(loan amount) or min(loan amount)
