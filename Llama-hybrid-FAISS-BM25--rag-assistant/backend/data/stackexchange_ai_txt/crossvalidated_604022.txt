Visualizing distributions of measurements with uncertainty

Suppose I have a vector of measurements, each of which has an associated potential measurement error. E.g. all my measurements are of the form $2 \pm 0.5$ or something like that. I can look at the distribution of the measurements (ignoring the standard error) by making a histogram or boxplot or whatever. But is there a good way to convey through a univariate graphical representation what the uncertainty in the measurements is? I read this post about error bars for histograms, but it appears that there is no definitive way to do this, if adding error bars to the histogram is even the best way to show potential error collected like this. Update: I'm assuming that all of the measurements are normally distributed, e.g. $x_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\text{point measurement}, \ \text{standard error}).$ I know that if I make this assumption, I can get an approximate distribution for the sum or average or whatever, but I'm really interested in trying to visualize this with uncertainty without having to take any summary statistics. Here's some example data (formatted for R input). structure(list(x = c(-0.06, 0.64, -1.71, -1.56, 2.28, 1.03, 0.07, -0.46, 2.14, 0.59, -2.22, 0.15, 0.62, -0.34, 0.18, -0.87, 0.68, 0.85, 0.25, -0.32, 1.1, -0.21, -0.26, 0.45, -0.68, 0.07, 1.71, -1.33, -0.73, 0.79, -0.5, 0.4, 0.59, -0.83, 1.42, -0.73, 0.55, 0.58, 0.71, -1.14, 0.56, 0.56, -0.25, -0.48, -0.6, -1.37, -1.56, -1.27, -0.17, -0.36), se = c(0.13, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.13, 0.14, 0.16, 0.14, 0.15, 0.15, 0.12, 0.14, 0.15, 0.13, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.13, 0.15, 0.13, 0.15, 0.12, 0.13, 0.13, 0.15, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.15, 0.13, 0.15, 0.14, 0.13, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.15, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14 )), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -50L))
