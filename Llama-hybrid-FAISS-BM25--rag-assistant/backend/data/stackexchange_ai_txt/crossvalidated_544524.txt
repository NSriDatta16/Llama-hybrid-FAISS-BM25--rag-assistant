A random variable $R$ is said to be continuous if for every real number $t,$ the probability that $R$ equals $t$ is zero $P(R = t) = 0.$ A random variable $R$ is said to be discrete if there exists a countable set of values $t_1, \ldots, t_n, \ldots$ such that $P(R = t_i) > 0$ for all $i$ and $\sum\limits_i P(R = t_i) = 1.$ The Radon-Nikodym and Lebesgue Decomposition theorems show every the cumulative distribution function (a.k.a. CDF) of every random variable can be expressed as $$ F = aF_{ac} + b F_{dc} + c F_{pm} $$ where $a, b, c \geq 0$ and $a + b + c = 1,$ where $F_{ac}$ is the CDF of an absolutely continuous random variable (i.e. $F_{ac}$ admits a density), and $F_{dc}$ is the CDF of degenerated continuous random variable and $F_{pm}$ is the CDF of a discrete random variable (so pm stands for point-mass). It is hard to construct examples of degenerated continuous random variables for their CDF must be continuous, increasing, not constant, and have a zero derivative almost everywhere. A typical example is Cantor's Devil Staircase function ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_function ). So you usually assume that random variables are either absolutely continuous, discrete or mixture of these two types. EDIT: this question received a lot of attention, so let me expand a bit. This definition is motivated on the 1D case (univariate random variables). The condition that $P(R = t) = 0$ for all $t$ signifies that the CDF of $R$ is a continuous function $\mathbf{R} \to [0,1].$ Indeed, it is a well-known fact that a CDF is non-decreasing function, a fortiori it can only have jump discontinuities. But a jump discontinuity of a CDF is precisely at the "atoms" of the distributions (an "atom" of a random variable $R$ is a value values $t$ such that $P(R = t) > 0$ ). To see this, we use that the CDF $F$ is already (by definition) continuous on the right, so that $F$ is continuous if and only if is continuous on the left. Now, $$ F(t) - F(t - \delta) = P(R \leq t) - P(R \leq t - \delta) = P(t - \delta by measure-theoretic properties of $P,$ the right hand side converges to $P(R = t),$ so that $F$ is continuous on the left if and only if $P(R = t) = 0,$ which is the main motivation to call an atomless random variable a "continuous random variable."
