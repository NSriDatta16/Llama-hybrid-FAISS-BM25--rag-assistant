It's a general purpose programming language. To paraphrase Kent Pitman on the question of what Common Lisp is useful for: ...Please don't assume [Smalltalk] is only useful for Animation and Graphics, AI, Bioinformatics, B2B and E-Commerce, Data Mining, EDA/Semiconductor applications, Expert Systems, Finance, Intelligent Agents, Knowledge Management, Mechanical CAD, Modeling and Simulation, Natural Language, Optimization, Research, Risk Analysis, Scheduling, Telecom, and Web Authoring just because these are the only things they happened to list. It's particularly suited for applications that cannot have downtime - it's quite normal to patch a running server in deep ways (say, by changing the shape of your class ) without taking the server down - or systems that are very complex or have rapidly changing requirements.
