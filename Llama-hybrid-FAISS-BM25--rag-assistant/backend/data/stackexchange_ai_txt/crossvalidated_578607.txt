Find extreme values in relative frequencies

I have the relative frequencies of elements in roughly 450 samples (with varying sample sizes). These elements are organisms in fecal samples. I am interested in finding extreme values of these relative frequencies per element. In context, this would refer to organisms that occur "too much" or "too little" in the fecal sample, which is informative for the health of the animal the sample comes from. Would it be good practice to fit a distribution, calculate confidence intervals for the means and mark values outside of that as extreme? I added an image of the distribution of a few elements as an example. As can be seen, the distributions seem right-skewed heavily. What would be an appropriate distribution to fit? Because of the shape I was thinking of Weibull, though perhaps there are distributions specifically for these situations that I am unaware of. A more straightforward approach would be simply taking the 5th and 95th percentile. How would results differ in that case?
