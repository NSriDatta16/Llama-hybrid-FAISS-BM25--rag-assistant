posterior Gaussian distribution

I have quite a newbie doubt about Bayesian inference. Let's say that my prior data is composed by a Gaussian distribution (mean1, standard deviation1). My likelihood is another Gaussian with mean2, std deviation2. Now, my question is how can I get the posterior, please? The most clear tutorial I found is this , in eq(28), but I do not have clear whether the author is applying Monte Carlo there or not.
