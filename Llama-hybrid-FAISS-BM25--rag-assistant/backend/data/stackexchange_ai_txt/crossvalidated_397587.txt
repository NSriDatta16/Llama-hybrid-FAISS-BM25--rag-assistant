Convolutional layers are not equivariant to rotation, and pooling layers only help with invariance to small rotations. "Invariance" of the whole classifier to rotations is not part of the inductive bias, but it's actually learned through heavy data augmentation. However, for each group action there exists a corresponding group convolution operator which is equivariant to it. This concept is used, for example, in 3D Steerable CNNs: Learning Rotationally Equivariant Features in Volumetric Data by Weiler, Geiger, Welling, Boomsma and Cohen, 2018, to design layers which are equivariant to 3D rotations: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02547.pdf
