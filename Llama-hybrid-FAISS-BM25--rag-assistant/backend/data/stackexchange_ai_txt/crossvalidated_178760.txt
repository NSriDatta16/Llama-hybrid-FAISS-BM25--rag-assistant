As others have mentioned in the comments, multinomial logistic regression (MLR) would be my first recommendation for what you are trying to do. It produces estimated probabilities that sum up to 1 across the categories for each person, and these probabilities can be interpreted as the probability of choosing category X given the covariates and the alternatives listed. MLR also gives you covariate information about how each covariates affects the outcome, but the interpretation of the coefficients of the covariates, as mentioned, is relative to the baseline category. An alternative that you can consider for estimating these probabilities is using random forests. It is an ensemble of classification trees that works in the following way: Grows say, 1000 different classification trees based on 1000 bootstrap samples of your dataset. For each person, use the 1000 classfication trees to classify the person into one of the categories you have. For category X, the probability of being in that category is: # trees that classified the person into X / 1000 Random forests can also tell you which covariates are important, however as far as I know they do not tell you HOW the covariates affect the outcome.
