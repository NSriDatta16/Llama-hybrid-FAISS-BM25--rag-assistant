Strange result with GLMM (binomial)

I'm analyzing some data, using GLMM and obtain very strange results. The data is of student passing a test, each group of students belong to a different school. So I analyzed the data using glmer(is_pass ~ (1|school), data, family = 'binomial') . The schools are the random effect. Now, the proportion of passing is very high. The average across all schools is 0.99 . However, the confidence interval obtained from the GLMM is between 0.68 - 1 . Furthermore, if I construct the Clopper-Pearson CI for each of the schools individually each CI is actually shorter (with the minimal one, the only school where students failed its 0.75 - 0.99 ). Confidence.Interval Lower.limit Upper.limit alpha two.sided 0.8765639 1.0000000 0.05 1 two.sided 0.8765639 1.0000000 0.05 2 two.sided 0.8765639 1.0000000 0.05 3 two.sided 0.8842967 1.0000000 0.05 4 two.sided 0.8765639 1.0000000 0.05 5 two.sided 0.8518149 1.0000000 0.05 6 two.sided 0.8628148 1.0000000 0.05 7 two.sided 0.8575264 1.0000000 0.05 8 two.sided 0.7486971 0.9905446 0.05 The glmer function returns no error or warnings. Why does it happen? and how can I circumvent it? Data attached in dput structure as well as code for analysis. library(lme4) library(tidyverse) data % group_by(school) %>% summarise(mean_pass = mean(is_pass), sum_pass = sum(is_pass), n = n()) cis $sum_pass[i], clopper_ci$ n[i], CI ='two.sided', alpha = 0.05) cis
