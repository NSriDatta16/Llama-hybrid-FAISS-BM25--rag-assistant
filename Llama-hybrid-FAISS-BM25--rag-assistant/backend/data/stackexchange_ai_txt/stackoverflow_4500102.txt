WiX Compile Error Creating Custom Dialog

I've been trying to insert a custom dialog into the WixUI_InstallDir UI sequence. I have a "main" file named Product.wxs and the custom dialog in another file named InstallTypeDlg.wxs - both of which are present in Installer.wixproj . Within InstallTypeDlg.wxs , I have the following: 1 I reference this custom dialog in Product.wxs thus: 1 1 Now, when I compile this project, I get the following error: InstallTypeDlg.wxs(8,0): error LGHT0094: Unresolved reference to symbol 'Property:InstallType' in section 'Fragment:'. I have no idea why. Have I forgotten something? :-/ I'm fairly new to WiX, having only picked it up yesterday. Any help would be much appreciated. I am using Wix 3.5.2415.0 .
