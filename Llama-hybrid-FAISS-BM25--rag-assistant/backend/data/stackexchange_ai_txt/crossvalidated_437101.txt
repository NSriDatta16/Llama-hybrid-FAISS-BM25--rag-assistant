Is a GLM the best option to analyze my data with R?

I would like to see which factors can better explain the success of a particular event to happen. I'm interested in 4 factors, being before , during , season and observer . All 4 factors have only two possible outcomes ( before : wet and dry ; during : wet and dry , season : Winter and Fall ) except observer , which has up to four. I've organized my data the following way: head(data) success before during season observer 1: no wet dry Winter 1 2: yes wet dry Winter 2 3: yes wet dry Fall 1 4: yes wet dry Fall 4 5: no wet dry Winter 3 6: no wet dry Fall 1 My idea is to look at how this factors (predictor variables) best explain the response variable ( success : yes or no ) to happen. I would like to test this with and without interactions between predictor variables. All models will be constructed and the one yielding the lowest AICc will be the one best explaining a " success:yes " (e.g. success~before * after * season * observer). Would that be the right approach given my data? I'm unsure about what type of distribution to use, although I would assume binomial because only two possible outcomes are possible ( yes and no ). Any other suggestions are welcomed. Also, is it necessary to include a random effect?
