Disclaimer: It has been decades since I last did PASCAL, so my syntax may not be exactly correct. You have to remember that PASCAL is Nicklaus Wirth's child, and Wirth cared very strongly about reliability and understandability when he designed PASCAL (and all of its successors). Consider the following code fragment: FOR I := 1 TO 42 (* THE UNIVERSAL ANSWER *) DO FOO(I); Without looking at procedure FOO, answer these questions: Does this loop ever end? How do you know? How many times is procedure FOO called in the loop? How do you know? PASCAL forbids modifying the index variable in the loop body so that it is POSSIBLE to know the answers to those questions, and know that the answers won't change when and if procedure FOO changes.
