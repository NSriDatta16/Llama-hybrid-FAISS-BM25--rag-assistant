This isn't a browser issue, it's an HTTP issue. You appear to be serving dynamic files without specifying that they shouldn't be cached. Use the Cache-Control: no-cache HTTP header to indicate this. Pragma: no-cache is the ancient HTTP 1.0 way, you can include it, but alone it is unlikely to be 100% effective.
