I think that this really depends. Certainly having used SSIS a lot I have found it to be a very flexible tool, suited nicely to the purposes that you describe above (although a little more detail on the file reformatting/data transformation might be useful). I would be interested to know if SSIS is a tool that you already have available to you, or if you would be purchasing it especially for this task. If the tools are there already for everyone to use then I am of the opinion that it perfectly suitable. The licence costs for developer editions are very reasonable, and I don't have much of a problem with the fact that you won't be utilising any of the database aspects of this (if I have understood you correctly). I would also be interested to know if there is some sort of automation planned for what you are doing. i.e. some place where processes would be run that could be deemed a 'LIVE' environment. If so, then you may find costs associated with the provision of a SQL Server - Server Licence. A licence of this sort that is able to run SSIS packages isn't a small amount of money, although I'm not the most knowledgeable about this, so this question is maybe best deferred to a more appropriate forum (e.g. ServerFault). You mentioned that the organisation have an in-house programming language. This may be inefficient, however I'm guessing that this fits in with some sort of existing framework/environment for change control, shipping, etc. If you are introducing SSIS, then you will find that you may have to integrate this into existing processes. I'm not saying that a show-stopper, but all part of considerations that you may have to make.
