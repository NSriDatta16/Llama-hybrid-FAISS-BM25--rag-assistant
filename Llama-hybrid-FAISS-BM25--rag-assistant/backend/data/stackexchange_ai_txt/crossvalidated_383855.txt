Compound risk poisson models

I was just working through this question. A compound Poisson risk model is used to model the total claims S experienced by an insurance company over one year, of the form: $S = X_1 + ... + X_n$ where $ X_i$ represents the size of claim $i$ and $N$ is the total number of claims, following a Poisson distribution. Each claim size $X_i$ is distributed according to $X_i$ ~ $Gamma(α,λ) $ In the 5 preceding years the average number of claims per year has been 14. The average claim size has been 500 and the standard deviation of claim sizes has been 150. I am supposed to estimate: a) $α$ and $λ $ for the Gamma distribution b) The variance and mean for the total number of claims My attempt at a solution, I am not sure if correct. a) I used the method of moments.The first moment (i.e. mean) is given by $E(X)= α/λ $ , and the second moment (i.e. variance) is given by $ Var(X) = \alpha/\lambda^2 $ . Setting E(X) = 500, and Var(X) = $150^2 $ , we solve for $ \alpha $ and $ \lambda $ : $500\lambda = \alpha$ Therefore, the variance will be: $ \alpha/\lambda^2= 150^2$ $ 500\lambda/\lambda^2 = 22500$ $\lambda= 500/22500 = 0.0222$ $\alpha = 11.111 $ b) This part I am completely lost at. EDIT Do we have to use the double expectation theorem here? This would give an expected mean for $S$ of $ 500*14 = 700$ . Still no clue how to calculate the variance though.
