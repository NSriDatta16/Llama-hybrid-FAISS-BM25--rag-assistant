Writing into .php file is not a good idea at all. Better to store your config in database, .ini file or xml file. Using this "storages" for config make it really easy to read and write. Attention: please note that you should put .ini, .xml files out from your document root directory to avoid accessing it from web. Also, I advise you to check Zend Config http://framework.zend.com/manual/ru/zend.config.html to see how writing to config is implemented in OOP MVC framework.
