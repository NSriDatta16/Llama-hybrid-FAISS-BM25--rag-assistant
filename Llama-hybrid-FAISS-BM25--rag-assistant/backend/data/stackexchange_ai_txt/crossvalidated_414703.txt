What is difference between interrupted time series and regression discontinuity design

Say that one has data over time, t , on an outcome, y . There is an event that happens at t==0 . One is interested in testing for evidence that the event is related to (I am being cautious on a causal interpretation) a change in the outcome. Importantly, there are many observations for each t (as opposed to a traditional time series when there is only one observation per t ). Suppose also that this is not a situation where the event happened in only or some of the units (e.g., states), but that there is only one unit. This rules out an analysis such as a difference in difference as there is no control group. In a situation like this, should I use a interrupted time series analysis or regression discontinuity design? If both are fine, what are the differences/advantages/disadvantages? (I am also much more familiar with RDD than the interrupted time series; where is a good place to learn about the latter?)
