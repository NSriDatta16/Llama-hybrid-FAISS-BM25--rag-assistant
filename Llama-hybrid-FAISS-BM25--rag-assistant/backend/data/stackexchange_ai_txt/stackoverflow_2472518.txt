iPhone - Can I look at the directory file

Once I connect my iPhone to my computer, is there anyway I can look at the directory structure on the phone? Would it work like a USB device for example and let me copy files without using iTunes but just drag and drop through the Finder on a Mac? Thanks, Tee
