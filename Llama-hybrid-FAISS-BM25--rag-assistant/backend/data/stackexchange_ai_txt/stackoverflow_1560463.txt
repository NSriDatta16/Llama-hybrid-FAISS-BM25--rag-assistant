Why are browser-specific CSS hacks not patched by agent developers?

Second line of the following is not recognisable by IE6/Windows #header {margin-bottom:3em} html>body #header {margin-bottom:1em} I can understand that the child selector is a feature not implemented by IE6. But IE/Mac will not recognize the following: /* Hide from IE-Mac \*/ #header {margin-bottom:3em} #footer {margin-top:1.5em} /* End hide */ This seems to be a bug. Usually agent developers gives patches. Why it is not patched? Any specific reason?
