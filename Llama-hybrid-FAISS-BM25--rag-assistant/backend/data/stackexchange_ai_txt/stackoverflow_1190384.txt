Every tool has its own right There is plenty of hype arround XML, I know. But you should see, that XML is basically an exchange format -- not a storage format (unless you use a native XML-Database that gives you more options -- but also might add some headaches). When your configuration is rather small (say less than 10.000 records), you might use XML and be fine. You will load the whole thing into your memory and access the entries there. Done. But when your configuration is so big, that you dont want to load it completely, than you rethink your decission and stay with SQLite which gives you the option to dynamically load those parts of the configuration you need. You could also provide a little tool to create a XML file from the DB-content -- creation of XML from a DB is a rather simple task.
