Correlation of particle patterns, mutual density and basic statistics

I am a postgrad student, who managed not to see any statistics in his Maths and Physics undergrad degree (am I the only one surprised by this ?). Anyway, I wanted to ask if someone could explain the underlying edit:(algebra) of how one goes from eq.2.62 to 2.63 and 2.64 in the attached images ? I just don't see how/why "|u" part is sometimes included, and sometimes not (not sure how the hell the algebra works here). I assume the notation "|u" is supposed to mean a conditional average. i.e. the ensemble average of those two values at a certain u... When I try to do the "straightforward mathematical manipulation" I can cancel out some of the terms with some nasty assumptions about statistical algebra, but I end up with: (nV) (nV_{m}) - (nV) (n \delta V) + (nV) (n \delta V |u) instead of 2.64... (Where brackets are meant to represent triangular brackets (doesn't let me use them for some reason). I assume 2.65 is just some kind of definition I am yet to find in "crash course in stats" type of lecture notes.
