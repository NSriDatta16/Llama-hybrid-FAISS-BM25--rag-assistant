Facebook's contribution in the matter is called ' Scribe '. Excerpt: Scribe is a server for aggregating streaming log data. It is designed to scale to a very large number of nodes and be robust to network and node failures. There is a scribe server running on every node in the system, configured to aggregate messages and send them to a central scribe server (or servers) in larger groups. ... Scribe is implemented as a thrift service using the non-blocking C++ server. The installation at facebook runs on thousands of machines and reliably delivers tens of billions of messages a day. The API is Thrift-based, so you have a good platform coverage, but in case you're looking for simple integration for Java you may want to have a look at Digg's log4j appender for Scribe .
