.Net Designer assemblies, C++\C# error

I'm working on an designer-heavy application (using Visual C++ 2.0, but a C# solution should still be relevant). My setup is this: I have a UserControl named "Host" I'm attempting a UserControl named "Child" Child contains a property to a class whose type is defined in a different dll entirely, named "mytools.dll" Child works just fine in the designer. However, when I go to drag "child" onto "host" from the designer, I get the following error: Failed to create component 'Child'. The error message follows: 'System.io.filenotfoundexception: could not load file or assembly MyTools, Version XXXXXX, Culture=neutral ..... {unhelpful callstack} If I comment out the property in "child" that points to the class in mytools.dll, everything designs just peachy. I have the property marked with "Browsable(false), and DesignerSerializable(hidden), and it does not help. Is there a way for me to explicitly say "Don't load this dll, you won't need it in design time", or some way for me to force a dll to load from the designer programmatically? Thanks!
