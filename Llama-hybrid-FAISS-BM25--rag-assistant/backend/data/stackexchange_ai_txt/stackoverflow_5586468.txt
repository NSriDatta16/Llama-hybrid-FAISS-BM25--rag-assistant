Well, there's an ugly hack way to do it and the elegant way to do it. Actually, there are probably several hacks. Let's look at one of the most common: In the notebook's page changing event, you can tell the output panel to do something like this: inputPanelRef.dirFile.GetValue() and then update the comboboxe's entries as needed. You'll probably need to do that from the Notebook widget. The way I prefer to pass info between panels is to use Pubsub. There's a good example here: http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2010/06/27/wxpython-and-pubsub-a-simple-tutorial/
