Try measure occurences of each letter in text. For English and German texts are calculated the frequencies and, maybe, the distributions of them. Having obtained these data, you may reason what language the distribution of frequencies for your text belongs. You should use Bayesian inference to determine the closest language (with a certain error probability) or, maybe, there are other statistical methods for such tasks.
