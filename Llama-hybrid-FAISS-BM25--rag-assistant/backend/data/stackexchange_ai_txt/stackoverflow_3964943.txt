Negating Alternation In Regular Expressions

I can use "Alternation" in a regular expression to match any occurance of "cat" or "dog" thusly: (cat|dog) Is it possible to NEGATE this alternation, and match anything that is NOT "cat" or "dog"? If so, how? For Example: Let's say I'm trying to match END OF SENTENCE in English, in an approximate way. To Wit: (\.)(\s+[A-Z][^.]|\s*?$) With the following paragraph: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Once upon a time Dr. Sanches, Mr. Parsons and Gov. Mason went to the store. Hello World. I incorrectly find "end of sentence" at Dr., Mr., and Gov. (I'm testing using http://regexpal.com/ in case you want to see what I'm seeing with the above example) Since this is incorrect, I would like to say something like: !(Dr\.|Mr\.|Gov\.)(\.)(\s+[A-Z][^.]|\s*?$) Of course, this isn't working, which is why I seek help. I also tried !/(Dr.|Mr.|Gov.)/, and !~ which were no help whatsoever. How can I avoid matches for "Dr.", "Mr." and "Gov.", etc? Thanks in advance.
