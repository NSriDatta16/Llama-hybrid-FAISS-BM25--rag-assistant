I've created a very lightweight plugin that uses limit(per_page).offset(page*per_page) to implement pagination under Rails 3. Therefore, it provides lazy loading, which is great for fragment caching. Interface is just the same as will_paginate (@posts.recent.paginate :page=>params[:page]). There are not too many view helpers yet, but I'm sure you will find it useful: http://github.com/josei/simple_paginate
