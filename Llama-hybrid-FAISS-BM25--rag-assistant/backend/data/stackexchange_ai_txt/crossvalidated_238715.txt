How to calculate $max_{\alpha}Q(S',a')$ in q learning?

This is the pseudo code I am using for my reinforcement learning programme. and consider this is my reward and action-value matrix (these are sample matrices) R= Reward matrix with row (1:4) as state and column as action(1:4) [0,0,0,0] [0,0,0,1] [0,1,0,0] [0,1,0,0] Q= action-value matrix with row (1:4) as state and column as action(1:4) [2,0,3,0] [3,4,0,1] [7,6,8,0] [0,1,3,0] where first row(1) is the starting state and last row(4) is the terminal state if I take gamma as 0.9 and alpha as 0.1 then I can find action-value for Q(3,2) as $Q(3,2) \leftarrow Q(3,2)+0.1 \times [R(3,2)+0.9\times \max_{0.1}Q(s',a')-Q(3,2)] \\ \\ \hspace{1.8cm} \leftarrow 6 + 0.1 \times [1+0.9\times \max_{0.1}Q(s',a')-6]$ How should I find $max_{0.1}Q(s',a')$?
