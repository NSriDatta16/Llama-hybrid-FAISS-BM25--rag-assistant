You'll want to avoid using fragments (anything after the hash mark) to indicate major parts of your site's content since Google and other search engines will generally disregard them completely. However, most uses of URL fragments (like the example you posted) involve dynamically loading AJAX content onto the page; the web app modifies the fragment so that visitors can still use the back button or bookmark the page, but the app's state won't be lost. In your example, the fragment is probably used for a private section of the site that won't be indexed by search engines, so using fragments has no effect on SEO. Bottom line: for content you want indexed, don't use hash marks. If you want to speed up your UI with AJAX content in a private section of your site, then go right ahead.
