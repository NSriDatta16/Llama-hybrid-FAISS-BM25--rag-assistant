Interface Builder and Cocoa: wiring up behind an App Controller class

I have been following this tutorial. I'm having conceptual trouble at the point where an App Controller class is written, and then added and hooked up within Interface Builder. Adding the AppController Class The next task is to add an instance of the new class to the Interface Builder document and connect the class outlets. Create an instance of the AppController class. In the Interface Builder Library window, click Classes. Locate the AppController class. Drag this class into the document window to create an instance named App Controller. Connect the App Controller’s qcWindow outlet to the design window. Hold down the Control key. In the document window, drag from the App Controller to the Window object. Select the qcWindow outlet from the list that appears. Connect the App Controller’s qcView outlet to the QC view in the design window. Hold down the Control key. Drag from the App Controller to the QC view in the design window. Select the qcView outlet from the list that appears. Specifically, I don't understand how this App Controller is being used at run-time. All I did was hook up the window and view outlets within IB, and it magically works as if it was being initialized within the applicationDidFinishLaunching:aNotification method of my app delegate. My point is, I'm not using my App Controller class anywhere in my code, and all I've done in IB is hook up its outlets, so how does it work?
