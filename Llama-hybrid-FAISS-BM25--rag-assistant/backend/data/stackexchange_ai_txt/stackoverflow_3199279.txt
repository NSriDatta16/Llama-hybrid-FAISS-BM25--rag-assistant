Getting Entity Behind Selected Row From DataGridView with Linq To Sql

What is a graceful/proper way to retrieve the Linq entity behind the selected row of a DataGridView? I am populating my DataGridView like this in the form Load event: this.Database = new MyAppDataContext(); var userList = from c in this.Database.Users orderby c.LastName select c; this.gridUserList.DataSource = userList; Then, in the DoubleClick event of the form I am doing this: int userPK = Convert.ToInt32(this.gridUserList.CurrentRow.Cells["colUserPK"].Value); var user = (from c in this.Database.Users where c.UserPK == userPK select c).First() ; //Do something with user object It seems like there should be a more elegant way of getting the user row that was double-clicked on.
