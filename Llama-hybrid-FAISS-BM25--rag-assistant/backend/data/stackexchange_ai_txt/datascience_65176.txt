Couple of things: Cant replicate the problem exactly but if you follow these steps you are not exposing yourself TfidfVectorizer is CountVectorizer + TfidfTransformer , you are exposing yourself to unnecessary complexity and potential errors Use pipelines , cant stress this enough, its a compact way to pack all the sklearn transformers together AND THEN use fit, predict methods... I would advise you to follow something like that, or find similiar problem here
