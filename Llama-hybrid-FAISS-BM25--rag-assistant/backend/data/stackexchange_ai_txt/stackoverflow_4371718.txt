-Werror causes compiler to stop on #warning. What can I do to prevent this?

First off, I want it to stop on warnings. But I also want to print out some informative messages (like "Come back and implement this!"). Unfortunately, my compiler doesn't support #info , #message , #pragma message() , etc. I know there's -Wno-error= , but my google-foo is weak, and I can't seem to find out the for #warning . I've tried -Wno-error=warning , and that just says "there's no -Wwarning ". Same with " warn ". Any suggestions? For what its worth, I'm using the Tensilica Xtensa compiler, xt-xcc, which appears to be a GNU derivative, or at least uses the GNU front end. It's version 8.0.0.
