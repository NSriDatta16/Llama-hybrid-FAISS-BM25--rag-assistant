Compacting a Python Application into a Single Source File

I have a strange situation where I need to upload a Python source file to a testing server for evaluation, but I want to keep my application organized into multiple files/modules/packages. Unfortunately, the testing server is out of my control, so I can't modify it to allow me to upload a ZIP file containing my code. Is there any easy way to take a large number of Python source files encompassing an application and automatically reduce them to a single source file (or .pyc file)? For simplicity, only one file would be considered the "entry point" and have a if __name__ == '__main__' . The final file still needs to be executable by the Python interpreter, so I can't use a Python-to-EXE generator.
