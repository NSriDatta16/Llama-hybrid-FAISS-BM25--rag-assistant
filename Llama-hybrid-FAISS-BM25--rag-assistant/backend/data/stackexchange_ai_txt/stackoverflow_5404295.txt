I think you have to select this attribute too in your collection like this before the collection is actually loaded: $productCollection->addAttributeToSelect('hero_banner'); It works fine on my code, but I dont know if you already have rewrited the block where your collection is defined (it won't work in your template since the collection is already loaded there) Maybe you can configure your hero_attribute to add this addAttributeToSelect directly in Magento back office, I'll have a look Edit: Ok, I think I've got it, you won't have to worry about collection & rewrites :) If you use this attribute on product listing, you have to set the property "visible on product listing" to true to your image attribute (in the admin panel attribute management) Good luck
