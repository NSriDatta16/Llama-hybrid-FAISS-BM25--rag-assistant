Firstly, I don't think you really need a Bayesian approach here: you have lots of data and very little prior information. On the other hand, if you'd like to there's no harm, either, as long as your priors are sufficiently weakly informative (or informed by some reasonable prior information). Secondly, the simplest thing to do is to log-transform the data. Clearly, run-time cannot be negative. Secondly, this might very well make a t-distribution be a pretty good approximation. As others have suggested a gamma distribution, Weibull distribution, exponential distribution or some other positive distribution may be sufficient. Of course, you could also use non-parametric methods (that tends to be non-Bayesian), but since you don't seem to have any covariates etc., just a Wilcoxon test may be fine (and it comes with the Hodges-Lehmann estimate). Finally, the results look so clear (if this is the real data), that you don't even need much statistics to tell one is better than the other. Or am I missing something?
