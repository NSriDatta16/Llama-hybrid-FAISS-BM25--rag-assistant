I would absolutely not run a JNI-based tool in a Java EE app server. Your suggestion for using JMS is a good one. You could create a service around message based Beans to respond to messages dispatched by your external service: http://oreilly.com/catalog/entjbeans3/chapter/ch13.html Here is the link to the Oracle Java EE documentation on Message-driven beans: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbpk.html I would suggest getting two JBoss servers to talk to one another over JMS is easier than writing a JCA adapter, and that JMS message-driven beans are a cleaner interface. JCA doesn't seem to be evolving at all - there doesn't seem to be any great implementation tutorials (that's just my perception).
