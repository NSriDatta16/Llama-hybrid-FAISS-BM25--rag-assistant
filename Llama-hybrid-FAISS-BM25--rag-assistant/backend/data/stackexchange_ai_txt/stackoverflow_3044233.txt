WPF menus with shortcuts and custom RoutedCommand

Im new to WPF so i might be missing something. I have a simple function in my MainWindow class called StartService. I wanted to add a menu item "Start Service" with a shortcut Ctrl+S to my application. I had to do the following: In my MainWindow class i had to define: public static RoutedCommand StartServiceRoutedCmd = new RoutedCommand(); In my XAML code i added: Things are working. I'm wondering if this is the correct and organized way to go? I am gonna need a shortcut for my StopService function. Does this mean i will need to define a new RoutedCommand StopServiceRoutedCmd, and so on for every shortcut i need?
