Applicability of Bayes factor to Contingency tables (Chi-Squared)

is it possible to apply the Bayes factor to tests of/for independence/homogeneity (Chi-Square)? You can find a file below. The contingency table shows the data (nominal) found for 9 variants in two groups; the problem with usual frequentist statistics here is that I would probably need to adjust the p-value (Bonferroni) if I checked for each variable independently; and as I have to make several of these tests, I think Bayesian methods seem more adequate. Can you help me out with this issue in any way? How will I need to approach this matter? http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/view/contingencytab7mwcaof5li.jpg
