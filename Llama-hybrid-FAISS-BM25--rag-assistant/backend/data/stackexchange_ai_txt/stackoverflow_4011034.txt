You definitely have to implement thread-safe access either via lock or via e.g. ReaderWriterLockSlim . Variable itself (List<>) is thread-safe if you not modifies it after first allocation (via new) but element access have to be thread-safe (since you say you adding/removing elements from list hence changing its state) BTW, if threads modifies its own items why you want to share them? So what you have implemented? Why you organize this way? Maybe there are better advise if you show details.
