Mysql joining tables question

I have a tables rooms, apartments and hotel. Now its easy for me to get all free rooms, name of hotel address or same thing for apartments by using separate queries ex : Get all free rooms : SELECT hotel.name, count(*) AS num_of_free_rooms FROM hotel, rooms WHERE rooms.occupied !=0 AND hotel.hotel_id = rooms.room_hotel GROUP BY hotel.hotel_id Get all free apartments : SELECT hotel.name, count(*) AS num_of_free_ap FROM hotel, apartments WHERE apartments.occupied_ap !=0 AND hotel.hotel_id = apartments.apartment_hotel GROUP BY hotel.hotel_id How could I get results like this : Name of a hotel | Number of free rooms other than 0 | Number of apartments 0 or any other Should I organize my data differently, like adding in the table rooms field type 1 for rooms, 2 for apartments or do it with separate tables. I'm open to any suggestions in order to get results that I need.
