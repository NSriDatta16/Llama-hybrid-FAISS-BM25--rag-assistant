Any reliable way to stop Internet Explorer (v7, 8) to stop caching PDF files?

An application I work on generates PDF documents and renders them in a browser window. Some of the data in the documents can be considered sensitive so we're exploring how to prevent the browser from caching the document contents. We're using the following Java code which prevents caching in Firefox but doesn't work in IE 8: response.setHeader("Expires", "0"); response.setHeader("Pragma", "private"); response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "max-age=0, no-store"); response.setHeader("Content-disposition", "inline; filename= \"" + filename + "\""); response.setContentLength(fbytes.length); I'm wondering if anyone has had any luck manipulating headers to prevent IE from caching? Thanks in advance.
