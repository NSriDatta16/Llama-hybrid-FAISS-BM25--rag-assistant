Modeling a gamma-mixture waiting model in BUGS

I'm analyzing a noisy time series where where the inter-event interval is known to follow a two-gamma mixture distribution. If there was a simple model that would generate that kind of thing, it would be pretty simple to implement into BUGS. But otherwise, I can't think of anything that wouldn't be prohibitively kludgey. Can anyone think of a model that induces mixture-gamma waiting times?
