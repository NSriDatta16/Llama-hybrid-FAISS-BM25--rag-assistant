Firstly, be aware that the outputs of a normal neural network have nothing to do with the confidence of the predictions . If the output of the softmax layer is nearly 1 for some class, that does not automatically mean that the network is almost certain of the prediction. Softmax only normalizes outputs so they sum up to 1, but it does not provide any confidence about that prediction. That said, I think you simply did a good job training the model for the task. Since you have not given any details about the dataset, I guess it might simply be that the task is relatively easy. A well regularized model should perform comparably good on training and testing data, and 0.9 dropout rate is very strong regularization. If you are suspicious, try inspecting the data. Make sure the vector representation of validation set sentences is not the same as the sentences in the training data.
