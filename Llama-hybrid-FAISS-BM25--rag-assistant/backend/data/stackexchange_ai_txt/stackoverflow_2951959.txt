I needed to do the same thing by exposing some timing variables from my code to the settings bundle so that non-developers could play around with them. As far as I know, there is no way to do this using a slider. I did, however find a good workaround: Use a multi value control instead and give it a list of strings and values. For example, to implement picking a time using a multi value control, I would use combinations of titles and values like: 30 seconds = 30, 1 minute = 60, 5 minutes = 300, etc. It turns out that this is a more elegant design than using a slider control anyway for picking a range of numeric values. For example, you can combine the above multi value control into an existing settings group (unlike sliders, where you need to label sliders by making a separate group for each slider).
