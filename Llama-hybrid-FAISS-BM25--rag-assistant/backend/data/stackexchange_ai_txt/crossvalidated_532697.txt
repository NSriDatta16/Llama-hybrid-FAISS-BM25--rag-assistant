How to perform PCA analysis on space-time data for few species in R?

The data-set I'm looking to analyze has 6 sites. Each site was sampled at five unique locations each month for a year. We could identify abundance of 4 species across the data set. Together, I have 360 points in space-time of 4 species. I also have few environmental variables. My data-set looks something like this. Month Site Plot Temp Humidity pH SP1 SP2 SP3 SP4 Jan 1 1 15 20 4 1 2 3 4 Jan 1 2 15 21 4 2 3 4 5 .. Dec 6 5 2 3 5 0 0 0 1 I want to do a PCA analysis to identify how species partition their environment. But I don't know if these are too few species to do such an analysis. Also, most PCA analysis I see are done in space, but not space and time. How do I incorporate both space and time? Do I simply treat the sites at different points as different spatial points? I would appreciate any help and guidance as I am quite new to this.
