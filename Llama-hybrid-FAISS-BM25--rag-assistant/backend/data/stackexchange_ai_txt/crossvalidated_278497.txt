Can we use Markov Chain for forecasting a time series?

I have a dataset which contains information about monthly visitors go to a particular website from Google News. Basically there are two columns - one is Month and another is Unique Visitors. There are 30 observations in the dataset. Can I apply Markov Chain to the data in any manner? Will it give any good result?
