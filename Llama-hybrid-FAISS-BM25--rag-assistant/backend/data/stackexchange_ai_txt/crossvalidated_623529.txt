Predict on continuous variable for Logistic Regression model in which feature was trained as a binary variable?

Let's say I have a binary logistic regression model trained on several binary categorical variables (i.e. the model is only trained on 0s and 1s for these variables). For example, Feature A can only be 1 (yes) or 0 (no). Now, when I use the model for prediction, let's say I know that in a particular case for Feature A there is a 70% chance that it is "yes" and a 30% chance that it is "no". Can I then have the model predict on 0.7 for Feature A? I think this works given that LogReg doesn't actually know the difference between continuous and binary variables. It would just apply 70% of the coefficient associated with that feature. In theory it would be the same as taking the weighted 70/30 average of the output predictions.
