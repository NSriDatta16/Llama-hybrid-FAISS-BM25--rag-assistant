Mysterious horizontal lines on my site when rendered on iPad

The following site: http://staging.jungledragon.com Has a few rendering issues on the iPad using Safari, so I'm trying to fix them. There is one issue where I am stuck though. If you have an iPad, open the site in portrait mode. There are two unwanted horizontal lines appearing, a top one that crosses the tabs (Popular, Fresh, etc) and a bottom one that sits right above the lizard illustration. Both lines should not be there. These lines do not appear on any other browser tested, including Safari on Windows. When you move that same site into landscape mode on the iPad, the top horizontal line dissapears, whilst the bottom one stays. If you zoom in a bit to the bottom line, it then dissapears too. I've been trying out various CSS fixes to no avail and am now beginning to think this is a rendering issue of Safari, although possibly triggered by me. Any help is greatly appreciated. It seems like a minor issue but I hate sloppiness.
