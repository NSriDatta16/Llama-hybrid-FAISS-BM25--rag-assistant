I have had some good experiences with Cobertura (free) and Clover (not free). I know they are both primarily coverage tools but if I remember correctly they both have cyclomatic complexity and other useful stuff. Edit: Found a nice list of open source tools for these purposes: http://java-source.net/open-source/code-coverage
