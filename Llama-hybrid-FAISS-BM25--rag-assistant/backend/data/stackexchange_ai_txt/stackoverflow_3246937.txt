Error during loading of SSIS package

I'm trying to execute a SSIS package on a SQL Server 2008R2. The script retrieve data on a remote server and copy them to its local database. This job is scheduled every hour, the SQL Agent use a proxy to authenticate itself to the remote machine. Authentication seems to be ok but I get an error during loading of the SSIS package. This is what I get: Could not load package because of error 0xC001404A. Description: While trying to find a folder on SQL an OLE DB error was encountered with error code 0x80040E09 (The EXECUTE permission was denied on the object 'sp_ssis_getfolder', database 'msdb', schema 'dbo'.). When I add the role of sysadmin to this user, the script works well. I don't know which kind of right I have to add to user on database 'mdb' to avoid this error. Anybody could help me, please ? Thanks in advance
