A couple of points: Lets start with a general definition of the linear mixed model, namely, let $y_i$ be the outcome for the $i$ -th subject ( $i = 1, \ldots, n$ ), $X_i$ the design matrix for the fixed effects $\beta$ , and $Z_i$ the design matrix for the random effects $b_i$ , then we have: $$\left\{ \begin{array}{l} y_i = X_i \beta + Z_i b_i + \varepsilon_i,\\\\ b_i \sim \mathcal N(0, D), \quad \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2 \mbox{I}), \end{array} \right.$$ where $\varepsilon_i$ are the error terms. When you fit this model you get estimates for the fixed effects $\hat \beta$ . You can also get estimates of the random effects $\hat b_i$ which are defined as the modes of the conditional distribution: $$ p(b_i \mid y_i; \hat \theta) = \frac{p(y_i \mid b_i; \hat \theta) \, p(b_i; \hat \theta)}{p(y_i; \hat \theta)},$$ where $\theta = (\beta, \mbox{vech}(D), \sigma^2)$ denotes all model parameters. From this model you can get two types of predictions, namely population predictions defined as $$\hat y_i^{pop} = X_i \hat \beta,$$ and subject-specific predictions, defined as $$\hat y_i^{subj} = X_i \hat \beta + Z_i \hat b_i.$$ Say now that you want to calculate prediction for a new subject $j$ . If you have no outcome data for this subject, then the only prediction you can do is the population prediciton, namely $$\hat y_j^{pop} = X_j \hat \beta,$$ which will be the average for his group. If however you also have some data $y_j^{new}$ for this subject, then you could estimate his random effect $\hat b_j$ as the mode of $[b_j \mid y_j^{new}; \hat \theta]$ , and then use this into the above equation of the subject-specific prediction, i.e., $$\hat y_j^{subj} = X_j \hat \beta + Z_j \hat b_j.$$ You can find additional information regarding this in Chapter 3, Section 3.4 of my Repeated Measurements course notes .
