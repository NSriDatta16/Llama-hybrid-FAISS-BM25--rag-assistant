Let $X_1, \dots, X_B$ be the corresponding random variables, and let $$\bar{X}_B = \dfrac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}X_i$$ be their average. Then $$\text{Var}(\bar{X}_B) = \dfrac{1}{B^2}\text{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{B}X_i\right) = \dfrac{1}{B^2}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{B}\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)$$ Suppose, in the above summation, that $i = j$. Then $\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \sigma^2$. Exactly $B$ of these occur. Suppose, in the above summation, that $i \neq j$. Then $\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \rho\sigma^2$ since the variances are identical. There are $B^2 - B = B(B-1)$ of these occurrences. (Notice that there are $B * B = B^2$ total terms in the summmation, so $B^2 - B$ is the number of terms that aren't equal to $\sigma^2$, as above.) Hence, $$\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{B}\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = B\sigma^2+B(B-1)\rho\sigma^2$$ from which we obtain $$\text{Var}(\bar{X}_B) = \dfrac{1}{B^2}\left(B\sigma^2+B(B-1)\rho\sigma^2\right) = \dfrac{\sigma^2}{B}+\dfrac{B-1}{B}\rho\sigma^2 = \dfrac{\sigma^2}{B}+\rho\sigma^2-\dfrac{1}{B}\rho\sigma^2$$ or $$\rho\sigma^2 +\dfrac{\sigma^2}{B}(1-\rho)$$ as desired.
