Is it possible to conduct a logistic regression with a metric dependent variable?

I have a dependent variable that is a percentage. I initially wanted to do a linear regression, but then realized that the outcome is not bounded between 0 and 1. My teacher suggested to transform my metric dependent variable into a dichotomous variable in order to do a logistic regression. But I can't find any instructions on how to do such a transformation. So my question is: Is it possible to transform a dependent variable that is a proportion into a 0/1 variable, and how would you do that?
