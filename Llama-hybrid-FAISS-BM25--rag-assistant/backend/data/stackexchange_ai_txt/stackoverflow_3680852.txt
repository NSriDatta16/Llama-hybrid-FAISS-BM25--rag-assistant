Javascript - How do I declare a variable with the variable name based on a string?

var cur_storage_unit = $('#storage_unit').val(); $('.size_unit').change(function() { var id = $(this).attr('id'); //This is how I want it to work, but not sure how 'cur_' + id = $(this).val(); }); The user 'changes' a of class 'size_unit' and id of 'storage_unit'. I want to then set the value of 'cur_storage_unit' to the new value of 'storage_unit'. In italics is how I want it to work, but I'm not sure the syntax of how to get it to work. Thanks!
