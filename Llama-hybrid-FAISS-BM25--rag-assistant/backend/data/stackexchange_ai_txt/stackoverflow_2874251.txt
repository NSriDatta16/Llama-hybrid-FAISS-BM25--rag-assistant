If you can afford to write the specs in Confluence, then I think using cross-links between Jira and Confluence is the best way. There are several plugins that implement such links (eg Application Links). Since the Confluence page must be unique within the space, the hierarchical naming that you show above would be appropriate. Confluence is a good tool for collaborative development of documents, but it takes a lot of discipline, organization and effort to keep things organized. Alternatively, you can use the Labels jira plugin to tag issues with strings such as "myapp-approvalLogic-mainScreen". This lets you quickly find all related issues, but not to navigate to the spec Neither of the approaches above provides a hierarchy though. Jira+Agile (aka Greenhopper) provides a hierarchy of Versions which is very useful for agile planning. But typically one version (release) works on features from many requirements, so you probably cannot use this hierarchy Jira components are not hierarchical, and issues are at only 2 levels (a problem that's been discussed for 4 years...)
