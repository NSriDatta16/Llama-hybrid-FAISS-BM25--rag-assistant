What is your build environment? If its Visual Studio 2005 or 2008, then all the other manifest advice does not apply as VS8 and up are already including manifest information. In which case the easiest way to add a manifest dependency is to make use of a simple (microsoft specific) compiler directive that you add to some cpp or header file: #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' "\ "name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' "\ "version='6.0.0.0' "\ "processorArchitecture='x86' "\ "publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' "\ "language='*' "\ "\"") Including the manifest this way avoids messing up the c-runtime manifest dependencies or messing up the settings needed for UAC to work correctly.
