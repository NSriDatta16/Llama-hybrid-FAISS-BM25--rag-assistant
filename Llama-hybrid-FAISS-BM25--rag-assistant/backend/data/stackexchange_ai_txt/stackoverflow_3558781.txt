I don't like using services just to wrap database lookups, you end up with all of the business logic in your controller. I would organize my services so there would be one per type of user. So if I had customers and data-entry people and admins, I would make a customerService and a dataEntryService and an adminService. Each service would expose the methods that that kind of customer needs. No business logic should be in a controller, it is strictly concerned with getting inputs from the url and request and the session, calling a method on some service (passing in those inputs), then taking the result of the service call and putting that where the page can display it.
