It depends on your webserver. There are newer webservers being developed that understand AJAX/Comet style and make long-polling very efficient. See Mongrel2 for an example. You might also consider regular polling, but making it dynamic. Not knowing your domain, I can't make a specific recommendation. But imagine in a chat application. Instead of polling every second, I might wait a little after a chat message is sent to give the other person time. Then check a little more frequently for a while, and if I still get nothing, slow down (as the other person might be gone). I might have poll intervals from 1 second to 30 seconds depending on the situation. It would all need to be tested for feel, but on average, I might be able to make it feel like 1 second polling, when on average it's more like 20.
