Table Cell Drop down menu anchored to the right of cell

I have a basic table with a div contained in it that I bring out of the cell "position: absolute" and it comes up nicely below the table cell starting at the left of the cell and flowing to the right. I want to be able to do this backwards with the last cell (that is have the submenu table anchor itself to the right of the cell(or essentially the table) I've got this working in FireFox, (bit mess) but it doesn't work in IE. The Html is as follows Parent Cell 1 supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Parent Cell 2 Parent Cell 3 Parent Cell 4 Parent Cell 5 supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Does anyone know how I could get the the rightmost submenu item (in a sense) to drop down to the same level as the left one. As I said this (simplified version) works in FireFox, just not in IE and I need it to work in both... :S I also don't know if the rightmost cell is structured in the most appropriate way or whether there is a better way! Thanks
