Writing a script to bypass college login page

My college has a silly login page that requires you to download a whole bunch of garbage that a lot of us don't need (Norton Anti-virus, Antispyware software, etc.). We have to have them running to get on the internet on campus. Though, if you are on Linux, or at least set your user-agent to linux, the requirements are gone. We could easily use Firefox with the useragent switcher to bypass this, but it'd be nice to create a script that automates this. How would this be possible? I figure this could be written in python, and could grab the webpage with curl specifying a user agent? How would I go about posting the data back to the servers? Thanks
