Catching a Email Loop from a out of office agent

Our Current email2fax gateway does not handle bounced emails very well. When a email is sent to the gateway the content is faxed out and a notification is sent to the original sender of the message. Problems happen when the original user turns on a out of office agent and messages will bounces between the 2 email gateways. I have tried to set in the outbound notification the following headers From Reply-To But as this is a proprietary gateway it does not allow me to set a custom Return-PATH some silly mail servers send replies back to that. Are there any extra email headers that maybe I could set to say "Do not send a Notification back" If not is there a email gateway that would be able to act like a proxy and sit in front of the gateway that would then allow me to programmable check the messages as they came in and drop out of office messages.
