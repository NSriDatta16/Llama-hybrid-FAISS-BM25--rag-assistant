How to initialize a two-dimensional array in Python?

I'm beginning python and I'm trying to use a two-dimensional list, that I initially fill up with the same variable in every place. I came up with this: def initialize_twodlist(foo): twod_list = [] new = [] for i in range (0, 10): for j in range (0, 10): new.append(foo) twod_list.append(new) new = [] It gives the desired result, but feels like a workaround. Is there an easier/shorter/more elegant way to do this?
