ExpressJS & Mongoose Schema embedding with DBRef examples

I'd love to collect/see any code examples or links to such using ExpressJS & Mongoose that show Schema embedding, saving/updating with DBRefs. Simple usecase: Comments on a Blog Post with DBRefs to Users in the Blog Post and Each Comment, showing saving/updating, and maybe as an extra treat: getters, setters, and a virtual or 2 tallying total comments or something
