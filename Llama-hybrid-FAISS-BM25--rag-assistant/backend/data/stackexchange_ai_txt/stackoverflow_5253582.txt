How can I structure a jQuery plugin that relies on other plugins, without forcing the user to link each one?

I'm creating a jQuery plugin that leverages several smaller plugins. I do not want to force the user to have a separate script tag for each plugin. I could just throw them all in the same file, but it seems like there should be a better way. The only idea I can come up with is to keep each plugin separate, but in a common folder. Within the main plugin, I would do something like the following: if(!$.isFunction(pluginName){ //load the plugin from common folder } Is there anything inherently wrong with this approach? Does anyone know of a better way?
