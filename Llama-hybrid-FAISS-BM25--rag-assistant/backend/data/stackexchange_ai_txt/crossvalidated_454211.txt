Creating a prediction model with non-normal residuals on purpose

I am trying to build a model with non-normal residuals as it is supposed to overestimate rather than underestimate while being as accurate as it can be. So far I have not experienced a scenario where normality of residuals needs to be violated on purpose and a bit stuck. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could point out what to look for and possible angles to approach the scenario I've described above. (edited) I do not have enough data to form a NN based model, so I am looking for a traditional statistical and machine learning model that incorporates non-normal residuals or customizable loss functions in training. Thank you!
