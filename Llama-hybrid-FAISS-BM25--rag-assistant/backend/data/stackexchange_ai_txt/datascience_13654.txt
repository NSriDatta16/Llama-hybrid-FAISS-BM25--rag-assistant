deep learning - how to train silhouette image?

I want to train silhouette images to figure out the original image I'm planning to use Tensorflow. Once I've thought about using Automatic colorization, but I have no idea if it works well since what it only has is just an outline of the image. Is there any way to achieve this? thanks
