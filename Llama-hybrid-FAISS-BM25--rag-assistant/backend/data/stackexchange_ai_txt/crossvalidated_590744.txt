This could also be seen from Bayesian perspective and goodness of fit. We might interpret "model fitted to data" as in finding out probability of parameters fits the given data well i.e, $p(\theta|X)$ a posterior and "data fitted to a model" as in finding out probability of observing the data given the model i.e., $p(X|\theta)$ likelihood.
