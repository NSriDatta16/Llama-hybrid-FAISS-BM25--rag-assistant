Why is SQLite fit for template cache?

The benefits of using SQLite storage for the template cache are faster read and write operations when the number of cache elements is important. I've never used it yet,but how can using SQLite by faster than plain file system? IMO the overhead(initiating a connection) will make it slower. BTW,can someone provide a demo how to use SQLite?
