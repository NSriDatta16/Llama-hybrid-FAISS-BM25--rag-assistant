JS: find width of all the images and sum them then apply this sum to the element

I have a aragraph which contains several images. The quantity of these images is not fixed, they're dynamically added via CMS. All the images have the same height but different width. I need to provide width="...px" to this to use it with jScrollPane. I can NOT add "width" parameter to the img tag. What I need is to calculate width for eachimages inside this , summarize and then use this sum as a width. So I neeed to calculate width for image01.jpg, image02.jpg and image03.jpg and then apply the sum of these widths to the style="width: px". I would appreciate any help with this matter. Thanks a lot!
