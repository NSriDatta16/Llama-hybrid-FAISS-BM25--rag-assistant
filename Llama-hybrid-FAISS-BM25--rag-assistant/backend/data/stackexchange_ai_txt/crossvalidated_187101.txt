I'm not sure the "importance" is that useful when model averaging. What if your co-variates occur in few models, but those models were the best ones? Why don't you look at the AIC scores of the models - you could calculate Akaike weights based on these scores. Multiply the coefficients for each co-variate by the Akaike weight, and then sum those products to give a model-averaged coefficient for each co-variate. You could then keep all of them in your model, or calculate confidence intervals to see if each of them is significant or not (i.e. do the confidence intervals cross zero).
