How to get element by ID in php DOMDocument class?

I am trying to parse a HTML file using DOMDocument class in PHP. The sample HTML file is and I loaded it using $document = new DOMDocument(); $document->loadHtmlFile("page.html"); Now I try to get the p element by id this way print_r($document->getElementById("myparagraph")); This doesn't work for some reason. So what's wrong with this ?
