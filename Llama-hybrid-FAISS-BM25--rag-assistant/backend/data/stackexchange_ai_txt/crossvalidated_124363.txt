Non-decaying eigenvalues in Kernel PCA with small kernel width

I noticed that when I use a small width kernel (RBF) with PCA, I get my desired result (clustering in this case), but I do not get decay in the eigenvalues (they stay about the same value). Is that a 'problem'? should I have used a larger kernel width? because when I do, I do get decay in the eigenvalues but I don't get the proper clustering anymore. I would appreciate any answer that can shed some light on the subject. Attached are two examples for widths of the RBF with clustering results (left), and the eigenvalues (on the right).
