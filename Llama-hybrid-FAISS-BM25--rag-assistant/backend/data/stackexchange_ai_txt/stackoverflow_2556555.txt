How do I check to see if my subview is being touched?

I've been attempting to expand on a tutorial by trying to make Ryu animate only when he is touched. However, the touch is not even being registered and I believe it has something to do with it being a subview. Here is my code: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if([touch view] == ryuView){ NSLog(@"Touch"); } else { NSLog(@"No touch"); } } -(void) ryuAnims{ NSArray *imageArray = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects: [UIImage imageNamed:@"1.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"2.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"3.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"4.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"5.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"6.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"7.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"8.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"9.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"10.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"11.png"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"12.png"], nil]; ryuView.animationImages = imageArray; ryuView.animationDuration = 1.1; [ryuView startAnimating]; } -(void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; UIImageView *image = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame: CGRectMake(100, 125, 150, 130)]; ryuView = image; ryuView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"1.png"]; ryuView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeBottomLeft; [self.view addSubview:ryuView]; [image release]; } This code compiles fine, however, when touching or clicking on ryu, nothing happens. I've also tried if([touch view] == ryuView.image) but that gives me this error: "Comparison of distinct Objective-C type 'struct UIImage *' and 'struct UIView *' lacks a cast." What am I doing wrong?
