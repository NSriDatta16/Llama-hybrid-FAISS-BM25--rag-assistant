Machine learning is a very vast field and everybody will have a different answer to your question. Here is mine: In machine learning, the word "learning" refers to the process of iteratively improving your model by gradient descent (e.g. neural networks), or another algorithm (EM algorithm, K-Mean clustering). For example , let's say you want to recognize images of dog/cat. During your gradient descent, you will tune your model coefficients to decrease your loss which should lead to a better image classifications. In other words, you learn to differentiate dogs from cat.
