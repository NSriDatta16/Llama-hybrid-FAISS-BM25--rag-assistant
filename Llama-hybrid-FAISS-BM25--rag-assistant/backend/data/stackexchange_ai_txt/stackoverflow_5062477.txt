Font properties are set on the Font object in the GUI object that you are using ( JLabel , etc), not on the String itself. EDIT: If you want to add formatting to your console, you will have to embed the formatting within the String itself. In order to get my output to be bold, I needed to do the following: System.out.println((char)27 +"[1m testing bold"); The (char) 27 is an escape sequence, the [ is followed by a set of ; separated values for different formatting types (see below), followed by an m . You will need to play around with this. On my Mac, the command prompt continued in bold as I didnt reset to normal ( [0m ) before I exited. This info, by the way, was lifted from here . some attributes: 0 Normal (clear all) 1 bold 2 dim 4 underline 5 blink 7 reverse 8 blank 9 overstrike 22 normal intensity (cancel bold and blank) 24 underline off 25 blink off 27 reverse off 28 blank off 29 overstrike off 30 black 31 red 32 green 33 yellow 34 blue 35 magenta 36 cyan 37 white 40 black background 41 red background 42 green background
