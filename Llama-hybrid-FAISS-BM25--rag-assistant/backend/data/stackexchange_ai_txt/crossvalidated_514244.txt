Bayesian GLM/ANOVA in brms -- what is the "equivalent" to frequentist post-hoc? Does it matter?

I'm running a one-way Bayesian GLM (in brms in R) between three groups (Class), using a heteroskedasticity adjustment: brm(bf(Var ~ Class, sigma ~ 0 + Class), data = df) When I plot the condition effects it's very clear that there are group differences, but I'm not sure how to "test" this. When I look at the output, it's also clear that the CIs don't overlap. I almost feel like maybe I don't need a formal test because the CIs don't overlap, but not sure if that applies. I'm guessing this is really simple and I'm just a noob (true). Any recommendations conceptually or in terms of packages?
