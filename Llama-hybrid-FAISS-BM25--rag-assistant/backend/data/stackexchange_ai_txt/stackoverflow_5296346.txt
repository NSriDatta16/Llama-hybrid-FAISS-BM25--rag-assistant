UDP is a connectionless protocol. You don't need to connect an udp socket. Pay attention that use a connect on an UDP socket may have a different semantic respect what you are expecting: on linux for example a connect invoked on a UDP socket , "bind" that socket to a specific IP address, but this is only a local binding, nothing happens over the network.
