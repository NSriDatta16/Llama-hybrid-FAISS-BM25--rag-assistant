On a higher level, here is how to understand it. (If you need a more mathematical approach, I can gladly go after some of my notes on time series analysis) ACF and PACF are theoretical statistical constructs just like an expected value or variance, but on different domains. The same way that Expected values come up when studying random variables, ACF and PACF come up when studying time series. When studying random variables, there is the question of how to estimate their parameters, which is where the method of moments, MLE and other procedures and constructs come in, as well as inspecting the estimates, their standard errors and etc. Inspecting the estimated ACF and PACF come is from the same idea, estimating the parameters of a random time series process. Get the idea? If you think you need a more mathematically inclined answer, please let me know, and I'll try and see if I can craft something by the end of the day.
