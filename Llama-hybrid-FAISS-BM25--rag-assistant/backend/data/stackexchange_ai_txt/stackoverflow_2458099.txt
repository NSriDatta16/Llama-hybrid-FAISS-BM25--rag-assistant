Peek ahead when iterating an array in PHP

Is it possible to "peek ahead" while iterating an array in PHP 5.2? For example, I often use foreach to manipulate data from an array: foreach($array as $object) { // do something } But I often need to peek at the next element while going through the array. I know I could use a for loop and reference the next item by it's index ( $array[$i+1] ), but it wouldn't work for associative arrays. Is there any elegant solution for my problem, perhaps involving SPL?
