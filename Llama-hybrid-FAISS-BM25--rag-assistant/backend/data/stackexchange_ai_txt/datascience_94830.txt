How do deep learning model store the mean and standard deviation and how to run sampling?

GPT-3 can generate code But distribution learning is just learnt the repeated things and no ordering of code if sampling Is deep learning model a storage of mean and standard deviation? How can mean and standard deviation stored as the format of deep learning model? How can python model.predict do like sampling from distribution? Update How GPT-3 code generation make learning has ordering of code in reasonable way when using model.predict to output code? Is deep learning of GPT-3 no statistics meaning?
