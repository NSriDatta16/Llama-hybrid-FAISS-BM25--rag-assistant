Referencing the child of a commit in Git

If you want to move the HEAD to the parent of the current HEAD , that's easy: git reset --hard HEAD^ But is there any simple way to do the exact opposite of this operation, that is, set the head to the current head's first child commit? Right now, I use gitk as a workaround (alt-tab, up-arrow, alt-tab, middle-click), but I would like a more elegant solution, one that can also be used when gitk is not available.
