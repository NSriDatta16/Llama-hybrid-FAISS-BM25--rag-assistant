From what I know about JVMs, fragmentation should never be a problem you have to solve. If there's no more room for allocation - whether due to fragmentation or not - the garbage collector should run, and GCs also typically compress data to solve fragmentation issues. To emphasize - you only get "out of memory" errors after the GC was ran and still not enough memory could be freed. I would instead try to dig more into the options for the specific JVM you're running. For example, a "copying" garbage collector uses only half of the available memory at a time, so changing your VM to use something else could possibly free half of your memory. I'm not really suggesting your VM uses simple copying GC, I'm just suggesting probing this on the VM level.
