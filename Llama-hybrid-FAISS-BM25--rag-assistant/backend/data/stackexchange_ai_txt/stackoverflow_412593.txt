As others have already mentioned, if UserService is all that the clients of your application are going to see, I'd only test that for now and make UserRepository inaccessible to your clients (e.g. make it internal). This way you should get good code coverage even without testing the classes individually. If your code coverage is bad, this usually either means that your tests are insufficient or you have implemented stuff that cannot be invoked through the public interface and could therefore likely be removed.
