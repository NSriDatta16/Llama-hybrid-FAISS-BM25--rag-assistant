Edit : As @LarsH has noticed, I hadn't paid attention to the requirement that the replacement should be in bold. There are two easy ways to correct this: .1. In the transformation replace : with .2. Pass as the value of the pReplacement parameter not just "ABC" but ABC This XSLT 1.0 transformation : when applied on the provided XML document (corrected to be well-formed): This word should not be replaced: TEST . But this one should be replaced: test produces the wanted result : This word should not be replaced: TEST . But this one should be replaced: ABC Do note : This is a generic transformation that accepts as parameters the target and the replacement text. The replacement is case-incensitive , but we suppose that the target parameter is provided in lowercase. It is even much easier to solve this with XSLT 2.0 .
