Choosing between logistic regression and Mann Whitney/t-tests

I have a dichotomous variable $A$, which does not have an a priori determined proportion of 0's and 1's, and a continuous variable $b$. In scenario 1, I decide to designate $A$ as the independent variable $X$, and $b$ as the dependent variable $y$. I then test $X$ against $y$ using tests such as Mann Whitney (distribution-free), t-test (normal distribution), etc. In scenario 2, I decide to designate $A$ as the dependent variable $Y$, and $b$ as the independent variable $x$. I then test $x$ against $Y$ using logistic regression. Which model should I choose when I do not know the directionality of the relationship between $A$ and $b$, i.e. I can't decide whether $A$ is the independent variable or $b$ is the independent variable? If I'm unsure which are the dependent or independent variables, would it be invalid for me to use the t-test/Mann-Whitney in the first instance as a sort of univariate analysis, and then use logistic regression as a multivariate analysis?
