Is it a problem to use SQL server Express for small MVC project?

So I know most of the limitations to SQL Server express (2008 R2) such as DB size limit, CPU, SQL server agent...etc. I am working on a personal small Ecommerce ASP.NET MVC project that won't hit the DB size limit, and I don't think I would be hitting the CPU limit based on the amount of traffic the (current NON-MVC) site see's now. I originally started this project with using MySQL, but I am more comfortable with SQL than MySQL so I was thinking on move to it. However, I don't know if the lack of SQL server agent in the Express edition would be huge enough that I should consider staying with MySQL or not. The site is going to be hosted who has database backup abilities themselves. 1) Should I stick with MySQL? 2) Is there a way around the inability to start/use the SQL Server agent?
