Gauss' proof that "the best estimate for a random variable is the average"

I have read that "Gauss proved that the best estimate for a random variable is the average." Can someone provide Gauss' publication containing that proof? To be clear, I am not looking for you to perform a derivation, instead, I am simply looking for a citation. Thanks.
