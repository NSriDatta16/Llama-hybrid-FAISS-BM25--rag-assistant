Statistically Approximating Clicks From Limited Data

Assume a business started in January 2014. I have the following daily data (from June 2014 to December 2014): 1. Number of people who joined the website; 2. Number of people who left the website; 3. Number of clicks in total the website obtained from people (i.e. theres no way of obtaining clicks other than through people who joined the website at anytime). Assume I cannot obtain January - May 2014 data. Problem: The number of clicks in total the website obtained may be clicks from people who joined the website before June. What I want to approximate: How many clicks were made by the number of people who joined the website strictly between June - December 2014 so that I can make a better approximation of the total clicks/person. I think a statistical time series method to provide some sort of trend needs to be used but I'm not sure what method to research to solve the above problem. Can you help me please?
