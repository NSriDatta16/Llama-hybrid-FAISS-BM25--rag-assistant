OCP makes a lot of sense when you aren't the consumer of your code. If I'm writing a class, and I or my team am writing all of the classes which consume it, I agree. Refactoring as things change is no huge deal at all. If, on the other hand, I am writing an API for my customers, or I have multiple consumers in a large organization with varying interests, the OCP is critical because I can't refactor as easily. Also, if you just refactor your class to meet everyone's needs, you'll get a bloated class as a result. If you designed the class to allow consumers to extend your class rather than modify it, you wouldn't really have this problem.
