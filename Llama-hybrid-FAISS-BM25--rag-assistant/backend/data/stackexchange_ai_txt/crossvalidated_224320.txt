The Nelder book already mentioned is a good one. Just for more consideration I would recommend Elements of Statistical Learning Second Edition by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman. I Like ESL because it covers such a breadth of statistical and machine learning topics. It shows how GLMs fit in with other techniques (and it's free). And as seen in this question , I'd recommend the Simon Wood text Generalised Additive Models: an introduction with R . I really believe the Wood text is worth considering because, while it says it covers GAMs, it really covers LMs, GLMs, and GAMs in detail and introduces some mixed modeling techniques as well. Wood's approach is to introduce each topic with a theoretical background, but then the text is very practical and has examples already in an R package that can be downloaded to accompany the book.
