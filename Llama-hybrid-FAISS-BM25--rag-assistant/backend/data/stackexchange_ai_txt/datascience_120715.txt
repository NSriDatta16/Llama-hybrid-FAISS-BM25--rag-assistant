I want to forecast a NetCDF data

I have a chlorophyl-a and sea surface temp (SST) in a NetCDF format, the data is 4 dimensional mattrix, each data is saved inside certain longitude and lattitude value, if the data plotted into heatmap it looked like this [enter image description here] . and this is how the data look like I want to forecast all the time series in this data using LSTM, but there is 31 lattitaude and 19 longitude so there is a lot of data, so instead of making model for every point of longitude and lattiude I intent to use a sample. but how do I took sample of this data
