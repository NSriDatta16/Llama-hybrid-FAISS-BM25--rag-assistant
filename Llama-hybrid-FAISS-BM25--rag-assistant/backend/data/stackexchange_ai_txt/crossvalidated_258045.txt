Should I teach Bayesian or frequentist statistics first?

I am helping my boys, currently in high school, understanding statistics, and I am considering beginning with some simple examples without disregarding some glimpses to theory. My goal would be to give them the most intuitive yet instrumentally constructive approach to learn statistics from scratch, in order to stimulate their interest in further pursuing statistics and quantitative learning. Before beginning, though, I have a particular question with very general implications: Should we begin teaching statistics using a Bayesian or frequentist framework? Researching around I have seen that a common approach is beginning with a brief introduction on frequentist statistics followed by an in depth discussion of Bayesian statistics (e.g. Stangl ).
