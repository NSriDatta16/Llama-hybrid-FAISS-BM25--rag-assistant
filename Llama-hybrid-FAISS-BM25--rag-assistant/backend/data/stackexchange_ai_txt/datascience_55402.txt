How many parameters in a Conv2d Layer?

I was following andrew-ng coursera course on deep learning and there's a question that has been asked there which I couldn't figure out the answer for? Suppose your input is a 300 by 300 color (RGB) image, and you use a convolutional layer with 100 filters that are each 5x5. How many parameters does this hidden layer have (including the bias parameters)? 2501 2600 7500 7600
