I found another solution which is very easy, short and does not need copying data. You could call native functions which want a C SDATUM in this way: //signature void someFunction(SDATUM datum); void someFunctionWrapper(SDATUM datum){ pin_ptr datum_pin=&datum; //::SDATUM refers to the C-Type someFunction(*(::SDATUM*)datum_pin); } I tested it and it works because both SDATUM Structs have the same bit structure. Because I only call short native functions I think fragmentation is no problem.
