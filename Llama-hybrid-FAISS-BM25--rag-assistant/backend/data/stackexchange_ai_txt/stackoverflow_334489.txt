jQuery .focus doesn’t actually focus a newly created element

Let’s say I have this markup: First paragraph Second paragraph Third paragraph Fourth paragraph I want to add a new with jQuery and focus on this new element. .focus does not do anything. function addParagraph() { var html = " New paragraph "; $("#content").append(html); $("#newP").focus(); } Any idea why?
