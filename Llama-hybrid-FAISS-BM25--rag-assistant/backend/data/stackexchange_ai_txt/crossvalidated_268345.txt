Cross-loading Factor Analysis

Using the Pattern Matrix Table on the SPSS I found there are some cross-loading among some of the variables. I am using Promax Rotation of the PCA and got 15 Factors from 56 Variables. I have 13 variables with some cross-loading of greater than 0.3. Is there a rule of thumb to remove variables that are cross-loading on multiple factors? Any advice as to how one should approach this please? Here is a snapshot of the specific variables - highlighted in orange are the cross-loadings.
