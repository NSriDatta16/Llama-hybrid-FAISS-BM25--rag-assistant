I would use logistic regression. So your model would be: log(odds) = X(bpm) + Z(confounders) for #3 or log(odds) = X(bpm># yes/no) + Z(confounders) for #1. **#1 & #3 are ways of looking at #2. In #3 you are assuming linearity (log-linearity with logistic regression), and in #1 you are assuming a sudden shift in risk/odds. If you don't know that the risk/odds are linear, you should probably look at categories of bpm first. And you should probably have some justification for the categories you examine.
