Identical mixed models in SPSS and R nlme, with different degrees of freedom. Which to trust and why?

I am analyzing a multilevel dataset with an AR(1) error structure and random intercept and slope. I fit what I believe is the exact same model in SPSS and R- my coefficients and standard errors are identical to the third decimal point, but my degrees of freedom are dramatically different. I have been able to find some information on how nlme calculates df, but not how SPSS does it. Given that these analyses are for a scientific paper and thus p-values matter (yes I know), I need to figure out what is going on and which DF to trust. Here is my code for SPSS: MIXED BF_lnLP_incr BY moduleJustDone WITH BF_RSPcl_incr timePoint /CRITERIA=CIN(95) MXITER(1000) MXSTEP(10) SCORING(1) SINGULAR(0.000000000001) HCONVERGE(0, ABSOLUTE) LCONVERGE(0, ABSOLUTE) PCONVERGE(0.000001, ABSOLUTE) /FIXED=BF_RSPcl_incr moduleJustDone timePoint | SSTYPE(3) /METHOD=REML /PRINT=CORB COVB G LMATRIX R SOLUTION TESTCOV /RANDOM=INTERCEPT timePoint | SUBJECT(subjID) COVTYPE(VC) /REPEATED=timePoint | SUBJECT(subjID) COVTYPE(AR1).
