VBA Fastest way to search a 40mb xml file or convert a binary array of that file to string for searching

Howdy, I have VBA running behind MS Access. I need to repeatedly search and retrieve data from a 40mb File. Its too big to load into a string variable. I've loaded it into binary array (rather zippily I might add), but I'm at a loss for how to leverage that format.....I can't seem to grasp looping thru the array a byte at a time in search of a string...... So I dumped that idea...(but I'm willing to learn how to leverage that strategy)..I'm on to FilesystemObject based searching; here's what I have so far: I get the beggining(x) and end(y) of the node & then put it into the FLat variable. Set ts = FSO.OpenTextFile(DLookup("gsgtver", "Eramdat", "EramID = 1"), ForReading, False, TristateFalse) x = InStr(1, ts.ReadAll, ">" & sFirst & " If I didn't have to do this 10 to 120 times I'd chalk it up to "acceptable wait state", but as you can guess, this ain't acceptable. Any suggestions on how to do this more slickilly?
