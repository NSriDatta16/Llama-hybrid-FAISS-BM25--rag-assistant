What are acceptable validation or cross validation error rates?

Is there a commonly acceptable error rate for validation? As in, if the error rate is less than X %, then my machine learning method would be considered "successful". I'm looking for something analogous to a p-value of 0.05 used for many experiments, but for cross-validation. I would use 5% as an error rate but thats really hard to achieve especially if you have small training and validation sets. (I only have 6 subjects total).
