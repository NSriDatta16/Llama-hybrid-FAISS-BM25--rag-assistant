if $x$ is number of attendees and $n$ is the available attendees, then we can assume $X$ has a binomial distribution with Bernoulli parameter $p$. In frequentist statistics, we would say that $p$ should be 0.3 now because we saw 30 people arrive. In a Bayesian framework, we are going to incorporate our belief that $p$ is really 0.2 with our new data with this formula $$ \begin{aligned} P(p|x) &= \frac{P(x|p)*P(p)}{P(x)} \\ &= \frac{P(x=30|p=0.2) * P(p=0.2)}{P(x=30)} \end{aligned} $$ Calculating the right hand side will give you an updated estimate of $p$. The tough parts are: what should the pdf of $p$ be? Calculating the marginal probability (denominator) Depending on how you frame the 2 above, this could be very difficult or very simple to solve. Commonly, $p$ is taken to be uniform so you end up with a beta distribution posterior if you work it out.
