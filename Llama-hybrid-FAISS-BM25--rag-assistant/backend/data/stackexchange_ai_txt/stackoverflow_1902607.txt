I know you said you want to stay away from particular technologies like SOAP unless they're beneficial, but one of the main benefits that well-defined technologies have are sets of tools for parsing messages in a consistent manner. Having said that, I don't think SOAP is right for you. I would aim for a RESTful architecture since the messages are just plain XML and there are libraries for emitting and consuming REST-style messages in a variety of languages. You can typically hit the ground running faster with REST than with comparable technologies like SOAP, but there are still paradigms to learn. Edit : You could describe your service using WADL which describes the RESTful architecture and includes any relevant schema. You could then use the WADL2Java tool or another WADL tool to generate the endpoint stubs. I think this approach is the closes to what you want to do while leveraging your existing schemas and not having to change your client code. Here is a sample WADL file and a little bit of info on it.
