You mean this eq.?: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodrick%E2%80%93Prescott_filter It quite directly says that first term penalizes for too much variation in cyclical component and other term tries to make trend term smooth by using penalty parameter lambda. Some have noticed that HP-filter is related to Butterworth - filter in signal processing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter You have one time series for which you postulate a model like this: series=trend + cycle + seasonal + irregular Problem is that you have only one series and four unknown components. Somehow these components must be extracted from the data and here you need some restrictions. Low-pass filter is such that it completely removes variation from unwanted frequencies and leaves only series where variation from the wanted frequencies is kept.
