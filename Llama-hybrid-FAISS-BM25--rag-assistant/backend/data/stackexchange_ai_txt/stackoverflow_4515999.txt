get mysql records just from today with offset

I'm trying to get all the records just for today but having trouble. Another thing I'm unsure of how to factor in is that my server time is two hours ahead of my local time so I'll need to figure out the offset. I'm off setting the time when I'm inserting the data just not sure how to do it on retrieval of if I'll need to. mysql_query("SELECT `* FROM table WHERE DATE_SUB(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 DAY) I think part of the problem is the I tried just using = and == but neither worked.
