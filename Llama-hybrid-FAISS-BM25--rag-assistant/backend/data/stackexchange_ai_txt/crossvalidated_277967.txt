The definition of a vector space is quite general and there are numerous ways to represent data as vectors in a vector space. From my cursory examination, they may be doing the following? Let $i = 1, \ldots, m$ index the gene. Let $j = 1, \ldots, n$ index the cell. Let $x_{i,j}$ denote the gene expression level of gene $i$ in cell $j$. We then have a matrix of data $X$. You can run PCA on either $X$ or the transpose $X^T$. Treat columns of X as vectors (what you're naturally thinking) You're thinking we can construct a vector for each cell $j$ as: $$ \mathbf{y}_j = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1,j} \\ x_{2,j} \\ \ldots \\ x_{m,j} \end{bmatrix}$$ That is, each vector $\mathbf{y}_j$ shows the gene expression levels of cell $j$ (and each index is a different gene). Treat rows of X as vectors (what they appear to be doing in Image 3 and 4?) We could also form vectors using the columns of $X$ $$ \mathbf{z}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i, 1} \\ x_{i, 2} \\ \dots \\ x_{i, n} \end{bmatrix} $$ That is, each vector $\mathbf{z}_i$ shows the gene expression levels of gene $i$ (and each cell is a different index of the vector). Onward to PCA Once you have a bunch of vectors, you can always conduct PCA to find an alternative basis for that space. A subject area specific interpretation of that basis of course will depend on what your various vectors represent.
