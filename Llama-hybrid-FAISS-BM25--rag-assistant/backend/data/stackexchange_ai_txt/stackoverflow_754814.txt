I had a similar problem and just realized that if you set the ConformanceLevel of the XmlWriterSettings to Fragment, it eliminates some of the XslCompiledTransform quirks. FileStream xmlFileStream = File.Create("file.xml"); XslCompiledTransform transform = new XslCompiledTransform(); transform.Load("transform.xsl"); XmlWriterSettings settings = new XmlWriterSettings(); settings.ConformanceLevel = ConformanceLevel.Fragment; XmlWriter xmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create(xmlFileStream, settings); transform.Transform(sourceXml, null, xmlWriter);
