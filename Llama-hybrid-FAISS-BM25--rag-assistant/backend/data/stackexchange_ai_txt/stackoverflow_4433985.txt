JangoSMTP problem with the php mail function

that's right I am back with another php problem I recently asked another question about php mail with smtp2go I was discouraged about it so I tried getting an email address with 000webhost I set it up with Thunderbird and tested it out I used jangosmtp as my smtp server (outgoing) and used 000webhost's incoming as imap it worked fine I could send and receive emails so I then took it to the next level... using php here is my code send.php: Topic: Message: when I run this code the form appears ok but when I press send this is what I see Warning: mail() [function.mail]: SMTP server response: 550 5.7.1 ... we do not relay in C:\xampp\htdocs> \send.php on line 16 Message sent unsuccessfully I followed these instructions I set up both an ip address and a relay email lsworkemail112@gmail.com I tried multiple times with different conbinations of email address but it still did not work
