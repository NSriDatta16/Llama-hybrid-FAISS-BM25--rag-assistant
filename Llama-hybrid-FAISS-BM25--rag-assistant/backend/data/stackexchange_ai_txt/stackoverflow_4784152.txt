need easy to use date selection menu, for just date / year

I need a jQuery date picker that asks the user to select month and year. I want it to be simple and not confusing at all. I could use two drop-down menus, one for month, the other for year, but I want it to be dead simple, just the click of the menue. I prefer it to be jQuery, anyone know of an elegant choice in this situation?
