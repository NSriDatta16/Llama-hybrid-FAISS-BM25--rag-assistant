Resolved. I contacted my hosting company and got the following: Tyler! Thanks for contacting us. Your script took about 10s to run, but it did run: [/root]# time php -q -f /tmp/nanno Minecraft Server Status Server 1: 70.89.xxx.226:25565 DOWN Server 2: 50.22.xxx.147:25591 DOWN real 0m10.071s user 0m0.047s sys 0m0.019s And bad news, your servers are down. However, this part of your script is fine ;) ... and I do get: Minecraft Server Status Server 1: 70.89.xxx.226:25565 DOWN Server 2: 50.22.36.xxx:25591 DOWN on (so it looks like your browser or http connection is timing out on your end). Unless you know of a way of adjusting your script to lower a timeout variable, your browser network timeout setting, or perhaps if you were to run both fsocks simultaneously you would have the run time? Let us know if you have any further questions or concerns. Regards, ------ Robert C. Server Analyst II SurpassHosting.com, LLC http://www.surpasshosting.com http://www.surmunity.com ME: Thanks for the prompt reply! Well it took ten seconds because there are two connection attempts with 5 second timeouts. The problem is that they should NOT be timing out, I'm in the server right now, and my local server can connect with fsockopen no problem and will display them as UP. What I don't understand is why my script can't 'see' my game servers from my web server. Thanks for your time, TylerT Them: Hello Tyler , The issue is fixed you can view the status now . Thanks Regards, Praveen M Senior Unix Admin SurpassHosting.com, LLC http://www.surpasshosting.com http://www.surmunity.com I dunno if they'll tell me what the problem was, I am very curious. LOL at the first response though.
