If you are not familiar with git you can download the sdk manually to your hard drive on this page: https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk click on downloads and select the preferred format. On the readme clearly states how to add the library to your own application: If you want to integrate Facebook with an existing application, then follow these steps: Copy the Facebook SDK into your Xcode project: In Xcode, open the Facebook SDK by selecting File -> Open... and selecting src/facebook-ios-sdk.xcodeproj. With your own application project open in Xcode, drag and drop the "FBConnect" folder from the Facebook SDK project into your application's project. Include the FBConnect headers in your code: #import "FBConnect/FBConnect.h" You should now be able to compile your project successfully. Register your application with Facebook: Create a new Facebook application at: http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php . If you already have a related web application, you can use the same application ID. Set your application's name and picture. This is what users will see when they authorize your application. You should have a file called yourProjectNameAppDelegate.h and yourProjectNameAppDelegate.m . You have to put #import "FBConnect/FBConnect.h" into yourProjectNameAppDelegate.h . And declare a variable in the header Facebook* facebok; and also synthesize it. Your yourProjectNameAppDelegate.m contains a method called application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: which should look like: - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions{ facebook = [[Facebook alloc] initWithAppId:@"YOUR_APP_ID"]; [facebook authorize:permissions delegate:self]; } Also put in this file the other method. - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url{ return [facebook handleOpenUrl:url]; } Also I suggest to learn a bit more about objective-c, because your problems are not related to the facebook library. You can find plenty of resources on the net. I suggest to look this iTunes university screencast .
