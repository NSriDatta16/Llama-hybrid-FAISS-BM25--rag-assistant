What is a batch in machine learning?

Karpathy's' LSTM batch network LSTM batch network operates with batches def checkSequentialMatchesBatch(): """ check LSTM I/O forward/backward interactions """ n,b,d = (5, 3, 4) # sequence length, batch size, hidden size input_size = 10 WLSTM = LSTM.init(input_size, d) # input size, hidden size X = np.random.randn(n,b,input_size) #... def checkBatchGradient(): """ check that the batch gradient is correct """ # lets gradient check this beast n,b,d = (5, 3, 4) # sequence length, batch size, hidden size input_size = 10 WLSTM = LSTM.init(input_size, d) # input size, hidden size X = np.random.randn(n,b,input_size) #... What does batch applied for? I'm only familiar with feeding one-hot word representation vector and can't understand LSTM learning process with batches. Please explain in terms of text processing. Thanks in advance.
