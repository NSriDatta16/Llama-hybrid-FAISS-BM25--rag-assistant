You state that your properties have the relationship "A * B = C". So, your class should express this. A and B are independent variables, so they have simple setters and getters that merely get and set a filed. C is a Dependant variable and so it should only have a getter and perform the calculation based on A and B: class Foo { private double m_a; public double A { get { return m_a; } set { m_a = value; } } private double m_b; public double B { get { return m_b; } set { m_b = value; } } public double C { get { return A * B; } } } An editor can be written that allows A and B to edited trivially. It can also allow the user to edit C if (and only if) the user has edited A or B already. The view would store some state to indicate which (if any) field was last edited and can therefore apply the appropriate change to A or B when the conceptual C is edited. Now, if the View is unaware of the calculation of C, you can add methods to the Foo class to "SetAGivenC()" and "SetBGivenC()": class Foo { ... as above ... public void SetAGivenC( double newC ) { A = newC/B; } public void SetBGivenC( double newC ) { B = newC/A; } } Now your GUI just calls one of these methods when "C" is edited. I am confused as to what "last field that the user set" means. Imagine that there are two editors up on the screen (both bound to the same Foo instance) and the user edits A in the first editor, then B in the second, then C in the first. What gets adjusted when C is set? A or B? If you can answer this question, you will know which class should track the "last field that the user set" - should it be the model or the view? I expect that A would be adjusted in this case and the view tracks the last edited field. But that's an issue for another day! Edit: Jeepers - I even stuffed up my own pathological case! I'll try that last paragraph again: I am confused as to what "last field that the user set" means. Imagine that there are two editors up on the screen (both bound to the same Foo instance) and the user edits A then B in the first editor, the user then edits B then A in the second, the user then edits C in the first. What gets adjusted when C is set? A or B? If you can answer this question, you will know which class should track the "last field that the user set" - should it be the model or the view? I expect that A would be adjusted in this case and the view tracks the last edited field. But that's an issue for another day!
