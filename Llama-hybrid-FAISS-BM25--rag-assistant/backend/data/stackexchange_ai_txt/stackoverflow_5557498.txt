It's always best to start with the normalized form. I would only suggest Method B if you had your RDBMS automatically managing cached column updates. For example, if you mistakenly placed Los Angeles in Michigan, you would need to update multiple locations (unless you had triggers that would update cascading pieces of information in denormalized tables). But without triggers, Method A is without a doubt the best form. This is assuming of course that your constraints match the ones implicitly dictated by common interpretation when viewing Method A's definition.
