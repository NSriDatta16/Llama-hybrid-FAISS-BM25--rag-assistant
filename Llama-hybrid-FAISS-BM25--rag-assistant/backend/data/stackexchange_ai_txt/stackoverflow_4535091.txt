how about trying this with a few songs first: select the songs, right click and select 'convert id3 tags'. select the most recent version. not sure if that will work. otherwise make a new automator workflow, press the record button at the top, switch to itunes press command+i (get info) then command+n (next button), then stop the workflow recording. you'll see automator made a new action called 'watch me do'. test it out. if this works, try holding option and dragging the command+n part of the action underneath it to duplicate it. you can then select both and duplicate those, then duplicate the 4 you have and so on. you should have a long list of command+n. then, in itunes select the song you want to start from and then press play in automator.
