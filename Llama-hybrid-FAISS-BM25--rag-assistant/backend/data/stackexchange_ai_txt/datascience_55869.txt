Scikit-learn randomforestclassifier error on fitting

So I am trying to use the random forest classifier from scikit-learn and I use tfidfvectorizer to create a feature set, then use test_train_split to create X_train and Y_train. I pass this into the fit function on a random forest classifier set up like this: RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, n_estimators=10, max_depth=1, verbose=True, n_jobs=-1) However I run into a pandas error after: [Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Using backend ThreadingBackend with 12 concurrent workers. [Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done 10 out of 10 | elapsed: 0.1s finished and end up getting empty dataframe failed to iterate on column errors like so: Empty DataFrame Columns: [(column headers listed out properly here)] Index: [] Failed to iterate on column: (a name) Failed to iterate on column: (b name) Failed to iterate on column: (c name) I have a fairly imbalanced dataset with some columns have 50k samples and some having 100ish so is that possibly and issue when using randomforestclassifier? Is there a need for there to be x many trees less than the smallest column length so that each tree can get a subset of y size? It should also be noted that it doesn't crash, it just finishes and prints metrics which are absolutely terrible with most columns being straight up 0 and the larger categories being maybe 40% at most.
