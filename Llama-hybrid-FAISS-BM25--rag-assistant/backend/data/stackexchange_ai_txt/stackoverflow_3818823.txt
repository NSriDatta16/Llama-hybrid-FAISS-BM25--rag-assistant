The problem is likely somewhere between line 875 (or a bit earlier) and line 1341. It maybe a misplaced quote or something less subtle. It will be essentially impossible for us to debug without all the original material between those lines. Suggestion 1: run with 'bash -n -v' and see whether that gives you any insight into the problem. Suggestion 2: split the script into smaller pieces that are more easily managed - and that can be separately debugged. The biggest scripts I have (out of 400 in my bin directory) are from the autoconf suite - they weigh in at just under 1100 lines; the next biggest is mine, and the 750 line script is too d..n big. The next biggest scripts are between 600 and 700 lines of Perl (including Perl documentation). Having said 'missing quote', I see that your fragment close to line 875 has: echo -n "Creating file . . . " echo "XXXXXXXXXXX with a missing close double quote from the second echo. You also mentioned making changes, albeit not close to the point where the script breaks. Since you have the code under version control (you wouldn't dream of playing with a 1700 line script without backups, would you?), you should look at the actual changes again. Or even back up to the previous working version, and make the changes again, one at a time, carefully, until you see why you broke something.
