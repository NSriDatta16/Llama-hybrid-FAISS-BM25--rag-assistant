What is the best solution for working together

I'm a web-designer and former coder. Recently I decided to start own project and hire different specialists (coders and designers) from different cities and countries. So, we have to find a solution that would let us work together, with one source. For this purpose, I think of using SVN or something similar. Is this a good solution for collective working? Maybe there is another, better ways to organize development?
