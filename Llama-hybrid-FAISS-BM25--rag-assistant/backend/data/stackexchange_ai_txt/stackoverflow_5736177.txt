I do not agree with Jordi. An XMI document describes a model. A model is different from its representation (diagrams) which could however be a model too aimed at describing the way elements belonging to the first model should be depicted. In TopCased for instance, a CASE tool based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework, a diagram is a model itself. So you could, and I actually did it thus it is possible, look at how TopCased describes diagrams in XMI and try to generate it from the XMI of your models. Good Luck
