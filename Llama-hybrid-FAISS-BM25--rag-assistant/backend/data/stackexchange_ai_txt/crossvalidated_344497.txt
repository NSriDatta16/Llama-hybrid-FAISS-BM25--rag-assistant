The term "invariance" or "invariant" in this context is not directly related to the statistical meaning of the term "variance" - it is using the basic English meaning of the words variant/varying/etc: invariant as in not varying . In the context of biological and artificial neural networks it is usually referring to a network that gives the same/similar response to an input that is transformed in some way; for vision, common transformations are of scale, position, orientation/rotation, color, etc.
