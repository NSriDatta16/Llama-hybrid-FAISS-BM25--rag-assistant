If you are concerned about sending plain text over the wire, use https. Then whether you use https or not use a one way hashing algorithm such as Sha256 to "encrypt" the password and store that in your database (or whatever persistent storage you are using). When a user logs in, use the same algorithm, to convert the text they entered into the hashed text and compare the hashed text with the hashed text in your database.
