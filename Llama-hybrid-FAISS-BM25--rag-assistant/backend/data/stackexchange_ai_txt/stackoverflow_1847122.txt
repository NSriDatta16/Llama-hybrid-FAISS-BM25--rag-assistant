connection refused exception when trying to run a jar via web start

I am getting the following exception when trying to run my jar through java web start: com.sun.deploy.net.FailedDownloadException: Unable to load resource: http://localhost /ValidatorWEB/validator.jnlp at com.sun.deploy.net.DownloadEngine.actionDownload(Unknown Source) at com.sun.deploy.net.DownloadEngine.getCacheEntry(Unknown Source) at com.sun.deploy.net.DownloadEngine.getCacheEntry(Unknown Source) at com.sun.deploy.net.DownloadEngine.getResourceCacheEntry(Unknown Source) This is the wrapped exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.doConnect(Unknown Source) Here is my .jnlp file: Validator My Company I am deploying the whole thing as a simple WAR to glassfish v2.1 on my local machine . The validator.jar is located in WEB-INF/lib and the jnlp and jsp page I am accessing the jnlp from is at the root of the ValidatorWEB folder. Googling hasn't helped. I have tried turning my firewall off and it still does the same thing. I have the appropriate Mime-type set in Glassfish. Is there something else I'm forgetting to do?
