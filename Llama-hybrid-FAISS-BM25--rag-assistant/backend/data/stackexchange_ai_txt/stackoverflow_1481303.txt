As the other posters noted, I believe it creates its own private "fiber" [in 1.9]. In 1.8.7 (or 1.8.6 if you use the backports gem) somehow or other it does the same thing (perhaps because all threads in 1.8 are the equivalent of fibers, it just uses them?) Thus in 1.9 and 1.8.x, if you chain several of them together a.each_line.map.each_with_index { } It actually flows through that whole chain with each line, kind of like a pipe on the command line http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/12/pipelines-using.html HTH.
