You can use response to therapy as the outcome, and control for covariates in exact logistic regression, that is also an exact test (as the Fisher's one) and it reduces to the Fisher's test itself in case of simple regression with a binary regressor (see, for example: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288420?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301146198_Exact_Logistic_Regression_Theory_Applications_Software ). If the model is too computationally intensive, you can switch to regular logistic regression or, if you believe its estimate are biased due to sparse data, or are even unfeasible due to quasi-separation, you can evaluate alternative methods, that don't use maximum likelihood estimators (like penalized logistic regression methods).
