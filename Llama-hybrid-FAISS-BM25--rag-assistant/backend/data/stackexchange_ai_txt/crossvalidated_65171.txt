A mixed effects model has both fixed effects and random effects. The "mixed effects" terminology is common in biostatistics*. In this context, study units are thought of as sampled from a population; the fixed effects are estimates of the population average effect, whereas the random effects are specific to the study units. In matrix form, a mixed effects model might be: $$ \bf Y=X\boldsymbol\beta + Zb + \boldsymbol\varepsilon $$ where $\bf X$ is the design matrix, $\boldsymbol\beta$ is a vector of the population average effects, $\bf Z$ is a subset of the columns of $\bf X$, $\bf b$ is a vector of the unit specific deviations from the population effects, and $\varepsilon$ is a vector of random errors. * Note that very similar terminology is used, but with a different meaning, in econometrics.
