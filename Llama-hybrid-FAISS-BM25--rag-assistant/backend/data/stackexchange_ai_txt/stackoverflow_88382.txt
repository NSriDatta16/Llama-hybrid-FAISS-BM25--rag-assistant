Where do I start learning about GUI programming?

I have a pretty good knowledge of programming languages like C/C++, Java, Python. But they were all mostly learnt in a college / high school class room setting where the best user interface was a numbered menu. You know, the standard data structures, implementation of various algorithms, file handling and the like. What I want to do now is to get into GUI programming. I am not sure if I am asking the right way, but I am looking at using the WIMP paradigm (windows icons menus pointers). I want to place buttons and forms. Event driven programming, I believe is the right word, where my application waits till the user clicks something, types something etc. Given my background, where would be a good place to start? I am looking at the following requirements - 1> Preferably cross platform. 2> Lots of documentations, tutorials, and if possible sample code that I can learn off of 3> A good GUI builder tool, where I can drag / drop stuff the way I want them to be displayed. Any ideas or suggestions to get me started?
