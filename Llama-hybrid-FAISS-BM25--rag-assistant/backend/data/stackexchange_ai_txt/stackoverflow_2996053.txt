Disadvantage of using guid over int: String values are not as optimal as integer values for performance when used in joins, indexes and conditions. More storage space is required than INT. The generated GUIDs should be partially sequential for best performance (eg, newsequentialid() on SQL 2005) and to enable use of clustered indexes for more detail : http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids.html http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2010/04/28/sql-server-guid-vs-int-your-opinion/
