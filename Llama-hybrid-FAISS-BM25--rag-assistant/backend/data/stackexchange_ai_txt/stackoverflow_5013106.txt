Memory-Mapped Storage Engine

From MongoDb's site, the current only support storage engine is Memory-Mapped Storage Engine. I am wondering how it supports atomicity in the presence of system crash(i.e power failure)? Does it depend on the OS? Is there any reference about this topic? What are the pros and cons of this design comparing with: couchdb's crash only design which depends on append only b+tree. sqlite's rollback journal file Thanks
