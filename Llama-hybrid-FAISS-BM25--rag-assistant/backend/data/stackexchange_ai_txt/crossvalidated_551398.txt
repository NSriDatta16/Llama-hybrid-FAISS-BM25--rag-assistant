Which one should we use for forecasting: differenced series and cox-box transformed series?

I have a non-stationary dataset which shows the prices. I wanted to apply time series analysis on it. I took the first differences of the dataset and it became stationary. Then I determined the p and q values by looking the ACF and PACF plots. However, I was a bit confused because I saw that many people applied Box-Cox transformation on their non-stationary dataset and took the differenced of these datasets until they reach a stationary series. My question is arising here. Should I work with Box-Cox transformed data first? Why some people are working with the differenced series when others are working with Box-Cox transformed series? Thanks in advance.
