Reading streams from java Runtime.exec

I have the following snippet of code: Process proc = runtime.exec(command); errorGobbler = new ErrorStreamGobbler(proc.getErrorStream(), logErrors, mdcMap); outputGobbler = new OutputStreamGobbler(proc.getInputStream(), mdcMap); executor.execute(errorGobbler); executor.execute(outputGobbler); processExitCode = proc.waitFor(); where the gobblers are Runnable s which use a BufferedReader to read the input and error streams of the executing process. While this works most of the time, I get the occasional window (of about 2 minutes or so) where I get the processExitCode as 0, which indicates normal termination but there is nothing in the input and error streams - nothing to even indicate end-of-stream. Like I indicated before, this works most of the time but this failure occurs every once in a while - and I am totally puzzled. Any ideas? Rags
