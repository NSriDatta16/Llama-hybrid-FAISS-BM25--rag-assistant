A lot has been already said, I will just add something from my side. In your case both cases are correct, except I would encourage to to split this into two layers: logic, and view. So your Logic layer would do: doLogic() { if (n > 5) { throw "n is greater than 5"; } ///Something more } and your view layer might do: try { doLogic() } catch (const char *e) { MessageBox(0, e, 0, 0); return; } But again, as other said: the most important thing is where does the n come from. If you expect it to be more than 5 then just use if() else, not exceptions. But if n is always less than 5 and if it's more than 5 means that something is wrong with your system, then use exceptions.
