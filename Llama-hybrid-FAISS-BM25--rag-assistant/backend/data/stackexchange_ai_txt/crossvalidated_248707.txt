As mentioned in the comments above, the gbm model would be better with some parameter tuning. An easy way to spot problems in the model and the need for such parameters is to generate some diagnostic plots. For example, for the gbm model above with the default parameters (and using the plotmo package to create the plots) we have gbm.gaus which gives In the left hand plot we see that the error curve hasn't bottomed out. And in the right hand plot the residuals are not what we would want. If we rebuild the model with a bigger number of trees gbm.gaus1 we get We see the error curve bottom out with a large number of trees, and the residuals plot is healthier. We can also plot the partial dependence plots for the new gbm model and the random forest model library(plotmo) plotmo(gbm.gaus1, pmethod="partdep", all1=TRUE, all2=TRUE) plotmo(rf.model, pmethod="partdep", all1=TRUE, all2=TRUE) which gives The gbm and random forest model plots are now similar, as expected.
