This is a smiliar question to Object Recognition from Templates to which I provided an answer which I believe might be of use. While different kinds of classifiers will probably work well, I would probably try the method I outlined first. Classifiers are often tricky to implement and especially to train properly. Also, when things don't work it is very hard to know where the problem is: is it in your implementation of the classifier, did you choose the wrong method, are the parameters wrong, did you not train it properly, or were you just unlucky? No, stay away from classifiers, template matching and neural networks if the problem can (easily) be solved using simlpe image processing methods and some math.
