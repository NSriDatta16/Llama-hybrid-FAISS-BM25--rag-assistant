getting a Webkit executeSql transaction to return a value

How can I get the following JavaScript to return row so I can access it outside the transaction? All of Apple's example code seems to have HTML written to the browser within the transaction instead of ever passing data back to a calling function. Along the lines of: function getData() { db.transaction(function(tx) { tx.executeSql("SELECT id FROM table LIMIT 1", [], function(tx, result) { row = result.rows.item(0); }, function(tx, error) { }); }); return row; } Is this even possible? Can the Webkit storage API be set to synchronous instead of asynchronous execution?
