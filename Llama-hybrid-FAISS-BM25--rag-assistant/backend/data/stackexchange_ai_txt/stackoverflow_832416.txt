There are a lot of use cases that a regular expression won't work properly for. For instance: foo bar baz This paragraph is valid This one isn't --> A regular expression that captures the text between the and will capture (respectively): foo bar This paragraph is valid This one isn't If I had to process HTML found in the wild, I'd use MSHTML to parse the HTML, and then search through the DOM to find the objects. Using MSHTML is not anywhere near as lightweight as using a regular expression, to be sure. But MSHTML is designed to make sense out of the sloppiest of web pages. I'd much rather use all of the knowledge of messy real-world use cases that it's designed to handle than discover them allfor myself. See the answer to this question for a bit of sample code.
