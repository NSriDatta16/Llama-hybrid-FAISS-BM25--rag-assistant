What method is suitable for short-term forecast for a trendless, oscillatory, bounded time series?

I am new to time series analysis and I would appreciate if anyone could provide me some insight on it. I am trying to analyse a past series of numbers that fluctuates between 107 & 210 with a normal frequency bell curve distribution of mean 162. What is a suitable approach to forecast short-term future range for a trendless but oscillatory, range bound type of time series?
