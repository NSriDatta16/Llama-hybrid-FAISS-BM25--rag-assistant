First of all: What is the size of your data? Then you should probably reduce the number of labels (so far 120 * 60 = 7200 is a large number for output). But you could encode them with label = 1, ..., k => your classes) Do you want a multi-label classification or a multi-class classification (there is a difference, allthough you can do both by extending a binary classifier for each output) Maybe you should hear "Random Forest", "Support Vector Machine", "Naive Bayes Classifier" or "k-NN" There are dozen of algorithms for classification....
