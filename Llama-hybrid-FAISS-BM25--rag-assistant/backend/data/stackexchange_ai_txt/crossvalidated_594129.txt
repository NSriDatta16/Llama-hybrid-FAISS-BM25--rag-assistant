Does it make sense to plot ROC curves on out-of-fold predictions in k-fold cross-validation?

To plot the ROC curve for the test set using k-fold cross-validation, the common approach is to plot k different ROC curves, one for each fold, and then obtain their average, as suggested in sklearn website . I want to follow a different approach: Let's concatenate the predictions obtained for the test sets in different folds, and plot an ROC plot on the whole set. Does this approach make sense?
