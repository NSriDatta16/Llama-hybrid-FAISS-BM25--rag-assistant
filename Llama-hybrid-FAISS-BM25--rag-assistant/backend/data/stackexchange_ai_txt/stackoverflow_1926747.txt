You can create a Rectangle object and set its BackgroundColor property. Use your Rectangle to initialize your Document . This tutorial on the iTextSharp site on SourceForge describes this (see the PageSize section). The same site has a code sample that demonstrates what you need to do. (see 'step 1'). The sample is in C# and I know you want it in VB.NET so I ran it through the C# to VB.NET converter on the developerfusion site. I can't test compile the results from the machine I'm not now, but the code looks reasonable: Imports System Imports System.IO Imports iTextSharp.text Imports iTextSharp.text.pdf Public Class Chap0102 Public Shared Sub Main() Console.WriteLine("Chapter 1 example 2: PageSize") ' step 1: creation of a document-object Dim pageSize As New Rectangle(144, 720) pageSize.BackgroundColor = New Color(&Hff, &Hff, &Hde) Dim document As New Document(pageSize) Try ' step 2: ' we create a writer that listens to the document ' and directs a PDF-stream to a file PdfWriter.getInstance(document, New FileStream("Chap0102.pdf", FileMode.Create)) ' step 3: we open the document document.Open() ' step 4: we Add some paragraphs to the document For i As Integer = 0 To 4 document.Add(New Paragraph("Hello World")) Next Catch de As DocumentException Console.[Error].WriteLine(de.Message) Catch ioe As IOException Console.[Error].WriteLine(ioe.Message) End Try ' step 5: we close the document document.Close() End Sub End Class Give it a try.
