First: I don't know much about ARB_fragment_program so I'm partly guessing here. Your best option would be to get the error string (glGetString(GL_PROGRAM_ERROR_STRING_ARB)) and see what that tells you. After looking at the shader, you seem to be using the wrong number of components in lines 3 and 7 (and probably some more). For example I don't think you can assign a 4-component vector (fragment.texcoord[1]) to a scalar field (R0.x).
