Use setTimeout("abc();", 5000); in your ready function. Example (Don't use this, see below) $(document).ready(function () { //Wait 5 seconds then call abc(); setTimeout("abc();", 5000); }); function abc() {} The 5000 tells it to wait 5000 milliseconds which is 5 seconds. This is a basic JavaScript function and doesn't require jQuery (other than of course, the ready state event code). You can also use setInterval() if you want something to happen a recurring amount of times. Edit : You can read more about it here(link removed). Edit3 : While my answer was not incorrect, it was not the best way to do it (as brought to my attention by david in the comment below.) A better way of doing it would be to pass the function abc itself directly into the setTimeout function. Like so: $(document).ready(function () { //Wait 5 seconds then call abc(); setTimeout(abc, 5000); }); function abc() {} This is better form because you're not passing the string argument which is eval 'd and could cause security risks . Also, a better link for documentation is here .
