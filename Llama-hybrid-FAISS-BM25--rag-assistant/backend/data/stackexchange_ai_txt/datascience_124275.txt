For some reason getting an odd error when hyper tuning my model

I was hoping to hypertune my decisiontree model , however I keep running into this error: TypeError: DecisionTreeClassifier() got an unexpected keyword argument 'criterion' here what I tried: def randomsearch(): data = pd.read_csv('test_data.csv', delimiter=',') x = data.iloc[:, :70] y = data['class'].values param_dist = {"max_depth": [3, None], "max_features": randint(1, 9), "min_samples_leaf": randint(1, 9), "criterion": ["gini", "entropy"]} tree = DecisionTreeClassifier() tree_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(tree, param_dist, cv=5) tree_cv.fit(x,y) print("Tuned Decision Tree Parameters: {}".format(tree_cv.best_params_)) print("Best score is {}".format(tree_cv.best_score_)) I had expected to receive the best parameters for my dataset. This error seems odd any reason why its showing up and how to bypass it? imports: import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import KFold from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2 from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline from sklearn.metrics import classification_report from random import randint import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2 from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split , cross_val_score , RandomizedSearchCV,GridSearchCV,RepeatedStratifiedKFold from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline from sklearn import preprocessing from scipy.stats import loguniform from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn import svm from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneOut import pickle
