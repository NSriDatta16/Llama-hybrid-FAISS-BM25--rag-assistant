Yes, but you'd have to rewrite WebServices.GetTheData and GetTheTime to take objects, or provide overloads that take objects. This is because you can't upcast objects in .NET implicitly. In other words, you can do this: TimeCheckRequest myTimeCheckRequest; object foo = myTimeCheckRequest; but you can't do this: object myTimeCheckRequest; TimeCheckRequest foo = myTimeCheckRequest;
