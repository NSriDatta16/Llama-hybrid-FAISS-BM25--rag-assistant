diagnose 404 for asp net POST request

How can i diagnose the 404 errors on my asp.net application. It seems in iis logs that GET request to my *.aspx page return success ( code 200) The POST request to same page returns a 404 error , not able to diagnose why. Is there a seperate setting to allow POST request to this page or some where in the application. Edit #1 The Page has a grid ( ingragistics grid, third party control) that makes a xmlhttprequest to the page itself to load some data on the fly. It sometimes work but mostly give a 404. fidler also confrims the 404 error with the url & that url does exist and is correct. I also verified the logs in IIS it confirm the 404 error. But not able to detect where the issue is.
