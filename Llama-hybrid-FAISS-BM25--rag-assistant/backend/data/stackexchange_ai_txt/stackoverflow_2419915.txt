SSIS Package won't fail, even with bad input data

I have an SSIS package that won't error out even with bad input. In my case this package reads from a flat file and puts records into a SQL Server table. Pretty straightforward, nothing fancy going on here. The flat file is defined as being ragged right, 80 characters per row, maybe 10 columns in total. Problem: sometimes the flat file isn't padded out to 80 characters, so we get variable length rows, instead of spaces filling out the rest. We want to fail the package when that happens. In my flat file source component I have the error output section set up so that if any column is truncated the component will fail. Yet for some reason all steps are green when I run the package from Visual Studio, even though no rows are imported. Here's the output I get: SSIS package "SSIS Package 01.dtsx" starting.

Information: 0x4004300B at Import data to Table01, DTS.Pipeline: "component "OLE DB Destination" (5467)" wrote 0 rows. ....so no records are imported, and there are warnings about partial rows, but the package completes successfully. When this package is fed a good input file, 80 characters per row, it imports as many rows as are in the file with no problem. The strange thing is we have other SSIS packages that fail when variable-length rows are used as input. I've looked and compared those packages to this and for the life of me cannot see what they might be doing different. If you have any ideas or leads I could follow I'd be grateful. Thanks!
