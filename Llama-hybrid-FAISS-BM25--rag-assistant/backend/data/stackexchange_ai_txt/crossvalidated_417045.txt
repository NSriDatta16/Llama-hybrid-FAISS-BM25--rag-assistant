To answer your main question: Multilevel TimeSeries modelling in Python There is nothing equivalent to the HTS package in Python. The two things that I know of that are the closest are PyAF and htsprophet . However they use different forecasting models than those used in HTS. PyAF uses models from scikit-learn to do forecasting, which is unusual since the sklearn models aren't usually amenable to time series problems. htsprophet uses only the FB Prophet model. By contrast HTS uses ARIMA and ETS, which are more standard forecasting methods (although FB Prophet is increasing in popularity). From what you described in your post though, I'm not entirely sure whether your problem is indeed a time series problem, or if it is indeed hierarchical in nature the way it hierarchy is understood in HTS. Can you please clarify the details of what you are trying to do?
