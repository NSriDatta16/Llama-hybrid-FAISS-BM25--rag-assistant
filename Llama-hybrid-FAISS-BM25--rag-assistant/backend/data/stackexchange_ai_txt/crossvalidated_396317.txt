For sequence data, the default model is LSTM. It's able to model long sequences and has a much better representative power than linear models. Take a look at PyTorch's tutorial if you're new to it. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-nlp-sequence-models-tutorial-py If I have a large enough dataset, I usually don't bother to remove the duplicates.
