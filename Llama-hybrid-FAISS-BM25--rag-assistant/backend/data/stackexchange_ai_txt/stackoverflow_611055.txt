From here : Session state is stored locally, relative to the user's home directory, by the LocalStorage save and load methods. The startup method must set the ApplicationContext vendorId and applicationId properties to ensure that the correct local directory is selected on all platforms. For example, on Windows XP, the full pathname for filename "session.xml" is typically: ${userHome}\Application Data\${vendorId}\${applicationId}\session.xml Where the value of ${userHome} is the the value of the Java System property "user.home". On Solaris or Linux the file is: ${userHome}/.${applicationId}/session.xml and on OSX: ${userHome}/Library/Application Support/${applicationId}/session.xml
