Pvclust is a bit odd in that it expects your data to be organized with the observations in the rows, rather than the columns. This is what the documentation in ?pvclust tries to explain, just not very well. try transposing your original data matrix in the call to pvclust() and see if it runs. i.e., fit as an aside its not good R practice to give names to objects that are also the names of R functions e.g., 'transpose' Good luck
