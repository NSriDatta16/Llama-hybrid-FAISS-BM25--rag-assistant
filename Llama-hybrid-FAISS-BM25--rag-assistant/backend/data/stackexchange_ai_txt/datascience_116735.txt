UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that is typically used to reduce high-dimensional data down to 2 or 3 dimensions so that it can be visualized. When you set the value of n_components to 5 in UMAP, you are telling the algorithm to reduce the data down to 5 dimensions. This does not necessarily mean that the resulting plot will have 5 distinct features or dimensions. When UMAP projects the high-dimensional data down to a lower-dimensional space, it does not choose the features with the most information or project them randomly. Instead, it uses a combination of methods, including local linear embedding and a novel technique called "stochastic gradient descent on a Riemannian manifold," to preserve the structure of the data as much as possible while reducing its dimensionality. This means that the resulting plot will typically retain the most important features and relationships in the data, even if it doesn't perfectly preserve all of the original dimensions. If you want to see the 5-dimensional result of the UMAP reduction, you will need to use a different visualization technique, such as a parallel coordinates plot, that can display more than two or three dimensions at once. Alternatively, you can try using a different dimensionality reduction algorithm that is better suited to preserving higher-dimensional structure, such as t-SNE.
