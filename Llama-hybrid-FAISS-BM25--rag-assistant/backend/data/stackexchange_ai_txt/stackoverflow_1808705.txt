The second type of casting has different behaviour for top level( http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/langref/ ) types, e.g. Array(obj) does not cast in the straightforward way you describe; it creates a new Array if possible from obj, even if obj is an Array. I'm sure the times this would cause unexpected behaviour would be rare but I always use "as" for this reason. It means if I do int(str) I know it's a cast in the "attempt to convert" sense of the word not in the "I promise it is" sense. ref: got some confirmation on this from http://raghuonflex.wordpress.com/2007/07/27/casting-vs-the-as-operator/
