Another tool that may be useful is the standardarized regression coefficient, or at least a rough-and-ready pseudo-version. You can obtain one such version by multiplying your obtained coefficient by the standard deviation of the predictor. (There are other versions and some debate about the best one, e.g. see Menard 2002, Applied Logistic Regression Analysis ( Google books )). This will give you a way to assess the strength of the effect across studies.
