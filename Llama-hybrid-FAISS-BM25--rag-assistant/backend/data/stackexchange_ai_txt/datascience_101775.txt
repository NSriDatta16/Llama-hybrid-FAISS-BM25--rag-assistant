If Kernel Least Mean Square (KLMS) is to be applied, it would be useful to most augment traditional machine learning (e.g., linear regression). KLMS are not common in machine learning because kernel methods require more both memory space and computational power. Kernel methods definitely increase the training time while probably not significantly increasing the ability to model the data relative to tree-based models and neural networks.
