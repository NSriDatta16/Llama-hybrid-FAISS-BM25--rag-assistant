Firstly, a NIB file is, for all intents and purposes, the same as an XIB file; it’s just a compiled version of a XIB file. Now, to create an object derived from NSObject in your NIB/XIB, simply drag an NSObject from the library window into your file. Then on the Identity Inspector change the class to your custom class. If you define methods like this: - (IBAction)myAction:(id)sender you’ll be able to hook them up in Interface Builder. Having said all that, it’s difficult to tell whether what you’re doing is the right thing to do at all. It sounds to me like you should be using an NSViewController subclass so have a look at the documentation for that. You should also make sure you understand what view, controller and model objects are. There’s plenty of literature on this.
