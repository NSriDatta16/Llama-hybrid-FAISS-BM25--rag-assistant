If you are using a neural network for classification, here are a few things you can do on the data even if you don't have the labels for them. If the data points are real-valued vectors, you can normalize them by calculating the (featurewise) mean and standard deviation. You can train an autoencoder on this data (by reconstructing the original input), and this will get your a better feature representation, which can then be used with k-means clustering or other unsupervised methods.
