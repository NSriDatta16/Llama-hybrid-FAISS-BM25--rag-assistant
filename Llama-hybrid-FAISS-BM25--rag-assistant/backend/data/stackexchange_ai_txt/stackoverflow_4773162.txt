Writing a simple game interpreter

I have read many entries about interpreter and compiler construction on this site and on hacker news. All the topics talk about big interpreter language , I wish to write a oversimplified languages. Language The language is based on Herbert [ Imagine Cup ] I wish to create a online version , user can submit in form and see it robot running in the web window. I can only use php , python , ruby or any web language. Here is my language Basic Instruction s - straight l - left r - right You can have function here f : ssrl [ They support recursion f: ssrlf arguments f(A) : Assrl , f(A) : ssrlf(A-1) ( A is integer here) You can have multiple functions in the program calling each other. f:ssrlgf I want to implement this as quickly as possible , what will be the best alternative for me to get this job done . [ I know php , don't have experience in python or ruby but willing to learn them for this project ]
