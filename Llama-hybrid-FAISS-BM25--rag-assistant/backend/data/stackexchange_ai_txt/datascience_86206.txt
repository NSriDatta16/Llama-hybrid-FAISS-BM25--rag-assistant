Identify Resume Structure

I am trying to build a resume parser (from PDF to JSON). After extracting text from a pdf as one long string, how would you split the string into different sections like the red lines show. Resumes have different formats and people use different labels for these sections. Is there any machine learning technique that I could look into? Thanks! .
