Generic view in razor

Good morrow, I am learning about razor, and found myself stuck in a problem. Although i know how to use inheritance with cshtml file with an actual class, " @inherits BasicListView ", I wanted to have all the comodities of the cshtml template engine, to make a base view, like a generic listing view, per instance. I believe that one might not be able to directly, cshtml to cshtml, mark an inheritance, but it is quite ok, as it will become a class anyway. As well, i could generate the class by myself and then use it's object, i may be wrong, but sounds a little too workaround for me. Would anyone care of having an elegant solution for it? Edit: I will redo the question: Keeping in mind that there is a strongly-typed view, for per example a list page, can anyone think on how to implement a generic-typed view, for the same porpouse?
