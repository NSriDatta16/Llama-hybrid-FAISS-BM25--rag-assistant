time series prediction with several independent variables using RNNs and Keras

I came across this excellent question and answer by Adam Sypniewski. Here method of using RNNs (e.g. LSTMs and GRUs) for predicting time series where the dependent variable depends on several independent variables. Just wondering, is anyone aware of some Keras code for this?
