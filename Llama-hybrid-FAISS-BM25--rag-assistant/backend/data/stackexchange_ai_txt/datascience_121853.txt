Running your code as is, I get an error about i_data being Long instead of Float. RuntimeError: expected scalar type Float but found Long. However, changing just the one line to i_data = torch.arange(1,10).float().reshape((9,1)) and I get outputs y and hidden_state returned correctly. hidden_state = torch.zeros(1,1, dtype=torch.float32) y, hidden_state = rnn(i_data, hidden_state) The parameters to the constructor for RNN are input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, and the arguments you pass to rnn are input, hidden_0. Everything seems correct at first glance to me. Do you maybe have variables still initialized from previous runs or is this working with the one-line change for you?
