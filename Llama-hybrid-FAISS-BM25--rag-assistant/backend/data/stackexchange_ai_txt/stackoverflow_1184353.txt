No real difference I think, beyond visual effect. Makes a difference when saving the file (browser usually takes the title as file name) or dragging the URL to a folder (in Windows), as the pipe cannot be used in the file name (.html or .url) so have to be removed or replaced. Pipes are also annoying when I use Make Link Firefox extension with Wiki markup (as pipe is used as separator between link name and URL). So pipe is slightly more annoying for these cases...
