Classifying by performing PCA for two classes separately

I have a dataset with binary labels, and I try to figure out whether the data can be classified and yield the ground-truth labels. I thought to try PCA for the data with each of the labels, and see whether I get a different PCA basis / coefficients. This is under the assumption that if the data is not differentiable, I would (probably) get the PCA coefficients to have similar shapes. The question is, is this method valid? If I do get different PCA coefficients for the two groups, does this mean they have different statistical properties?
