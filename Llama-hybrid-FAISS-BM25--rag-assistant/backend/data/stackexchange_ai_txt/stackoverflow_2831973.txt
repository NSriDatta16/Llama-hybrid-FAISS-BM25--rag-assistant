Try this in the postinstall script: /usr/bin/sudo -u $USER /bin/launchctl load -S Aqua /Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourcompany.launchagent.plist Note that if multiple users are logged in via Fast User Switching, this will only activate your launch agent for the user who installed it. There is an unsupported way to make this work with multiple users logged in on Mac OS X 10.5/10.6, using launchctl bsexec ; see this mailing list post for more information.
