Logistic Regression for non-binary classification (multi-class) in R

I am trying to use glm(family = binomial(link = 'logit')) for a classification task with 14 classes. I know that logistic regression is used in R for binary classification and as a result it outputs the probabilities for the predicted value being either 0 or 1. But is it possible to also use it for a non-binary classification task? I have 14 classes and 93 features in my dataset. This is how I have written it, and of course it does not work, because this is the approach that I use when I only have two classes; log.model
