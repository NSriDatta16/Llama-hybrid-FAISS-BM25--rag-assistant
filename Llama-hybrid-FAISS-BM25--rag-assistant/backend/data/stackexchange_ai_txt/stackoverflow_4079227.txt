The response code you're getting is an HTTP code stating that you are forbidden access to the resource you're trying to retrieve. This could be for a number of reasons: Server settings - The server may disallow ALL attempts to access the resource. To check for this, try accessing it from a browser. If you get the same error in the browser, then it's likely that your issue is the server configuration. Blocked user agent - Sometimes only certain user agents are allowed to access a resource. This is done to prevent automated website crawlers from scraping the info in the resource. If the site you're accessing has a robots.txt file there's a chance that your program is being blocked. Authentication needed - If the server you're accessing requires authentication (such as basic or digest auth) then you need to provide credentials along with your request. Again, this can be checked w/ the browser. If the resource required authentication you should get a popup in the browser requesting user/pass info. There are probably other reasons you could be getting this code, but these are the first three I could think of off the top of my head.
