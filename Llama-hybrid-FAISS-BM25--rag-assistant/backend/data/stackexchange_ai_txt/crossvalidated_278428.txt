The estimate of the effect of $x$ will certainly change if $z$ or $q$ (or both) have an effect on $y$ net of $x$. It will change even if $z$ and $q$ are orthogonal to $x$ as long as $z$ and $q$ explain any portion of $y$. This happens because adding new variables changes the scale in which the entire model is expressed. The logistic model given by: (1)$$ \ln\bigg(\frac{1}{1-p_i}\bigg) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1i} $$ Is expressed in the latent variable formulation as: (2)$$ y^* =\alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}x_{1i} + \sigma \varepsilon $$ The total variance in the model is made of explained (modelled) and unexplained (residual/errors) variance. The logistic model forces the errors to have a fixed variance of 3.29 (and a logistical distribution). Hence, any changes in the amount of explained variance will force the total variance of $y*$ to change, causing its scale to change because the variance of the errors is fixed and cannot change. This affects the size of the coefficients because they now explain change in $y*$ in a different scale. The scaling factor is given by $\sigma$ in (2). The alphas in (2) are related to the betas in (1) by: (3)$$ \beta_{j} = \frac{\alpha_{j}}{\sigma}\;\;j=1,...,J. $$ Adding more covariates that explain any portion of $y$ will reduce the amount of unexplained heterogeneity and will consequentially change the other coefficients in the model.
