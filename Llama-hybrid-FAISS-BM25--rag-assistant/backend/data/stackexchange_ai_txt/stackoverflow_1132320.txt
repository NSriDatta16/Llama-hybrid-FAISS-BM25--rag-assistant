If you can, it seems like modifying the priority scheme would be the most elegant, so that you could just sort normally. For example, instead of storing a default priority as 0, store it as 999, and cap user defined priorities at 998. Then you won't have to deal with the special case anymore, and your compare function can have a more straightforward structure, with no nesting of if's: (pseudocode) if (priority1 priority2) return 1; if (startTime1 startTime2) return 1; if (teamName1 teamName2) return -1; return 0; // exact match!
