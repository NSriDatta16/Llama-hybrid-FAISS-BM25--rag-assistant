The problem is that your data is both very small and very noisy. This leads to the very different outcomes you get from your models. In such small samples outliers have very big influence on your outcome. Imagine, for example, that you removed case 44 from the first plot - then we would see "obvious" upward, quadratic trend. Now imagine we removed case 5 - the "trend" would be very different. If we removed case 10 from the second plot we would get very steep positive trend. All this makes the approach you would choose for analyzing this data have great influence on the outcome. One approach you could possibly apply is to use Bayesian model with informative prior based on your out-of-data knowledge about the phenomenon you observe. With such a small sample overfitting is a significant risk, so simpler (e.g. linear) models are safer that more complicated ones (e.g. including polynomials).
