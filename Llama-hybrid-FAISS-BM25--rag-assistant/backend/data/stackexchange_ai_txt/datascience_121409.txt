My suggestion here would be considering different models for single drivers and additional drivers. Regarding missing values (1) This would be the case for additional drivers When driver2_licence_type is not NAN, but driver2_licence_years has missing values ; I would consider average of driver2_licence_years on the basis of driver2_licence_type, driver2_licence_years for the data that does not have missing values. To do this if would group by driver2_licence_type and average driver2_licence_years. I would use this dictionary to compute missing values for driver2_licence_years.If still there are missing values ; I would then consider an overall average. (2) This would be the case for single drivers When both driver2_licence_type and driver2_licence_years has missing values ; I would consider dropping these two columns and not considering them at all. If you do not wish to create two different models, I would create an additional variable as you mentioned to flag which one's are single driver and which one's are additional driver (say Single/Additional). The missing values for case (1) would remain same and missing values for case (2) for driver2_licence_type would be None/Other; assuming you would be using encoding methods to convert the variable from categorical to ordinal for your data modelling and missing values for driver2_licence_years can be 0. Your data model will consider the difference between no driver versus a novice driver with 0 yrs experience because of the encoding values for driver2_licence_type for a particular data row. This is the ordinal example that you can use for converting the categorical column to ordinal - You can compute additional variables like as shown below and then consider just numerical variables for your model-
