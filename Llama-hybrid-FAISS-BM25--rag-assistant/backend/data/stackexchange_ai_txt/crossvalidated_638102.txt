R - multinomial logistic regression with relative frequencies as response variable

My colleagues observed in an experiment involving categorical and continuous independent variables, how the species composition changes. Approximately equal numbers of microbes were used in the experiments, and at the end of the trials, the surviving species were genetically determined. Only relative frequencies (not count data) of the individuals of each species could be estimated based on quantitative genetic measures. However, this also means that my response variable is not binary coded (0/1), and probabilities for survival are already available. Now my question: Can I still perform a multinomial logistic regression in this case? How should I do it in R? Or: Is there already an implementation for this in R? Thank you for suggestions, ideas, and assistance! Additional background info A community of bacteria has been grown together in medium. For every experiment, the community has been initialized with the same composition, i.e. every culture started had the same number of individuals belonging to one of the 12 species contained in the population. Moreover, we tested whether the combination of the supernatants of all species together either increased or decreased the growth of any of these 12 species when cultured separately. This effect of supernatants has been expressed in either a positive or a negative continuous value. Furthermore, it could be that the individuals belonging to the same species may build microcolonies/clusters inside the liquid medium. Thus, we either slowly shaked the medium with the bacteria composition or didn't shake it. In the end we were interested which species surveyed finally in each experimental group. Thus, my colleagues performed qPCRs to quantitatively determine how many characteristic DNA sequences for every bacterium could be found. We used this as a proxy for the number of cells in the medium, and thus calculated relative frequencies as proxies for the species composition. Since I have been asked to analyze this setup, I'd like to know how I can evaluate whether the final species composition is impacted by which explanatory variable (either numeric or categorical). Thanks in advance for any suggestions on how to analyze such a kind of multinomial model (species composition = starting composition + supernatant effect + treatment).
