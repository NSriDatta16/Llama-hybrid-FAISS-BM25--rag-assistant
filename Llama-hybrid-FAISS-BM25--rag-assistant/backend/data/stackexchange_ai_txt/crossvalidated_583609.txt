How to compare the sensitivity of many countries?

My thesis question is asking whether biodiversity sensitivity differs geographically. I will assess all 5 pressures individually, but take 1 (pollution) as an example. My data contains time series for how biodiversity and pollution change in each country, over time. I ran a linear model, lm(Biodiversity~Pollution), for each of 180 countries, and for the countries demonstrating a significant effect (158 countries), pulled out the coefficient of the gradient as a 'sensitivity score', representing how sensitive that country's biodiversity is, to pollution. I want to compare the countries and see whether they are different. I'm thinking about grouping the sensitivity scores (coefficients of gradient) into continents, then using an ANOVA to test whether the sensitivity scores (Gradients) are different between continents. Would the use of gradients in an ANOVA this way be viable? Upon looking online, I saw some other threads suggesting that instead of doing a model for each country, to do one model and include country as a dummy variable. Would this work for my situation?
