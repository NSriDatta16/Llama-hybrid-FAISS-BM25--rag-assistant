"Deep learning removes the need for feature engineering"?

I have seen it written in several papers and currently see it written in Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet that Deep learning removes the need for feature engineering What does this mean exactly? Does this apply to tabular data as well as perceptual data such as images?
