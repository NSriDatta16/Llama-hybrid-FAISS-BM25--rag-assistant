There is a paper that discusses a Bayesian factor analysis for mixed ordinal and continuous variables: Kevin M. Quinn. 2004. “Bayesian Factor Analysis for Mixed Ordinal and Continuous Responses.” Political Analysis. 12: 338-353. This is implemented in the MCMCpack package in R: MCMCmixfactanal() . Another option would be the generalized low rank model (GLRM) which is implemented in h2o. This is similar in spirit to PCA, but without the linearity assumption (and it also permits missing data).
