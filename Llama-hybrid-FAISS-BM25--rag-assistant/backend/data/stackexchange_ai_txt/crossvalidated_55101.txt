I like Zen's answer and want to add to it in order to clarify some misconceptions in the question. "Confidence" or "sample size" cannot be meaningfully applied to a posterior distribution . Only a likelihood can have a notion of "sample size". That's the motivation behind Zen's point that the confidence should be $a + b - 2$. In general, the only way to map the likelihood of an exponential family distribution into a confidence is to linearly transform its natural parameters (for the Beta distribution these are $a-1, b-1$) to the positive real line. (For example, a light that turns on when two heads are flipped, another light turns on when two tails are flipped. So, a single sample might induce a likelihood such that $a$ or $b$ goes up by more than 1.) To answer your question: do the whole Bayesian inference to arrive at the natural parameters of the induced likelihood ($\Delta a, \Delta b$ in your case), and then scale these to your desired "confidence" if it exceeds it. After scaling, you can combine your likelihood with your prior. To me, this scaling is meaningful: You're saying that the evidence you have saturates after a certain point. (I'm interested in this subject if anyone has any references.)
