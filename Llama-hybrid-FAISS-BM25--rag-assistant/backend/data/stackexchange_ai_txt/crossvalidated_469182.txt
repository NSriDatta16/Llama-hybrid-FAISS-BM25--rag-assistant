Which test to use for paired samples with different sizes and only 1 categorical variable?

I am testing 9 rooms for bacteria growth, and want to see affects of heat. Assume Blue Room is colder, Red room is warmer. I am not sure how to approach this because samples are too small (so can't assume normality) sample sizes differ even without groups The n for each room is how many times we swabbed each room, and we counted how many bacteria were on each swab. So if n=7, it means that we swabbed 7 times in room 1 Blue, with an average bacteria count in each one of 3.7. N=8 the second time, because we swabbed 8 times. However, I believe there is significance - the Blue rooms clearly see less change than the red rooms, I just need to prove this. I did some research but unfortunately an ANOVA or Wilcoxon paired test don't seem to help me here, as I want to show the categorical variable (Red/Blue) has a statistically significant effect. Any help is appreciated, and sorry if this question is trivial - I don't have a statistics ba
