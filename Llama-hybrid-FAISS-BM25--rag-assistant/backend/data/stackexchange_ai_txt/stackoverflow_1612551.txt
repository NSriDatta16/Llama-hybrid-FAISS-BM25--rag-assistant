Embedding the output of a server script inside another HTML page

I have a php script (generator.php) which generates certain HTML/XML/SVG depending on various conditions. I want to embed the output of this script in my homepage (home.php) eg. Let generator.php always generate an SVG document (complete with SVG NS and DTD). Now I want to embed this generated image in the output of home.php I have tried , and . None seem to work. Does anybody know how to accomplish this?
