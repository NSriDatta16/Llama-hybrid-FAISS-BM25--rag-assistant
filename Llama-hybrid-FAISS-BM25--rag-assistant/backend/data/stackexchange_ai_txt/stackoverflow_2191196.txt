Please pay attention to Hints and Warnings when you compile your apps. To ignore them is to ignore potential problems . You should be getting warning that "WideChar is reduced to byte char...". Therein lies the problem: the Key is no longer Unicode in your set operation! The warning advises you to use CharInSet ; you can also look at TCharacter (a special class with class functions to identify certain categories of characters). If neither of these suit your requirements, then use a string constant with all the valid characters, and use the Pos function to determine if the Key is present. Finally, you may rather want to consider excluding specific characters as opposed to trying to think of every specific character you want to include.
