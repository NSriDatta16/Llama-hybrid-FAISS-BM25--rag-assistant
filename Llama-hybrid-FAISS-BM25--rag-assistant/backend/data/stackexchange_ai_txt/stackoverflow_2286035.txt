Saving and retrieving inherited types with LINQtoSQL and Business Objects

I have an abstract EventBase class and some inherited event types, along with an Event class. Each event type has its own unique columns. In my data layer, I have a GetEvents method that simply does: from e in db.Events select new Event {...values...}; EventType is an enum which matches up to an EventTypes table I want GetEvents(EventType type) and GetEvent(int id, EventType type) to do something like.. from e in GetEvents() where e.TypeId == (int)type select new TypeSpecified {...values for Event + Type-specific fields...}; // Determine what type it is // Switch statement? Dictionary? I'm not sure a switch is the best idea, but I'm also not sure how to correctly employ a dictionary to map the data retrieval and object creation to a specific type. My second question involves saving the data - going from Business Object to L2S table - same question as above, basically I hope this makes sense :)
