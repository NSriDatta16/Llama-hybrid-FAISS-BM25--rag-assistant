Creating incremental reports using Azure Tables

I need to create incremental reports in the table storage. I need to be able to update the same records from several different worker role instances (different roles with several instances each). My reports consist mainly of values that I need to increment after I parse the raw data I initially stored. The optimistic solution I found is to use a retry mechanism: Try to update the record. If you get a 412 result code (you don't have the latest ETAG value), retry. This solution becomes less efficient and more costly the more users you have and the more data you need to update simultaneously (my case exactly). Another solution that comes to mind is to have only one instance of one worker role that can possibly update any given record. This is very problematic because this means that I will by-design create bottlenecks in my architecture, which is the opposite of the scale I want to reach with Azure. If anyone here has some best practices in mind for such a use case, I would love to hear it.
