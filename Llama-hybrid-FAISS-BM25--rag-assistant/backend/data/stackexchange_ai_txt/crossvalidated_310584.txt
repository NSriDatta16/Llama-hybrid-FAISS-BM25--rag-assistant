Why using offset for a Gamma (link=log) glm doesn't yield the same predicted average response as the average observed?

One of my analyst asked me why his Gamma/link=log glm with offsets was always overstating his observed data points. I was able to reproduce the behavior in R with intercept only glm using offsets. For some reason, when you use offsets with a Gamma/link=log your predictions are overstated. See this code : set.seed(12345) x Why am I getting a different value in the last chunk on [,2]. From the definition of the glm formula, it should be the same, no? Iâ€™ve debugged the glm.fit function and the code works fine, its not returning the expected result or what?
