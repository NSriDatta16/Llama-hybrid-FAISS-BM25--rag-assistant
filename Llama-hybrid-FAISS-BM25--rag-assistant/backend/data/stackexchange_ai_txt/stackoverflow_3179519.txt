Director/Lingo, making an application toggle between fullscreen and windowed?

I recently had a client contact me asking for an update to his project that I used to maintain/develop years ago. It was done using Macromedia Director (now Adobe Director) and Lingo. Since I haven't developed anything using these technology in such a long time I need some assistance. The majority of the changes are simple, but what has got me stumped is making the application be able to toggle between full-screen projector and windowed-mode. This is how it is organised: I have a stub projector, which is lightweight and ensures a quick start-time. The stub projector loads the main movie. ("@::Content:Main") This stub projector is published with in full-screen mode. Now, I can create a projector that is windowed and one that is full-screen mode by publishing separate executables. However what the client wants is the ability to switch this at runtime - is this even possible? I have found a few workarounds that kinda work (setting the display-rect and stage-rect to the desktop size) but introduce numerous compatibility issues. Any advice? Solutions? I am tempted to say that it isn't possible to switch at runtime and recommend that he publishes either a full-screen or a windowed version.
