The first thing to do with predictive models is to start simple, and then increase complexity. I don't know how blood pressure works exactly, but I can say that some columns have more variability than others, which require a different processing. Before making predictions with the different columns, you can start by making a decision tree model (or random forest) using the mean value of each column from the 120 000 records in order to see if you already have some patterns. Then, you can apply some data pre processing by detecting the correlated columns (ex: correlation heat map) : some uncorrelated columns could be remove to improve results and reduce processing time. Then you can use a longer sampling rate (ex: every second) using neural networks predictive models like GRU or LSTM to detect dynamics on your values.
