You may want to have a look at "Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks". The basic idea is to construct a neural network that forces the output to be positive. The integral of the output from that neural network is the final output that forms a monotonic function. The paper describes how to train such a neural network. That is to say how to get the derivatives for the parameters with the added integral. Here is the link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05164.pdf
