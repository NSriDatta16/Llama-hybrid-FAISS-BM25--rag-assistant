Ruby on Rails: what performance can I realistically aim for?

I've been building an application in Ruby on Rails 3, and I'm starting to worry about performance optimization. Now I hope that my question is not too subjective for this site, but I'm interested in facts, not a discussion, so here goes: While I'm trying to get my views to render faster, there is one thing I simply do not know: What should I aim for? Given a reasonably complex page, what load time is realistic? I simply don't have any reference. What I'm typically seeing for my application is something like this: Completed 200 OK in 397ms (Views: 341.1ms | ActiveRecord: 17.7ms) This is on my production server, running Apache/Passenger. I am the only one (!) making requests on that server, it's a root server (not virtual), running Ubuntu, AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+, 4 GB RAM That is, for most of my more complicated actions (not unusually complicated, just assume it's a paginated listing of 20 objects with 5 computed properties each or something) the ActiveRecord times are almost always fine ( 200 ms. Now, to my question: When I started using RoR my expectation (maybe unrealistic) was that for most consumer-oriented applications with average complexity (let's say something like Facebook, Twitter, etc. WITHOUT the millions of users) I would get My expectation was also that database requests would be the major bottleneck, since all the rest is just relatively simple computations without any real complexity. I thought that it might take 10ms to get all the objects from the database, and then maybe another 5 ms to run the controller code, build the view, etc. Since I've never been in charge of any production app, I don't know if this expectation was in any way realistic. So I would like somebody with experience point out to me what my realistic expectation should be. (e.g. "pretty much everything but really nasty stuff should render in 50 ms tops as long as you are the only one making requests") or ("actually 300 ms is not unusual for RoR applications, even if you're the only user") or ("Are you kidding? I get Again, I hope this is not too subjective, but I'm not really interested in an opinion of whether or not RoR is fast, I want facts from someone with more experience on what numbers are average and to be expected from production RoR applications. Otherwise I simply have no clue at what point I should stop optimizing and just accept that I'll never get 10 ms load times.
