Can structural equation modeling be used with only categorical variables?

I am interested in methods that will allow me to examine the relations between variables in a graphical manner. Structural Equation Modeling seems promising for my purposes. However, I only have categorical data and most of it is binary. Is there a version of Structural Equation Modeling for exclusively categorical variables? I know for Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is the analog for categorical data, so I'm looking for a similar analog for SEM that allows me to work exclusively with categorical data.
