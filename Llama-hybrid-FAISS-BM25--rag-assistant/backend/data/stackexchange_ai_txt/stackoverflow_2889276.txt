Google Chrome extension: Use Javascript inside webkit notifications?

I have been following the Google Chrome Extensions Developer's guide and have been able so far to create an extension with a browser action without popup that would trigger a webkit notification in HTML format. Fact is that this HTML file contains action buttons, links and javascript, but none of them seems to respond. Is this a by-design behavior or is there a way for embedding javascript/links/buttons in these webkit notifications? EDIT: Here are some new insights on the subject: Javascript Here is an HTML notification page that doesn't work: alert("hey"); content As a result, the notification is all blank ; the text "content" isn't displayed. But if I remove the "alert", the text "content" is displayed. I first thought that Javascript was blocking the page from rendering correctly, but I tried something else: document.write("content"); This javascript command is correctly executed and displays the text "content" . We can then assume that Javascript is enabled even in the webkit desktop notifications, but the "alert" function is disabled, and breaks the rendering of the notification page. Links Some links work, some don't. Here is a quick list of those I've tested so far: Link # => Doesn't work Link # => Doesn't work Link # => Doesn't work Link # => Works (new tab)
