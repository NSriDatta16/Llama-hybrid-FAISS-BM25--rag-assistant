Well, with PHP you could use $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . This string contains the browser, but also the OS. Example Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) With the "substr" function (which is faster) or an preg_match you can extract the OS from the string.
