Multi Value Dictionary?

Anyone know of a good implementation of a MultiValueDictionary ? Basically, I want something that allows multiple values per key. I want to be able to do something like dict.Add(key, val); And if the key doesn't already exist, it will add it, if it does, it will just add another value to that key. I'm just going to iterate over it, so I don't really care about the other retrieval methods.
