my rails ApplicationController is having a RoutingError

I am by no means a Ruby developer, but I code HAML for a ruby framework on my localhost. I had originally put a file called vidgirlBox2.flv file and called to it within the HAML, but converted the file to a swf called vidGirl_home.swf . This swf worked. Until I made a simple change to the orginal .fla, and overwrote the vidGirl_home.swf . It never worked again. I tried swfObject, Unobtrusive Flash Object, the bare minimum of embedding a swf, everything. Turns out, I get this message in my terminal when running my local server: ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/Users/daniellevine/Desktop/vidgirlBox2.flv" with {:method=>:get}): Rendering rescues/layout (not_found) As you can tell, its looking for an old file. I'm not calling this file in any of my haml. I am confused as to how this flv wrote itself into the ruby (this is what I assume at least) . This was my attempt at a workaround, but it seems that this code generates a rails compiler error. This could be just a simple naming convention error. Am I missing an quotation mark somewhere? My New Embed Code : - if Rails.env.development? = javascript_include_tag "swfobject" - else %script{:src => "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/swfobject/2.1/swfobject.js"} - id ||= "flash" - filename ||= "/images/vidGirl/vidGirl_home.swf" - width ||= 440 - height ||= 247 - background ||= "#ffffff" - version ||= 9 - base ||= '{base: "."}' %div{ :id => id } %strong You need to upgrade your Flash Player = javascript_tag "swfobject.embedSWF('/images/vidGirl/vidGirl_home.swf', 'vidGirl_home', '440', '247', '9.0.0', '/javascripts/swfobject/expressInstall.swf', {}, '/public/', {});" Anyone know what might have happened? or better yet, how to fix this? Thank you!!
