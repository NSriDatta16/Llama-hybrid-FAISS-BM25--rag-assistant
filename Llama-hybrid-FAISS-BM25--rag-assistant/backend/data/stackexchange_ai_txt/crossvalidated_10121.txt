How to generate random correlation matrix that has approximately normally distributed off-diagonal entries with given standard deviation?

I would like to generate a random correlation matrix such that the distribution of its off-diagonal elements looks approximately like normal. How can I do it? The motivation is this. For a set of $n$ time series data, the correlation distribution often looks quite close to normal. I would like to generate many "normal" correlation matrices to represent the general situation and use them to calculate risk number. I know one method, but the resulting standard deviation (of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements) is too small for my purpose: generate $n$ uniform or normal random rows of a matrix $\mathbf X$, standardize the rows (subtract the mean, divide by standard deviation), then the sample correlation matrix $\frac{1}{n-1}\mathbf X \mathbf X^\top$ has normally distributed off-diagonal entries [ Update after comments: standard deviation will be $\sim n^{-1/2}$]. Can anyone suggest a better method with which I can control the standard deviation?
