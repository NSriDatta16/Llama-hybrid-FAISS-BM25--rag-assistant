Hello I don't know about scientific paper. But I know that to compare quality of ML algorithms one against another you need to establish a metric : Make it a square mean error or anything else, a final number that can tell you if your algorithm is working as expected. On a side note : Every algorithm, if used in their correct purpose, is highly parameters dependent. So I'm not sure what you're referring to with "machine learning approaches that are heavily dependent on the parameters"
