In vanilla MySQL , there is no easy way to do it. You can install OQGRAPH (it's a plugin storage engine designed to store the graphs), create a graph table in it and issue a query like this: SELECT * FROM oqtable WHERE latch = 1 AND origid = 1 AND destid = 3 which will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between 1 and 3 .
