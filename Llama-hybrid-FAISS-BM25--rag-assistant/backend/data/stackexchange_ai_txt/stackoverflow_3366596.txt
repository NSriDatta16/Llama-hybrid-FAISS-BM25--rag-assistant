It is because the compiler uses padding to bring each element into word alignment that is specific to the architecture for which you are compiling. It can be for one of several reasons but usually: Because some CPU's simply cannot read a long or long long multi-byte value when it isn't on an address multiple of its own size. Because CPU's that can read off-aligned data may do it much slower than aligned. You can often force it off with a compiler-specific directive or pragma. When you do this, the compiler will generate relatively inefficient code to access the off-aligned data using multiple read/write operations.
