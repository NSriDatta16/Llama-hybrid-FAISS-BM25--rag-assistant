What cause $X\beta$ shift from Stochastic Gradient Descent Comparing to Logistic Regression?

I am experimenting with stochastic gradient descent and observing very strange output. In a toy problem, the $X\beta$ for stochastic gradient descent is always larger than $0$, which will be predicting $1$ all the time. But the shape is similar to glm . What could be wrong? My code: library(sgd) set.seed(0) d=ggplot2::diamonds d$price=ifelse(d$price>2500,1,0) noise_idx=sample(nrow(d),nrow(d)/5) d$price[noise_idx]= ifelse(d$price[noise_idx]==1,0,1) glm.fit=glm(price~.-carat,d,family=binomial) sgd.fit
