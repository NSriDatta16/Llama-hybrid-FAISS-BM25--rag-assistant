Associating a probability to disease propagation in regions of a map

I am trying to model disease propagation. I am considering a map separated into regions. One region is infected. There is data over time, with the number of people travelling into and out of the infected region and which region they travel to (a table of transport of individuals over the whole map). This is an O-D matrix ( wiki description ). There is also some data about the prevalence of this disease in the region. The questions I would like to ask are: What are some classical options for modelling disease propagation to different regions with this spatial data which will produce easy to interpret probabilities? (eg. SIS/SIR models which require simulations that I can just average over, or a time series model such as ARM with some measured parameters?) What specifics of the disease must I know before hand? (eg. parameters of infection in different circumstances?) What is the common name for these types of applications in research? (eg. temporal-spatial disease modelling? etc.)
