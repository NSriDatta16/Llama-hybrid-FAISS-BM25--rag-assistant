Are you essentially seeing if subjects in group A, group B, and group C flip heads on a coin more often? If so, how many times does each subject flip the coin? (Coin flipping is whatever task can be successful or unsuccessful.) This sounds lIke a job for a logistic regression with categorical predictors, as proportions often get tested by testing the raw success/failure events, not proportions like 0.7. This is basically ANOVA for a binary outcome. (Since I posted this as a comment, I learned that my favorite way of testing this goes by the name G-test.)
