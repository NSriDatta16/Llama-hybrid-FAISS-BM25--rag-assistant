EJB's are framework constructs ( see here for a high level explanation ). You can use them in lots of situations, to separate concerns like business logic from other concerns like data storage. A high-profile competitor to EJB's (for contrast) is the Spring framework. In answer to your question, no, they are not REQUIRED for websites and web application development, though they are a way to do it. Other methods of web development in Java are Servlets , JSP . Servlets are by far the simplest to code. Its feature limited, but for simple web-apps it's plenty.
