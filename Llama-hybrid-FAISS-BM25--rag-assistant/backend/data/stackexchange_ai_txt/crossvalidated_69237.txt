Flexible and inflexible models in machine learning

I came across a simple question on comparing flexible models (i.e. splines) vs. inflexible models (e.g. linear regression) under different scenarios. The question is: In general, do we expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to perform better or worse than an inflexible method when: The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations $n$ is small? The variance of the error terms, i.e. $Ïƒ^2 = \text{Var}(e)$, is extremely high? I think for (1), when $n$ is small, inflexible models are better (not sure). For (2), I don't know which model is (relatively) better.
