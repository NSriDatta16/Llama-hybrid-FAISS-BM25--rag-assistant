php web image search

I want to do a picture search engine. I use simple_html_dom and preg_match_all to get all the images, then use getimagesize to get all the image sizes. Here is one part of my code. find('img') as $element) { if( preg_match('#^http:\/\/(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)$#i',$element->src)){ $image = $element->src; //$arr = getimagesize($image); //get image width and height //$imagesize = $arr[0] * $arr[1]; echo $image.' '; } } ?> First question, how to add a judgement so that I can echo the biggest size image? (only one image). Second question, I can get the image real url in these two possibilities, first where image is as a 'http' began, second where image is as a / began. But how to get the image real url in the situation where image is as a './' or ../ or ../../ began? it is difficulty for me to judge how many ../ in a image, then cut the site url to complement a image real url? Thanks.
