For this sort of password, I tend to use a system that's likely to generate more easily "used" passwords. Short, often made up of pronouncable fragments and a few numbers, and with no intercharacter ambiguity (is that a 0 or an O? A 1 or an I?). Something like string[] words = { 'bur', 'ler', 'meh', 'ree' }; string word = ""; Random rnd = new Random(); for (i = 0; i (Typed right into the browser, so use only as guidelines. Also, add more words).
