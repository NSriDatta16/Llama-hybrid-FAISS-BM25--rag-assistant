A neural network does not actually know / understand like humans do. A neural network is nothing but a fancy name for application of Non-linearities to a signal. That being said, this knowing simply comes from training the Neural Network over thousands/millions of examples. This training gradually keeps optimizing the weights and biases to minimize the loss function, which in this case leads to combination of the right parts of the images. This must sound dull, but this is what neural networks do.
