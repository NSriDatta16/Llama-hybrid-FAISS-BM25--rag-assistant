Using R and function `convolve` to find $P(Y < 0.44)$

I have just started learning R and am studying some probability and statistics examples. I have the following code snippet, which produces a vector x of length 100000 and sample means of $\text{Unif}(−3, 3)$ with a random sample of size 100: samplemean I determined the sample average and sample variance of x as follows: (mean(x)) #sample mean (var(x)) #sample variance Let mux and sig2x be the expected value and variance, respectively, of a $\text{Unif}(−3,3)$ random variable. I'm trying to use the central limit theorem to calculate the probability that the sample average is less than 0.44, which is given by $P(Y where $Y$ is a $\text{N}(\text{`mux`}, \text{`sig2x`}/100)$ random variable. I tried to use the function convolve to achieve this, but this is my first time using it, so I really don't know what I'm doing here: pX2fold Despite my best efforts, none of this seems correct. I would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time to explain my errors and show me how to do this.
