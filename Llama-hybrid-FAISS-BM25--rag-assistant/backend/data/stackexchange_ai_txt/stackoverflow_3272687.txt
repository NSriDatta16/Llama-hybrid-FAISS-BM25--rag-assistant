Have you tried benchmarking the sort of activities you're likely to perform on the large strings using MongoDB? I wouldn't write if off without performing some tests beforehand - better to try it out than to go off and implement your own storage strategy that results in a disconnect between your data sources. What's the gist of your C++ project? Are you really going to need bleeding edge performance? Write now, optimize later is the best strategy IMHO - you can waste a lot of time writing 'optimal code' that has little or no bearing on the performance of the application as the end of the day.
