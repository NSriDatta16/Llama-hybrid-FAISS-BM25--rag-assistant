Sounds like you want to feed your chessboard to a neural network trained to recognize the configuration. This is very similar to the classic examples of image classification, with the only complication being that you don't know exactly where your configuration thingy will appear in the grid, unless you're always considering the whole grid - in that case a classic 2 layers network should work. HTM neural networks implementations solve the offset problem out-of-the-box. You can find plenty of ready-to-use implementations starting from here . Obviously you'll have to tweak the heck out of the implementations you'll find but you should be able to achieve exactly what you're asking for to my understanding. If you want to further investigate this route the Numenta forum will be a good starting point.
