Sensitivity analysis for modeled time series

I have very basic knowledge of stats so my question may sound very simplistic. I have a large time series of measured data and have calibrated a model with five parameters to make predictions. I would like to test the sensitivity of my model but I am not sure what statistical method to use. I've been reading about sensitivity analysis, however the output of my model is a time series with fluctuations and a simple sensitivity analysis does not seem appropriate since it looks at individual output points and not the entire series. Any recommendations on methods or approaches?
