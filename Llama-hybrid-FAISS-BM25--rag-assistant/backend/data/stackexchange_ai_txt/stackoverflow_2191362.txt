ForEach isn't part of LINQ - it's part of the List API and has been since .NET 2.0. The reason it's not part of LINQ is that it's a naturally side-effecting method... and LINQ doesn't encourage side-effects. Using Sum is the right solution here, but you don't need to create a list first: return m_items.Sum(x => x.GetIncrement());
