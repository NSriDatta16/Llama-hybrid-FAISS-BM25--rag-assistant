Logistic regression: Is there a significant difference for probability p between groups of Bernoulli random variables?

Let $S_{I+1} = \{1,2,\cdots,I\}$. And assume that there are exactly $J$ observations $(x_j,s_j) \in \mathbb{R} \times S_{I+1}$ for each integer $j$ such that $1 \leq j \leq J$. For each $i \in S_{I+1}$, I create Bernoulli distributed random variables $Y_{i_1}$,$Y_{i_2}, \cdots, Y_{i_J}$ such that $Y_{i_j} = 1$ if $s_j \leq i$ and $Y_{i_j} = 0$ otherwise. I proceed to do logistic regression on each of the $I$ groups using: $$P(Y_{i_j} = 1 | x_j) = \frac{\exp(\beta_{i_0} + \beta_{i_1} x_j)}{1 + \exp(\beta_{i_0} + \beta_{i_1} x_j)} \qquad \text{for each $i \in S_{I+1}$.}$$ Thus I complete exactly one logistic regression for each $i \in S_{I+1}$. Now fix $p, \alpha \in (0,1)$. How can I construct a $100(1- \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $x_{p_i}$ such that $P(Y_{i_j} = 1 | x_{p_i}) = p$ for each $i \in S_{I+1}$? The purpose is that I want to test whether there is statistically significant difference between $x_{p_i}$-values. I suppose I need to use maximum likelihood estimation, but I am not sure where to begin.
