Averaging 3 integers

My assignment is to fix the code. I have my edited code below and the original code below that. I figure I still have a few errors in here. My error checking doesnt seem to work, and I am not sure if my getchar() function is written or working properly. Please assume I know nothing becasue that is fairly accurate. The code compiles, but the answer is always 2. I am about 4 hours into this piece of code with 3 more to work after this. My code #include double get_number(double num); main () { double n1,n2,n3; double average; printf("\nCompute the average of 3 integers\n"); printf("--------------------------------\n"); n1 = get_number(1); n2 = get_number(2); n3 = get_number(3); average = (n1 + n2 + n3)/3; printf("The average is %0.2f\n",average); } double get_number(double num) { double value = 0; char c; int i; printf("Please input number %d: ", num); while (c = getchar != '\n') { if ( (c>9) || (c Original code #include main () { double n1,n2,n3; double average; printf("\nCompute the average of 3 integers\n"); printf("--------------------------------\n"); n1 = get_number(1); n2 = get_number(2); n3 = get_number(3); average = (n1 + n2 + n3)/3; printf("The average is %0.2f\n",average); } double get_number(int num) { double value = 0; char c; printf("Please input number %d: ", num); while (c = getchar() != '\n') { if ( (c =0) ) { printf("Incorrect character entered as a number - %c\n",c); exit(-1); } else { value = 10*value + c - '0'; } } return(value); }
