From my understanding solutions such as MonoTouch are not worth the effort I've just voted to close this on the grounds of it being subjective and argumentative... ... but while it's still open ... In my experience, MonoTouch offers an excellent solution: if you want to leverage a single code base and existing skills if you want to take advantage of CLR memory management if you can cope with the increased download size if you don't need to link with existing Obj-C libraries (you can link to these in MT, but in my experience it's not always a straight-forward process to do so) if you can budget for the MonoTouch license fee For XNA in MonoTouch, see http://monogame.codeplex.com/ (latest now on GitHub) For general iphone getting started advice, try: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/332039/getting-started-with-iphone-development
