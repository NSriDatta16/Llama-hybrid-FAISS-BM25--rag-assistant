Magic squares are really a system of (simple) simultaneous equations. You solve those by converting into a matrix and using Gaussian elimination , which is brute force but reasonably elegant at the same time. If the solution is not unique, you'll at least a reduced set of constraints on what the solution can be, which should make doing the solution much simpler.
