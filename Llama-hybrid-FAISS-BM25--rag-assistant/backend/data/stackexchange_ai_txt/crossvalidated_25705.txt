Advanced Excel graphs

I should not be here, I am a designer by trade and all these numbers scare me. I am attempting to help someone display their information; they sent me an excel spreadsheet and asked me to make graphs out of certain information. Unfortunately the spreadsheet contains ~13,000 rows and 32 columns, and I need to find out how to group them so I have all 0-25 values in one bar, 26-35 in another, etc. I do not know how to even begin to calculate this information or organize it (other than by hand) can someone point me in the right direction as to what I need to do?
