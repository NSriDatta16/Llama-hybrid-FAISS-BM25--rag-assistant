There is probably a faster way but you could regex out punctuation like !?-./\@#$%^&*, then explode the two paragraphs into an array, and then try array_intersect() on both arrays. Anything in array 2 that is in array 1 should come back as a match. http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-intersect.php Theoretically you should receive back an array of matching words. From there, ranking is up to you and how you chose to do it.
