Bind Infragistics UltraWebGrid with Hierachical view to collection of objects

I have a list of entities that i want to bind to my UltraWebGrid. The Class definition of the entity has the following structure public class Parent { public Guid Id { get; set; } public String Name { get; set; } public IList Children { get; private set; } } public class Child { public Guid Id { get; set; } public Guid ParentId { get; set; } public String ChildName { get; set; } } I want the bind the Parent to the first band of my ultraWebGrid and the Children to the second band. Can anyone tell me if this is possible without converting the object to datasets. All the infragistics examples use DataSets instead of entitylists.
