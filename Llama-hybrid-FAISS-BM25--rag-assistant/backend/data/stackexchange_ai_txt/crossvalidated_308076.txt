What’s the applied utility of inverting ARMA processes?

I’m taking a first graduate course on Time Series Econometrics and this question regarding ARMA processes has come to my mind. I see that the ability to represent AR processes as MA or the converse has theoretical advantages when trying to establish some results and this holds true even with ARMA models. However, from the applied econometrician point of view, why one would care about inverting a process and getting a representation that has an infinite number of lags?
