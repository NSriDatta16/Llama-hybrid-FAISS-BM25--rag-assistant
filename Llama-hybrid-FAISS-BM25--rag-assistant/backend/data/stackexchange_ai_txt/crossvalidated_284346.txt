I recommend a mixed effect model, with accuracy as the outcome. You can enter database and run as random effects, and model (A or B) as a fixed effect. This will tell you whether there is any significant difference in accuracy between models A and B and, if so, which model has higher accuracy. Note that database and run need to be entered as factors (categorical variables), not numeric variables (continuous). In R: # make the dataframe mydata Run the model: library(lme4) m1 Note: Because accuracy is bounded at 0 and 1 (or 0 and 100, if you express it as percent), technically you may want to use a link function that will take that into account, for example, logistic regression. Generalized models with random effects can be a pain to estimate, though, so you may prefer to treat accuracy as a regular continuous outcome. By eyeballing your data, my guess is that you'll be okay with a regular mixed effects model, without using a logistic link function --- your accuracy scores are not clustered too closely to either bound, so they're probably more or less normally distributed, or at least closely enough that you'll get sensible estimates from your model.
