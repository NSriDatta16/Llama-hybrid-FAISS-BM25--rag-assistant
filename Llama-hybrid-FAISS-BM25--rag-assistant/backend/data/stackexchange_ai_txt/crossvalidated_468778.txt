Contradictory results between Breusch-Pagan test and Goldfeld-Quandt test in Python

I am reading Python regression diagnostic for statsmodel in Python . Under the heteroskedasticity tests, they introduced two test: the Breusch-Pagan test and the Goldfeld-Quandt test. From my understanding, the null hypothesis test of both tests asserts that heteroskedasticity does not exist. However, in the webpage, they have p-value 0.08794028782673029 and 0.3820295068692507 respectively. This means that the Breusch-Pagan test asserts heteroskedasticity exists whereas the Goldfeld-Quandt test asserts that heteroskedasticity exists. What is happening here? Why would they give contradictory results?
