From the ILE RPG Programmer's Reference Guide: Storage is implicitly freed when the activation group ends. Setting LR on will not free any heap storage allocated by the module, but any pointers to heap storage will be lost. If your RPG program is in its own activation group, then the memory will be freed when the program ends. Of course, when your job ends, so does your activation group. So ending the job will always clean up any memory allocated.
