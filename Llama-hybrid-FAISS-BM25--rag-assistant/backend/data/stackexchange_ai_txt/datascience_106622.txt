Like mentioned by Brian Spiering, this is a probability-based problem and best tackled with Bayes. When considering Machine Learning, which is a bit of a buzz term these days, you need to really consider the problem. Are you looking to study features of the data (Feature Analysis) or are you looking to make a prediction for the next person to be added to the list (Prediction)? Machine learning can achieve both of these but can be a lot of work if you're just looking to study the features. Software like STATA, SPSS, etc, can handle the size of data you mentioned and can be a lot more straightforward when you just want to understand the data and gain insights. To provide a more meaningful response, it would be great to get a detailed picture of the other variables mentioned, as these variables could also have a large impact on the model and use case selected.
