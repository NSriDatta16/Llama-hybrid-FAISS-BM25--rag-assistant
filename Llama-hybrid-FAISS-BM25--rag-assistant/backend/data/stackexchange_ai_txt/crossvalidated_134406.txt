Yes, there is - "perceptron" refers to a particular supervised learning model, which was outlined by Rosenblatt in 1957. The perceptron is a particular type of neural network, and is in fact historically important as one of the types of neural network developed. There are other types of neural network which were developed after the perceptron, and the diversity of neural networks continues to grow (especially given how cutting-edge and fashionable deep learning is these days).
