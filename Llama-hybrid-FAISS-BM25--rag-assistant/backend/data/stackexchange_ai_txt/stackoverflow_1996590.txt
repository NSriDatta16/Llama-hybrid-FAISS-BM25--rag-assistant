This is possible but the query is going to come out to be very complicated. If possible, perhaps you could reorganize your schema to encode some more information into it. For instance, rather than team1 and team2 , you could have winning_team and losing_team ; similiarly, using winning_score and losing_score you wouldn't have to check which score corresponded with which team. Then you could do a GROUP BY on losing_team to get all the wins for a particular team against each other team, and one on winning_team to get the losses (and avoid using score at all in this particular query).
