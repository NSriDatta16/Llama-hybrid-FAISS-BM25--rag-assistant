Pre PhD preparation: What should I focus on?

I am going to start my PhD in Statistics next fall and I am currently studying some math (in part because I don't want to stay too much time without studying something and in part to be sure that I won't struggle with my courses in the first semesters). I covered almost all Stephen Abbott "Understanding Analysis" and then I moved forward to "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" by Walter Rudin and "measures integrals and martingales" by â€ŽSchilling. The fact is that besides Abbott's book the others are pretty big books, with hundred of pages and covering a wide sprectrum of topics and I am not really sure which chapters in particular I should study. For those who have some experience with these (or similar) books, could you give me some brief idea on which topic I should put more attention? Thanks in advance.
