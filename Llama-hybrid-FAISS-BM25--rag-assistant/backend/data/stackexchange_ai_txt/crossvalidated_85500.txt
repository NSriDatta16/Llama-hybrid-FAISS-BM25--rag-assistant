If using C++ is a must, you may take a look at Shogun . As I understand, it could be a NN, but any method that get the job done will do as well. Shogun focuses on kernel methods (SVM and GP). As for genetic algorithms: I have no experience whatsoever with that optimization technique, but mostly because I have not come across it in the literature. It seems to me that not many people in the Machine Learning community uses it.
