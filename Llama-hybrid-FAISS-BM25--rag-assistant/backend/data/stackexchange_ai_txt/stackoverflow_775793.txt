WPF bind control size

I have a StackPanel with a list of custom user controlls that I would like to resize. I would like the user to be able to drag a slider and scale the control size up and down. Is there a way to bind the control width to a slider value? Something similar to: Is this possible? Or should I just iterate through the controls and manually set the size whenever the slider value changes?
