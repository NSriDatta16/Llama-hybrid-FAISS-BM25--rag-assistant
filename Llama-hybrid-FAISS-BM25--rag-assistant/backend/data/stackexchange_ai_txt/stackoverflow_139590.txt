I wholeheartedly agree with the comments about GANTT charts not suiting agile development - where we don't have a clear understanding of the details of the implementation at the outset. On the other hand, I can't help but fondly remember a painful weekend I spent putting together a GANTT chart for a project I was managing where the technology and requirements were very well-understood and the schedule was critical. We had the entrance wall to our cubicle section partially covered with this GANTT chart (5 A4 pages wide), and having it was extremely useful to making sure we were working to the critical path - getting the things done that needed to be done right now - and also made it possible for me to report to the project board with detailed reports on how the project is progressing against the schedule. The usefulness of GANTT charts definitely depends on the context, but I'd say that if you know your requirements, and particularly if you have a lot of importance attached to your schedule, they can be incredibly useful.
