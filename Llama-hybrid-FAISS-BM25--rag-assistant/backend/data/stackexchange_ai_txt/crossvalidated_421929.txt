In a logit model, what does a Estimate value = 0 (zero) mean? Is it a useless variable?

As an output of a logistic regression analysis I got an Estimate value of 0 (zero). Does this mean that the variable is useless in the model? Or what? logit(P) = log(P / (1 - P)) = 13.458 - 0 Variable A - 0.106 Variable B - 0.004 variable C + 0.008 Variable D, where P is Pr(y=1|x).
