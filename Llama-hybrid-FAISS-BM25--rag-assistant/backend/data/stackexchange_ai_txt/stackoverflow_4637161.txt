Detecting hits in UIScrollView while still letting it do it's thing

Is there a simple way to detect if someone touched a UIScrollView without having to disable user interactions?. I know this has been answered a few times before, but every answer I find is somebody wanting to detect hits in an image. I don't have an image. What I do have is a scroll view with a number of text fields embedded in it. They used to be inside a UIControl, from which I could detect a touchDown and call resignFirstResponder on all my textfields (for when the keyboard is up). But when they are in a UIScrollView, I can't seem to find a simple way to do this. I don't really want to have to write code to do the scrolling myself, which is what I assume I have to do if I disable user interactions and grab the touchesBegan message. But I may be wrong. I'm still a little new at this, but this is the first time I haven't been able to figure out the answer by reading the code doc and googling ... Thanks for any help, J
