Good method to do text with links in gettext?

I'm currently doing internationalization with gettext using PHP. I was wondering if there were any good methods for this example: By using this website, you accept the /tos/">Terms of Use . For en_US, this sentence would follow such a format. However, in another language, the link "Terms of Use" could be at the beginning of the sentence. Is there an elegant way to do this? Thanks for your time.
