I develop mostly applications that have to do with decision analysis and financial forecasting. In that frame, math is a key component of most of my development work. In no particular order, on top of my head: Run simulation of the possible outcomes of a project, generate cumulative distributions and analyze the distribution (probability, statistics, simulation) Compute the optimal allocation of supply to demand over time on a market (algebra, optimization) Model the prescription decision physicians make, based on an attribute model and the results of a survey, to determine adoption of new products (algebra, micro-economics) Model the evolution of patients through a disease (graphs, markov chains) In general, I am using a small subset of what I learnt in math / quantitative methods. Usually straightforward algebra, with the occasional probability usage, is sufficient - especially if your application is mostly about record-handling... On the other hand, I found that knowing a wide array of mathematical techniques or ideas help you think better about problems, see connections, similarities and dissimilarities, or know better what to look for.
