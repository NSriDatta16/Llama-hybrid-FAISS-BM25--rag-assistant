rails smart collection

What are rails smart collections? If I am trying to build a view that presents most popular articles, top 10 products, recent comments (i.e a snapshot of recent updates to a variety of models in one view), would I be using a smart collection? Would I be updating it via something like delayed job? Use some sort of fragment caching? What's the best way of doing this? Thanks
