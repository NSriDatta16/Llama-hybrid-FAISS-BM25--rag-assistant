Ruby on Rails or PHP... Somehow uncertain

I've been thinking about this a long time now but I want to hear your opinion because I always receive the best answers here. So any advance... thank you guys. Right now I have to make this decision: Shift a prototype webservice to production quality. Choose either Ruby or PHP... (Background: A friend of mine is joining the project and prefers rails) I've already played around a bit with RoR (only basic stuff) but I am really disappointed about the documentation of Rails and Ruby. In relation to PHP I find only fragments or hard-to-use references. At the end I am a bit scared. I don't want to waste my time realizing that I am not capable of doing s.th in Ruby what I could with PHP. Maybe only because I am too stupid and don't find a proper explanation ;-) Did anyone experience this shift and can tell me how easy/hard it was to switch from PHP to Ruby? E.G. would you recommend programming it in PHP and using MVC as a base pattern? Thanks for your opinion!!!
