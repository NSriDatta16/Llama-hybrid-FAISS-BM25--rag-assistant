How to permanently adding directories to the GCC include search path?

I'm running OSX 10.6.6. I have installed Apples GCC- version 4.2.1. I'm writing myself a nice little library- things for debugging, data storage algorithms, and the like. I've stored all the headers and .c files in a nice little folder called 'mylib' in my C folder. I'd like to add that folder to the GCC search path, so that I can type, say, /* ... */ #include /* ... */ and have it work perfectly. How can I either add /Users/Henry/coding_stuff/c/include/mylib to the GCC search path, or have a reference to the folder in /usr/include? I'd like to not have to replace /usr/include/mylib with the one in my C folder every time I make a trivial change. So, how can it be done?
