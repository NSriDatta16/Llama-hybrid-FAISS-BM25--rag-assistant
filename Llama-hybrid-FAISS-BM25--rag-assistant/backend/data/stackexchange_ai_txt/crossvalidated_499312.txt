Probability of doing a specific Path in a Markov Chain

My problem is the following: I have this graph, representing a Markov Chain: For example, if I am in state 1, the probability of going in state 2 or 4 is $\frac{1}{2}$ . So I'm saying that the probability of going in one specific state is uniform. Now, let's say that in state 2 there is a mouse and in state 5 there is cheese. Let's also say that in state 4 there is a cat. What is the probability that the mouse meet the cat first rather than the cheese? I know that this problem involves using the Markov Property (the future is based only on the present and not on the past), but I don't know how to step forward. Thank you
