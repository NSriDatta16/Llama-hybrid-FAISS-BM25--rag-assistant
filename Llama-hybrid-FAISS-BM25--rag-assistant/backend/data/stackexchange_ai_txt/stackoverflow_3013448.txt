Puzzled with nib files

I know nib files are serialized objects and they have owner, outlets to make connections. Using XCode Navigation window template I created application, which in its order created 2 nib files - MainWindow and SecondView. I can't understand how MainWindow is referring to SecondView, there is no connection between those two as far as I can see. SecondView's owner is UIViewController and in MainWindow there is a navigation tab which is also UIViewController. But how they are connected in IB I can't understand... Also I don't understand who is instanciating MainWindow's owner object and where that object is being kept, where is the variable which is UIApplication myApp = [[UIApplication alloc] init] . This one is self-answered: UIApplicationMain and to have the instance variable I need to create outlet somewhere. If I create 10 nib files with UIViewController owner, who will trigger their deserialization? If some class is nib file's owner, what is the essential responsibilities of that class? Is it deserializing nib file into memory? Sorry for unorganized questions, I've been reading numerous articles and docs about nib files, but it is still confusing.
