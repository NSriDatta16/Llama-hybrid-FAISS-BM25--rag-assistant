Coding an interaction between a nominal and a continuous predictor for logistic regression in MATLAB

So our data is structured as follows: We have $M$ participants, each participant can be categorized into 3 groups ( G $\in {A,B,C}$), and for each participant we have $N$ samples of a continuous variable. And we are trying to predict values that are either 0 or 1. How would we use matlab to test for an interaction between the continuous variable and the categorical variable in predicting these values?
