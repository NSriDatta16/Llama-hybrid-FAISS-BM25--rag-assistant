I just noticed that the same question has been posted on Stackoverflow and Cross Validated. The first part of my answer is on Stackoverflow. Since your follow up questions (and most of the original question) have very little to do with actual coding problems I will answer the rest here on Cross Validated. For additional clarity it would help if you update your question here to mirror Stackoverflow . Part 1: Question and reply Is here on Stackoverflow . Part 2: Follow up questions However I cannot figure out where coefficients such as mu, delta, etc. from my example correspond to which matrix element.. The main problem you are facing is that the model from your description and the model you employed in R are not the same. If you compare the model for the mGJR function (see Schmidbauer & Roesch (2008), P. 5 ) with what you uploaded, you will see a difference. I'm not familiar with the specification you are trying to replicate. The mGJR or baqGARCH from the mgarchBEKK package in R , however, is very similar to a BEKK-GARCH model + a form of leverage effect for bivariate timeseries. This means you face the same problems you have with BEKK models, such as the following taken from Multivariate Time Series Analysis: With R and Financial Applications : [...] limited experience indicates that some of the parameter estimates of a BEKK(1,1) model are statistically insignificant at the traditional 5% level. Yet there exists no simple direct link between the parameters in $A_1$ and $B_1$ and the components of a volatility matrix because the volatility matrix is a nonlinear function of elements of $A_1$ and $B_1$. Ruey S. Tsay (2014), P. 420. Back to the baqGARCH. $A$ stands for the "ARCH"-term, $B$ stands for the "GARCH"-term and $\Gamma$ (Gamma) stands for the leverage effect. $\Gamma$ is multiplied with the weighting function $S_w$, which in turn depends on $w$ and the innovations (or returns) in your time series. For more on the interpretation of the ARCH-term and GARCH-term look for more information regarding multivariate BEKK-GARCH publications (there are plenty). The same applies to the baqGARCH. The construction of $S_w$ and $w$ is described in above mentioned publication by Schmidbauer & Roesch. It appears that the "normal" fit means negative returns in series 1 & 2 lead to the highest weighting of the leverage effect. Depending on the series (and the result for the fitted $w$) this could also change. The results you got $w=-1.102507$ could mean that positive returns in series 2 and negative returns in series 1 lead to the highest leverage effect (in fact I've experimented with that model before and exactly that seems to be the case for negative $w$ values). I understand it as follows: As a rule of thumb you could say significant diagonal coefficients mean significant ARCH/GARCH/Leverage from the time series innovations on itself. Significant off-diagonal elements mean significant ARCH/GARCH/Leverage spillover between the fitted series 1 & 2. I'm not sure if there is an exact mapping of the baqGARCH from the mGJR function to the parameters you posted. You would need to get a better understanding of both models. Also my example does not seem to show the e1*e2 variable while the non-diagonal elements seems to show the coefficients for such variable As I understand it, $e_1$ and $e_2$ stand for the innovations (returns) in your time series.
