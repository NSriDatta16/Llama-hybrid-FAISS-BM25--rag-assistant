That's just one advantage of only using variable values for any styling like em or even better ex ... With them you'd just have to adjust your basic font-size a few px s higher and boom; everything's got bigger. Still, to your question: Depends on how many fix values you used, the more, the longer it will take to adjust it to be "bigger". But for the future I really encourage you to use variable sizes for almost anything as there is no disadvantage in it and it makes your website 100% resizable.
