Automated login and password storage

I wrote a simple PHP script to log into my mobile phone provider's website, check my balance, and send me an email if it's too low. I put the script on a distant server. It seems that I have to store my password as plaintext in the script to be able to send it to the login page. However, I am a little bit reluctant to do this... $user="foo"; $password="blah"; Is there a more secure way?
