Methods of sharing class instances between processes

I have written a C++ class that I need to share an instance of between at least two windows processes. What are the various ways to do this? Initially I looked into #pragma data_seg only to be disappointed when I realised that it will not work on classes or with anything that allocates on the heap. The instance of the class must be accessible via a dll because existing, complete applications already use this dll.
