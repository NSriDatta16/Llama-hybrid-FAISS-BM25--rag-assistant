why does this touchesBegan method code get trigger in my UITableView?

Why does the touchesBegan method code get trigger in my UITableView? Background: I have a UITableView within a UINavigationController. In the UITableView I have custom cells based on subclassing UITableViewCell. I current don't have a selectRowAtIndexPath method in my UITableView. Some aspects of the answer that would be good to cover off would include: why it doesn't work obviously in terms of getting it to work, how does get one ensure that the correct touch (single-tap) detection will not prevent the other scenarios to work like: selecting a table row, scrolling the tableview contents up and down etc. should the simulator be able to pick up touches etc, or are there cases here where you need the physical device Code: @interface AppointmentListController : UITableViewController . . . @implementation AppointmentListController . . . - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; timeStampStart = event.timestamp; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSTimeInterval timeStampEnd = event.timestamp; NSTimeInterval touchDuration = timeStampEnd - timeStampStart; if(touchDuration > 0.2) [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; else DLog(@" - TOUCH EVENT OCCURS"); [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; }
