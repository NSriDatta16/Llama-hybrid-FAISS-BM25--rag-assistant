The UAT says that a suitable neural network can represent any approximate continuous function, essentially taking an input, passing it through a network of particular weights, and mapping it to an output. That says nothing about how the particular weights on that network are determined, which is what NFL deals with. Since the neural net can represent a huge range of functions, we need an algorithm to learn the weights on the network that will get it to do what we want. Depending on the function we want the neural network to represent, some algorithms will find the appropriate weights quickly and some will not. No algorithm will outperform any other if we average performance over all possible mappings from input to output. In short, UAT addresses what kinds of input-output mappings we can represent with a neural network. NFL addresses our ability to actually learn the weights that will generate that mapping.
