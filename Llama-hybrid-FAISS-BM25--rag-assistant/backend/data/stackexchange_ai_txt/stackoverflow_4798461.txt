Cneonction and nnCoection HTTP headers

We have often some issues in terms of interoperability on the Web. One of these issues for browsers vendors is the wrongly spelled Connection HTTP header. The most common errors are given by these two forms. nnCoection: Cneonction: There are has been a few articles about this, including Fun with HTTP headers . Often it is happening by period, then disappear. It seems that some of them are created by load balancers such as this example : NetScaler Appliance. Do you know any other instances of hardware or software that create these issues? Update Here an example among others of a site which doesn't send back a good Connection HTTP header. curl -sI ehg-nokiafin.hitbox.com HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 25 Jan 2011 20:35:45 GMT Server: Hitbox Gateway 9.3.6-rc1 P3P: policyref="/w3c/p3p.xml", CP="NOI DSP LAW NID PSA ADM OUR IND NAV COM" Cneonction: close Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, proxy-revalidate Expires: Tue, 25 Jan 2011 20:35:46 GMT Content-Type: text/plain Content-Length: 23 update 2011-01-26 On Amazon forum about AWS, there is a thread about nnCoection . A comment says: FYI, the reason it misspells the word connection is so that the internet check-sum (a simple sum) still adds up, this way the change can occur at the packet level. If it completely removed the header, it would have to stall forwarding the response until the header was entirely read, so it could rewrite the headers, recompute the checksum and then send it along. with sum(ord(c) for c in "Connection") and sum(ord(c) for c in "nnCoection") both gives 1040
