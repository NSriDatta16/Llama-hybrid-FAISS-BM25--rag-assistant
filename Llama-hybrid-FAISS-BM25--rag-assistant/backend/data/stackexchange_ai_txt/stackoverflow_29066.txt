I was intrigued so I looked it up in the definition of ECMAScript 262 ed. 3 which is the basis of JavaScript 1.8. The relevant definition is found in section 11.1.4 and unfortunately is not very clear. The section explicitly states that elisions (= omissions) at the beginning or in the middle don't define an element but do contribute to the overall length . There is no explicit statements about redundant commas at the end of the initializer but by omission I conclude that the above statement implies that they do not contribute to the overall length so I conclude that MSIE is wrong . The relevant paragraph reads as follows: Array elements may be elided at the beginning, middle or end of the element list. Whenever a comma in the element list is not preceded by an Assignment Expression (i.e., a comma at the beginning or after another comma), the missing array element contributes to the length of the Array and increases the index of subsequent elements. Elided array elements are not defined.
