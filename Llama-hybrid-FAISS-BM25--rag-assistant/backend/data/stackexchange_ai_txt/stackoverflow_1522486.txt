It sounds like you already have a standard - VB.NET. And maybe you are tempted or interested in getting into C# instead. It makes very little sense to have half your systems written in VB and half written in C# - although depending on the nature of your organisation this may not apply. But generally, the organisation shouldn't take these changes lightly. If I was you (and you are interested moving to C# for yourself) then I'd push for C#, but if I was the business then I would need a very good reason to introduce this new complexity, cost & management issue.
