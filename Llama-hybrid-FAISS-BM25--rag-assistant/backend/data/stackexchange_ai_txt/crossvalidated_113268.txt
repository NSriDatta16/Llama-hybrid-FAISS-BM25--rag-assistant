Using correlations to re-label data from Google Analytics

In my Google Analytics data a lot of traffic gets mis-labelled as "Direct" because Google doesn't know the original traffic source. I've taken 6 months worth of our "Direct" traffic data and calculated the correlation of that to other traffic channels, such as Organic and Social. There is a moderate correlation between Social and Direct. My question is... is there a way to adjust the traffic numbers for "Social" (in a spreadsheet) to include some of the traffic from "Direct", knowing that there's a correlation between them? Eg, say GA currently reports 1,000 social visits and 5,000 direct, can I attribute some of the direct to social, like: Social might now be 2,000. Although I know the levels of correlation, there's no way of telling how much Direct is actually direct of course, so I don't know if this calculation is possible, or if there is a scientific way of going about the process. I accept this wont be truly accurate or definitive, I'm looking at this as more of an indicator. Thanks!
