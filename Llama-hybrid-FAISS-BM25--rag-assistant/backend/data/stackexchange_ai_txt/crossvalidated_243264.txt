How appropriate is simple linear regression?

My machine learning professor gave us the following data: Admission Fee ($) Year Attendance Adult Child Group 1998 117874 4.00 2.50 1.50 1997 125363 3.00 2.00 1.00 1996 126853 3.00 2.00 1.50 1995 108363 2.50 1.50 1.00 1994 133762 2.50 1.50 1.00 1993 95504 2.00 1.00 0.50 1992 63034 1.50 0.75 0.50 1991 63853 1.50 0.75 0.50 1990 61417 1.50 0.75 0.50 1989 53353 1.50 0.75 0.50 The question is to find the expected gate admittance figures and revenues for both 1999 and 2000. I plan to use simple linear regression, as I have always done. But the question should not be this simple. Is linear regression good enough, given that the training data is so less? I have read about other regression techniques, but have not implemented them (like locally weighted linear regression).
