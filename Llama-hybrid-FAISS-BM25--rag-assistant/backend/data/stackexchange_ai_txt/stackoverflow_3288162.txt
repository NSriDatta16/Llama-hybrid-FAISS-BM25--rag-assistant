The better approach would be to use the built-in caching features in ASP.NET. Searching StackOverflow for [asp.net] [caching] is a good start, and after (or before) that, similar searches on both www.asp.net and Google will get you quite far. In response to your comment, I would probably save the data as a flat string. It might not be the best option performance-wise when it comes to storage, but if you're going to perform searches on the text content, you don't want to have to compress/decompress or convert to/from binary every time, since there is probably no (easy) way to do this inside SQL Server. Just make sure you have all intexes and full-text features you need set up correctly.
