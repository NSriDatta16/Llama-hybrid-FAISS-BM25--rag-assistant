The "correlation of fixed effects" output doesn't have the intuitive meaning that most would ascribe to it. Specifically, is not about the correlation of the variables (as OP notes). It is in fact about the expected correlation of the regression coefficients. Although this may speak to multicollinearity it does not necessarily. In this case it is telling you that if you did the experiment again and it so happened that the coefficient for cropforage got smaller, it is likely that so too will would the coeffienct of sbare . In part his book "Analyzing Linguistic Data: A Practical Introduction to Statistics using R " dealing with lme4 Baayen suppresses that part of the output and declares it useful only in special cases. Here is a listserv message where Bates himself describes how to interpret that part of the output: It is an approximate correlation of the estimator of the fixed effects. (I include the word "approximate" because I should but in this case the approximation is very good.) I'm not sure how to explain it better than that. Suppose that you took an MCMC sample from the parameters in the model, then you would expect the sample of the fixed-effects parameters to display a correlation structure like this matrix.
