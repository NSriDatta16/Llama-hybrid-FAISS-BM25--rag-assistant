Is there a test to show that your RMSE is sufficently small for a dataset?

I am currently experimenting with some machine learning, which is going well. However, I am curious if there is a way to show that the $RMSE$ I am achieving is sufficiently small enough for the data set. For context, the data I am working with is on a scale from $10^0$ up to a scale of $10^2$ . With an SD on the order of $10^1$ , this is also the scale of my $RMSE$ I am achieving. When I compare the $\frac{RMSE}{SD}$ , I get that: $\frac{RMSE}{SD} \approx 1$ , and when I compare the $RMSE$ of both the training data to the testing data, they also are similar. i.e.: $$RMSE_{Train} - RMSE_{Test} \approx 0$$ So would both of these conditions satisfy that the $RMSE$ I am achieving, is sufficiently small enough for my data set? Or is there a test I can do to specifically assess this? Thank you for your help.
