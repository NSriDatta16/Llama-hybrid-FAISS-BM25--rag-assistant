If you want to go down this long, dark, lonesome road of trying to pick stocks you may want to look into data mining techniques using advanced data mining software such as SPSS or SAS or one of the dozen others. You'll probably want to use a combination or technical indicators and fundamental data. The data will more than likely be highly correlated so a feature reduction technique such as PCA will be needed to reduce the number of features. Also keep in mind your data will constantly have to be updated, trimmed, shuffled around because market conditions will constantly be changing. I've done research with this for a grad level class and basically I was somewhat successful at picking whether a stock would go up or down the next day but the number of stocks in my data set was fairly small (200) and it was over a very short time frame with consistent market conditions. What I'm trying to say is what you want to code has been done in very advanced ways in software that already exists. You should be able to input your data into one of these programs and using either regression, or decision trees or clustering be able to do what you want to do.
