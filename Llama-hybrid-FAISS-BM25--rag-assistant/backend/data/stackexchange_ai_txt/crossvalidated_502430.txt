Weighted and Probability Graph

I have a simple markov chain with A, B and C states. For each state I have a probability and beyond that, a value. So, for each state transition I have two informations: the probability of the transisiton to another state and a value. I need to know the average value considering that I am trying to start from node A and finish in the node C. I was thinking about to use Markov Chains but I have a value with the probability and I dont know whet kind of theory I can apply to find the average value on this path A -> C.
