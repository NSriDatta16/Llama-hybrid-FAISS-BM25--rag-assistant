The approach you're heading towards seems reasonable, but it all depends on the sort of queries you need to execute. Assuming you need to look up time series by name (string) and week, and you generally want to fetch between, say, 1 and 100 consecutive weeks worth of data, I would suggest the following: Have one entity for each week's worth of data for each term, as you suggest Instead of storing the data 'loose' and aggregating it periodically, store new points directly in this form. Whenever you receive a new data point, if it's the first point of the week, create a new entity. If it's not, retrieve the existing entity for that week and append your data point to it. When you want to plot data, query for the term and time period you need, and fetch the results in time order.
