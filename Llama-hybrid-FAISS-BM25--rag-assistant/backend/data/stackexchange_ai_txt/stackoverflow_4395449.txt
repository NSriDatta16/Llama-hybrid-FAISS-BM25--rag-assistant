Why the presentationLayer of a view doesn't work correctly for me?

I want to get the position of a view while it is being animated and moving from one position to another I tried to use the presentationLayer to get the action location information, and tried to print out the location when the UIView is moving. Here is what is printing out: 2010-12-08 16:56:50.496 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {45, 45} 2010-12-08 16:56:50.696 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {45, 45} 2010-12-08 16:56:50.896 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {45, 45} 2010-12-08 16:56:51.096 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {45, 45} 2010-12-08 16:56:51.296 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {45, 45} 2010-12-08 16:56:51.496 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {245, 245} 2010-12-08 16:56:51.696 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {245, 245} 2010-12-08 16:56:51.896 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {245, 245} 2010-12-08 16:56:52.096 Exp[31219:207] point: NSPoint: {245, 245} notice the arrow, the endpoint is directly printed out without showing points on the path. Can anyone help? below is my code: Here's how it is printing: -(void)print { NSLog([NSMutableString stringWithFormat:@"point: %@",[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:((CALayer *)[bomb.layer presentationLayer]).position]]); } I used a timer to repeatedly print out the animated view "bomb" -(id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder { if (self=[super initWithCoder:aDecoder]) { bomb = [[BombView alloc]init]; bomb.frame = CGRectMake(30, 30, 30, 30); bomb.backgroundColor = [UIColor yellowColor]; [self addSubview:bomb]; timer = [NSTimer timerWithTimeInterval:PRINTINTERVAL // defined to be 0.2 target: self selector: @selector(print) userInfo: nil repeats: YES]; [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] addTimer:timer forMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode]; } return self; } Here's how it is animated: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CABasicAnimation * animation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"position"]; animation.duration = 10.0; animation.delegate = bomb; [bomb.layer addAnimation:animation forKey:@"animatePosition"]; bomb.center = CGPointMake(bomb.center.x+200, bomb.center.y+200); } when I click, the "bomb" will move and the information printed out should be gradually changing. Because it is moving at such a low speed within 10 seconds. It moves fine but doesn't print correctly.
