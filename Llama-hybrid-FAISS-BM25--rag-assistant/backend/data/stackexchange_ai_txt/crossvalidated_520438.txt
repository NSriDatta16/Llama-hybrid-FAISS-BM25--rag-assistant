1D CNN and Moving Average for Time Series. Any formal relationship?

Intuitively, a 1D CNN (for a good filter) is very similar to a weighted moving average of a time series. Are there any formal (mathematical) relationships between the two? Can it be shown that under certain circumstances a 1D CNN would learn an exponentially-weighted moving average?
