Assuming SQL Server 2005+, use ROW_NUMBER: LEFT JOIN (SELECT UserID, PhoneNumber AS HomePhone, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY userid ORDER BY what?) AS rank FROM UserPhoneNumbers upn LEFT JOIN UserPhoneNumberTypes upnt ON upnt.UserPhoneNumberTypeID = upn.UserPhoneNumberTypeID AND upnt.PhoneNumberType='Home') AS tmpHomePhone ON tmpHomePhone.UserID = Users.UserID AND tmpHomePhone.rank = 1 Mind the what? placeholder for determining the first number. Omit the ORDER BY if you don't care at all...
