path problem when using 'require' and symbolic links

I've got the following scripts: "/folderA/bin/command.rb", which calls require 'some_library' "/folderA/lib/some_library.rb" "~/scripts/command.rb", which is a symbolic link to "/folderA/bin/command.rb" When I run ruby ~/scripts/command.rb (calling the symbolic link) it works fine, but because of the symbolic link, __FILE__ is "~/scripts" and not "/folderA/bin/". My best idea to solve this path problem is the following: $:.push File.dirname(Pathname.new(__FILE__).realpath) + '/../lib' This solution looks really dirty. Is there a better way to organize this?
