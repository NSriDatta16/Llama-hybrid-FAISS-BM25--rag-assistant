Embedding binary video data in a swf file

Is it possible to play video from data that has been embedded in a swf at compile time (with the [Embed] metatag)? The "Import Video->Embed" feature provided by Flash CS3 etc. is not acceptable because it has many severe limitations (including sound synchronization issues, a maximum number of frames, and other caveats) I'm interested in being able to bundle flv video data in a swf (along with other assets), which will be played by an AIR application. I don't think it can be done. Anyone disagree?
