machine.config and processmodel with IIS express

I'm wondering if modifying processModel in machine.config will have any effect on an IIS express integrated mode application? I'm trying to modify the maxWorkerThreads to at least 100 because I was comparing normal IIS vs IIS express on windows 7 using WCAT to see if scott was correct when he said IIS express has no connection limits. Although IIS express does show 30+ requests executing at the same time against the normal IIS limit of 10 the actual total requests per seconds are comparable between both and IIS express has much higher cpu usage and on average 70 requests queued vs 0 requests waiting for normal IIS! And the CPU is only about 70% on an quad core i7. surely there is room for optimization? additional details I have uploaded the WCAT results run on windows 7, same script, to http://d1yb9lkqglrfzu.cloudfront.net/IISExpress-100VU-MachineConfig.zip IIS Express has slighter higher requests per second, and total transactions served than normal IIS. IIS Express is executing up to 50 requests at a time, while normal IIS on windows 7 is limited to 10 as designed. IIS express is using 30% higher cpu, probably because of additional requests it handles at a time. But on average Express requests take much longer to complete. see Request Execution Time performance counter and time analysis (first and last byte). Express is only able to beat IIS in total requests served because it can handle more requests at a time! Theories Could the fact that IIS express is printing each request to command line window even with trace set none be slowing it down. I also noticed a lot of additional modules registered in IIS express applicationhost.config that are not in IIS applicationhost.config. Could then extra debugging/tracing modules be causing the problem. I notice IIS express does not have FileCache and HTTPCache modules. Could that be why? I'm hoping asp.net experts can clarify how these results are possible if IIS express is not limited.
