Output attribute value and text alongside price in Magento

HI I am new to Magento and still new to the whole css, php thing. And I have been searching for over a month to find this answer (I am sure it is here some place, but I cannot seem to find it) I am building a b2b site for a clothing company. Since they are a wholesaler, they do not sell single items, but rather, they sell them in a pack. Depending on the items , some will come in a pack of 2-Small; 2-Medium; 2-Large, other will come in a pack of 1-Small; 2-Medium; 1-Large, and so on. So far, I set up an attribute called “Package Set”, which describes the kind of pack the customer will be getting when ordering the item, but it only appears in the Additional Information tab, which is not good, because we want that information to stand out. Putting it in the Short Description is an option, but we want to emphasize it more. So we want to 1. add a text “per pack” right behind the price. 2. add the value of the attribute “Package Set”, right underneath the price, so people will see it clearly, both in the category and product page. It would look some thing like, “$60 per pack Package Set: 2-Small; 2-Medium; 2-Large.” I am using the modern theme running 1.4.1.1 Thank you
