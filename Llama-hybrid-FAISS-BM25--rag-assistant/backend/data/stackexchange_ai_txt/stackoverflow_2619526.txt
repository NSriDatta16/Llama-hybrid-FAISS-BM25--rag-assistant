Generally the VS project files are not backward compatible. But there is no reason why you cannot create a new VS2005 project file and add the various code files to it, and maintain it separately. Synchronizing the 2008 and 2005 project files is not hard, just use a diff tool like SourceGear's DiffMerge* to compare them and move the relevant lines back and forth between the two, you need to pay attention to the Reference and Compile ones: I don't know why you would want to go back to VS2005 if you have access to VS2008 though. *this is not your only option, there are heaps of good diffing tools out there
