Strategy for analysing stock history data from multiple files with SPSS

I have a folder with a hundred comma separated files (CSVs) of which the filename equals a company stock exchange followed by it's symbol, delimited with a "_", eg: NASDAQ_MSFT.csv Each file contains historical daily stock information, eg. a csv file looks like: Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume 29-Dec-00,21.97,22.91,21.31,21.69,93999000 28-Dec-00,22.56,23.12,21.94,22.28,75565800 27-Dec-00,23.06,23.41,22.50,23.22,66881000 ... 5-Jan-00,55.56,58.19,54.69,56.91,62712600 4-Jan-00,56.78,58.56,55.94,56.31,52866600 3-Jan-00,58.69,59.31,56.00,58.34,51680600 Now, I want to analyse this information (analyse the companies as if the company name is a column field rather than a new list of fields). But there are a couple of issues: Each company has it's own file with the symbol and exchange as filename Some companies start at different dates than others. Eg. some might have a range of 30 days while others have a range of 30 months (every step is still 1 day difference though). I am using SPSS as my analysis tool. My question is, how can I import these files to perform senseful analystical operations on them? For example, I wish to see the average slope of the open price of all companies together, etc.
