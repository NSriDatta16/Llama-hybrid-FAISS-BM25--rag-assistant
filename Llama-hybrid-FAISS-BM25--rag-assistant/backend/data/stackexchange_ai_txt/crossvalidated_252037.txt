What is the probability that the next president of the United States is an Independent?

In his (fantastic, fascinating and sure to become a classic) book "Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman asks the reader the question in the title. I was wondering how people would approach this problem. A similar question with some answers (one of them is mine) can be found here . However, these answers consider a fixed set of results (namely - success and failure). My answer and others don't take into account an unknown number of possible outcomes. So, I'm curious as to how one may overcome these issues. For example, the accepted answer uses the rule of 3 (explained in the comments). How one would adapt this to a varying number of outcomes? One natural approach would be to call the event "a republican or a democrat won" a success and call all other events failure. Then the problem is reduced to the one cited above. Are there other ways to rephrase or approach the problem? This question is opinion based to the extent statistics is opinion based: You can have a frequentist solution, you can use Bayes' rule etc. A couple of notes: I don't care about the number, the reasoning is far more interesting. I am not asking you to extend my (Bayesian) approach. I'm interested in your approach. Carrot is the next president, so the question relates to the one after him. Feel free to suggest tags.
