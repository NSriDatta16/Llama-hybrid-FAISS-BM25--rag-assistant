How to get plaintext from the response of a WebRequest class in C#

I want to get plain text using WebRequest class, just like what we get when we use webbrowser1.Document.Body.InnerText . I have tried the following code public string request_Resource() { HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(myurl); Stream stream = request.GetResponse().GetResponseStream(); StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(stream); WebBrowser wb = new WebBrowser(); wb.DocumentText = sr.ReadToEnd(); return wb.Document.Body.InnerText; } when i execute this is get a NullReferenceException . Is there a better way to get a plain text. Note: I cannot use webbrowser control directly to load the webpage, because, i don't want to deal with all those events that fire up multiple times when ever a page is loaded. UPDATE: I have changed my code to use WebClient Class instead of WebRequest upon suggestion My code looks something like this now public string request_Resource() { WebClient wc = new WebClient(); wc.Proxy = null; //The user agent header is added to avoid any possible errors wc.Headers.Add("user-agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C)"); return wc.DownloadString(myurl); } I am considering using HTML Utility Pack, can anyone suggest any better alternative.
