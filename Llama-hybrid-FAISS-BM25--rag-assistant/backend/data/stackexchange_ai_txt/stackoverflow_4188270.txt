Is there a way to encode object constructors with the JSON Perl Module?

All, I'm using the JSON Perl module to encode JSON. I'd like the resulting JSON to include lines like this: { "startDate": new Date(2010,11,15,0,0), "aString" : "String Data", "aNumber" : 1234 } In order to create that, I have a Perl HASHREF like this: { startDate => SEE BELOW, aString => "String Data", aNumber => 1234, } Here's my problem: I can't figure out how to coerce the JSON module into printing unquoted strings, so that I can include my new Date(...) instantiation call. I've tried creating a Perl module with a TO_JSON method, but the output still gets quoted. Does anybody out there have any suggestions on how I can encourage JSON to print unquoted strings?
