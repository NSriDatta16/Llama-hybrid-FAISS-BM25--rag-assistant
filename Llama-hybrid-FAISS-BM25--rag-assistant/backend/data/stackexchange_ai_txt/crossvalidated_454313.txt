Text retrieval from an image is not appropriate

I have an image where it contains names of several resources. When I am trying to read the text from the image using R its not throwing how it is present in image. For instance J is reported as I Or JI, Xyz1 is reported as XyzL I used tesseract and magick packages but still I am facing the issue.
