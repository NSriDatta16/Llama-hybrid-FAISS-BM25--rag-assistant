Loading HTML fragments asynchronous in a web page that is generated using XSLT & XML

Technology: Dot Net, ASP.Net We have articles stored in XML repository and article contains multiple sections. These XML files are transformed to HTML using XSLT for browser rendering. New requirement is to allow users to comment on each section (not on the article!) and when the article is shown we also show the comments (but based his role/rights and in a collapsible/expandable widget) Since comments are not directly related to article and also the same article can be shown in multiple sites; we will not be able to store comments along with article XML. We plan to solve this by storing comments in a separate database with references and when transforming article XML using XSLT we will embedded a URLs to the comments in the generated html. When user clicks on the comments widget, we use the embedded URL to fetch the comments using Asynchronous calls from the web server and show it in the expanded div area This sounds very complex to us and not sure if this will work. Please let me know if this can be archived? or suggest a better way to archive this. THX
