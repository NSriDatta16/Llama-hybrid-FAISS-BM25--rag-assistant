What is the connection between Kernel Logistic Regression and Smoothing Splines?

Working on probabilistic outputs of kernel methods I found the formulation of the SVM as a Penalized Method using the Binomial Deviance (described for example in " The Elements of Statistical Learning Theory , 2nd edition" by Hastie et al., pp 426--430). The model is called "Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR)". References on "The well studied KLR" lead to literature on smoothing splines, but KLR is never mentioned there. What is the connection between KLR and Smoothing Splines? Thank you in advance for your answer!
