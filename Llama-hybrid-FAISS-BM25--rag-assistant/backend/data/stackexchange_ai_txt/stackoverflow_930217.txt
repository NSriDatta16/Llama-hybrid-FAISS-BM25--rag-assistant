Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) like GIT, Mercurial and Bazaar do collectively have advantages in flexibility of workflow and operation compared to centralized CVSs such as SVN or CVS. See the discussion on wikipedia . As for the choice among DVCSs, that's as highly debated as (say) that between vi and emacs;-). On a "horses for courses" basis you might pragmatically pick hg (Mercurial) if you're going to be using code.google.com, Bazaar if you're going to use Launchpad, GIT if you're going to use github, for example.
