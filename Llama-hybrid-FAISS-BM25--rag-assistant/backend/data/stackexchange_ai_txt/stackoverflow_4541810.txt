Try these settings... useActiveDirectory should be false by default, but try it. The authentication mode is set on the transport itself, so msmqAuthenticationMode should be set to 'none'. msmqProtectionLevel and clientCredentialType sound relevant, so I threw them in there, too : ) I'd be concerned about removing all the security, however... if you're on a domain, you should install MSMQ with Active Directory Integration, or use Workgroup methods of securing the messages. Also, don't forget, the settings for the server and client have to match. HTH, James Sorry for the continual updates, my attention to details seems to be a bit low today : P
