Ripping a CD to mp3 in C# - third party component or api out there?

We're working on a project that requires the ripping of audio tracks from CDs to MP3s (ideally also retrieving the track information from CDDB or similar). More background information: Various music labels send us CDs of music which we then deliver to people via an online delivery system. We're looking at automating the process of converting those CDs into MP3s with full track information where possible. We want to produce a simple desktop application that allows a member of editorial staff to setup the information about the new music we receive. To streamline the process we'd like to include the ripping of the audio and retrieval of the track information.
