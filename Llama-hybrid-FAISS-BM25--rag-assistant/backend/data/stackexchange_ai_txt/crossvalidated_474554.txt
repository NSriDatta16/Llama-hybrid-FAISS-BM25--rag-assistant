You need to apply a functional derivative in this case, use the Euler-Lagrange formula: Given $$\mathcal{F}[f] = \int_a^b G(f(x), f'(x)) dx$$ $$\frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta f} = \frac{\partial G}{\partial f(x)} - \frac{d}{dx}\frac{\partial G}{\partial f'(x)}$$ Since the functional in your case does not depend on the derivative of $f$ , the expression becomes already much easier $$\frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta f} = \frac{\partial G}{\partial f(x)}$$ and you can treat it almost like a 'normal' derivative with respect to a variable. All that's left to do is to solve your constrained optimization problem . I recommend Bishop's 'Pattern Recognition in Machine Learning' Ch. 1.6 about Information Theory and Appendix D about Calculus of Variations, those are great resources to learn about this topic.
