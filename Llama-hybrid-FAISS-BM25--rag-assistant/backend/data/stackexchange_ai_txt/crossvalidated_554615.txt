Intuition of the log odds linearity assumption for logistic regression

I'm currently having trouble understanding the assumption of logistic regression that the input variables must be linearly related to the log odds. Specifically, what actually happens to the model when this assumption is violated? Ive read the mathematical explanations of the assumption, but it does not help my understanding of it. They leave me more confused. I have been told that whether the assumption is true or not does not affect whether the data is linearly separable. So does a violation of the assumption cause the decision boundary to point in the wrong direction or something like that? Why should I care whether the assumption is violated or not basically.
