You really need to give more context to your question for a really useful answer. In general, questions like this are difficult to answer in the abstract, only some generalities can be said. I will assume your conflict event type variable is to be used as an predictor (I assume that is input in machine learning lingo.) Even if that variable can be ordered along a line of less to more violence, that does not mean it is necessarily that is the only aspect of the variable that is important for the response ( output .) So why not try it both ways and see what works best for your goal? That is, one model with dummy ( one-hot ) encoding, another with 1,2,3,4,5,6 numerical coding and a spline or low-order polynomial. Then see what works best. Also see Including both transformed and original data (untransformed) in a multivariable linear regression. .
