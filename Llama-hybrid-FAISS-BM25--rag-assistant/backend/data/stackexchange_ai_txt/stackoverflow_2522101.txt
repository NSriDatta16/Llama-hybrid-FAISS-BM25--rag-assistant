Topics such as REST, DRY etc are not really in the same category as the patterns covered by the Gang of Four. There is a book, Design Patterns in Ruby which you might find useful as it covers how the original GoF patterns apply in Ruby. However, once you start programming in dynamic languages like Ruby you often find you don't need patterns in same the same way as you did in languages like C++ and Java. I would also take a look at The Ruby Way (for general Ruby programming), Agile Web Development with Rails (for a good introduction to Rails) and The Pragmatic Programmer (which covers many of the general practices such as Don't Repeat Yourself.)
