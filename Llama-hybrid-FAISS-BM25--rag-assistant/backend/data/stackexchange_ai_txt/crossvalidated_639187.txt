Suspicious Partial Dependence Curves from a Random Forest Model

I have created several Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) for some of the top variables in my RF model. Overall, the plots seem to make sense; however, for the 'Bog" class, the probability for all variables analyzed goes up to around 0.9 probability, while for the other variables, the probability is significantly less (e.g. 0.02). I understand that the probability will change depending on the class, and a predictor variable may have more importance in one class than another. However, the high probability for all bog classes has me questioning the data. I would appreciate any feedback and ideas on troubleshooting approaches (if necessary).
