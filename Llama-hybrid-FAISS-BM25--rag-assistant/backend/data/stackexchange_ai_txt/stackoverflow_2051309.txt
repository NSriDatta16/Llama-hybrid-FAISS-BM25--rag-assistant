When I validate a textbox that depends on the value of another textbox, instead of highlighting like you've mentioned I intercept the value change and accept or reject the change. I have found that if I try to change textbox B based on a change to textbox A I always run into problems, but if I accept or reject a change to textbox A based on the value in textbox B it works fine. Edit: I'm assuming you're dealing with numeric-only textboxes. If that's the case I suggest you do what I did. First, for my validation rule, I created a polygon that represents the numeric constraints, this lets you have linear relationships between the two values. Then, whenever one value is changed I check to see if the current data point intersects with the validation polygon. If the data point rests outside the polygon then you don't allow the change to be made. The problem you run into is that if you are at the edge of the polygon, then the value seems to be "stuck". To get around this I created a graphic that shows the validation polygon with the current point in it. That way if the user pushes one value to the limit, they can see why they can't change any more. For good measure I've added slider bars along each axis of the plot so they can change the value easy and I've added drag functionality to the point. This way, you have stable validation, and it is very clear to the user how to change the values and why they can't go beyond certain limits.
