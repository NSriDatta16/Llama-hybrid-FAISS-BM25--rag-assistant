Does the R and Python implementaions of random forests handle categorical variables differently?

Does R and Python implementaions of Random Forest handle categorical variable differently ? sklearn vs. randomForest implementations clue : I've heard that R implementation looks for the best combination of categories for each split and sklearn looks for one category which provides the best split... is it true that difference lays here ?
