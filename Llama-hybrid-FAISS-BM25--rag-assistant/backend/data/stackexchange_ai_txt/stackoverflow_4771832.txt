This seams like a wonder application of two fairly new but very powerful modules. Context - http://drupal.org/project/context in conjunction with Spaces - http://drupal.org/project/spaces or Panels http://drupal.org/project/panels Both have concepts that allow you to set a context for pages that changes the output based on a variety of criteria. In your case the criteria would be the role of the user viewing the page. Both more less unwieldy than the tricks that CurtainDog offered up, which btw are all very valid approaches. The advantage of these two modules is that they make the organization and selection process much more sane and simple. It's difficult to advise one over the other, but in a nutshell: Panels has more options in the interface, but has a bit of a learning curve on the code level. Context / Spaces is very easy to work with on the programing level, but required more coding to accomplish most tasks. I would suggest trying both before committing to either. For a wonderful discussion of both listen to this podcast .
