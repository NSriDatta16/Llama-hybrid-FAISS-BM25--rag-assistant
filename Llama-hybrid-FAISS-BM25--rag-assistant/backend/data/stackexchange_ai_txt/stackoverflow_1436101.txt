There's no easy way to accomplish this using string.Split . (Well, except for specifying all the permutations of the split string for each char lower/upper case in an array - not very elegant I think you'll agree.) However, Regex.Split should do the job quite nicely. Example: var parts = Regex.Split(input, "aa", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
