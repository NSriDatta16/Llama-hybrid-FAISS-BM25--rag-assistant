"...I still need case studies that show ROI values." Why is ROI so hard? Here's why. Individual programmer productivity varies by at least one and sometimes two orders of magnitude. http://forums.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2008/03/27/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-quot-10x-quot.aspx Individual variability trumps any other effect you might be looking for. You can't do a "head-to-head", "apples-to-apples" comparison. When you compare two similar teams using different techniques (i.e., different complexity thresholds) you find that individual performance differences simply dominate the data and almost everything is noise. "Without that kind of data, it is difficult to get management to care." If management doesn't care about quality, you have big problems. ROI numbers aren't going to influence management to change the environment. You have to run your own experiments on your own code in your own organization. Gather Cyclomatic complexity, defect rates, problem tickets, crashes, anything you can. Try to correlate complexity with other bad metrics. An argumentative manager can always win by pointing out the individual differences among members of teams. Use real data in your real organization. That's the best you can do. And it's not "some study" or "some whitepaper" It's your actual organization.
