Crystal reports - PUSH blob data, image doesn't display

I've a crystal report that I'm trying to get a dynamic image displayed. This is the CRBasic 2008 version that comes with VS 2008, so i can't use the method where we link out to the file, it has to come from the data source. I'm pushing a strongly typed dataset to the report, which contains a byte[] field. This dataset is being populated correctly and the BLOB data in the DB is actually an image (verified it by getting it to display in a picture box in a windows form). I've a BLOBField dragged onto my crystal design surface, but when I view the report, nothing gets displayed. Anybody have any idea why this might be happening?
