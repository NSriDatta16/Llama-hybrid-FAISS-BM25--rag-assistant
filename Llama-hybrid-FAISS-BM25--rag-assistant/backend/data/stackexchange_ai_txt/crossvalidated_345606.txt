Maybe you can try to rewrite the latent Markov chain in a different form, so that your model becomes a more standard HMM. For instance suppose that the original hidden chain is denoted by $(X_t)$, then consider a new chain $(Z_t)$ such that $Z_t = (X_t, X_{t-1},...,X_{t-10})$. Then $(Z_t)$ is a Markov chain ($Z_t$ given $Z_{t-1}$ is independent of the previous states), and now your observation $Y_t$ at time $t$ has a distribution that depends on $Z_t$ only. So the model parametrized with $(Z_t)$ as the hidden chain is a standard HMM. You also need to define the initial state $Z_0$ appropriately.
