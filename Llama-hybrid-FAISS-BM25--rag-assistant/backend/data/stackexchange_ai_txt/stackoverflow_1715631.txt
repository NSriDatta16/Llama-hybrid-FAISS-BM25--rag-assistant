Barring (as you said) spreading data across the system, it seems pretty solid to me. Here's an outline of a way to store all the data in one central location. You'd have to flesh this out some, work out the naming conventions and updatable view wrinkles and whatnot. I think it's elegant, but elegance can be overrated. -- In SharedDB CREATE TABLE CentralTable ( Id int not null identity(1000000, 1) ,OwningClientDB sysname null ,YourDataHere varchar(100) not null -- Toss in stuff like who added it, when it was added, etc.) ) As you mentioned, all common data gets added via SET IDENTITY_INSERT CentralTable ON with Id values under 1,000,000, and with Owning ClientDB as null. Then, in each client DB: -- In client DB CREATE VIEW vCentralTable (Id, OwningClientDB, YourDataHere, etc.) as select Id, OwningClientDB, YourDataHere, etc. from SharedDB.dbo.CentralTable where isnull(OwningClientDB, db_name()) = db_name() The view filters out which rows a given client can see. I based the filter on database name, but there may be more efficient ways of doing this, depending on how you identify "owning" clients.
