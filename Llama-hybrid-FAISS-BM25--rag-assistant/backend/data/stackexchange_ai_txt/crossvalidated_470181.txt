Time series - Differencing vs Dividing

What is the difference between using differencing or dividing to treat trends / seasonality ? Most approaches seem to be using differencing. Is there a qualitative preference for why we do this ? For instance given a time series ts Would ts/ts.shift(7) be qualitative different from ts-ts.shift(7) ? How do we assess which method is better ?
