The Pragmatic Programmers just made available the book iPhone SDK Development by Bill Dudney, Chris Adamson, and Marcel Molina through their beta book program. You can purchase a PDF (and Kindle) version right now, and it contains a detailed chapter on Bonjour and GameKit networking, along with code examples. Aside from Apple's documentation and sample code, it's probably the best resource you'll find right now.
