OLS assumes that your dependent variable is independent across your observations. In other words, if you perform OLS you're assuming female labour participation at year 1 is independent from year 2. This assumption is likely wrong when you're dealing with time series data like this. When you have dependence in your dependent variables, this is called autocorrelation. There are sets of models called autoregressive models that can handle this. These models will outperform OLS when you have autocorrelation.
