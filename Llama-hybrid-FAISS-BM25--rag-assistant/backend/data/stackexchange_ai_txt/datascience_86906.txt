How to grade an interaction that a user had with a post with an AI based on big data?

Context I'm creating a social network. The thing is, I don't want to order posts by likes, or something like that , I'm using an AI ( lightfm in python ). This AI uses a hybrid recommendation system based on ratings that users have given to posts. For this part, everything works, BUT for testing I was using fake ratings that I've manually entered the database . THE REAL QUESTION IS , how do I get the rating that a user has given to a post without asking him and only knowing his interactions (liked, shared, commented, watch time, etc...) Interaction example: { "average_watch_time": 2.4739250771067502, "follow_on_init": true, "id": 0, "interactions": [ { "at": 1608370856, "id": 0, "type": "first_time" }, { "at": 1608370860, "id": 1, "type": "see_profile" }, { "at": 1608370861, "id": 2, "type": "come_back" }, { "at": 1608370869, "id": 3, "type": "unfollow" }, { "at": 1608370874, "id": 4, "type": "duo" }, { "at": 1608370880, "id": 5, "type": "come_back" }, { "at": 1608370890, "id": 6, "type": "double_click_like" }, { "at": 1608370892, "id": 7, "type": "see_profile" }, { "at": 1608370895, "id": 8, "type": "come_back" }, { "at": 1608370900, "id": 9, "type": "copy_link" }, { "at": 1608370907, "id": 10, "type": "duo" }, { "at": 1608370911, "id": 11, "type": "come_back" }, { "at": 1608370914, "id": 12, "type": "dislike" }, { "at": 1608370924, "id": 13, "type": "see_profile" }, { "at": 1608370934, "id": 14, "type": "come_back" } ], "total_comments": 2814, "total_duos": 78, "total_likes": 45477, "total_shares": 1857, "total_views": 4853, "video_duration": 0.48587760432015425 } My solutions First one At the beginning, I thought the best solution was to rate on /20 . And for each type of interaction (liked, commented, etcâ€¦), give it a part of this final grade. What I mean: Liked: /10; Commented: /2; Shared: /5; Followed: /3; Total: /20 The problems is that if I use this method it won't really work. For example if I share , that means that I liked the post but if I don't that doesn't necessarily mean that I didn't like it . SO THIS WILL REMOVE 5 points because I didn't share. Second One After that, I thought of making a deep RL algorithm based on human preferences . The idea was that, I would create a client side website where a human can rate interactions. For this I created another algorithm that would create random interactions and then simulate them on the client side BUT AFTER I WAS BLOCKED. Why ? Well, because I SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO. There is nothing on the internet ( except a really complex math document ) on deep RL. Third Solution Finally, the last solution that I found was to give a weight to each type of interaction. THE THING IS THAT, how could I give a weight to something that depends on other interactions (time between last interaction, repetition, video duration, etc...)
