If you are not working in a team, you could use something like Eclipse's local history feature. It stores versions of your files locally, and you can revert to previous versions whenever you feel like it. More details here: http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/index.jsp (Search for "local history"). I am pretty sure other IDEs have such a feature too. If you are collaborating with others on your code, there probably is no way around learning one of the standard tools like SVN, CVS or git. For most of them, there are plugins for many IDEs available, so you don't have to use the command line.
