HLSL How can one pass data between shaders / read existing colour value?

I have 2 HLSL ps2.0 shaders. Simplified, they are: Shader 1 Reads texture Outputs colour value based on this texture Shader 2 Problem: Need to read in the colour from Shader 1 Outputs the final colour which is a function of the input colour (They need to be different shaders as I've reached the maximum vertex-shader outputs for 1 shader) My problem is I cannot work out how Shader 2 can access the existing fragment/pixel colour. Knowing how to do any of these things with HLSL would solve my problem; Read existing pixel colour (I don't think this is possible) Pass result of Shader 1 to Shader 2 as a float4 Render result of Shader 1 as a texture in memory, and have Shader 2 read that in
