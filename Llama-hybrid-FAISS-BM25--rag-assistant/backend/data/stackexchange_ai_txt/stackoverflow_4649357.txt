How do I delete this event from FullCalendar?

The calendar lets the user drag a timeslot onto the calendar, however I would like them to be able to remove it if they click on it. So in the eventClick I have this function: function (calEvent) { removeRequestedEvent($(this), calEvent); }, It just passes in the calendar event and the calendar itself. removeRequestedBooking: function (cal, calEvent) { if (!confirm("Delete?")) return; cal.fullCalendar("removeEvents", calEvent.id); cal.fullCalendar("rerenderEvents"); // Re-show draggable element $("#requests #" + calEvent.id).show(); } I've also tried using a filter, but a breakpoint on the return statement is never hit. cal.fullCalendar("removeEvents", function (event) { return event.id == calEvent.Id; }); Any ideas? (I know the Id is right, and the last line works). Firebug doesn't show any errors in the javascript. I'm using FullCalendar v1.4.10
