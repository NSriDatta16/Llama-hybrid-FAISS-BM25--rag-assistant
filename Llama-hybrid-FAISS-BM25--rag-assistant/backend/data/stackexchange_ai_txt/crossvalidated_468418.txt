Multi-class classification - confusing some classes is worse than others

I am quite a Rookie concerning machine learning and now thinking about the following problem: I want to assign a person to one out of 6 groups, let's say concerning their favorite colour --> works quite well with random forrest. Now it is the case that categorizing a person from group 1 as group 3 (favorite colour is red but I predict green) is worse than categorizing this person as group 4 (favorite colour is red but I predict purple). Is there an algorithm for this special use case? Or an option to "tune" my evaluation metrics so they consider the second best or "close to right" group, too? Thanks a lot in advance! Sara
