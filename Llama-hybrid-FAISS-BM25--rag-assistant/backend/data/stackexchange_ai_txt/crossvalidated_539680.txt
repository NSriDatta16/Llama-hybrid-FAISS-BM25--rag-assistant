Can we benefit from a convex loss function when optimizing a neural network?

Many existing loss functions are convex since they are easy to optimize. However, they are only convex with respect to the output $y$ , not to parameter $\theta$ of a neural network, or any other non-convex model. In this case, is it still beneficial to use a convex loss function when optimizing a neural network?
