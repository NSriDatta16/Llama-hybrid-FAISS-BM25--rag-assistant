Error when launch adhoc app in xcode 3.2.4

I'm sorry about asking this question again, I looked for many forums, websites about this issue, even if I did follow Apple's instruction at http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa2010/qa1710.html but it's seem helpful for me. I upraged my xcode sdk to 3.2.4 and iOS 4.1, everything is well with Development, but when I built adhoc with Distribution, the app can't launch with error: Error launching remote program: failed to get the task for process 571. Error launching remote program: failed to get the task for process 571. The program being debugged is not being run. The program being debugged is not being run. I created the Entitlements.plist with configurations: application-identifier $(AppIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier) get-task-allow keychain-access-groups $(AppIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier) but nothing is changed. Anyone could help me? Thanks so much.
