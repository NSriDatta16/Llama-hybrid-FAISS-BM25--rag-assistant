PHP substr after a certain char, a substr + strpos elegant solution?

let's say I want to return all chars after some needle char 'x' from: $source_str = "Tuex helo babe" . Normally I would do this: if( ($x_pos = strpos($source_str, 'x')) !== FALSE ) $source_str = substr($source_str, $x_pos + 1); Do you know a better/smarter (more elegant way) to do this? Without using regexp that would not make it more elegant and probably also slower. Unfortunately we can not do: $source_str = substr(source_str, strpos(source_str, 'x') + 1); Because when 'x' is not found strpos returns FALSE (and not -1 like in JS). FALSE would evaluate to zero, and 1st char would be always cut off. Thanks,
