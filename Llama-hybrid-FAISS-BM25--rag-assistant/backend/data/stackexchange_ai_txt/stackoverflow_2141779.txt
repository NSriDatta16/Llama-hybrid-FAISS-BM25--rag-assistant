Just complementing Paul Brinkley's answer . Is the 73 a universal key code? Yes, it is the ASCII code of the upper case letter, 'I' in that case. See the javadoc for KeyEvent.VK_A Attention despite this coincidence , it's better not to do something like getKeyCode() == 'A' - it may fail in future implementations.
