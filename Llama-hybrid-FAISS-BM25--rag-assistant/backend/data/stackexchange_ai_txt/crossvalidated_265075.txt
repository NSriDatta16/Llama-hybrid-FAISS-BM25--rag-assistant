How does a bag-of-words model treat words that were never seen before (not in the training data)?

What happens when a text classifier using a bag-of-words model (let's say we're using logistic regression) encounters a word that the model has not seen before- aka, words that were not in the training data? How would it handle or treat these extra features? The reason this confuses me is that usually samples that we are trying to predict or test have to have the same number of features as training samples, but it seems like in most text classification implementations, we can predict samples that have higher dimensions than the training samples.
