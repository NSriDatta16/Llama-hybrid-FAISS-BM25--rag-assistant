Without a JOIN, why not just use a temp table or table variable. So insert the SUMs: INSERT INTO tempTable (SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(q1) AS q1.... FROM thotels_results WHERE brand = 'EFG' AND date = 'NOV2010' GROUP BY brand) INSERT INTO tempTable (SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(q1) AS q1.... FROM thotels_results WHERE brand = 'XYC' AND date = 'NOV2010' GROUP BY brand) INSERT INTO tempTable (SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(q1) AS q1.... FROM thotels_results WHERE brand = 'ABC' AND date = 'NOV2010' GROUP BY brand) Then fetch the adverage SELECT SUM(q1) / 3 as q1Adverage,.... From tempTable
