I suspect that the model is behaving properly in predicting just the one class. Your logistic regression (for example) returns probability values, not classifications. Frank Harrell, founder of the biostatistics department at Vanderbilt University and a member here on Cross Validated, has two good blog posts about this topic [1] [2] . When you make the classifications, you most likely are going with category $1$ if the returned probability exceeds $0.5$ and with category $0$ if the returned probability is less than $0.5$ . This makes $0.5$ the so-called threshold value for classification. Given that you have imbalanced classes, I could believe that the model always returns probability values less than $0.5$ . After all, you are going into the problem telling the model to be skeptical about being class $1$ , since there are so many fewer instances: all else equal, a lower prior probability of membership in class $1$ means a lower posterior probability (prediction). If you evaluate the probability outputs, such as with log loss, Brier score, or concordance index (equal to ROCAUC), you are likely to find the results more to your liking and that not all of the probabilities are equal.
