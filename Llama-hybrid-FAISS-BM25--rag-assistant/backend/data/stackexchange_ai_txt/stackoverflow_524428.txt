Cannot implicitly convert List to Collection

This is a compiler error (slightly changed for readability). This one always puzzled me. FxCop tells that this is a bad thing to return List and classes that are derived from Collection should be preferable as return types. Also, FxCop says that it is OK to use List for internal data storage/manipulation. Ok, I get it, but what I don't get is why the compiler complains about trying to implicitly convert List to Collection . Isn't List more interface-charged and functional? Why prohibit implicit conversion? And another question that stems from above: is the new List (some collection ) constructor expensive?
