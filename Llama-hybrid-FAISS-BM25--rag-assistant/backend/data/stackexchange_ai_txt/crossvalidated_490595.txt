Calculation of transition probabilities of Markov Chain

I have just started learning markov chains and I need help on the following question: Alice and Bob vote in each parliamentary election. If, in a certain election, Alice and Bob vote for the same party, they vote for it again in the next election. If they vote for different parties, then in next election each of them switches their opinion independently with probability 1/4. How do I draw the transition graph for this one?
