We use Caliburn on all of our projects (but that's misleading because we the ones who developed it). :-) Number of tables will have no impact, as Caliburn has nothing to do with data access. Number of "pages" doesn't necessary have an impact either. The use of the term "page" leads me to think that you have a navigation (browser style) UI metaphor in mind. If so, you can still benefit from Calbiurn when using that approach however it is not the natural "Caliburn way". To sum up, size of the application and complexity doesn't matter. In order to get a better feel of why Caliburn would be useful, I recommend reading the series of posts by Rob Eisenberg, beginning here . Note that we are encouraging new projects to use Caliburn Micro, instead of the original Caliburn. An additional resource to help might be Rob's video from MIX 10 we he discusses how to roll your own framework (independent of Caliburn).
