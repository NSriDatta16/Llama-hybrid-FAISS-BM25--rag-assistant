PCA is a good way to study populations. So, a good starting point is to know which axis represents samples and which represents variables or features. In your case, it seems like solutions are samples. In many naturalistic datasets, it's common to see eigen-spectrum plots that look like (A). So it's difficult to interpret much from it other than your samples lie on a line in the space defined by the reactions. For example for two reactions you will get a plot that looks like this: The score plot might be more useful in your case. Because they are useful for clustering, finding outliers, and identifying implicit patterns such as temporal behavior. To take advantage of this, you'll need to use your knowledge of the solutions to figure out what you can say about the score plot being grouped the way it has. For example, let's say you collected the data during different times of the day (morning, evening, etc.) and from these plots you realize that each group corresponds to one of those times. For example, a clustered score plot, might belong to a dataset like this:
