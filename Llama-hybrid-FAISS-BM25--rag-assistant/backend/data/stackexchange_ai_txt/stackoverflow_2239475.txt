http://subversion.wandisco.com/component/content/article/1/40.html I think it's fairly safe to say that amongst developers, the SVN Vs. Git argument has been raging for some time now, with everyone having their own view on which is better. This was even brought up in the of the questions during our Webinar on Subversion in 2010 and Beyond. Hyrum Wright, our Director of Open Source and the President for the Subversion Corporation talks about the differences between Subversion and Git, along with other Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). He also talks about the upcoming changes in Subversion, such as Working Copy Next Generation (WC-NG), which he believes will cause a number of Git users to convert back to Subversion. Have a watch of his video and let us know what you think by either commenting on this blog, or by posting in our forums. Registration is simple and will only take a moment!
