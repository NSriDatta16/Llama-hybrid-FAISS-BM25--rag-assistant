How can I figure out the singularity problem in estimating the indicator variable coefficient in time series model ?

I want to capture the role of the sign of the previous return in my time series model(AR(1) and QAR(1)) in R both with quantile and OLS regression , but I face error. Here is the code: stockreturns22=data.frame(ret22=(data22)[,4], timestamps=(data22)[,2],format="%Y/%m/%d") stockreturns22.ts= xts(stockreturns22$ret22, order.by=as.Date(stockreturns22$timestamps)) rt22=ts(stockreturns22$ret22) tt22=length(rt22) lm22=lm(rt22[-1]~rt22[-tt22]+rt22[-tt22]:I(rt22[-tt22] Here is the answer for the OLS. It can not compute the third coefficient which is for the previous return: Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 504.65017 14.84839 33.99 and the answer for Quantile AutoRegression is : Error in rq.fit.br(x, y, tau = tau, ...) : Singular design matrix How can I fix it? Thanks for your time and consideration
