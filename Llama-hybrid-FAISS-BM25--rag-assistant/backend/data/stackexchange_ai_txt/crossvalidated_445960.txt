Inferential properties of Two-Dimensional Kernel Density Estimation

In r, I create a 70% density contour from a two-dimensional kernel density estimation using library('MASS') prob Let's say I draw a random sample from a bivariate population. Ideally, I would like the 70% contour based on the sample to encircle 70% of population, but how well will this procedure actually perform? I have tried running thousands of iterations using above and noted that on average the specified proportion of the population is encircled by the contour based on the sample (when sample n > 32). However, the encircled proportion in the population varies quite a bit from sample to sample. I'm a bit unsure of how to specify my question, but maybe one way is to ask if I can create a 95 % confidence interval around the (70%) contour based on the sample? Do you generally think this is a good approach to create a contour estimated to encircle a specified proportion of the population?
