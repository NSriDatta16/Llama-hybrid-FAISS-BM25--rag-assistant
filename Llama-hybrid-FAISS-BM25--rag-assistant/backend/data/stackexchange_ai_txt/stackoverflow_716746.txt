The gang of four design patterns book is the standard. I recommend it if you're comfortable with C++. Head first design patterns is good too, especially if you like visual aids and want to feel like you're learning design patterns in a '50s diner. Examples are in Java. There are sometimes multiple ways to implement patterns in a given programming language (for example see this discussion of options for implementing the Singleton pattern in C# ), so it might be worth getting one book to succinctly describe the common patterns, and another to suggest the best way to implement them in your favorite language.
