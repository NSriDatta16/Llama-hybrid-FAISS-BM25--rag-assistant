There is no concept of "subthread" in the way you describe, certainly no (apparent) tree structure. You can adjust the priority of threads if you like, though the actual meaning of thread priority is essentially undefined (unless you go to RTSJ). CPU resource allocation, by and large, is managed by the OS scheduler... you can try to influence it with priorities, but again that's a dicey proposition. If you are looking for a framework to break a problem into subcomponents and process them concurrently, look at JDK5/JDK6's java.util.concurrent package, with specific attention to Callable and the Executor framework. Also, the ForkJoin framework might match.
