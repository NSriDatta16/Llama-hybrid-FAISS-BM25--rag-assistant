Use of DB2 LUW in SMB?

My projects are currently SQL Server focused (with a little Postgres and MongoDB thrown in for fun). A recent project involving some configuration on Oracle reminded me of the complexity of implementing and managing Oracle RDBMS instances compared to the above. Having dealt with DB2 on OS/2 many years ago, I decided to download a trial, and install it on CentOS for comparison. It was a fairly quick and easy implementation, including docs, and sample data. Noting that DB2 LUW seems to get relatively little attention, I am wondering why? In certain editions, it is price competitive, and by many measures, is highly capable and scalable. So, I am interested in knowing, if you use DB2 Express(-C), WSE, or EE, on Linux or Windows, could you share why (if it is your database of choice) ?
