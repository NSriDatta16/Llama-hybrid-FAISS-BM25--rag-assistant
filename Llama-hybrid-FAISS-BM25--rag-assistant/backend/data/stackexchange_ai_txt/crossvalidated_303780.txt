@kjetil b halvorsen has done a good job outlining the main ideas here. Let me add a couple supplementary points. With a categorical variable, suppressing the intercept results in level means coding, instead of the default reference level coding. I explain this in greater detail here: How can logistic regression have a factorial predictor and no intercept? You can use level means coding with multiple categorical variables, but in essence you have to fit the full interaction. In your case, you only wanted to fit the additive model ( y~a+b ); that is what you cannot do, as previously explained. Should you be committed to using level means coding, the procedure is fairly straightforward. You first create a new, single variable as the Cartesian product (the combinations) of all possible levels of your various categorical variables. For example, in place of your original two categorical variables ( a , with 4 levels, and b , with 9), you would have a single variable with 36 levels ( a1b1, a1b2, a1b3, a1b4, a1b5, a1b6, a1b7, a1b8, a1b9, a2b1, ..., a4b9 ). Then you fit your model using level means coding (i.e., suppressing the intercept) with the new variable: mod Note again that this is equivalent to glm(y~a*b, ...) ; it is only that the output will be presented differently.
