Calculate confidence interval over Relative Prediction Error

I am trying to understand the concept of the confidence interval, but I get confused with t-test, p-values, standard deviation, and quantiles. My problem is the following: I created a model in machine learning that predicts a dependent variable. For each prediction, I calculate the Relative Prediction Error ( prediction - true Value / true value ). I want to calculate the confidence interval so that I could say, for example, between the interval [-1, 1] (let's assume that the errors are normally distributed around the 0) is where 95% of the relative errors are. How can I do this? Is it possible to have the distribution of the Relative Prediction Errors with positive or negative skewness? If so, will the intervals, where 95% of the relative errors are, be symmetrical or asymmetrical? (e.g., [-2, 1] or [-1, 2])?
