I have a very similar related question . Not an expert, but based on what I've researched so far and what is highlighted on this page , here are some points that may be helpful in answer to your last question Is it possible that the analysis could be valid despite the non-proportional hazards? As others have mentioned, large sample size may be a factor leading to the violation of the statistical test of the PH assumption. As @EdM mentioned, it will depend on your context/knowledge of the subject as to whether the deviations matter. From page 1461 of this paper When the sample size is small, this method may lack power to detect deviations from PH; while for large sample sizes, hypothesis tests may be over sensitive to slight deviations from this assumption. The answer to this question suggests that the effect of fitting a Cox model with non-proportional hazards is "slightly less power" which can be recovered with robust standard errors, leading to the hazard ratios being interpreted as the time-weighted average of the hazard ratio This interesting paper (Why Test for Proportional Hazards?) was published recently highlighting that there are legitimate reasons to assume violation of PH, and that one of the effects is on the interpretation rather than invalidity of the results. They actually suggest that statistical testing of PH is unnecessary if it's expected that the hazard ratio varies over time. (I'd be interested to hear what others think of this paper) In the section "How should hazard ratios be interpreted?" on page 1402 As a weighted average of the time-varying hazard ratios, the hazard ratio estimate from a Cox proportional hazards model is often used as a convenient summary of the treatment effect during the follow-up. However, a hazard ratio from a Cox model needs to be interpreted as a weighted average of the true hazard ratios over the entire follow-up period. The 95% confidence interval should be estimated using a valid method such as bootstrapping and also using inverse probability weighting to adjust for losses to follow-up.
