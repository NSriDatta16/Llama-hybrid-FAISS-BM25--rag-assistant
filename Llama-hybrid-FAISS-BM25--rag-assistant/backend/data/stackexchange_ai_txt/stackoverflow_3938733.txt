My fix to itellisense was required after that awful refactor utility minced my code. The problem was a class header file that included an #include of itself. The recursive reference destroys itellisense. A symptom of this is if itellisense can see other classes but not the current one. Also: Use #pragma once to eliminate duplicate header loads If the project now takes a very much longer time to load, that itellisense trying to make sense of the conflict that is causing then lack of completion support. Often it is only one class object that is affected, This shows you what files (usually headers) to look at.
