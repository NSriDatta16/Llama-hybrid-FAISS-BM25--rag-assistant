For SPSS, look at : www.mathkb.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/stat-consult/1201/Effect-Size-in-SPSS www.spsstools.net/Syntax/T-Test/StandardizedEffectsSize.txt (maybe better organized) For Stata, I used SIZEFX: Stata module to compute effect size correlations ( findit sizefx at Stata command prompt), but metan as suggested by @onestop is probably more featured.
