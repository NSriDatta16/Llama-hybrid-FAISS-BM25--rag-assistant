The ratio of the sum of square for a given term and the total sum of squares is an actual percentage since the sum of all the sum of squares terms (including residuals) will sum to the total sum of squares. Yes adding more degrees of freedom will increase the sum of squares (but it will also increase the total sum of squares). The ratio of the mean squares is not a strict percentage. However there are functions of the ratios of mean squares that are then refered to as "adjusted $R^2$" values and have the advantage that you state in that when you add more degrees of freedom (add another variable) the $R^2$ value (or ratio of sums of squares) will increase (unless the new df is orthogonal to everything already in the model), but the adjusted $R^2$ will on average stay the same if the new term(s) don't add to the model. The adjusted $R^2$ can sometimes be negative which is a bit harder to interpret.
