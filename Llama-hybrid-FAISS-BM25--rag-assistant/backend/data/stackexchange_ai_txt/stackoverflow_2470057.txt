best scala idiom for find & return

This is something I encounter frequently, but I don't know the elegant way of doing. I have a collection of Foo objects. Foo has a method bar() that may return null or a Bar object. I want to scan the collection, calling each object's bar() method and stop on the first one returning an actual reference and return that reference from the scan. Obviously: foos.find(_.bar != null).bar does the trick, but calls #bar twice.
