This answer comes in two parts, the first a direct answer to the question and the second a commentary on the model you're proposing. The first part relates to the use of Numbers as an offset along with having it on the r.h.s. of the equation. The effect of doing this will simply be to subtract 1 from the estimated coefficient of Numbers , thereby reversing out the effect of the offset, and will not otherwise change the results. The following example, with a few lines of irrelevant output removed, demonstrates this: library(MASS) Numbers summary(glm(Incident~Numbers, family="binomial")) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.3121 -1.0246 -0.8731 1.2512 1.7465 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.99299 0.80624 1.232 0.2181 Numbers -0.11364 0.06585 -1.726 0.0844 . summary(glm(Incident~Numbers, offset=Numbers, family="binomial")) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.3121 -1.0246 -0.8731 1.2512 1.7465 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.99299 0.80624 1.232 0.218 Numbers -1.11364 0.06585 -16.911 Note how everything is the same except the coefficient of Numbers and the null deviance (and the t-statistic, because it's still testing against 0 instead of -1.) The second part relates to the model you are building. Since the incidents are recorded not as the number of incidents in a day but whether there were any incidents in a day, the probability of observing a 1 on day $t$ is $1-(1-p_t)^{N_t}$, where $N_t$ is the number of patients on day $t$ and $p_t$ is the per-patient probability of an incident on day $t$. The usual link function, the logit, would parameterize this as $\log(1-(1-p_t)^{N_t})/N_t\log(1-p_t)$. This indicates that the relationship between the probability of observing a 1 on day $t$ and $N_t$ may not be well-modeled by a linear function on the logit scale. (This may be the case anyway, as one might expect some rough "threshold" below which the quality of patient care is OK but above which the quality of patient care drops rapidly.) Reversing the definition of the probabilities so as to move the $N_t$ in the denominator instead of the numerator still leaves you with that awkward exponential inside the log. One might also suspect that the per-patient probability varies from patient to patient, which would lead to a more complex, hierarchical model, but I won't go into that here. In any case, given this and the limited range of the number of patients you observe, rather than use a model that is linear on the logit scale, it might be better to be nonparametric about the relationship and group the number of patients into three or four groups, for example, 10-11, 12-13, 14-15, and 16-17, construct dummy variables for those groups, then run the logistic regression with the dummy variables on the right hand side. This will better enable the capture of nonlinear relationships such as "the system is overloaded around 16 patients and incidents start to ramp up significantly." If you had a much wider range of patients, I'd suggest a generalized additive model, e.g., 'gam' from the 'mgcv' package.
