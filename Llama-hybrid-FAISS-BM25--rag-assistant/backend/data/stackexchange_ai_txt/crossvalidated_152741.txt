Can a simple linear regression be applied to a time series with non-constant time interval between observations?

I have a strictly ordered series of observations where the time between the observation is not constant. I am wondering if I can apply a simple linear regression on this and treat it as I would treat a time series with a constant time interval between observations? In other words - is it a necessary for the linear regression model to hold that the time interval between observations are consant?
