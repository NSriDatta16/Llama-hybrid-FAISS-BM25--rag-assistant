hypothesis test: difference greater than threshold

Hypothesis tests are commonly framed as $H_0: p_0 = p_1$ vs. $H_1: p_0 \not= p_1$. But I am interested in the case: $H_0: |p_0 - p_1| for some constant $c$. Could I apply a likelihood ratio test? - the degrees of freedom would be the same in both cases, I suppose? Would I have to go Bayesian and apply an (arbitrary) prior?
