Your classpath looks wrong. First, there should be no ; in it (in Unix, the separator is : , but it is not needed at the end). Secondly, do you really have the individual class files in this directory? If there are jar files, you need to either list them individually, or put a * there (but pay attention that bash does not expand it, since you would need : instead of spaces between). I have no idea if this would solve the problem, though.
