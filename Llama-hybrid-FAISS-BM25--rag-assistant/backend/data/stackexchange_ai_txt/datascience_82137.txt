Is is possible to train on Hypergraphs in Keras?

I know that vanilla Keras doesn't support operations with graphs. For example, the Spektral library, based on Keras API, provides some layers to work with simple graphs. However, it doesn't support graphs with multi-node connections (i.e. hypergraphs). Is there any way to train a deep learning model on the hypergraph input data?
