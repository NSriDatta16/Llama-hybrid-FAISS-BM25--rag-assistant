Is there a machine learning model that is able to take reviews as input and output a new and unique blog article from them?

I am looking for a machine learning model ideally with inference speeds of no longer than a few minutes that is able to take in n human written reviews and output a blog article from them. The model would need to be pre-trained or if it does need training using the reviews then the training would not take more than a few minutes on a modern single GPU machine. Can someone point me to such open-source projects?
