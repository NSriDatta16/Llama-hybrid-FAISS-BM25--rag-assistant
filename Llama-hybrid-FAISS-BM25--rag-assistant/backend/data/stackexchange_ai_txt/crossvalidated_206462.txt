Understanding the Application of HMM to a Dataset

I have been working on a dataset that has $1000$ rows and $10$ columns with $1$ response and $9$ predictor variables. The response variable is binary and the predictors are integers. I am thinking to apply hidden Markov model to predict response variable $y$ for given predictors $x_i$, $i=1,...,9$. I have read many documents and forum discussions about how to apply hidden Markov models for prediction purposes. However, I could not clarify/resolve my questions/concerns. Let me tell you what I know about how to apply HMM into my problem, for sure; since $y$ is binary, I have $2$ hidden states; "$0$" and "$1$". What I am not sure is as follows: How should we handle observations? That is; (1) history of $y$ itself could be observations, just like a time series model, (2) one of the predictors could be observations (not sure how to select the one), or (3) all $9$ predictors could be observations. However, when I read the functions of HMM in $R$, observations always defined as sequence of observations , then how to apply the third option? Can sequence of observations be a matrix? Are all these options always available (even might not be options)? How to know which one to choose? If I choose to apply the first option given above, then are observable states (observations) as the same as the hidden states? If I choose to apply the third option given above, how to create emission probabilities for each predictor/observation? I will be using $R$ to solve the problem. Which function would be more suitable for my problem. Because, I have tried the third option with depmixS4 package, but I got "NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 10)" error. Thank you.
