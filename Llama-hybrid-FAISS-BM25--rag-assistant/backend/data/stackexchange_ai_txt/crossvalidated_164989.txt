When you perform principal component analysis (PCA) on your 27 points in 3D, you first subtract the mean vector $\mathbf m$ and then obtain three eigenvectors $\mathbf e_1, \mathbf e_2, \mathbf e_3$ of the covariance matrix. The first two eigenvectors (with two largest eigenvalues) span the plane that you want to find, so the geometric situation looks like that: The question is: how to get from here to the equation of this plane in the form $$ax+by+cz=d.$$ This equation can be reformulated as follows: $\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf x = d$, where $\mathbf x$ is any point lying in the plane and $\mathbf a$ is a vector $(a,b,c)$. In other words, we need to find a vector $\mathbf a$ such that its dot product with any point in the plane gives the same constant value $d$. From the picture above, we see that any point belonging to the plane can be written as $\mathbf x = \mathbf m+ g\mathbf e_1 + h\mathbf e_2$, where $g$ and $h$ are some real numbers. It follows that the dot product between $\mathbf e_3$ and $\mathbf x$ is given by $$\mathbf e_3 \cdot \mathbf x = \mathbf e_3 \cdot (\mathbf m+ g\mathbf e_1 + h\mathbf e_2) = \mathbf e_3 \cdot \mathbf m = \mathrm{const}.$$ So here we have it: we can take $\mathbf a = \mathbf e_3$ and $d = \mathbf e_3 \cdot \mathbf m$. Putting it all together, the solution is: \begin{align} a &= e_{31}\\ b&=e_{32} \\ c&=e_{33} \\ d&=e_{31}m_1+e_{32}m_2 + e_{33}m_3. \end{align}
