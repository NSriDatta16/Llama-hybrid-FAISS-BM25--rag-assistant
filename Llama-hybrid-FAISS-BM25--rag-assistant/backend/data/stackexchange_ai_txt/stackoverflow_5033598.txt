UIKit's [NSString sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:] in AppKit

Is there any equivalent method in AppKit (for Cocoa on Mac OS X) that does the same thing as UIKit's [NSString sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:] ? If not, how could I go about getting the amount of space needed to render a particular string constrained to a width/height? Update: Below is a snippet of code I'm using that I expect would produce the results I'm after. NSDictionary *attributes = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: [NSFont systemFontOfSize: [NSFont smallSystemFontSize]], NSFontAttributeName, [NSParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle], NSParagraphStyleAttributeName, nil]; NSSize size = NSMakeSize(200.0, MAXFLOAT); NSRect bounds; bounds = [@"This is a really really really really really really really long string that won't fit on one line" boundingRectWithSize: size options: NSStringDrawingUsesFontLeading attributes: attributes]; NSLog(@"height: %02f, width: %02f", bounds.size.height, bounds.size.width); I would expect that the output width would be 200 and the height would be something greater than the height of a single line, however it produces: height: 14.000000, width: 466.619141 Thanks!
