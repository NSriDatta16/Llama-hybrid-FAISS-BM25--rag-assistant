Adding Multi-User Approval Process in trac Workflow

I have selected trac for my organization's project management tool; and I'd like to modify the default workflow as follows: A new "enhancement" ticket can be created by all members All new "enhancement" tickets need to be approved by the same 4 people before it can be assigned to a developer for work. "defect" & "task" tickets need not have the approval process. I know I have to modify the [ticket-workflow] area of the trac.ini; but I can't figure out how to limit developer assignment until the ticket has essentially been approved. I understand this is not an optimal workflow/process; but it's something that I have inherited and have to conform to until I can change it. Thanks!
