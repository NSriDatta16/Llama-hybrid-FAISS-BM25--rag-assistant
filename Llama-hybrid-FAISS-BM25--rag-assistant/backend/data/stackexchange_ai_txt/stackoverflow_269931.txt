Creating a csv-file, doesn't work with right-click save-as

I have a script that generates data in csv format which is sent to the user along with a set of headers that tell the browser it is a .csv file. Everything works great when users (left)click on the link to the script, they are presented with a download dialog with the filename ending in .csv and it suggests using excel, or calc, to open it. However, when users right-click and choose Save As it is being saved with the php script name. Here is the header code: header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); // set expiration time header("Content-Type: application/force-download"); header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Type: application/download"); $val = date("m_d_Y_g_i"); Header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="personal_information_'.$val.'.csv"'); So again, when users left-click it saves the file as personal_information_date.csv; when they right click it saves as download.php. I'm using FF3. Oddly enough, IE7 does not have this problem. Any ideas?
