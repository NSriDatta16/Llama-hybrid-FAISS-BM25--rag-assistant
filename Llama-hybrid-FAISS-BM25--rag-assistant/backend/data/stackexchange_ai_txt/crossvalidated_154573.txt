Random Forest online/incremental learning in R

Is there a Random Forest implementation available in R, that supports online learning? My alternative approach was to use the popular randomForest package and combine Random Forests (the existing one and the new one trained with the new data) to implement a simple online-learning approach. But therefore I have to remove trees from the random forest, so my second question is: Can I somehow remove trees from an existing random forest in R?
