Nope, it doesn't. I know it's very irritating. My first try at solving this issue (I had the same issue) was adding these usings: using FilterRandom = BusinessLayer.FilterElements.FilterRandom; The problem then becomes that you have to add one for every sub namespace you want to include, and that becomes a mess. How I permanently solved this is by changing the namespaces in the project so that, in your example, FilterRandom would e.g. be in BusinessLayer . The problem you are actually seeing is that you have too many namespaces. It isn't strange it happens. They are a great way of organizing your code and classes and it's not that hard to have it go out of hand. What I mean by changing the namespaces is that I merged many small namespaces into larger ones. This sometimes means renaming classes, but my opinion is that the class name on itself should be meaningful, without the namespace prefix. This way, I permanently solved these issues in my project (60kloc) and it worked out great.
