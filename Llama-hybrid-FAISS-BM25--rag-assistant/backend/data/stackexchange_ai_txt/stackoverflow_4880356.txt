Use NSButton's -setAttributedTitle: method to send it an attributed string. for basic formatting. For anything "fancy", however, you'll likely have to subclass NSButtonCell and handle the drawing yourself using one of the "draw with attributes" methods with a custom NSParagraphStyle as one of the attributes for paragraph alignment, etc.
