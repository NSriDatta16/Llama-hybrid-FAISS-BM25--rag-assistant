Why aren't Genetic Algorithms used for optimizing neural networks?

From my understanding, Genetic Algorithms are powerful tools for multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, training Neural Networks (especially deep ones) is hard and has many issues (non-convex cost functions - local minima, vanishing and exploding gradients etc.). Also I'm that conceptually training a NN with GA is feasible. I was wondering, why aren't they used in practice? Is it a matter of performance?
