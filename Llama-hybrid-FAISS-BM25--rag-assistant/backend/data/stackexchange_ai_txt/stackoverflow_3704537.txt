It is not the question WHY? It is Demanded, as in, we WANT to monitor a DIV when it is resized. For obvious example, jQuery UI, resizable. Yeah, user resized a div by mouse drag, now what? Maybe the content inside is resized and we want to know about it. And should we have all the code in a giant melting pot within the original reszing code? I don't think so. Another speedy browser that does nothing, sigh.
