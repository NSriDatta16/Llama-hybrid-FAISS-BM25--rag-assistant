GUI frameworks for Java

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions of frameworks to give an old desktop application a much needed facelift. The application has had a long life without anyone giving any attention to its exterior resulting in a monster with an 80s look. I've just downloaded and tried MyDoggy framework for making windows floatable and dockable. So I'm looking similar for quick and easy fixes that will bring a dead looking application back to life.
