Disclaimer: I am an extensive user of R Shiny and R in general and I have not used any of the other above mentioned tools (Tableau, QlikView, SAP Lumira). In this post I would like to outline some of the major benefits/differences of Shiny compared to the other tools. PRICING RShiny comes for free. However some features cost extra. The RStudio Shiny Server Pro Licence costs \$9995 per Year for 20 users. RShinyPricing Deploying the apps may cost extra if you are looking for special feature like premium support or custom domains. Tableau Tableau costs you at least \$999, but it comes for free if you are a student or an instructor. Tableau pricing . A free trial for limited time is available Qlikview Qlikview has a free version, but the free version is very basic and you have to buy an upgrade to use it professionall QlikView pricing SAP Lumira Similarly to Tableau you can have a free trial. However if you use it permanently you have to pay 185$ per User. SAP Lumira Pricing RStudio clearly has the better pricing. Freeware is always cheaper than expensive commercial products. DataImport The BI Tools have access to many different data sources. Among other tableau can import data from SAP, Excel and Salesforce. Also QlikView can import data from many different sources. Most commonly people import data from Excel, CSV or SQL Server. Also SAP Lumira can import data from many different types of data, e.g. excel, CSV and SAP. However RShiny can take its data “directly from R”. You can use all the data import libraries on CRAN or Github and you can use your own onces. The dataimport libraries in R include RODBC (for relational databases), foreign (e.g. for Stata files and SAS files), xlsx (for excel files), Neo4j (for data from graph databases) and readr (for many different datatypes, e.g. tsv files). Here is a library which imports data from SAP directly to R(Shiny). I have never heard of any of the other tools importing data from xlsx, Stata, SAS or Neo4j. Therefore RShiny is the clear winner In dataImport. Calculation of specific statistical values Well, R Shiny is part of R and R is the statistics language with the most different algorithms implemented. This points clearly goes to RShiny. Advanced data visualisation RShiny can be combined with all other data visualization libraries: ggplot2, htmltable, igraph, plotrix and lattice just to name a few. Note that many JavaScript libraries (e.g. plotly.js, d3, Datatables and dygraphs) are also implemented in R. Have a look at the htmlwidget library. You can also use extensions of RShiny such as shinyjs or you can include html, css and JavaScript easily. Therefore RShiny offers more flexibility concerning data visualization. Steeper learning curve RShiny might have a steeper learning curve, but if you are good at RShiny you also learn programming and it will be easier to learn other programming languages especially functional programming languages such as F# or Closure. Reproducability Anyone can take your app with the code install RStudio and deploy it. As far as I know drag- and -drop tools such as Tableau do only offers very sparse options concerning Reproducability.
