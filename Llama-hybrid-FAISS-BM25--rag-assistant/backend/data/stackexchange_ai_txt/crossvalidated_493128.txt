Can we generate simulated data using result of Logistic regression?

I have an outcome y (binary) and two variables x1 and x2 (continuous and independent). I have fitted logistic regression y~x1 and y~x2 in two different datasets, but I don't have a dataset that records both x1, x2 and y. I wish to generate a simulated dataset that follows the two fitted logistic regression (i.e. when I fit y~x1 and y~x2 separately in the simulated dataset, the coefficients should be close to the coefficients I obtained in the two real datasets). I have no clue how to achieve this using R and I wish to learn from you. Any help would be appreciated.
