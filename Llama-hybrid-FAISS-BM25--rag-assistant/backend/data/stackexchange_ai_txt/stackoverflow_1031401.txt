You'll probably need to subclass UITableView and override whatever touch events are appropriate ( touchesBegan:withEvent ;, touchesEnded:withEvent , etc.) Inspect the events to see how many touches there were, and do your custom behavior. Don't forget to call through to UITableView's touch methods, or else you won't get the default behavior.
