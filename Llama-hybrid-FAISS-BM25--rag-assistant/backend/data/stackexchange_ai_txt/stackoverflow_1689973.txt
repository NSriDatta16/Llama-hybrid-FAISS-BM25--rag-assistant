Since you can't get the url from Internet Explorer's history using IUrlHistoryStg::EnumUrls http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767720%28VS.85%29.aspx try making sure the file association is setup one the box and that your app can take a file path from the command line to start up. I added these keys to my registry [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.sdr] @="sdrfile" [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\sdrfile\shell\open\command] @="\"D:\\Shenanigans\\MyGreatApp.exe\" \"%1\"" on a Win7 box and IE/Sharepoint figured it out. If you poke around HKCR you'll see that it can get more complicated to setup file associations, but see if this works.
