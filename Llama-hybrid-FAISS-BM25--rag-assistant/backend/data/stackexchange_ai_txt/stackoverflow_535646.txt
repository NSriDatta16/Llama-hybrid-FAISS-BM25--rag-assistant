What are good "real" programming examples for a beginning programmer?

I've been browsing Bjarne Stroustrup's new introductory programming book, Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ . It's meant for first-year university computer science and engineering students. Early on in the book he works through an interesting extended example of creating a desktop calculator where he ends up implementing an arithmetic expression evaluator (that takes bracketed expressions and operator precedence into account) in a series of co-recursive functions based on a grammar. This is a very interesting example, although arguably on the complex side for a lot of beginners. I wonder what others thing of this particular example: would learning programming by seeing how to implement an expression parser excite and motivate you, or would it discourage you because of all the details and complexity? Are there other good "real" programming examples for beginners?
