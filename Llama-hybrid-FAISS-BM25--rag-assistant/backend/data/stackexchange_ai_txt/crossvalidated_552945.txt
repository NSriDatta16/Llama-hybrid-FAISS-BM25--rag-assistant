Evaluating $P(X_{3}=j,X_{1}=i|X_{2}=k)$ on markov chain trouble

I just would like to evaluate $P(X_{3}=j,X_{1}=i|X_{2}=k)$ So I tried: $P(X_{3}=j,X_{1}=i|X_{2}=k) =P(X_{3}=j|X_{2}=k)P(X_{1}=i|X_{2}=k)$ The trouble is evaluating $P(X_{1}=i|X_{2}=k)$ I tried $P(X_{1}=i|X_{2}=k)=P(X_{1}=i)$ since I think the past doesnt depend from future and I applied total probability theorem so: $P(X_1=i)=\sum_{l \in S}P(X_1=i|X_0=l)$ where $S$ is the state space. But I'm not sure if this independence holds if not what should I do? PS: Assume transition matrix is known so $\sum_{l \in S}P(X_1=i|X_0=l)$ is known.
