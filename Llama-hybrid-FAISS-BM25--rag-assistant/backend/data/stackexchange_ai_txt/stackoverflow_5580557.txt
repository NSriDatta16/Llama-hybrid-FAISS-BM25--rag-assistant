Possible anticrawler

For an educational NLP project I need a list of all Italian words. I thought I would write a crawler that will get the words from www.wordreference.com. I use Python with the mechanize crawler framework. but when i use the code: br = mechanize.Browser() br.open("http://www.wordreference.com/iten/abaco") html = br.response().get_data() print html I get some page from "yahoo.com". is it possible this website has an anticrawler mechanism?
