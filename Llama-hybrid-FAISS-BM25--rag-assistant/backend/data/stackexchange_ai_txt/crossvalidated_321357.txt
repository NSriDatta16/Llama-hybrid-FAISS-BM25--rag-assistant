There are two good papers to tell you a lot about the Shapley Value Regression: Lipovetsky, S. (2006). Entropy criterion in logistic regression and Shapley value of predictors . Journal of Modern Applied Statistical Methods, 5(1), 95-106. Mishra, S.K. (2016). Shapley Value Regression and the Resolution of Multicollinearity . Journal of Economics Bibliography, 3(3), 498-515. I also wrote a computer program (in Fortran 77) for Shapely regression. It is available here .
