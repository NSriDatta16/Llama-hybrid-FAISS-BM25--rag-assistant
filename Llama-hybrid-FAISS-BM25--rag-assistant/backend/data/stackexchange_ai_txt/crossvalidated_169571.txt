If you look at the problem as a linear regression problem (linear probit to be correct), the predicted values will not be bound by [1,0]. Therefore points satisfying 0.5= β0+ β1x′1+ β2x′2 will not be the same set of points obtained from the logistic regression. In logistic regression the predicted values are always between 0 and 1.
