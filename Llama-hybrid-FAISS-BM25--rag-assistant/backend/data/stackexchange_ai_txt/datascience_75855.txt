What types of matrix multiplication are used in Machine Learning? When are they used?

I'm looking at equations for neural networks and backpropagation and I see this symbol in the equations, ⊙. I thought matrix multiplication of neural networks always involved matrices that matched dimensions on both sides, such as... [3, 3]@[3, 2]. (This is what is happening in the animated gif). What part of a neural net uses a Hadamard product and which uses the Kronecker product? Because I see this notation for the Hadamard product (⊙) in papers and deep learning learning materials.
