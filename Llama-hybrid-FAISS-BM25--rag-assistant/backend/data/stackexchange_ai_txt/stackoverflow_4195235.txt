I use jQuery UI a lot because of the drag and drop function, that is not present on jQuery Tools. Some time I use jQuery Tools for the tooltip that is not present on jQuery Ui. So I would say that you would need to check what you need before picking one. Both have the option to build custom packages with what you need to make them lighter. In both cases, to learn them the demos are a good place to start, documentation its quite good.
