Reading byte stream returned from JavaEE server

We have a JavaEE server and servlets providing data to mobile clients (first JavaME, now soon iPhone). The servlet writes out data using the following code: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(out); dos.writeInt(someInt); dos.writeUTF(someString); ... and so on This data is returned to the client as bytes in the HTTP response body, to reduce the number of bytes transferred. In the iPhone app, the response payload is loaded into NSData object. Now, after spending hours and hours trying to figure out how to read the data out in the Objective-C application, I'm almost ready to give up, as I haven't found any good way to read the data into NSInteger and NSString (as corresponding to above protocol) Would anyone have any pointers how to read stuff out from a binary protocol written by a java app? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!
