SVM is an algorithm that is based on distances since it tries to maximize the margin between the support vectors. If one of the features would have much larger values than another it would dominate the distance results and the other feature would have a lesser effect on the result even if it changes significantly. By scaling the features to the same range, the algorithm would be sensitive to all of them and not biased to the features with the greater magnitude.
