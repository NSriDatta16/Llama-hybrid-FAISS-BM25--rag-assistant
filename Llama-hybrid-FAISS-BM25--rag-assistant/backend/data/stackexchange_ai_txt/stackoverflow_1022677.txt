Off the top of my head Lua ... supports coroutines has no restriction to just string/number as key for a table. Everything works. the error handling is somewhat clumsy. Either you don't handle anything or use the pcall method I think I read something about differences in the lexical scope and that Lua has the better one. If I recall correctly regular expression support in lua is limited
