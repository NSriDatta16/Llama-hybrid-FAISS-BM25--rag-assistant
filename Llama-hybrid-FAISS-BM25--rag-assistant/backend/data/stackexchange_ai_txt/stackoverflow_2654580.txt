How to resize NSTextView according to its content?

I am trying to set an attributed string within NSTextView. I want to increase its height based on its content, initially it is set to some default value. So I tried this method: I set content in NSTextView. When we set some content in NSTextView its size automatically increases. So I increased height of its super view that is NSScrollView to its height, but NSScrollView is not getting completely resized, it is showing scroller on right. float xCoordinate = 15.0; [xContentViewScroller setFrame:NSMakeRect(xCoordinate, 0.0, 560.0, 10.0)]; [[xContentView textStorage] setAttributedString:xContents]; float xContentViewScrollerHeight = [xfContentView frame].size.height + 2; [xContentViewScroller setFrame:NSMakeRect(xCoordinate, 0.0, 560.0, xContentViewScrollerHeight)]; Can anyone suggest me some way or method to resolve this issue. By doing google search I found that in UITextView there is contentSize method which can get size of its content, I tried to find similar method in NSTextView but could not get any success :(
