Copy-on-write is a storage scheme where copies of an object with duplicate values are represented by a single object. Only when you try to change one is it copied to a new, unique object. Boost supports this by telling you whether a given shared_ptr is supporting more than one reference. If it is, then writing to the object will require making a copy. The manual is saying that if you have NULL pointers in such a scheme, they might report being either unique or not. Really, Boost is being generous by even allowing such an operation.
