To write a function in C, that can be used from PHP, you'll have to write an extension. There are not that many informations about that available, unfortunatly... Still, searching through my bookmarks, here are the links I found : Extension Writing Part I: Introduction to PHP and Zend Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs [continued] Extension Writing Part III: Resources Wrapping C++ Classes in a PHP Extension And, if you are really interested by the subject, and ready to spend some money on it, you could buy the book Extending and Embedding PHP ( some pages are available as preview on Google Books too) ; I've seen a couple of times that it was the book to read when interested on this subject (In fact, I've bought it some time ago, and it's an interesting read) BTW, the author of that book is also the author of the first four articles I linked to ;-)
