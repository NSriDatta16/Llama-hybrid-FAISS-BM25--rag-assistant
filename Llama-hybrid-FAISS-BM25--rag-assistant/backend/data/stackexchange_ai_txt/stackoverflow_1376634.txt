You will save space for a given precision if you use fixed point math given the requirements you describe, because you can use just the number of bits you need in order to store the fractional portion. However, most compilers store a float as a 32 bit value and most fixed-point math libraries I have seen also use 32 bits as storage. Unless you can represent the number ranges you need (whole and fractional part) using a 16-bit fixed-point number, there will be no storage difference between float and (32-bit) int. Bottom Line Unless you want to deal with 16-bit fixed-point numbers, int and float probably use the same amount of storage on your system.
