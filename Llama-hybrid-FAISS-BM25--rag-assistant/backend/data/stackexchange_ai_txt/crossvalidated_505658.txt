With respect to the last issue, you treat them as comparisons. R has made the "none" the base category, so we interpret it as follows: For animals with no treatment, as compared to those with low treatment, there is a -239.50 change in value, on average. Repeat the comparison with None vs other condition. You can change what becomes the base "comparison" category by setting the variable as a factor and specifying the base.
