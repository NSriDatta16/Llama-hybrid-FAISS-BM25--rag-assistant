If you really want to be as painless as possible for you and your users, consider extending python rather than embedding. embedding doesn't allow easy integration with other software -- only one program that embeds python can be used at once by a python script. OTOH extending means the user can use your software anywhere python runs; To make stuff available for the script writer, you don't have to initialize an interpreter. the interpreter will be already initialized for you, saving you work. You don't have to create special built-in variables and fake modules to inject into your embedded interpreter. Just give them a real extension module instead, and you can initialize everything when your module is first imported. You can use distutils to distribute your software Tools like virtualenv can be used as-is -- you or the user don't have to come up with new tools. Your user can also use her IDE/debug tool/testing framework of choice Embedding really buys nothing to you and your users.
