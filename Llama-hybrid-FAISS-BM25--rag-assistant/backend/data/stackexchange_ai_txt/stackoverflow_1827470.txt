Rhino mocks - does this test look sensible?

I have just crafted the following test using Rhino mocks. Does my test look valid and make sense to those more experienced with mocking? I am a a little confused that I haven't had to use the DynamicMock() or StrictMock() methods to create a seemingly valid test. This test tests that the Add method was invoked on the supplied ICachingStrategy with the supplied parameters. object o = new object(); DateTime d = new DateTime(DateTime.Now.Year, DateTime.Now.Month, DateTime.Now.Day + 1, 0, 0, 0); CacheStorageStyle s = CacheStorageStyle.Unmodified; string f = "test"; //arrange var stubStrategy = MockRepository.GenerateStub (); var stubEncoder = MockRepository.GenerateStub (); stubStrategy.Stub(x => x.Add(o,d,s,f)).Return("test:key"); stubEncoder.Stub(x => x.Encode(o,s)).Return(o); _mocks.ReplayAll(); //act ICache c = new Cache(stubStrategy, stubEncoder); c.Add(o, d, s, f); //assert stubStrategy.AssertWasCalled(x => x.Add(o,d,s,f));
