How do I get my netbeans drag and drop widget to know whether it is rendering inside the netbeans design view window or the running application?

How do I get my netbeans drag and drop widget to know whether it is rendering inside the netbeans design view window or the running application? I'm trying to do some custom rendering. I think it has to do with the root container.
