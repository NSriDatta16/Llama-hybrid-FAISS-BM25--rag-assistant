Can database fields be dragged and dropped (as textboxes, not a gridview) into an ASP.Net form?

In VisualStudio, when you drag and drop a table or an individual column from a data connection in server explorer, a gridview is created. What I want to be able to do is drag and drop the columns to make a quick and dirty detail form to display an individual record. Is this possible in any way? An even better way to do this would be via a custom T4 or LLBLGen template but I have no clue how to do this. Any other suggested approaches? UPDATE: A DetailsView is the type of thing I am looking for, in that you can select a data source and the specific columns you want, but I'd like to be able to have manual control of the layout and formatting after the initial drag and drop.
