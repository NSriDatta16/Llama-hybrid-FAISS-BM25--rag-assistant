Best tool for multivariate nonlinear regression

I have a data set which has 7 continuous variables, r0 ... r6 and I need to predict 2 continuous variables, x and y . These variables are quite correlated but the pattern is nonlinear. To explain the relationship between each variable, the problem is a little bit as follows: r0 to r6 are the radii of different circles, whose centre, (x0, y0) ... (x6, y6) , we do not know. We want to predict (x,y) where the circles intersect each other. With a training data set with rows that looks like this: [32,15,12,11,19,24,12],[35.124,14.224] I am hoping to find a tool which gives me the coordinates for unseen values of r0 to r6 . In reality r0 to r6 are actually sensor readings, so they won't be actual radii, and they will be noisy, but the example hopefully explains the nonlinear relationship between them. I am very new to regression and machine learning in general, so I am hoping to be pointed to the right toolset to use in this case. What is the best tool to look at? Do I need to do any pre-processing to make the input more compatible with the existent tools?
