I would say that it's because difference in $R^2$ has a very clear interpretation: "How much more of the variance is accounted for by the more complicated model?" A good statistician will then weigh that improvement against the added complexity. Adjusted $R^2$ , AFAIK, has no easy interpretation. It's an attempt to automate the judgment that the researcher uses in my first paragraph.
