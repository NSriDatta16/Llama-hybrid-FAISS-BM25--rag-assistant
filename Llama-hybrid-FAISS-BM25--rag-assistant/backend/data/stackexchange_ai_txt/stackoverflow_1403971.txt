XPath to return string concatenation of qualifying child node values

Can anyone please suggest an XPath expression format that returns a string value containing the concatenated values of certain qualifying child nodes of an element, but ignoring others: This text node should be returned. And the value of this element. And this. But this paragraph element should be ignored. The returned value should be a single string: This text node should be returned. And the value of this element. And this. Is this possible in a single XPath expression? Thanks.
