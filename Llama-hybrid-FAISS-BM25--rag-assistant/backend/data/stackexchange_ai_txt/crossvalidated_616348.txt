What should I do with structural breaks at return time series?- R

Let say I have the below time series data(It is a return data of a financial derivative): x I want to determine whether there is stuctural change at the time series. First, I determine the arima model using auto.arima procedure. Then I apply the below ols-cusum procedure to determine the whether there is a structural break: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/104324/strucchange-package-on-arima-model The code is below: z $coefficients sigma $process type.name $lim.process datatsp The result is as below: Plot shows that there are structural breaks at the data. It seemd to me strange. I wonder how to fit an arima model to this data without structural breaks. How should I deal with this data? Thanks a lot.
