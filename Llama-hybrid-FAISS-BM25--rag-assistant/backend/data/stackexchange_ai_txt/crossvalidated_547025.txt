How to proof that the square of the half-margin of maximum-margin SVM is equal to the summation of lagrange multipliers given by SVM dual?

Can be show that the square of the half-margin of maximum-margin SVM is equal to the summation of Lagrange multipliers given by SVM dual? i.e, Let $ \rho = \dfrac{1}{w}\\ $ Show that: $$ \dfrac{1}{\rho^2} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i $$ where $\alpha_i$ are Lagrange multipliers
