What is the relevance of bootstrapped confidence intervals on markov chain transition matrices?

Am I right in thinking that bootstrapping is just replicating your original data x amount of times? So I have a series of $n=20$ sequences of varying length containing the letters ACGTE. The probability of having C after to A is $$ P(X_C=x_C|X_A=x_A), $$ and which can be calculated from the set of sequences, thus $$ \widehat{P_{ij}}=\displaystyle \frac{x_{ij}}{\sum^mx_{ik}}\quad \text{where m=ACGT or E}. $$ Assume this is $\widehat{P}\rightarrow P$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. However I don't have enough sequences to produce a full transition matrix $P$, instead I have a sparse matrix: \begin{align} \widehat{P}=&\begin{pmatrix} 0& 0 & 0& 1.00& 0\\ 0& 0 & 0.22& 0.44& 0.33\\ 0& 0.19& 0.57& 0.10& 0.14\\ 0.03& 0.19& 0.09& 0.50& 0.19\\ 0& 0.06& 0.13& 0.56& 0.25\\ \end{pmatrix} . \end{align} This source suggests that I can use bootstrapping to increase my sample size and get a better approximationg of $P$: arxiv.org/pdf/0905.4131v1.pdf However, what does this really tell me? Nothing more useful if I don't have more real data right? How do confidence intervals ( http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/46/88/04/PDF/estimvar_final.pdf ) make it credible all of a sudden?
