I think you already got the answer yourself: Moving the pen results in some other event than a simple click, perhaps maybe a Drag and drop like event. I'm not sure whether it's a Java/Swing or a Wacom problem, it could be that the tablet doesn't register the clicks as such but as drag events, or it could be that swing interprets the events incorrectly.
