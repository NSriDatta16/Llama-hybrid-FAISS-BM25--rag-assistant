Predict user's next login time

I am trying to implement a model to predict the next time a user will login to some system. The only data I have is the user ID and the login time. The distribution for the time between each users' logins (in seconds) is exponential. I'm struggling to implement a model that one could use to predict the next n $\Delta_t$ . There was a very similar question previously asked, and The answer was to model the data as such: $ (\Delta_t)i∼$ Exponential $(\lambda_i)$ $i=1…N$ $λi∼P(λ)$ Where the Exponential distribution is paramatarised by $\lambda$ and the $P$ is the distribution for $\lambda_i$ which are gamma distributed. I'm strugging to understand how I would implement this in Python using numpy or scipy for example. I'm very familiar with training machine learning models using scikit-Learn or PyTorch, but how would I implement the model above? Given the data below, where do I go next? time_between_logins = scipy.stats.expon.rvs(450, 80000, 1000)
