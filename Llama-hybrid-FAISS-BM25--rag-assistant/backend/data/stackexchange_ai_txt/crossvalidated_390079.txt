Detection of music note sequence in audio signal

I have an audio signal which contains the combination of different western music notes(I know this combination in advance) and I want to identify the sequence of the music notes present in it. For this, I am following the below steps: Firstly, I am identifying all the dominant frequencies present in that signal using PredominantPitchMelodia algorithm of essentia library of python. The output of this algorithm provides me the vector array of dominant frequencies. Now, I want to distinguish between different music notes present in the signal with the help of this vector array of frequencies. This array of frequencies also contains noise from the environment, which I don’t want to remove. The above figure shows the combination of 8 notes which I need to differentiate. Following are the methods I tried: I tried to identify the sequence using k-means clustering method. But k-means clustering is not suitable for time series signal. The main drawback of using k-means is that when we do clustering, the noise frequency present in one note might lie in the frequency cluster of other note. So instead of considering it as noise, the algorithm considers it in the cluster of previous note. I am also thinking to implement moving average but again I am doubtful that it might alter my data and the result might not be that accurate. I also thought of creating an adaptive window which could shift in time and do clustering frame by frame. No idea how to implement this adaptive window and whether it is a good method or not. Again for adaptive window, I should know the window size in prior. And if I could guess the window size to form cluster for one note then I actually don’t need to cluster anymore because I already have the boundary points. To find the boundary points, maybe segmentation could be useful which is used to detect silence in audio signals but my data need not contain silence between two notes. And again segmentation might require training data(supervised learning) Please help me to figure out the solution for this problem.
