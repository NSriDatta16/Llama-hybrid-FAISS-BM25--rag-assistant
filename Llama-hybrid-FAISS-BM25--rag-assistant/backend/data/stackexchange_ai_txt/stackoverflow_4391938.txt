I have solved this problem in two ways (both using jquery): cookies and mysql. The concept would be a $('select[name=foo]').change(function(){ $.cookie('dropdown', $(this).val()); }); so that when you change the dropdown, you now have a cookie. in upload.php you can then call that cookie and use it as your variable. The other option was $('select[name=foo]').change(function(){ $.post('updatedatabase.php', {'dropdown': $(this).val()}); }); Then you'd call your database from upload.php to get the last value of your dropdown. neither way is very elegant, but I've gotten them working before. I would love if someone posted a more elegant solution.
