Managing web service views/templates for several clients

I have a server-side web service that serves to multiple clients. Clients include web browsers, iPhone, BlackBerry, Android etc. My question is, I need to be able to generate dynamic content for views to these clients. Be it a full blown HTML template, an HTML snippet, JSON, XML, etc. Depending on the user-agent of the requesting client, a different "view" template gets generated and spat out by the web server. My question is, are there any elegant "view" frameworks or styles out there to adapt that simplify managing all of these snippets/fragments/full templates into some orderly fashion? I've been looking for an elegant way to manage this myriad of client handling, with straight forward maintenance and a simple hand off procedure to User Interface developers.
