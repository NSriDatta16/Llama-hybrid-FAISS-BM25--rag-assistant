I try to show one aspect of similarity and difference in this example: We have a sample from a population, everybody agrees that Xbar is the best estimate we have for mu. Frequentist point of view: Xbar is a random variable that its probability density function is concentrated around mu. The constant mu is probably close to my xbar in this range called Confidence Interval. Bayesian point of view: Mu is an unknown variable for me, conditional to this data (my sample), if I bet that the population mean is close to Xbar within this range called Credible Interval, I expect to win most of the time. Great statisticians in the forum, please correct my answer if needed. Yours, Amir
