Yes, more precisely, the arrow from (a) to (b) indicates that variable a is not conditioned by variable b. Quoting from Christopher M. Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , Section 8.1 : Then, for each conditional distribution we add directed links (arrows) to the graph from the nodes corresponding to the variables on which the distribution is conditioned. The next example in the book is that if we have the following factorization of a density $ p(a, b, c) = p(c|a,b)p(b|a)p(a)$ the associated graph will be:
