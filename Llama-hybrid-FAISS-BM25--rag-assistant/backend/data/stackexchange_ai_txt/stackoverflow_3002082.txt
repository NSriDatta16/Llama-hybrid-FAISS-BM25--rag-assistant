Entity Framework 4 mapping fragment error when adding new entity scalar

I have an Entity Framework 4 model-first design. I create a first draft of my model in the designer and all was well. I compiled, generated database, etc. Later on I tried to add a string scalar (Nullable = true) to one of my existing entities and I keep getting this type of error when I compile: Error 3004: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 569: No mapping specified for properties MyEntity.MyValue in Set MyEntities. An Entity with Key (PK) will not round-trip when: Entity is type [MyEntities.MyEntity] I keep having to manually open the EDMX file and correct the XML whenever I add scalars. Ideas on what's going on?
