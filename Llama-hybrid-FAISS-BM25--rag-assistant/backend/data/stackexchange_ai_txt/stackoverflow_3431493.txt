You have no choice but to set up something like an ajax mechanism. It doesn't have to be XMLHttpRequest but it has to be some explicit communication from the browser to a URL on your server. Think about it: the Javascript is running inside a client browser. How is it going to get the load average of the server without actually communicating with the server?
