Triggers are generally used incorrectly, introduce bugs and therefore should be avoided. Never design a trigger to do integrity constraint checking that crosses rows in a table (e.g "the average salary by dept cannot exceed X). Tom Kyte , VP of Oracle has indicated that he would prefer to remove triggers as a feature of the Oracle database because of their frequent role in bugs. He knows it is just a dream, and triggers are here to stay, but if he could he would remove triggers from Oracle, he would (along with the WHEN OTHERS clause and autonomous transactions). Can triggers be used correctly? Absolutely. The problem is - they are not used correctly in so many cases that I'd be willing to give up any perceived benefit just to get rid of the abuses (and bugs) caused by them. - Tom Kyte
