I like SQLite as a solution. It is easy to provide a pre-populated DB, and beyond that you simply hook your app into some methods that can Add/Delete/Update records. Your issue isn't going to be solved with SQLite - the problem is memory management. Get that wrong, and it doesn't matter where you store your data. Separate the 2 concerns - displaying vs storage. Get the displaying to work right, then worry about where to store the data.
