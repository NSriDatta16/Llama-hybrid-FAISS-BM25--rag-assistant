Why do we assign probability to theta even though we consider it constant in frequentist statistics?

i am trying to understand the differences between bayesian and frequentist statistics. I read that in frequentist statistics the unknown population parameter theta is considered a constant but in DerSimonian and Laird method the assign for example a Normal Probability distribution theta ~ N[μ,τ^2]. Can anyone clarify how a quantity is considered a constant if it has a probability distribution?
