Using k-fold cross-validation for time-series model selection

Question: I want to be sure of something, is the use of k-fold cross-validation with time series is straightforward, or does one need to pay special attention before using it? Background: I'm modeling a time series of 6 year (with semi-markov chain), with a data sample every 5 min. To compare several models, I'm using a 6-fold cross-validation by separating the data in 6 year, so my training sets (to calculate the parameters) have a length of 5 years, and the test sets have a length of 1 year. I'm not taking into account the time order, so my different sets are : fold 1 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6] fold 2 : training [1 2 3 4 6], test [5] fold 3 : training [1 2 3 5 6], test [4] fold 4 : training [1 2 4 5 6], test [3] fold 5 : training [1 3 4 5 6], test [2] fold 6 : training [2 3 4 5 6], test [1]. I'm making the hypothesis that each year are independent from each other. How can I verify that? Is there any reference showing the applicability of k-fold cross-validation with time series.
