One way to think about a GLM model without an offset is that it models a transformation of the expected value of the response variable as a function of the predictor variables included in the model. (Synonims for the word expected include mean and average .) The transformation being used depends on the link function used when fitting the model. If the GLM model is a Poisson model with a log link, then you are modelling the log expected value of the response variable as a function of the predictor variables. The response variable is a count variable. As an example, let’s say that your response variable is the number of salmon returning to their spawning ground and that you record the values of this variable each year for 20 years. Your Poisson model includes a single predictor, year. The model assumes that year has a linear effect on the log expected number of salmon returning to their spawing ground: $log(expected number) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 year$ if you exponentiate the coefficient $\beta_1$ , you get the multiplicative factor by which the expected number of salmon returning to their spawing ground changes for each additional year. If you estimate $\beta_1$ to be 0.9 from the data, that means that expected number of salmon returning to their spawing ground is estimated to decrease by 10% for each additional year. For a gamma model with a log link, you would be modelling the log expected value of a (strictly positive) continuous response variable but the interpretation of the regression coefficient for a predictor would be similar to what I described above. Personally, I find it helpful to frame the interpretation of these types of models in terms of the expected value of the response variable. This way, you know exactly what you are modelling, rather than using mysterious labels that may not even be appropriate for your context. Going back to the Poisson model above, let’s say that each year you record those salmon counts, you have to account for the fact that the counting effort spanned different numbers of counting days (e.g., only 20 days were used to count fish in 2019, compared to 30 days in 2020). Your model could include an offset, which will be given by log(counting days): $log(expected number) = log(counting days) + \beta_0 + \beta_1 year$ But this is the same as: $log(expected number/counting days) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 year$ so you can see that what we are now modelling is the log-transformed expected number of salmon returning to their spawning ground per counting day . Thus, $exp(\beta_1)$ is the multiplicative factor by which the expected number of salmon returning to their spawning ground per counting day changes for each additional year.
