I think you've already got a strong argument: maintaining multiple instances will be a pain. Plus, if all users can read/write to all of them, it'll be a pain in the ass to coordinate a sign-on system between them all. You might be able to convince your supervisor that what you really need is one wiki using multiple categories, as it sounds like that is more what he actually wants. Categories can keep the entries organized. You could even write a separate portal page for each category (it'd sure be a lot less work than maintaining a new instance for each group!). Though I don't suggest it, you could setup your server to have multiple entry points that point towards the same site... (i.e., wiki/dev, wiki/qa both point to the same site).
