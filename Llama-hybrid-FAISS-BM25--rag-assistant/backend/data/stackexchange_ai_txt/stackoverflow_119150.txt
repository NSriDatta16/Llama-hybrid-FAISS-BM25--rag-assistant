http://www.logparser.com forwards to an IIS forum which seems fairly active. This is the official site for Gabriele Giuseppini's "Log Parser Toolkit". While I have never actually used this tool, I did pick up a cheap copy of the book from Amazon Marketplace - today a copy is as low as $16. Nothing beats a dead-tree-interface for just flipping through pages. Glancing at this forum, I had not previously heard about the "New GUI tool for MS Log Parser, Log Parser Lizard" at http://www.lizardl.com/ . The key issue of course is the complexity of your GRAMMAR. To use any kind of log-parser as the term is commonly used, you need to know exactly what you're scanning for, you can write a BNF for it. Many years ago I took a course based on Aho-and-Ullman's "Dragon Book", and the thoroughly understood LALR technology can give you optimal speed, provided of course that you have that CFG. On the other hand it does seem you're possibly reaching for something AI-like, which is a different order of complexity entirely.
