Another visual metaphor for choosing is two parallel lists side by side, with select and unselect buttons or drag and drop between them. In the display-only scenario perhaps you don't even need to show the unselected items. The advantage of that is that that selected list is concise. I prefer this when the list of options becomes large, as it tends to cosume less real-estate. As to whether to exploit browser-side presentation stuff such as jQuery or Dojo: browser-side tends to look much nicer, lots of rich UI possibilities, but be significantly more work. Depends how important the quality of presentation is to the people paying for development effort. Increasingly I see a desire for the improved UI look and feel coming from rich browser UI.
