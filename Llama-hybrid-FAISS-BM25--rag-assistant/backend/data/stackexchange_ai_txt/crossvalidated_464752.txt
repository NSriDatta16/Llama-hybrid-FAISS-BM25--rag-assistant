You say that causal inference is just a regression problem, and you present one estimator of a causal effect. But on what grounds can you claim that effect as causal? Is that the only way you can estimate a causal effect? Is that the only causal effect you can estimate? Have all the causal (let alone statistical!) assumptions been met that would allow you to interpret that effect as causal? The strategy you described is one way to estimate causal effects. It's called the parametric g-formula or regression estimation. See Snowden, Rose, and Mortimer (2011) for an introduction to using that method. This method estimates the average marginal effect of $Z$ on $Y$ after adjusting for $x$ . There are many other methods to estimate the average marginal effect, including matching and weighting (with or without propensity scores). Nothing about using these methods is inherently causal. These are just methods of statistical adjustment that allow you to integrate over a distribution of covariates to arrive at a marginal effect estimate that has been purified of its relationship with the covariates. Causal inference motivates the use of estimators like these because causal effects are often defined as average marginal effects. You don't need to appeal to causal inference notions to use these estimators, but they are generally of limited utility otherwise. The statistical properties of these methods don't depend on the causal assumptions that are often invoked to use them. In this sense, the development of statistical methods to estimate average marginal effects and related quantities that adjust for other covariates is not necessarily the task of the field of causal inference. It is the task of statistics, econometrics, and biostatistics. The field of causal inference is concerned with enumerating the assumptions and conditions required to interpret an estimated relationship as causal. This includes developing an understanding of counterfactuals, confounding, causal graphs, threats to validity, generalizability, transportability, causal estimands, interference, mediation, measurement error, etc. Causal inference is an extremely broad and productive field that has made contributions far beyond just the statistical estimation of covariate-adjusted quantities. It is the field of causal inference that has linked statistical quantities to causal ones. To specifically address the method you described, there are problems with it. What if you fail to correctly estimate the relationship between the covariates and the outcome? What if your covariates are measured with error? What if there is missing data in the covariates? What if the outcome is unobserved? What if there are multiple treatment periods? What if the variables you control for induce bias rather than reduce it? What if you haven't included the required variables to estimate the quantity of interest? What if you want your estimate to generalize to a population different from the one you have? What if the observed relationship exists only because of your sample selection strategy? Statistical methods have been developed to address all of these issues, and regression estimation cannot solve all of them. The area of statistics devoted to developing methods for causal inference has considered all of these problems and developed an ever-growing suite of methods to deal with them. It's often so much more complicated than a "simple specialized regression problem."
