I think I have the answer here, which is not as elegant as I'd hoped, but it should do the trick: var studentIDs = StudentClasses.Select(sc => sc.StudentID) .Union(StudentTeachers.Select(st => st.StudentID); //.Distinct(); -- Distinct not necessary after Union var q = from id in studentIDs join sc in StudentClasses on id equals sc.StudentID into jsc from sc in jsc.DefaultIfEmpty() join st in StudentTeachers on id equals st.StudentID into jst from st in jst.DefaultIfEmpty() where st == null ^ sc == null select new { sc, st }; You could probably squeeze these two statements into one, but I think you'd sacrifice code clarity.
