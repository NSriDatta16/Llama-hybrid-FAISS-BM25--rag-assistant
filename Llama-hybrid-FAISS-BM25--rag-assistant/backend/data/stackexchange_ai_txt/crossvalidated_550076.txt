Find stochastic differential equation which best describes time-series

I have a time series with daily observations in a time span of 20 years describing the price of commodities. Given that this time series is non-stationary, is it possible to find a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) from the type $dX = f(X)dt+g(X)dW$ ? If so, what would be an efficient algorithm or reference that I could use?
