My main refinement is that I'd start with a higher first guess instead of 2, around the average of what I'd expect them to choose. Starting with 64 would save 5 guesses vs starting with 2 when the number's over 64, at the cost of 1-5 more when it's less. 2 makes sense if you expect the answer to be around 1 or 2 half the time. You could even keep a memory of past answers to decide the best first guess. Another improvement could be to try negatives when they say "lower" on 0.
