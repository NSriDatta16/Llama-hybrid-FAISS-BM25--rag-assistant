How many coefficients does the Logistic regression model has as a function of the number of features?

I have built a logistic regression model using Python anaconda and was surprised to see that the number of model coefficients turned out to be proportional to the training sample size i.e. My training data is: print('Training data is type %s and shape %s' % (type(os_X_train), os_X_train.shape)) and outputs: Training data is type and shape (174146, 11) Then the model is: logreg = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2',solver='lbfgs',max_iter=1000) model = make_pipeline(preprocess, logreg) model.fit(os_X_train, os_y_train) print(logreg.coef_.shape) print("Model coefficients: ", logreg.intercept_, logreg.coef_) This outputs: (1, 153024) Model coefficients: [12.02830778] [[ 0.42926969 0.14192505 -1.89354062 ... 0.008847 0.00884372 -8.15123962]] To my understanding the number of model coefficients should be the number of columns for the predictor variables or features plus one the intercept, or?
