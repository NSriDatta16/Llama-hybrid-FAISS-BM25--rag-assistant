I do not think that Particle Swarm Optimization is suitable for your case... PSO stores the maximum value found so far and its location.. So if that largest value was caused only by the noise , it will stuck there all along the way.. You must modify the ordinary PSO in order to consider the weighted average of recently found maximums (not the ultimate global maximum) I recommend to you looking at: Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization But that subject is still in research phase, so you may find it hard to get to it... You may also go to Simulated annealing , that suits your case better...
