The model you describe reminds me of changepoint models. Like you said, the model parameters change, in your case $b$, with respect to some changepoint $x_1$. There might be several ways to estimate such models. One way is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This would provide estimates of the uncertainty of your parameter fits as well. OpenBugs is a softwarte frequently used in the context of MCMC. One example is about changepoint models. Maybe this will help. http://www.openbugs.net/Examples/Stagnant.html
