Comparing coefficients across segmented regression models given aggregated, heterogenous data

My goal is to compare $\beta_1$ across $7$ models: \begin{align*} Y^1_t &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X^1_t + \epsilon_t \\ Y^2_t &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X^1_t + \epsilon_t \\ &\vdots \\ Y^7_t &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X^7_t + \epsilon_t, \end{align*} where the realizations of $Y^L_t$ is time series data and $X^L_t$ is a binary variable for $L=1, 2, \dotsc, 7$ , interpreted as a treatment. I want to compare $\beta_1$ across models to determine if the treatment had a heterogenous effect on $Y^L_t$ . To be concrete, the response variables are different types of crime. The problem is the means and variances of $Y^1, Y^2, \dotsc, Y^7$ vary greatly. For the sake of argument, suppose $Avg(Y^1) = 100, Avg(Y^2) = 4$ , and $\hat{\beta^1} = -25, \hat{\beta^2} = -1$ . In terms of averages, the effect is the "same", but the coefficients are quite different. So a direct comparison becomes difficult if not untenable. I have tried to identify some approaches to compare the treatment effects: Percent change Using the pre-treatment average of $Y^L$ , compute percent change $PC = \frac{\beta_1}{Avg(Y^L)} \cdot 100$ , and compare those. Standardize $Y^L$ Using overall Avg / Std, or the pre-treatment Avg / Std, estimate the coefficients and make direct comparisons (perhaps using a hypothesis test of their difference). $Z$ -test for difference of coefficients (or some other test) Seemingly unrelated regression Ideally, I want to determine if the difference in effects is statistically significant or not.
