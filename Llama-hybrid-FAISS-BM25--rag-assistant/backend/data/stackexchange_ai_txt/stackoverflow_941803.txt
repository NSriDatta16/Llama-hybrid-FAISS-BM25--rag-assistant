There are various management views built into the product. On SQL 2000 you'd use sysprocesses . On SQL 2K5 there are more views like sys.dm_exec_connections , sys.dm_exec_sessions and sys.dm_exec_requests . There are also procedures like sp_who that leverage these views. In 2K5 Management Studio you also get Activity Monitor. And last but not least there are community contributed scripts like the Who Is Active by Adam Machanic .
