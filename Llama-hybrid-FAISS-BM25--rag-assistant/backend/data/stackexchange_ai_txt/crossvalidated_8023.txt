The simple way is to add a categorical variable $z$ to identify the different experimental conditions and include it in your model along with an "interaction" with $x$; that is, $y \sim z + x\#z$. This conducts all five regressions at once. Its $R^2$ is what you want. To see why averaging individual $R$ values may be wrong, suppose the direction of the slope is reversed in some of the experimental conditions. You would average a bunch of 1's and -1's out to around 0, which wouldn't reflect the quality of any of the fits. To see why averaging $R^2$ (or any fixed transformation thereof) is not right, suppose that in most experimental conditions you had only two observations, so that their $R^2$ all equal $1$, but in one experiment you had a hundred observations with $R^2=0$. The average $R^2$ of almost 1 would not correctly reflect the situation.
