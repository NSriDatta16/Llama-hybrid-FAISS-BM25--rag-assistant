Need help with entity tagging

I need to design a system which can identify movie and production company names in a sentence. The approach that comes to my mind is to train a NER Named-entity recognition system on labeled data so that it identifies the corresponding entities. But what about new entities (movie or production company name) which trained system hasn't seen, how can we tag them. Re-training the model every time with new released movies won't be feasible. Labeled data: Sentences with the position of words that corresponds to movie or production company name I am a beginner in NLP any help would be appreciated
