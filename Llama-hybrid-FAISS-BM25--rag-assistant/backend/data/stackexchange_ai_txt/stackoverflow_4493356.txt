Flex Smooth Drag of Objects

I'm trying to create an object which can be moved in Flex 4. I tried http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf64595-7fed.html but in this most examples actually leaves the actual object (at pause) until the drag is completed, but I'm looking for something where the update will be done/shown while the drag is still on ... in those lines I've tried: Problems replicating drag-and-drop with mouse events ... but here I dint understand 'what are MouseHelper & EventHelpers'. Also tried this: Flash AS3 custome Dragging using MOUSE_MOVE event but the movement is not smooth, very jig-jag. Any suggestions are most welcome. Regards
