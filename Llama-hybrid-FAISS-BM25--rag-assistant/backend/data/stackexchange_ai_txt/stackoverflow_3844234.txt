A quick-and-dirty solution: Copy the text into cell A1 of a clean spreadsheet. Each line will land in a cell going down from A1. In B1 put ="sqlString ="""&A1&"""" In B2 put ="sqlString=sqlString&"""&A2&"""" Copy/drag B2 down to the end of the column of text. Copy and paste the resulting column B into your code. You could also edit your sql fragments straight into column A of a blank Excel sheet instead of notepad, and save a step. If you'd rather do it with code, this VBA will make Column B from Column A: Option Explicit Public Sub makeSqlStmt() Dim r Dim n Dim i Const s = "sqlString = """ Const t = "sqlString = sqlString & """ Set r = Range("a1") Range("B1") = s & r & """" n = r.CurrentRegion.Rows.count For i = 1 To n - 1 r.Offset(i, 1) = t & r.Offset(i, 0) & """" Next i End Sub If you wanted to take it straight from the notepad file, you could replace the For loop with code to read the file.
