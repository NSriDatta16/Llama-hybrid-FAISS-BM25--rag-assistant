I Ã m using something called "synthetic population" by which I had calculated health related 3 parameters (physical health score, mental health score, subjective wellbeing) and economic indicators (rent, average income, ...etc 7 indicators ). I am trying to find correlation between health indicators and economic indicators. If I use Pearson's correlation, there is relationship but it does not take into account the geographic locations. I want the use of geographic locations or spatial data (which I have calculated by local authority units/different segments of the city)... I can use GWR method to find the relationship between them ...so, any similar experience or alternative suggestions would be helpful ! Kind regards Imran
