The question title is: How to get log odds from these results of logistic regression The estimates are already on the log-odds scale. All you have to do is read the relevant entry. What are the odds of a male surviving as compared to a female? The log-odds of a male surviving compared to a female is -2.5221, holding the other variables constant. If we exponentiate this we get > exp(-2.5221) [1] 0.0803 and this is the odds ratio of survival for males compared to females - that is the odds of survival for males is 92% lower than the odds of survival for females How do odds change for every 1 year increase in age of the person? Every 1 year increase in age is associated with a 0.3693 decrease in log-odds of survival holding the other variables constant. If we exponentiate this: > exp(-0.3693) [1] 0.691 So every 1 unit increase in age is associated with a decrease in the odds of survival of 31%, holding the other variables constant.
