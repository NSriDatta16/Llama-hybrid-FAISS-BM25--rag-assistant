To solve the high cardinality problem, follow the recommendation of Erwan. To solve the second issue you are mentioning, fit the OneHotEncoder on the train set and use the transformer on the test set, like this: from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown = 'ignore') enc.fit(train) X_train = enc.transform(train) X_test = enc.transform(test)
