Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test vs $t$-test Power Simulation

It is well known that the Wilcoxon rank sum test is more powerful for detecting shifts in location when the data is non-normal. However, I am conducting a brief simulation study and my results contradict this. One setting in my simulation strategy is as follows: Generate 25 random variables $X_1,\ldots,X_{25}$ such that $X\sim\mathsf{exp}(\mu=1)$ Generate 25 random variables $Y_1,\ldots,Y_{25}$ such that $Y\sim\mathsf{exp}(\mu=1.5)$ Determine whether the null hypothesis that $\mu_X=\mu_Y$ is rejected Repeat 10,000 and calculate the average This average gives the empirical power of the test. However, I find that the $t$ -test is consistently more powerful than the Wilcoxon rank sum test. For instance, in my last simulation, I obtained powers of 0.2317 and 0.2585 for the Wilcoxon and $t$ -test, respectively. Is there a flaw in my simulation strategy that is leading to unintuitive results? My R code: power=0 for(i in 1:10000){ x
