Stratified random sampling in Random Forests is done when you have an unbalanced data set, that is you have a different number of observations in your categories. If that is the case, then a simple random sampling (done in each tree) to obtain a bootstrap sample is going to be even more unbalanced. To prevent this, you would use stratified random sampling, which is different from supplying the weight argument, albeit used for the same purpose. If your sampling was done right, then your sample should be representative of the population, and the proportion of cases in each category is the best estimate of the true population parameter. In short, stratified sampling in RF is done to prevent biasing your trees.
