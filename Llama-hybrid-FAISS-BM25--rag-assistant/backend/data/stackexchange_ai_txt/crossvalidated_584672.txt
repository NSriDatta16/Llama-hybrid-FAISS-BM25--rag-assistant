The intuition is that directed graph models, i.e. Bayesian (belief) networks (BN), describe the situation where the joint pdf is written as the product of conditional pdfs, while an MRF describes the situation when the joint pdf is given as a product of factors (which, in the best case, each describe a maximal subset with no conditional independencies). Each has its strengths and weaknesses. Thus, in the same way, as you can "directly" define a BN from the joint pdf as a product of conditionals, you can "directly" define the MRF from the pdf as a product of factors (and those factors could, of course, also be the conditionals). E.g., if you have the pdf: $$ p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(b|a)p(c|b), $$ you can directly deduce a BN (not unique!): $$ a\to b \to c $$ and you can directly deduce an MRF (the factors being $p(a)p(b|a)$ and $p(c|b)$ ): $$ a - b - c. $$
