Ah, from the tramp docs on password caching you can set: (setq password-cache-expiry nil) which requires the package password-cache.el . Also, in the tramp sources, it mentions reading the ssh-agent(1) man page, which shows how to set it up so that you don't have to re-enter passwords (inside, or outside of Emacs): There are two main ways to get an agent set up: The first is that the agent starts a new subcommand into which some environment variables are exported, eg ssh-agent xterm &. The second is that the agent prints the needed shell commands (either sh(1) or csh(1) syntax can be generated) which can be evalled in the calling shell, eg eval ssh-agent -s for Bourne-type shells such as sh(1) or ksh(1) and eval ssh-agent -c for csh(1) and derivatives.
