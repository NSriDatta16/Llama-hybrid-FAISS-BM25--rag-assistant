Time Series of Wound Healing percentages / proportions

I am looking at wound healing over time and have hit a wall with analysis. My data consist of injury cases which are tracked over time. Injury healing is measured as percentage wound area/perimeter change since initial sighting. Each case varies in the number of days since initial sighting and the total number of sightings, with some only seen twice and some seen 5 times. DV = Area Change IV = Days , Severity , Location , Type Random effect = Shark ID , Injury I want to look at changes over time and be able to statistically explore whether wounds are decreasing in size over time and what factors can influence this. Key points: My response is a percentage that is dependent on previous records. How can I combat this? Here is an example of data: Injury Shark ID Name Date Days Severity Location Type Cause Area Change Perimeter Change 1 WS198 Naococco 24.6.15 0 Major Flank Laceration Boat 0 0 1 WS198 Naococco 8.7.15 14 Major Flank Laceration Boat 74.6858632 63.6698483 1 WS198 Naococco 10.7.15 16 Major Flank Laceration Boat 81.4165492 77.0354486 1 WS198 Naococco 1.8.15 38 Major Flank Laceration Boat 81.9152998 89.704627 1 WS198 Naococco 4.8.15 41 Major Flank Laceration Boat 86.2165258 89.1497158 1 WS198 Naococco 18.8.15 55 Major Flank Laceration Boat 86.1513557 90.3776043 1 WS198 Naococco 19.9.15 87 Major Flank Laceration Boat 97.9639636 93.7961375 1 WS198 Naococco 24.9.15 92 Major Flank Laceration Boat 96.8353572 91.813769 1 WS198 Naococco 3.11.15 132 Major Flank Laceration Boat 99.7190944 98.0207677 1 WS198 Naococco 10.11.15 139 Major Flank Laceration Boat 99.8686985 98.8372268 1 WS198 Naococco 30.11.15 159 Major Flank Laceration Boat 100 100 2 WS198 Naococco 27.3.16 0 Major Flank Laceration Boat 0 0 2 WS198 Naococco 29.3.16 2 Major Flank Laceration Boat 28.902414 17.0816156 2 WS198 Naococco 4.4.16 8 Major Flank Laceration Boat 47.1829361 45.5672997 2 WS198 Naococco 30.5.16 64 Major Flank Laceration Boat 97.4773761 91.7192607 2 WS198 Naococco 13.9.16 170 Major Flank Laceration Boat 100 100 3 WS198 Naococco 5.10.17 0 Major Flank Laceration Boat 0 0 3 WS198 Naococco 26.10.17 21 Major Flank Laceration Boat 65.2492641 67.0574269 3 WS198 Naococco 30.10.17 25 Major Flank Laceration Boat 68.9993994 66.1401071 3 WS198 Naococco 10.12.17 66 Major Flank Laceration Boat 100 100 Please tell me if this does not make sense or if more information is required to clarify my question. I know I cannot use a standard lmer model, as follows, because of my response: healing.lmer How can I change my response or my model to fit?
