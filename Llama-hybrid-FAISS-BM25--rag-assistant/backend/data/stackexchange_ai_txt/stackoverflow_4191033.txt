How to set request-specific data to SNMP agent using net-snmp?

I want the SNMP agent to response differently depending on the source requester, but cannot find a way to magic convey some data to make it distinguishable by the SNMP agent. What I have tried setting is the netsnmp_session structure and netsnmp_pdu structure. because they're two parameters of snmp_send . The data field I tried to facilitate is myvoid and callback_magic. But unfortunately on the SNMP agent, the data received are all 0, which is not what I have set on the SNMP client.
