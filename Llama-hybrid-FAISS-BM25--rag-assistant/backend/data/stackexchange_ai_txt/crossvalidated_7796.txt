Important Note : I've decided to remove the proof I gave originally in this answer. It was longer, more computational, used bigger hammers, and proved a weaker result as compared to the other proof I've given. All around, an inferior approach (in my view). If you're really interested, I suppose you can look at the edits. The asymptotic results that I originally quoted and which are still found below in this answer do show that as $n \to \infty$ we can do a bit better than the bound proved in the other answer, which holds for all $n$. The following asymptotic results hold $$ \mathbb{P}(T > n \log n + c n ) \to 1 - e^{-e^{-c}} $$ and $$ \mathbb{P}(T \leq n \log n - c n ) \to e^{-e^c} \>. $$ The constant $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and the limits are taken as $n \to \infty$. Note that, though they're separated into two results, they're pretty much the same result since $c$ is not constrained to be nonnegative in either case. See, e.g., Motwani and Raghavan, Randomized Algorithms , pp. 60--63 for a proof. Also : David kindly provides a proof for his stated upper bound in the comments to this answer.
