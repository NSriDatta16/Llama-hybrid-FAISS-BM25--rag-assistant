Slightly off topic but if you have control over these issues... High level and High Impact. For high IO environments make sure your disks are for either RAID 10 or RAID 0+1 or some nested implementation of raid 1 and raid 0. Don't use drives less than 1500K. Make sure your disks are only used for your Database. IE no logging no OS. Turn off auto grow or similar feature. Let the database use all storage that is anticipated. Not necessarily what is currently being used. design your schema and indexes for the type queries. if it's a log type table (insert only) and must be in the DB don't index it. if your doing allot of reporting (complex selects with many joins) then you should look at creating a data warehouse with a star or snowflake schema. Don't be afraid of replicating data in exchange for performance!
