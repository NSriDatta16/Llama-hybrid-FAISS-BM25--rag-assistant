Why publishing an upgrade reinstalls the application deleting the internal data storage?

I developed and application and then I published it on Android Market. After developing several improvements I generated an upgrade for the application. The upgrade has been successfully published on Android Market, and devices got updated. Nevertheless, the application hasn't been upgraded on user's devices; it has been removed and installed again, losing the data the application stored on the internal storage. How can I publish an application upgrade that will be installed on the user's devices keeping the application's data? How are the application's upgrades being published for just upgrading the application without reinstalling it? My application runs from Android 2.0 (API 5).
