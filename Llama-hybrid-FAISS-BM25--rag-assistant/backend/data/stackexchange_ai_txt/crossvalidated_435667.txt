When does random forest feature importance fail?

I'm curious about the assumptions of random forest feature importance. In this paper , the author says that "We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories." I don't understand what it means by "predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement." Is this referring to the need to standardize data before fitting a random forest model? Does RF based feature importance require standardization of features? Does it require fitting a good RF model (ex: pruning), as if I'm making an actual prediction with RF? What do I do if I have categorical variables and continuous variables at the same time? Is permutation method the only option?
