Heteroskedasticity Question

I have a model that's affected by Heteroskedasticity: bptest(m1) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: m1 BP = 65.055 , df = 6 , p-value = 4.205e-12 In this model I had 2 variables (yrs.since.phd and yrs.service) that have significant coefficients: summary(m1) Call: lm(formula = salary ~ ., data = data) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -65248 -13211 -1775 10384 99592 Coefficients: Estimate Std.Error tvalue Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 78862.8 4990.3 15.803 I tried to fix this model by using robust standard errors, and now the two variables mentioned above (yrs.since.phd and yrs.service) are not significant (or barely significant): coeftest(m1, df = Inf, vcovHC(m1, omega = NULL, type = "HC4")) z test of coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 78862.82 3936.67 20.0329 Could anyone please explain me what's happened? All other variables Std.errors decreased, while happened the opposite for these two... Thanks! James
