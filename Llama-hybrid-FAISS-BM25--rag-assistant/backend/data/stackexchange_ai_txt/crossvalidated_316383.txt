You might be in interested in, in contrast to a recurrent neural network, a recursive neural network , which [applies] the same set of weights recursively over a structure, to produce a structured prediction over variable-size input structures, or a scalar prediction on it, by traversing a given structure in topological order ... introduced to learn distributed representations of structure. You may also be interested in parsing in general, in which tree structures are inferred for sentences, for example. Each tree structure follows certain rules specified by some grammar. One paper that might be of interest is aclweb.org/anthology/P/P13/P13-1045.pdf I have not used them myself, but it appears that there are implementations in pytorch ( https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/recursive-neural-networks-pytorch/ ) and tensorflow ( https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/06/recursive-neural-networks-tensorflow.html ).
