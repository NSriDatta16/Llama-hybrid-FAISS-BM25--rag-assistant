LeCun tracks MNIST performance on many classification models. yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ Unsurprisingly, CNNs do the best, but his “Neural Nets” category gives a number of fully-connected models with classification error under $1\%$ . The SVM and KNN categories also report models with error rates under $1\%$ .
