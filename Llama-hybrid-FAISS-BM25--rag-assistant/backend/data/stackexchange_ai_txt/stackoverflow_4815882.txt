When running on ipod touch, not simulator.. 'program received signal SIGABRT'

My app runs just fine in the simulator, but now I have a developers license and when I try and run it on my iPod Touch, xcode says GBD: Program received signal: "SIGABRT". What can i do to figure out what the problem is here? It gives no warnings when building. EDIT: Sorry, this is my first time running an app on a device, so please bear with me. I just noticed the Organizer window and debugger is giving me a log of what's happening on the device. So this is the problem: [UIApplication setStatusBarHidden:withAnimation:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1160e0 And the code it's referring to is in (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation { This is the code it has a problem with: `if (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft || interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight) { self.view = clockView; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES withAnimation:NO]; return YES; } if (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait) { self.view = homeView; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:NO withAnimation:NO]; return YES; } if (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown) { self.view = homeView; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:NO withAnimation:NO]; return YES; } else { return YES; } `
