Keeping multiple projects on the on same CVS branch in Eclipse

So my team is just starting to use branches on our project, and we've run into an organizational issue concerning the way Eclipse/CVS handle branches and projects. My question is this: Is it possible to ensure that multiple projects are always synched to the same branch with CVS in Eclipse? Here's a simplified scenario: Two projects: ProjA and ProjB , and two branches: Dev and Release . So let's say both projects are synched to Release in my workspace, and I decided to add a new feature. I only anticipate that this feature will touch ProjA , so I naively branch only that project to Dev . So now my workspace is inconsistent. After a few hours of work, I realize that I need to make a small change to ProjB , so I pop open the file in question and make my change, forgetting to sync it to Dev . Later, after my changes are complete, I commit them. Now, I've just committed the changes in the first project to Dev , and the changes in the second project to Release . Woohoo, broken build! A solution to this problem would either: not have let me sync the two projects separately not have let me commit to two branches at the same time Now, in the real world, we have about 30 projects, and a number of developers working on feature branches, many of whom seem destined to use branching to break the build any way possible. I'd like to remove some of those ways.
