Is machine learning suitable for detecting screen elements?

I want to test a few devices as pure black box tests. That would mean some kind of robotics to press buttons and the touch screen and detecting screen elements like buttons in varying light conditions with a video camera. I can handle the mechanics but I am not sure how to got about screen detection. Would machine learning be suitable for such a task? I imagine training the system under different lighting conditions.
