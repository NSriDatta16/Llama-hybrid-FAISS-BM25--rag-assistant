How can I regress if all the variables are categorical?

I am working with a dataset of 335 categorical variables. The dependent variable is also categorical variable, as following: How satisfied are you with your life: 1.unhappy ... to 10. very happy. I looked up in some papers, and it is said that Oprobit or Ologit could be used if dependent variable is categorical. But if all are categorical, could I also used these two types or logistic regression? Plus, do I need to convert all these categorical variables into dummy variables before doing regression?
