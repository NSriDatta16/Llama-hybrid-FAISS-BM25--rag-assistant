How do you query the set of Users in Google App Domain within your Google App Engine project?

If you have a Google App Engine project you can authenticate based on either a) anyone with a google account or b) a particular google app domain. Since you can connect these two entities I would assume there is some way to query the list of users that can be authenticated. The use case is outputting a roster of all members in an organization to a web page running on Google App Engine. Any thoughts?
