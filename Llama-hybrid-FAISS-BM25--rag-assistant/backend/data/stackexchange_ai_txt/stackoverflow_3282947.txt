you should follow the standards defined on the Android Data Storage docs. This will give you information on how to save to internal storage, external storage (sdcard for example), and to a database. Since you are "caching" the file, you would save it to the selected storage (internal/external) to /Android/data/ /cache/ . You would probably only want to use internal storage if external storage was not available, in my opinion.
