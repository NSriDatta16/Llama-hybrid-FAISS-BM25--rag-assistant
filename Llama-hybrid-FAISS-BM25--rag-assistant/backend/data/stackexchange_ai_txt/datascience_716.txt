How to choose the features for a neural network?

I know that there is no a clear answer for this question, but let's suppose that I have a huge neural network, with a lot of data and I want to add a new feature in input. The "best" way would be to test the network with the new feature and see the results, but is there a method to test if the feature IS UNLIKELY helpful? Like correlation measures etc?
