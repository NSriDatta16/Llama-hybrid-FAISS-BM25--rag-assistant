As you've noted, anyone could find out your paths by using Wireshark to watch traffic sent to your site, or a Flash decompiler to look at your source code and find the links directly. I don't think it sounds worth the trouble to try to hide your paths, since all it would be adding is a slight layer of obscurity. Anyone interested could figure it out with relatively little effort, but the average person would have no clue whatsoever about how to make an AMF call to one of your services. Instead, I'd concentrate on making your AMFPHP functions themselves as secure as possible.
