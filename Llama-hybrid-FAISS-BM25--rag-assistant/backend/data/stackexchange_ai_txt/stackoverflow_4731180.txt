Jquery UI dialog - Flash content shining through on scroll in Safari

I have a problem similar to this: How to stop Flash content shine-through jQuery UI Dialog in Firefox on Windows ..but only in safari and only when when I'm scrolling the content inside the dialog. When the dialog appear, everything is fine. But when you start scrolling, with the mouse wheel or by dragging the bar, the flash content start to shine through and come back. For example: start: Fine scroll one step: Flash bleeding through scroll second step: Fine scroll third step: Flash bleeding through etc. When in modal "mode", the modal background come over the dialog, but is still over the flash. Chrome and Firefox works fine. I tried "wmode=transparent" and "wmode=opaque" and check the z-index, but nothing come up. Help? Flash code with swfobject: var flashvars = false; var params = {wmode: 'opaque', bgcolor: '#FFF4D5'}; var attributes = false; swfobject.embedSWF("chat/logo.swf", "logo", "250", "100", "9.0.0", "../expressInstall.swf", flashvars, params, attributes); Dialog opening thingy: function openAdminDialog(buttons) { $("#admin-dialog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 925, height: 500, modal: true, title: 'Title', buttons: buttons, close: function() { $('#admin-dialog').remove(); } }); $('#admin-dialog').dialog('open'); } EDIT: SWFObject translate to this (from Safari console):
