It turns out the answer is yes. I read Efron and Tibshirani's textbook on the bootstrap and they gave an example of bootstrapping PCA applied to standardized test data where a few students answered many questions. In this example they resampled questions (equivalent to genes in my example). Since NMF is a special case of the more general multinomial PCA, it seems to follow that this approach should also work with NMF.
