I am in the same scenario you are in , so I'd like to comment on my experiences. Both Typemock and Moles have the goal of isolation in mind. Especially for those pesky sealed classes, non-virtual methods. I believe an isolation framework, as ones mentioned above, are needed especially if you are in the later phases of development and/or have no/little control of the code base. These are the advantages in Typemock, I have not yet discovered with Moles Support for code coverage tools ( Ncover and Partcover ) Support to intercept/verify on privates (methods / properties) [yes this is controversial] More polished product, up and running fast with intuitive API (still messing with Moles to even work right) I hope Moles matures into released product, but the beginning of my tinkering with it seems to be no different than other MS Research projects; usually unpolished, but that seems to be the nature of those type of projects.
