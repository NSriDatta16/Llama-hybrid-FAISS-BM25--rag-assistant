Interpretation of binomial GLM (glmer) with interaction and results description

I would like to confirm if I am analysing the results of my model correctly and get some advise if I am missing something! I conducted the following model to analyse factors that describe the feeding behaviour of whales. My dataset includes a set of dives performed by whales where foraging takes the value 1 if the whale fed during the dive and 0 if it didn't. The explanatory variables are basically dive metrics (maximum depth of dive, duration, etc.) and time of the day (Day and Night). g_model |z|) (Intercept) 0.5621 0.1600 3.514 0.000441 *** max_depths 1.9123 0.1863 10.266 I am wondering if the interpretation is as simply as, for example, there is a significant difference in the maximum depth (max_depths) reached between feeding and non-feeding dives, with maximum depth taking higher (deeper) values in feeding dives. And for diel2_Night, does it means there are more feeding dives at night? How do I interpret the interaction? Maximum depth is higher in feeding dives at night? What about during the day? What is the typical form of presentation of these results. I guess I should refer the p-value but do I have to state the estimate as well for example?
