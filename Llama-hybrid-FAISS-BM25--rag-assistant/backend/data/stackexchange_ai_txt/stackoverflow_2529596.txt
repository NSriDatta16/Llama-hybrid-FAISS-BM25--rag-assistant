Diagramming in Silverlight MVVM- connecting shapes

have I have a quesition regarding MVVM pattern in the use case diagarm. What I have so far is a list of Items which are my Shapes. ObservableCollection Items; and a Collection of Connection of Items ObservableCollection Each ItemViewModel has an ID and a ConnectionViewModel has two ID to connect the Items. My ItemsViewModel Collection is bound to a Itemscontrol which is layout on a Canvas. With the ElementMouseDragBehavior I am able to drag my Items around. Now comes my big question =) How can I visualize my connections that I will be able to move the items around and the items stay connected with a line either straign or bezier. I don't know how to abstract that with the mvvm pattern. Thanks for any help...
