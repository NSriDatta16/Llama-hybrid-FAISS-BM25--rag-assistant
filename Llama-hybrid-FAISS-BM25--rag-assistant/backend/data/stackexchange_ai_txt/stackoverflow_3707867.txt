How to read username and password from http GET in .NET MVC controller?

How can I read the username and password from http GET in .NET MVC controller? I am using a jQuery $.ajax call and I am passing username and password in as a setting. Is this secure? If my server is ASP.NET MVC 2 how can I retrieve the username and password from the request? My end goal is to make a secured jsonp call. here is how I am making the call in javascript $("#getSomethingButton").click(function () { var username = "myusername"; var password = "mypassword"; $.ajax({ url: 'people/getSomething', username: username, password: password, dataType: 'jsonp', jsonpCallback: 'onGetSomething' }); }); here is how MVC receives the request public string GetSomething(string callback) { string data = "{data: 'test'}"; return string.Format("{0}({1});", callback, data); } if I watch the request in fiddler this is how it looks http://myusername:mypassword@localhost:29161/people/getSomething?callback=onGetSomething If and when this is put in production it will be SSL/HTTPS only but of course the query string is not secured by that. So the question is can I in any possible way secure a password with a jsonp GET request?
