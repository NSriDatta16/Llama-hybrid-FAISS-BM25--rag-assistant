Drag, Drop and Delete

I have a question about drag and drop in WinForms. I know how to enable the user to drag and drop controls around inside the form, but what I'm now trying to do is enable them to drag a LinkLabel ontop of a"Recycle Bin" icon inside my Form and when it detects that something has been dropped onto the Recycle Bin icon, that control will be removed from the Form. How would I detect if something's been dropped on another control? Would I still use Control.DragEnter & Control.DragDrop ? Thank you
