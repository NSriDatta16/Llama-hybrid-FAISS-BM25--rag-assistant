From a usability point of view the text in the input component should be preserved only for user's input purposes. The possible default value in the input should be valid if left untouched by the user. If the placeholder text is meant to be a hint for how to fill the input, it is better to be blaced near the input where it can be seen also when the input has been filled. Moreover, using a placeholder text inside text components can cause troubles e.g. with braille devices. If a placeholder text is used, regardless of usability guidelines, one should make sure that it is done in an unobtrusive way so that it works with user agents without javascript or when js is turned off.
