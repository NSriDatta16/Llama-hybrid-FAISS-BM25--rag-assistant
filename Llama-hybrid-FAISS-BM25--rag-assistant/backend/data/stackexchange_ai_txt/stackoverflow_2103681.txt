However if you are processing hundreds, and possibly millions of records, the extra overhead from the end tags can bloat the files. This could cause problems on memory/processor constrained systems and/or slow datalinks. Littering your XML with elements can also make it much more difficult to read and understand your XML visually. While the visual experience of data may not matter for transfer and storage, and can be very important for configuration and maintenance. Another problem that can come out of using elements from everything is when you try to use data from outside of your code base; you have a much more difficult time knowing if the elements can repeat or if they should only contain a simple piece of information. Yes, you can constrain this with XSD and DTD but that is typically more difficult then just making the XML easy to understand. As for your bonus question... Versioning of XML schemas would depend on the platform you are developing against and how strict your code and platform are against schema. XML (and binary files) can be very flexible... that really why XML is eXtensible.
