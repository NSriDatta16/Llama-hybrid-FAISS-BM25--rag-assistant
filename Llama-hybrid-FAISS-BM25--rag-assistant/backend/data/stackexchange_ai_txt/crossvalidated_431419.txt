Conditional probability table from deterministic relationships of two discetizied distributions - for Bayesian Networks

Consider a simple Bayesian Network of three variables A, B, and C. All of the variables are discrete variables between (0,1] that are discretized as below: Ψ (A,B,C) : {(0,0.2], (0.2–4], (0.4–0.6], (0.6–0.8],(0.8–1]} I Know A and B are discretized Truncated Normal distributions with a mean of 0.4, and variance of 0.1; such as: A, B ~ TNormal{(0,1],0.4,0.1} And I know that C is a deterministic function of the two distributions e.g. is an average of the two, with the same variance. C ~ TNormal{(0,1],(A+B)/2,0.1} How can I calculate the CPT for node C, from A, and B, that creates the same relation? I know some commercial software create those. But I do not know how, and I want to incorporate that in my BNlearn graph so that it can work as part of the back propagation of evidence.
