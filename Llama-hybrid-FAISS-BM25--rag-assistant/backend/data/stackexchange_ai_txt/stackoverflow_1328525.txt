First, why do you say that the counter value should be set "upon save"? That's going to be tough. I'd expect that instead, you'd want the value to be set at the point you attach an organization to a Foobar. Second, as Paul Keeble noted in a comment, yes, this value appears to be Organization-related, and so belongs in that class. You're going to need to create a method to associate Foobars with Organizations (as opposed to simply setting a member variable). This method will have to set the counter. So in Foobar: public void associateWithOrganization (Organization org) { this.organization = org; org.addAssociation (this); } and in Organization: public void addAssociation (Foobar foo) { this.associationCounter ++; } ... You'll also need "getNumberOfAssociationsForThisOrganization()" and "removeAssociation(this)" methods, of course.
