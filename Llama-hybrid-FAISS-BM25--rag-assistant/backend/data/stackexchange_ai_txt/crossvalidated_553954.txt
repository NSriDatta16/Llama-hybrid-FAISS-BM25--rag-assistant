Turning my comment into an answer: This is doable, but it's not common. The assumption in an RNN is that the hidden state already carries with it information from all previous states. This isn't true in (e.g.) a $k$ th-order HMM. By the Markov assumption, you absolutely can only look back $k$ steps. I don't think the higher-order RNN would have much value, unless you're trying to include a specific inductive bias of dependency on specifically $k$ steps back. What you've provided is another avenue for information to flow, but unlike the HMM there was already one avenue.
