Mathematically applying regularisation to logistic regression to reduce over fitting

I recently was introduced to the concept of regularisation to reduce the process of overfitting in logistic regression were the curve fits too perfectly to a point where our non linear line does a very bad job at generalising our data. The way we did this we edited the cost function actually; Hypothesis function -> H(Q) = Q0 + Q1 x X1 + Q2 x X2 + Q3 x X3..... Cost function -> All we did was multiply values to these parameters in order to reduce them apparently; 1000Q4 + 1000Q4 .... Now my question here, how is this managing to reduce the size of the parameters ( Regularisation ), since we are multiplying 1000 or any big number to the parameters, isn't it actually increasing the value of the parameters Q3, Q4... etc ?
