You only need such a projection if you are using only dense layers for your model (i.e. a multilayer perception (MLP)). You can simply have a convolutional autoencoder, where the layers are convolutions and max pooling, and therefore the number of parameters is drastically reduced with respect to an MLP. You can check Keras' tutorial on autoencoders , specifically the section "Convolutional autoencoders" for an example.
