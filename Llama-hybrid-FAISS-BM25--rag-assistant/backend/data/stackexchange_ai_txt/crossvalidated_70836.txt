Let us assume the unobserved observations $y_i$ fall into intervals $[a_i, b_i)$, and that the observed observations (sorry, couldn't resist) are the pairs of $[a_i, b_i)$. In that case, the likelihood function for a single observation is: $l(\mu, \sigma^2 | a, b) = \frac{1}{\sigma} \int_a^b \exp\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-\mu)^2\}\text{d}y$ You can't use the same approach as before, unfortunately. However, that doesn't mean there aren't any approaches which work. One such approach is MCMC, as you can explicitly calculate the likelihood function w/o much trouble in, for example, R. I've attached some code that implements a simple sampler: # Generate underlying data y and the results... > summary(mu_mcmc) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -0.068810 -0.007038 0.022150 0.015570 0.034990 0.106300 > summary(sigma_mcmc) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.9539 0.9915 1.0070 1.0070 1.0220 1.0790 Pretty good, but, then again, the sample size was large (1000) and the rounding not that great (intervals of length 0.1).
