In your example, your ensemble of two models could be worse than a single model itself. But your example is artificial, we generally build more than two in our ensemble. There is no absolute guarantee a ensemble model performs better than an individual model, but if you build many of those, and your individual classifier is weak . Your overall performance should be better than an individual model. In machine learning, training multiple models generally outperform training a single model. That's because you have more parameters to tune.
