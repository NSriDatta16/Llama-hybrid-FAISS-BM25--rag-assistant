Tracking and debugging a CookieStore::CookieOverflow error it's not simple. You should try to replicate exactly the same user activity on the site. A couple of suggestions to fix the error: * switch to a more scalable cookie storage such as ActiveRecord or Memcached * try to reduce the number of elements stored in session Also note that flash messages are stored in session . If you send back a really long flash message text you might expect a CookieOverflow error.
