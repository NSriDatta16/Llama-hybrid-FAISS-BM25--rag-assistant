Collapsing levels of categorical varibles

Let's say I have multiple categorical predictors (X) and I want to see the influence on outcome (Y) by building a logistic regression model. Some of my predictors have many levels i.e. exercise frequency (with levels of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 +) then collapsing to 1 - 3, 4 - 6, 8 + or happiness level (excellent, very good, good, okay, bad, very bad, terrible) but then collapsing to good, fair or bad For my outcome I am not interested in the details i.e the exact level of happiness that affects my outcome but how does happiness affect my outcome (Y). Therefore my form of collapsing is based on: my own knowledge results that are more interpretable I have read that I would get a more precise estimate and higher degrees of freedom, is this correct? My question is, is there anything technically wrong with this approach? Anything I should be cautious of? I would be grateful for any useful references too.
