Assuming you're using the "Screen" method of organizing your code (ie. [Game State Management]) 1 , simply redirect them to the title screen and the title screen will take it from there. If you are not using the game state management, then you will need to be more specific, otherwise, I'd suggest just reformatting your code to use the method described in the link above.
