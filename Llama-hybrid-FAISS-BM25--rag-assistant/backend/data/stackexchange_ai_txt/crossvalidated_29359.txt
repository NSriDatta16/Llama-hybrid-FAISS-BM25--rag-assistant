I think these concepts are easy to explain. So I would rather just describe it here. I am sure many elementary statistics books cover this including my book "The Essentials of Biostatistics for Physicians, Nurses and Clinicians." Think of a target with a bulls-eye in the middle. The mean square error represent the average squared distance from an arrow shot on the target and the center. Now if your arrows scatter evenly arround the center then the shooter has no aiming bias and the mean square error is the same as the variance. But in general the arrows can scatter around a point away from the target. The average squared distance of the arrows from the center of the arrows is the variance. This center could be looked at as the shooters aim point. The distance from this shooters center or aimpoint to the center of the target is the absolute value of the bias. Thinking of a right triangle where the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the sqaures of the two sides. So a squared distance from the arrow to the target is the square of the distance from the arrow to the aim point and the square of the distance between the center of the target and the aimpoint. Averaging all these square distances gives the mean square error as the sum of the bias squared and the variance.
