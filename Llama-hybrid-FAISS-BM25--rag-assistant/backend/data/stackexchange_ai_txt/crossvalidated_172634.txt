difference-in-difference analysis in R results in 0 degrees of freedom

I have a value I am measuring before and after a treatment, for an experimental group and a control group (total of 4 data points). An example CSV file of the data is here . When I model it as follows: general_df I get this output: Residuals: ALL 4 residuals are 0: no residual degrees of freedom! Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 100 NA NA NA group 20 NA NA NA pre_post -50 NA NA NA group:pre_post -10 NA NA NA Residual standard error: NaN on 0 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 1, Adjusted R-squared: NaN F-statistic: NaN on 3 and 0 DF, p-value: NA How do I do this analysis correctly so I don't have 0 degrees of freedom and NA values everywhere? Is the problem that I'm using averages, instead of the raw values? Ie. the values reported are averages of tens of thousands of values.
