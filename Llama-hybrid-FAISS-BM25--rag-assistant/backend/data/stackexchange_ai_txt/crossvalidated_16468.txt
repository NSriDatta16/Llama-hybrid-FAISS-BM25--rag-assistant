I disagree with the answer given by @probabilityislogic. There is no geometric distribution here at all, truncated or otherwise. One of 13 agents can answer the question. The worker calls the agents one by one until the worker reaches the agent who can answer the question. Let us number the agents as $1$, $2, \ldots, 13$ in the order in which they are called. Absent any other information, I presume that the agent who can answer the question is equally likely to be any of $1$, $2, \ldots, 13$, and so the average number of calls is $7$. The next question may lead to the agents being called in a different order, but the identity of the agent may be different too, and so the same analysis applies. Alternative scenario to be considered: all the questions are on the same topic and can be answered by just one agent but the worker, being a slow learner, does not figure this out, and calls the agents in random order every time a question comes in. So the go-to agent is reached on the first, second, ...., thirteenth call with equal probability, and again, $7$ calls are required on average. Added note: The simulation by @thias (cf. comment on probabilityislogic's answer) confirms my analysis.
