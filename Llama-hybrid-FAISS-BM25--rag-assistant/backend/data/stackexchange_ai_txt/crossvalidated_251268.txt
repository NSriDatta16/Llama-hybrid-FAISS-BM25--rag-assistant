You can perfectly train non-rectangular images with CNN. if you have non rectangular input image, you can still use the square kernels. Note that the resulting size will be different in two dimensions. If you have 80*100 image, and use 5*5 filter, resulting dimension will be 76*96 if you do not use any padding. You have to be careful with this dimension because - at the final layer you are probably going to use fully connected layer which size has to match exactly - otherwise you will get dimension mismatch error. In your case, if you have some points missing, one way to use is to go with copy padding, which is similar to zero padding except it adds the values of border pixels to newly added dimensions. And if you think you have to add more more pixels by about 50%, it's better not to use that type of data to train-otherwise its going to add more noise to your data - and making your classifier more confusing.
