nnetar giving different output each time

I am using nnetar package for time series forecasting in R.But each time when I run the model, I am getting different output. i guess this is related to different random weight initialization at each time, but I don't know how to set it as constant. ts=nnetar(Time_Series,P=3,lambda = 0,decay=0.001,maxit=150) fs = forecast(ts, h=12) Any pointers would be appreciated.
