Or is there some utility that will automatically build the JSON parameter structure of a [WebMethod] call? (just like you can automatically get the WSDL of a web service) Yes! The ASP.Net AJAX framework can do this! You could get the framework to generate client side proxy classes for GeneralData , SomeObject and SomeOtherObject classes using the 'GenerateScriptType' attribute on a web service class. See understanding asp net ajax web servcies for a very good article about the subject. [Unfortunately, AFAIAA, the GenerateScriptType has no effect when applied to the Page class where your page method is defined - so you will have to add an .asmx purely to get the proxy generation.] You could perhaps use these classes to build up the data structure that you then JSON stringify when you call .ajax ? [One of (the very few) things I really like about the MS AJAX framework is the client side proxy generation: it really does make calling web services and page methods very easy. Having said that, I too am moving towards using jQuery in preference to MS AJAX.] Or alternatively... Your problem is really that the de-serialisation of the JSON data into the arguments of your page method is done transparently by the framework (which in most cases is a good thing) but when it goes wrong, the feedback you get is less-than-helpful. If you want to trap de-serialisation problems then I think you have to take control of the serialisation either by using custom JSON converters (see here ) or by using the rather inelegant sledgehammer approach of having your method accept a string and de serializing the JSN yourself in the method - which is trivial with anyone of the numerous JSON libs out there.
