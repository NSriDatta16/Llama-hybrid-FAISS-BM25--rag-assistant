how to automatically determine which tables need a vacuum / reindex in postgresql

i've written a maintenance script for our database and would like to run that script on whichever tables most need vacuuming/reindexing during our down time each day. is there any way to determine that within postgres? i would classify tables needing attention like this: tables that need vacuuming tables that need reindexing (we find this makes a huge difference to performance) i see something roughly promising here
