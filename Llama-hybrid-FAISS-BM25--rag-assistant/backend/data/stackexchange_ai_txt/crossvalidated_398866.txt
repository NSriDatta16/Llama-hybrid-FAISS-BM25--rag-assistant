Classify time series with unequal lenghts

I have a set of time series sensor measurements (acceleration and gyroscope readings) for driving events (harsh acceleration, harsh brake …) with the type, start and end of each event. I need to classify those events in real time and the problem is that each event has different window’s size. What are the lachine learning techniques that I can used ?
