What is popular choice for modelling distribution of orthogonal matrices

In Bayesian statistics, instead of considering a variable to be fixed and use MLE to infer that value, we put a prior distribution over that variable. Now consider an orthogonal matrix $W \in R^{d \times p}; d >p$. All entries are random variables. Is there any popular distribution in literature to model the distribution of $W$ ? My first try here is to model distribution of general matrices $A \in R^{p \times d} $ and then show some relationship between W and A. I want to put a prior over $W$ and use some likelihood function over $W$ to find a posteior distribution over $W$.
