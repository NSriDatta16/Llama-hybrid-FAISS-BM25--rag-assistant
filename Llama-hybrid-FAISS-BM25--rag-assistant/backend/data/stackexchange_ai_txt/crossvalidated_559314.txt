SARIMA without seasonal differencing

I am trying to forecast daily data with (S)ARIMA, having observations for the last 180 days. STL decomposition clearly shows seasonality and ACF plot shows spikes at 7, 14, 21, etc. days so that I assume weekly seasonality, which meets our preliminary expectations as data comes from network traffic export which is significantly and 'reliably' lower on weekends: ACF after manual seasonal differencing: y_diff = diff(y, k_diff = 0, k_seasonal_diff = 1, seasonal_periods = 7) Using pmdarima_AutoARIMA without differencing on the raw (not differenced) data it suggests ARIMA(1,0,0)(2,0,0)7 model = pm.auto_arima(y, seasonal = True, m = 7, trace = False) Residuals ACF: Using pmdarima_AutoARIMA with forced seasonal differencing (D=1) on the raw (not differenced) data it suggests ARIMA(2,0,2)(1,1,1)7 model = pm.auto_arima(y, seasonal = True, D = 1, m = 7, trace = False) Residuals ACF: With seasonal differencing, results are worse in terms of residuals ACF and actually in terms of RMSSE on test set as well. My question is that how should one know that seasonal differencing should be used or not for SARIMA at all? If there is a clear seasonality in time series, how it is possible to get better results without seasonal differencing? Generally, what is the point of a SARIMA model without seasonal differencing? Any tutorials I have found starts with seasonal differencing if there is an identified seasonality. Thank you very much!
