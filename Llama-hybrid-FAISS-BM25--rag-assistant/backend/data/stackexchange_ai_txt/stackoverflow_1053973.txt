I don't know Clojure, but it looks that, like Scheme, it supports "let loops": (loop [char (readChar)] (if (= char delimiter) '() (do (some-processing) (recur (readChar))))) Hope this is enough to get you started. I referred to http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc9 to answer this question. NOTE: I know that Clojure discourages side-effects, so presumably you want to return something useful instead of '().
