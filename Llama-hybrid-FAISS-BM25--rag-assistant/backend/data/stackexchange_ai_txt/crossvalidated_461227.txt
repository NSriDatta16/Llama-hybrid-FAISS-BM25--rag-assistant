library(tseries) adf.test(df, alternative = 'stationary') Out: Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: df Dickey-Fuller = -2.7776, Lag order = 13, p-value = 0.2491 alternative hypothesis: stationary We fail to reject the null hypothesis that timeseries is nonstationary and conclude that the time series has a unit root. log_returns Out: p-value smaller than printed p-value Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: log_returns Dickey-Fuller = -13.224, Lag order = 13, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary We reject the null hypothesis that this time serries is non stationary and we conclude the the differenced log transformed times serries is stationary.
