OCR / Text Recognition and Recovery Problem

I am working on a research project that deals with American military casualties during WWII. Specifically, I am attempting to construct a count of casualties for each service at the county level. There are two sources of data here, each presenting their own challenges. 1. Army and Air Force data. The National Archives hosts lists of Army and Air Force servicemen killed in action by state and county. There are .gif images of the report available online. Here is a sample for several counties in Texas. I DO NOT need to recover the names or any other information. I simply need to count the number of names (each on its own line, and listed in groups of five) under each County. There are hundreds of these images (50 states - 30-100 for each state). I have been unable to find an OCR program that can tackle this problem adequately. How would you suggest I approach this challenge? (I have some programming expertise in Python and Java, but would prefer to use any off-the-shelf solutions that may exist). 2. Navy and Marine Core data. This data is organized differently. Each state has long lists of casualties with the address of their next of kin. Here is a sample for Texas again. For these images, I need to BOTH count the number of dead and recover their hometown, which is typically the last word in each entry. I can then match these hometowns to counties and merge with database 1. Again, the usual OCR programs have proved inadequate. Any help on this (admittedly more difficult) problem would be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance experts!
