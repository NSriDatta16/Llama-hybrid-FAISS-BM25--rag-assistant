The baseline hazard function in a Cox semi-parametric survival regression is empirical, with 0 hazard between observed event times. If no one died on day 365 in this cohort, then empirically there was 0 probability of death on that date . What's shown in your plot is the the survival curve representing the integrated effect of the hazard over time. Can't see much detail right around day 365, and it's possible that cph.predict_survival_function smooths its output, too (don't use Python for this myself). The empirical survival curve, at least, would be flat between days 364 and 366. So I fear that your attempt to make things "simpler" and your specific choice of day 365 is leading to some confusion instead in this case. Other warnings: Be careful about just how the baseline hazard is defined in your Python program. It might not be the hazard at reference values of all predictors; in some R survival programs it represents a set of some "average" values of the predictors. So read the manual carefully. With the data that you show you will not get reliable confidence intervals for your estimates. As with any multiple regression model, you need the full covariance matrix of coefficient estimates, not just the standard errors of the individual coefficients, to get confidence intervals. See for example Wikipedia on the variance of a sum of correlated variables , as the regression coefficients estimates $\beta_i$ involved in the sum to get the linear predictor ( $\sum \beta_i x_i$ ) are almost certainly not uncorrelated.
