Cookies ignored on Apache/Magento installation

I'm running a Magento based website store on Linux/Apache. In order that user logins are maintained, I've set my cookie lifetime to be close to two years. The cookies are sent out with the right times, I can see them in my browsers. When I visit the site from a previously logged-in browser after about a day, the user is logged out. I can still see the cookies, with their extended life, present in the browser. Where should I start looking to get to the bottom of this issue?
