Neural Network vs Boolean Network

I have been lately researching and working with ANNs and I found that, despite of being used widely on our machines, we are unable to implement such networks in other paradigms: at a molecular level and so on. While in this case Boolean Networks show a promise. Though this question may make no sense at first, it is perhaps an interesting problem to consider: How to convert a neural network to boolean network? Simply constructing a neural network by connecting basic logic gates AND, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, YES et cetera. I want to research on the topic, kindly help me as to where should I begin with because I am surely missing some important keywords here. [Kindly disregard the training/learning process] Thanks in advance
