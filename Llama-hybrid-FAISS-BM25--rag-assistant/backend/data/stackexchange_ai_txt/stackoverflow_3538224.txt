DoDragDrop() from another thread

Every time i want let the user to drag an control, i calling DoDragDrop of that control. The drag & drop works fine, but i have problem with things around: DoDragDrop completely blocking the form, no timer events jumps, no paint messages handled. DoDragDrop blocking not only for the drag & drop operation, but until target program finishing with the drop event (I.E. explorer.exe's suck code). Depending on other program's code is sucks. I thought to call DoDragDrop from a new thread. tried this: Thread dragThread = new Thread(() => { Form frm = new Form(); frm.DoDragDrop("data", DragDropEffects.All); }); dragThread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA); dragThread.IsBackground = true; dragThread.Start(); but it doesn't seems to work. I mean: when doing DoDragDrop from other thread like this, other controls within my program or other programs does not receiving drag&drop messages. Any other solutions?
