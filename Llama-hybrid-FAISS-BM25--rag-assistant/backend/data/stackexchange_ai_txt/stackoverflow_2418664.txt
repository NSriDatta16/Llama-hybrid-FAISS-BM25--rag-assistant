I assume port is HTTP and since you have configured CONFIDENTIAL hence port is blocked. Port does uses SSL which satisfies CONFIDENTIAL hence it is not blocked. . You are missing few elements in your web.xml configuration. You don't have any authorization constraints on your web resources. Hence when you access from port even though you are not authneticated you are still authorized to access the resources as you have not put any auth-constraints on your resourses. You need to have list of containing that can access this application. for should have telling which to give access to and others will be restricted. The roles configured above are Java EE roles. The container (JBoss) needs to be configured to map authenticated roles to Java EE roles. Reference: http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncbe.html http://community.jboss.org/wiki/RoleMappingLoginModule . Updated copy of above web.xml Entire Application /* Authorized Roles ALL_AUTHENTICATED element of server.xml --> CONFIDENTIAL CLIENT-CERT All authenticated users ALL_AUTHENTICATED . In security there are two things, authentication and authorization. Authentication: the act of verifying that a user is a subject and granting the user certain principals; "who you are." Authorization: the act of verifying that a user is allowed to access a certain resource; "what you may do." tell how to authenticate a user or how to ask who you are. If user does not have client certificate, he is unauthenticated user. It does not tell what user can do. However is what you may do. If you put , then only roles mentioned in there can access the respective web resource. You could still have user who is not authenticated but is authorized to access certain resources if resources are not constrainted to certian roles.
