how to calculate the following conditional probability

There are two events involved, say event A and event B. I want to know the probability of event B conditioned on the event A. The relation between the two events are as follows. We can not talk about about event B if event A does not happen, for example, we can not talk about the probability of death of a person if that person is not born yet. Moreover, once A happened, the events A and B are basically independent. Well, almost independent. For example, once a person is born, the probability of that person's death only has relation with the specific time when that person is born, not with the event of the birth of that person. I hope I explain it clearly enough. Any directions for future references are greatly appreciated. Many thanks for your time and attention.
