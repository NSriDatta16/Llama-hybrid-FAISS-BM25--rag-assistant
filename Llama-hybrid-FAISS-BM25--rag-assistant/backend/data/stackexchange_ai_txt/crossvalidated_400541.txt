Yes, there are nonparametric ways of testing if two multivariate samples are from the same joint distribution. I will mention details excluding the ones mentioned by L Fischman . The basic problem you are asking can be called as a 'Two-Sample-Problem' and a good amount of research is going on currently in journals like Journal of Machine Learning Research and Annals of Statistics and others. With my little knowledge on this problem, I can give direction as follows One recent way of testing the multivariate sample sets is through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD); related literature: Arthur Gretton 2012 , Bharath 2010 and others. Other related methods can be found in these research articles. If interested, please go through the articles citing these articles, to get a big picture of the state-of-art in this problem. And YES, for this there are R implementations. If your interest is to compare various point sets (sample sets) with the reference point set, to see how closely they approximate the reference point set, you can use f-divergence . One popular special case of this is Kullback-Leibler Divergence . This is used in many machine learning regimes. This can again be done in two np ways; through parzen window (kernel) approach and K-Nearest Neighbor PDF estimators. There may also be other ways to approach, this answer is in no way a comprehensive treatment of your question ;)
