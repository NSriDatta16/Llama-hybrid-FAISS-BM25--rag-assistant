In fact the question 'which distribution is the best' (i.e. gives me the most money) strongly depends on your goal. Let us throughout assume that you have 'enough' pulls at hand, so you can pull as often as you want. Let us first assume that your goal is to make as much money as possible in average and we just compare the following two distributions: Would you rather pull the left one or the right one? Well, it does not make a difference because if your goal is to maximize the average amount of money you get in every pull then you just get to the equal mean(s) of both distributions. Well this is weird, the right distribution is clearly 'better' because it has a high mean and it has a low variance, i.e. you have more certainty that you get a high amount of money. How can that distribution be equally good as the one that has a high mean by 'coincidence' and much uncertainty whether or not you will get that amount of money... Now let us change the goal to 'we want to have a high probability that we get at least 10 money'. Then we have a higher chance to reach our goal with the right distribution (because the red area of failure is smaller in the right one than in the left one): So in short: There are at least two parameters: How high is the mean and how 'spiky' is the distribution towards the right. How much you can interchange one property for the other depends on the goal that you want to achieve. Examples we have seen: We want to optimize the mean --> the spikyness is completely unimportant, just the mean is important. If we make the goal so that it includes the uncertainty somehow then the second property becomes important.
