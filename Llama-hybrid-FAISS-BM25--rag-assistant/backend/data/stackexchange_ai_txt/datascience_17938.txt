Data pre-processing and feature extraction are the two most important parts of a machine learning technique. That's right, NOT THE MODEL. If you have good features then even a very simple model will get amazing results. Data pre-processing goes from your raw data and remolds it to be better suited to machine learning algorithms. This means pulling out important statistics from your data or converting your data into other formats in order to it being more representative. For example if you are using a technique which is sensitive to range, then you should normalize all your features. If you are using text data you should build word vectors. There are countless ways pre-processing and feature extraction can be implemented. Then, you want to use feature selection. From all the information you extracted from your data not all of it will be useful. There are machine learning algorithms such as: PCA, LDA, cross-correlation, etc. Which will select the features that are the most representative and ignore the rest.
