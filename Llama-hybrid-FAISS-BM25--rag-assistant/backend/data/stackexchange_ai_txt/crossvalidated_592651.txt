Forecasting - Review Volume & Average Rating

I just want to confirm - our review volume has an upward trend but no seasonality. I can use holt's exponential smoothing. Right? for average ratings, no trend, and no seasonality. simple exponential smoothing? Are there any other factors I should consider? Thank you!
