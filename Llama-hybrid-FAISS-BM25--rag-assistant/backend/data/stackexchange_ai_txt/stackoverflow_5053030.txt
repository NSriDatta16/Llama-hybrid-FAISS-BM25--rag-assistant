I just tested your code on my computer and it works correct (with my directories, of course). Maybe you are not getting the expected result because your directory string is broken with an newline char, resulting in: dir /B C:\Users\Fernando\workspace\Organizator2\s1 > C:\Users\Fernando\ workspace\Organizator2\temp.txt The correct should be: dir /B C:\Users\Fernando\workspace\Organizator2\s1 > C:\Users\Fernando\workspace\Organizator2\temp.txt Please try changing the do end to: local source = "C:\\Users\\Fernando\\workspace\\Organizator2\\s1" local directory = ScanDirectory(source, "C:\\Users\\Fernando\\workspace\\Organizator2\\temp.txt")
