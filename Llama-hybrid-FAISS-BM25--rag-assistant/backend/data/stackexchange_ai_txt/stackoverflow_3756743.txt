What is the "acceptable" upper limit for JavaScript array size?

I left this question as generic as possible, but I do have a specific problem that I need to solve in my application and the answer to this would help. The application I am working on uses PHP/MySQL as its backend, and is set up so that no text/words/phrases visible to the user are hardcoded in the HTML/JS that is output to the browser, rather they are stored in a database table associated with a language key that is used to fetch the correct translation of the word/phrase based on the user's language preference. Now this works great for text that exists inside the application's HTML, but in order for this system to work with the javascript files, all javascript must be placed in a .php file and wrapped in tags and included inline with the HTML, CSS ect. This creates some problems with the flexibility in the system's javascript, as it cannot be included as external scripts via tags (I guess unless you set the .php file's headers manually), and perhaps more importantly it cannot be minified/packed etc. when served in the production environment. My first thought of a solution to this problem is to have a php script that's placed before any other javascript which loops through every record in the language database table and creates an associative javascript array using the language key as the array keys and setting their value to the translated phrase according to the user's preference. So, in this way all javascript files could be made into actual .js files and link'ed, minified, packed, etc. as needed, and they would just reference the phrases they need from the master language array that was created (i.e. alert(LANGUAGE.some_text); ) Only problem is, the number of elements in this array could easily get into the thousands possibly even bigger. So back to my original question, what is an acceptable max size for a javascript array, based on the average PC? Or am I attacking this problem entirely wrong to begin with?
