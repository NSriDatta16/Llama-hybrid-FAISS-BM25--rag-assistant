The PHP variable will be expanded into a string value, which should be wrapped in quotes when evaluated in the XPATH expression. I'm not as familiar with PHP, and unsure how the nested quotes(used to reference the $_GET variable) would work when already wrapped with single and double quotes. I'm assuming that you could build the string by concatenating the string fragments and variable: $res = $xml->xpath("/bookstore/book[title = '" . $_GET['title'] . "']"); Or, that you could assign the value to a variable that could be referenced without quotes: xpath("/bookstore/book[title = '$title']"); echo $res[0]->author ?>
