Data Preparation

I faced a mixed data set which contained both continuous and categorical variables (totally more than 200 variables). Now I have chosen 60 variables out of them by the business specification. Then is there any single technique can be used to reduce the dimension further? I researched decision tree method, but it required all variable as categorical. PCA/factor analysis etc. were suitable for continuous variable only. Do I have to transform variables to a single type for process?
