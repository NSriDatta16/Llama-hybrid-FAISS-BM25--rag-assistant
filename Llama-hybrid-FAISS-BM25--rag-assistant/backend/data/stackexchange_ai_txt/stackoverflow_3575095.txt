partially migrating onto a/another framework is strongly discouraged. Don't mess with live-sites (especially not big ones) unless you really(!) need to. You should better set up a testing/migration site in your local office and do a full migration, and thorough testing, before you release anything into the wild. If you really want to do this you should start looking into .htaccess conditional request rewriting to redirect the request either to zend or to your proprietary PHP application. Cheers, haggi
