Some good ideas here... Using a Namespace - suggested by Petruza - is probably the best way to handle it... but it's PHP 5.3 only. Alternatively, Robert's suggestion of refactoring the code is a reasonable idea but will likely take a good deal of time and effort. Since this will have to be done eventually, you might want to do that. Alternatively, if getting the system online is the top priority and you can refactor it afterwards, you might be able to rename the class and all references to it. By adding a prefix - DateTime to company_DateTime - you're namespacing it the old way and your classes should coexist without much difficulty. Of course, if you have to update the supporting libraries any time soon, this is going to make life more difficult, so don't blindly jump into this one...
