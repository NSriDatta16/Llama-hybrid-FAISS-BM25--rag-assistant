Have you tried to connect via CLI? ldapsearch -x -D "cn=admin,dc=home,dc=local" -W -h Do check your syslog, slapd by default logs its output there. You can also use slapcat, which must be executed locally, to know whether your database was created or not (slapd would break if otherwise, anyway). It will output the first database avaliable. Use the flag -n to extract an specific database: slapcat -n My bets are that you're authenticating against the wrong database.
