As Phil mentioned text is also organized in nodes. Therefore your node inhalt has two children: A text node ("123") and an element node named more , which also has a text node ("45"). If you just want to know, if there is text before the element more , test if there is at least one element and then test if the first element is text (should be DOMText as far as I remember). If you like to know, if there is at least one element "at the root", iterate over all children and make the same tests. http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.domtext.php
