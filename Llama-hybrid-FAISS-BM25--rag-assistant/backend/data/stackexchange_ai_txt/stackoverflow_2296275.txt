Retrieve XML Namespaces using Regex

Given an XML fragment that I want to parse with XPath I first need to extract the namespaces to add to the namespace manager. I've been trying to figure out the Regex pattern needed to extract xml attributes that define a namepspace. For example I want to get all the namespaces which I can do some more basic string manipulation on to separate out the namespace name and the url. xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2010-02-12T12:41:45" The attribute name will always begin with xmlns: and I need the regex to read to the end of the value, so include the last " Alternatively a more generic pattern would do the job to just extract ALL attributes in the form name="value" and I can just do some string compares to see if each attribute is a namespace. Hull Inspectors Barnsley Inspectors Hull Inspectors I've not been able to find an example of something like this, nor work it out for myself. Any assistance on this would be very much appriciated. [EDIT] I understand that XML parsers should be used and this is what I am going to do. But all I have is an XML fragment to pass so I must first build a namespace manager and in order to do that I need to extract the namespaces used.
