Clean the data and check how each variable is varying with output. Drop the variables which has less variance among the output variable. sklearn.feature_selection contains multiple methods like SelectKBest, chi2, mutual_info_classif to select the best features. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html Use either PCA,forward stage wise selection methods to get the highly correlated variables with the output. Or built a Random Forest model to get the feature importance values of each feature. Keep the variables with high value and drop the remaining.
