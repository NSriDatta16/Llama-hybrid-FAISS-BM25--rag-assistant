Adjusting imbalance in classification problem reduce precision, accuracy but increase recall

I've learned that adjusting imbalanced data when training a CNN affects model performance which got me thinking "what about in ML?" so I've done some testing on my own, you can check it out here -> https://haneulkim.medium.com/handling-imbalanced-class-in-machine-learning-classifiers-1b5c528f427f I've ended up concluding that as we balance our data using random oversampling our precision and accuracy decrease. I want to know why this is the case... If it requires me to do more research, link to resource would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
