It sounds like you are looking for a prediction-interval , i.e., an interval that contains a prespecified percentage of future realizations. (Look at the tag wikis for prediction-interval and confidence-interval for the difference.) Your best bet is likely to work directly with NN architectures that do not output single point predictions, but entire predictive distributions . You can then directly extract desired prediction intervals (or mean, or median point predictions) from these distributions. I and others have been arguing that predictive distributions are much more useful than point predictions , but to be honest, I have not yet seen a lot of work on predictive distributions with neural nets, although I have been keeping my eyes open. This paper sounds like it might be useful. You might want to search a bit, perhaps also using other keywords like "forecast distributions" or "predictive densities" and such. That said, you might want to look into Michael Feindt's NeuroBayes algorithm, which uses a Bayesian approach to forecast predictive densities.
