Why is resizing images is important when applying CNN or deep learning models?

I have images from deep sea, some are good quality and some barely anything is visible I want to classify the images (they're already labelled) I performed few image enhancement tested it on few images (actual size) but when resize the images (244,244) the pixel look very visible (for example if thr image is gray the pixel of the object have some white pixels) Is resizing images important? Will the model learn even with the pixel issue
