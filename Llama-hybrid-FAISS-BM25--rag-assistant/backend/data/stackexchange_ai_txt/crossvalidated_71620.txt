Law of total variance as Pythagorean theorem

Assume $X$ and $Y$ have finite second moment. In the Hilbert space of random variables with second finite moment (with inner product of $T_1,T_2$ defined by $E(T_1T_2)$ , $\Vert T\Vert^2=E(T^2)$ ), we may interpret $E(Y|X)$ as the projection of $Y$ onto the space of functions of $X$ . We also know that Law of Total Variance reads $$\operatorname{Var}(Y)=E(\operatorname{Var}(Y|X)) + \operatorname{Var}(E(Y|X))$$ Is there a way to interpret this law in terms of the geometric picture above? I have been told that the law is the same as Pythagorean Theorem for the right-angled triangle with sides $Y, E(Y|X), Y-E(Y|X)$ . I understand why the triangle is right-angled, but not how the Pythagorean Theorem is capturing the Law of Total Variance.
