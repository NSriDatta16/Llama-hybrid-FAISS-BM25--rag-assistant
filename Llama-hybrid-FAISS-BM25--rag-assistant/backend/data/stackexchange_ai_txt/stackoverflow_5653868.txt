What makes this HTTPS WebRequest time out even though it works in the browser?

Here's my request: var request = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create("https://mtgox.com/"); request.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer(); request.AllowAutoRedirect = false; request.Accept = "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"; request.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.AcceptEncoding] = "gzip, deflate"; request.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.AcceptLanguage] = "en-gb,en;q=0.5"; request.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.AcceptCharset] = "ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7"; request.Timeout = 5000; request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0"; request.Method = "GET"; request.GetResponse(); The headers were copied from Firefox using HttpFox. I used Fiddler2 to verify that at least for HTTP requests, the headers are completely identical between Firefox requests and my requests. However, when performing a request to this specific website using HTTPS, the request simply times out. It works for other websites. I must be performing it differently to Firefox, because it always works in Firefox. I can't debug it using Fiddler2, however, because whenever Fiddler2 forwards these requests they also time out , even when originated by Firefox. Is it just a really buggy website? Which part of the above gives me away as not being Firefox?
