Unit testing Jade

What techniques and design strategies have people used to aid in unit testing Jade applications? In particular, how do people typically go about testing Behaviours - which are tightly coupled to the Agent instance and the Jade environment? I'm aware of the JadeMX project, but this appears to be geared more towards system testing - in particular the message exchange between collaborating agents. Thanks.
