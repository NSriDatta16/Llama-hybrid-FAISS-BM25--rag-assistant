This is an impossible task in any programming language. You have 30 features. There are therefore $2^{30}$ possible combinations of features. $2^{30} = 1,073,741,824$. If you fit one model a second, you'll be done in $298,261.68$ hours, or about 34 years (give or take a few days due to leap years). Therefore you need a different feature selection approach. And that question has been asked before: Feature selection with Random Forests
