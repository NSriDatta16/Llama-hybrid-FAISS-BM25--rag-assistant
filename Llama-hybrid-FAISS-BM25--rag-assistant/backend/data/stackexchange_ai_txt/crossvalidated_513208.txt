Although it is feasible to apply classification incl training, cv and benchmarking using cluster labels obtained by clustering the same data, it should be clear that this is will be "successful" even if you have RANDOM high dimensional data. Benchmarking on the same data that you used for clustering leads to overoptimistic classifier performance estimates. Therefore, data science purists do not like it. Similarly, you get overoptimistic p values when you assess differences for data between clusters of some high dim data. So, be careful to use statistical testing for feature selection prior to classifier building - tests can just be regarded as heuristic procedures to prioritize features - p value not be interpreted the usual way.
