Survival Calculations

I am trying to calculate survival rate for all grades (Kindergarten to 1st Grade) of school. See the example below for Grade 1 students. Y0 refers to number of students enrolled in grade 1 in that particular year. Y1 : how many of them are still in the school 1 year later. These students would have moved to grade 2 in Y1. Similarly for the other years. I have similar data for other grades as well for years 2010 to 2019. As of now I am calculating survival rate based on (number of students in Yn divided by number of students in Y0). For example : In Y2 survival rate is column sum of Y2 divided by column sum of Y0 (excluding 2018 as data is not available in Y2 for 2018). It is 76%. I will do the same calculations for other Yn periods and for other grades and then average out all the annual rates. I wanted to know is there any better way to calculate survival rate more statistically?
