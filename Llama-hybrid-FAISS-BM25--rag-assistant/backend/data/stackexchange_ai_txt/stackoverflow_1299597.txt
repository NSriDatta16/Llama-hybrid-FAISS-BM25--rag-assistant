As far as this being a "bug" with relation to the spec; it isn't. As the author of the post questions, the behaviour for this would be "undefined" since this behaviour in IE only happens on form controls, as per spec: CSS 2.1 does not define which properties apply to form controls and frames, or how CSS can be used to style them. User agents may apply CSS properties to these elements. Authors are recommended to treat such support as experimental. ( http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#conformance ) Cheers!
