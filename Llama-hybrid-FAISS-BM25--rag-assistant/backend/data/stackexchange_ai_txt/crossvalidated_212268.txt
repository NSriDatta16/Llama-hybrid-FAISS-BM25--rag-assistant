Naive Bayes assumes conditional independence, $P(X|Y,Z)=P(X|Z)$ , Whereas more general Bayes Nets (sometimes called Bayesian Belief Networks) will allow the user to specify which attributes are, in fact, conditionally independent. There is a very good discussion of this in Tan, Kumar, Steinbach's Introduction to Data Mining textbook. They also have instructor powerpoint slides: Tan, Steinbach, Kumar - Introduction to Data Mining - Lecture Notes for Chapter 5 - Data Mining Classification: Alternative Techniques which should give an example of this assumption and why it can be flawed.
