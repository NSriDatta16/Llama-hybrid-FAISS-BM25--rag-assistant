I think you probably just need to work your way through the examples located in /Developer/Examples/AppKit/ at it's essence Preview.app is not much more than a window with a scrollable content view, plus a toolbar and a drawer. However, in many ways it is a tour-de-force of the capabilities of the AppKit (drag'n'drop, hierarchical menus, context menus, spotlight, textedit, userdefaults, rulers, even the kitchen sink, you get the idea...) play with the appKit examples, you'll be glad you did!
