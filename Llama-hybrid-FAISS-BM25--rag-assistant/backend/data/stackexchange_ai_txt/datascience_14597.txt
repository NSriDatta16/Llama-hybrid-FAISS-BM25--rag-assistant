I don't think there are best practices in this developing area yet but, in addition to cookiecutter, there were some interesting ideas shown in a tutorial at the SciPy 2016 conference. Personally, I try to minimize the number of sub-folders in a project unless I have a really good way to distinguish them and have good reason to keep them separate. Bad organization is nearly as bad as no organization. I think best practice might depend on use case -- not every project needs the same amount of boilerplate.
