Writing better SQL: Dan Tow's "Tuning SQL" by O'Reilly's a very good cross-platform SQL tuning guide. It's not a short read, but it does cover some pretty hairy examples and shows you how to tune your queries. There's no FAST=TRUE option in Oracle; if there were, it'd be hidden and you wouldn't be allowed to change it. His web site's at http://singingsql.com . Tuning by Response Time: Cary Millsap's focused heavily on using the Oracle wait interface and queuing theory to tune SQL and systems over the last 20 years or thereabouts; both his current company ( http://method-r.com ) and his previous one ( http://hotsos.com ) have a number of useful resources. Tuning via Optimizer Statistics: Wolfgang Breitling at http://centrexcc.com has done some excellent work in demonstrating tuning by cardinality feedback to demonstrate that if the SQL's good and there's too much load, the problem can be that you're lying to Oracle (or Oracle's making unsafe deductions) about the nature of the data. He then shows you how to fix it. All of these are valuable. All of these alone are incomplete. And I second the recommendation of Jonathan Lewis' fine work; he's got a pretty fair tuning blog over at http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com
