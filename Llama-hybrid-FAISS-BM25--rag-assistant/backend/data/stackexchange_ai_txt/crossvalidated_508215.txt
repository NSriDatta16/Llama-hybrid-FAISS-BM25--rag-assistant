Depends on what you mean by probability. If you are a frequentist, then conditional probability P(A|B) means something akin to how much B causes A. If you are Bayesian, P(A|B) only measures the logical connection between B and A. To sum up, for a Bayesian, the answer to your question is yes, for a frequentist, it is no. For ones, who are a mix of both, it is a tricky question.
