Deprecated generally means that you're discouraged from using the function. For some reason or another, it has been decided that Java would be better off without it (because a better alternative exists, and you should use that instead), and so it might be removed from a future version of Java. Deprecation is basically a warning that "this will probably get removed in the future, although we're keeping it around a bit longer to give you a chance to remove it from your code first"
