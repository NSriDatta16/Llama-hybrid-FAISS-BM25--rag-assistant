We have tried this with our D7 Application, or actually we intended to do this and ended giving up during the analysis phase, as we could'nt find and suitable tool to do this with without having to fix lots of bugs and errors behind it. I would advice you to consider having a new IDE (If you have an old one) and if you really have to do this. Anyway check this similar question and read the experience of people who had this issue, its not really encouraging.
