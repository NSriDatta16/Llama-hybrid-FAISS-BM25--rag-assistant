A somewhat elegant, but perhaps naive approach, would be to take the coin bias data as trustworthy and known, and include those biases as offsets in a binomial generalized linear model. This automatically handles any imbalances in the number of trials. This also assumes that the effects for year and manufacturer are fixed effects, and that's really in the eye of the modeler. You can code this analysis in R, so I will demonstrate by creating fake data with the additive biases you indicated. ## Create factors for predictors m This analysis could be extended depending on the real problem: Random effects could be used to model the manufacturer biases The formula for the random effects version might be f3 if you use lme4. A prior distribution for coin biases could be determined from the coin bias database, which is updated based on the experimental data. This would be more realistic than using offsets for coin biases.
