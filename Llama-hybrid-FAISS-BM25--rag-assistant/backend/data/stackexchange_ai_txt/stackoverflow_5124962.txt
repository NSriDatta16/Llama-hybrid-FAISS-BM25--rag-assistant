Help determining why XCode "Failed to upload MyApp.app" to my iPad

An hour ago everything worked great. I was busy hacking away at my code, deploying it to the simulator or my iPad as I liked, and no problems. Then I thought all the bugs were gone, so I created a new Provisioning Profile for the app and added it to the "Release" Project Settings. Suddenly, I cannot launch the app on my iPad anymore, and the only thing that XCode tells me is "Failed to upload MyApp.app"... no elaboration at all. I'm still using the Developer Profile (which the organizer assures me is installed on my iPad) for the "Debug" Project Settings. I tried deleting the most recent version from my iPad, deleting the Build/ directory, and then installing but no joy. Help, please!
