I have actually found a solution for the problem in question indeed. I successfully implemented my code in a similar fashion to what is described in the following post from the "Thoughts from Mirality, Random thoughts and musings from Miral at Mirality Systems" blog under the subject "Unmanaged callbacks across AppDomains". Good Luck, Roger http://lambert.geek.nz/2007/05/29/unmanaged-appdomain-callback/
