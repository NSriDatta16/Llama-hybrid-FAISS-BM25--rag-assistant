Pydev does have some unit-test integration, but that's only as a run configuration...so... This is not a very elegant way, but if you: Enable Project->Build Automatically In your project properties, add a new builder of type Program Configure it to run your tests and select 'during auto builds' Then at least you will get something that outputs the test results to the console on resource saves.
