I have created signed applet to read file from client side.. It is not necessary to sign an applet to gain access to the client file system if the applet is deployed using JWS in a 1.6.0_10+ (Next Generation Plug-In) JRE. Such applets have access to the JNLP API FileContents object. Here is a demo. of the FileContents object . ..Please help how can i do without administrator role. But ultimately, if the file access is barred (for the specific file in question) by the OS, there is nothing that Java can (or should) do about it. Perhaps the real problem is the exact path of this file. What is it? What does it do? Where is it located and can that path be changed? A sub-directory of user.home is a good place to store anything of interest to the application that is subject to change. For storing small amounts of data, JWS also offers the PersistenceService to all apps., including sand-boxed.
