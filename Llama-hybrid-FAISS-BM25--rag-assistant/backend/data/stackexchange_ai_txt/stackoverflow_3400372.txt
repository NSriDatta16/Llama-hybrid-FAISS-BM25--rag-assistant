I think that you should firstly check how much your disk is fragmented. If your file is in many pieces and you don't have large continuous free space for second one then disk must move head much often which is very slow. Maybe your disk is simple old and slow and you reach it's maximum performance. In that case solution is simple you need to buy new one, or better two and create RAID 0. You may also check if during copying something else doesn't use the same disk, for example anti-virus or indexing service. I didn't propose any software solution, because I don't believe there is anything faster than functions provided by OS.
