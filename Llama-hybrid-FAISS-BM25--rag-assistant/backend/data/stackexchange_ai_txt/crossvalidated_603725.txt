How to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a time series spread?

I am just starting anew in econometrics, and am presently trying out statistical arbitrage, specifically cointegration. I have stochastic time series data for variables A, B. Engle-Granger testing is used for the project. What I have done: Performed a stationarity test. Performed differencing Performed OLS regression Found the trading pair formula by calculating the spread. Which is spread = dependent (A) - regressor (B). Now, where I got confused is how to get the mean and standard deviation of the spread. I'm a bit confused on how to calculate these, and I'll really appreciate it if I can get a help in this regard.
