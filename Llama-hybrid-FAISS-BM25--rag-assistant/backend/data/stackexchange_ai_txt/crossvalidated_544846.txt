You state that the hypothesis you are interested in is that the proportion of people who prefer chocolate is larger than .5. You also state that this proportion is influenced by age, and you want to control for that. However saying that the proportion is influenced by age, means that there is no longer a single proportion, but one proportion for each age. So the problem is your hypothesis no longer makes sense. The solution is to think about what it is that you want to know exactly (e.g. do you want to know the proportion of an average aged person or the average proportion). What the right hypothesis for your problem is depends on the details. Since this is obviously a fictional example, there is not much more to be said here.
