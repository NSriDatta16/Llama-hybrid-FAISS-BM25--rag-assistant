Yes, you are correct. To confirm, I downloaded the 2021â€”2022 data for Table B6: Rates of patient mortality after listing . (The healthcare application is organ transplantation.) The expected & observed number of deaths for adult candidates are denoted by sfl_ad_exp_c & sfl_ad_obs_c , respectively. Let's do the calculations for the hazard ratio (HR) using the STRT.org Bayesian methodology: The prior on HR is Gamma (with parameters shape and rate ), the likelihood of the data (number of deaths) is Poisson. The Gamma is the conjugate prior for the Poisson, so the posterior distribution of the hazard ratio is Gamma as well. # prior: hr ~ gamma(prior.shape, prior.rate) prior.shape The 95% credible interval for HR is calculated as $[q_{0.025}, q_{0.975}]$ where $q_\alpha$ is the $\alpha$ -quantile of the Gamma distribution. qgamma(c(0.025, 0.975), shape = posterior.shape, rate = posterior.rate) We can check that, for each transplant center/program, this gives the reported lower & upper bounds sfl_ad_hr_lb_c & sfl_ad_hr_ub_c . And the posterior mean sfl_ad_hr_c is calculated as posterior.shape / posterior.rate .
