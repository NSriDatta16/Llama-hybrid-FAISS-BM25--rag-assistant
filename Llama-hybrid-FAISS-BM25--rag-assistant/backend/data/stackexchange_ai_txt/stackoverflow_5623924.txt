How to group financial time series objects in Matlab

I want to group 2 or more financial time series objects of different length. Specifically, I have FTS a and b, a is shorter than b, and how can I get a time series c, so that c has two sub series a and b, and all the missing records in a is filled with null values. Thank you.
