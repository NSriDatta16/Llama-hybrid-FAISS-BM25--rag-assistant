Great links above. I'd like to clarify that though XBAPs and ClickOnce apps run in a sandbox by default, they can be elevated to higher trust. This is trickier to do with XBAP as it requires a Code Access Security policy to exist on the customers machine and there is no easy way to get it there (other than a web-launched MSI which defeats the purpose). Click-Once applications can specify that they need elevated privileges in the manifest (this is done in project settings). When the application is first launched, if the app needs more privileges than the default zone (usually Internet) the user is prompted and warned but they can approve the elevated rights. Silverlight runs in a secure sandbox only with no way to elevate. There is a secure way to access local storage but there is no way to interact directly with other hardware like USB devices. Silverlight is great for (nearly) zero-touch application deployment, so long as the application can live within the security and feature boundaries that Silverlight provides. Silverlight does continue to evolve however, and those boundaries continue to expend. With the Live Framework, for example, we can now run Silverlight applications outside of the browser on the desktop in offline mode with data synchronization. I've got a screencast about that on channel 9 . I too would avoid ActiveX unless you just can't fit what you need in one of these other profiles. ActiveX is getting more and more restricted with every browser release and it's a lot harder to control and a lot less secure than the alternatives. ActiveX can be a management headache for IT Pros, which in turn makes it more of challenge to get your app deployed in an enterprise. Hope that helps and good luck with your project.
