It depends on what you want to achieve. And you can do it using different distance measures. If you want to find clusters of objects that are generally lighter, vs objects which are generally heavier, then yeah, you can do it with a dot product distance or an euclidean distance (which I wouldn't recommend for a 30 dimensional space). But your data is basically a time series data. So you can look at your data from a different perspective. For instance, would you be interested in objects which gain weight and then loose weight with a similar pattern? i.e. objects with a similar pattern through time to be in the same cluster. If yes, then you can use a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure to put objects with a similar pattern together. The distance measure is independent of the clustering approach you take. Depending on your data, you may want to use a hierarchical clustering or a center based clustering. And different distance measures put your data in a differently shaped space. So you may want to use one clustering approach for one distance measure, and another for a different distance measure.
