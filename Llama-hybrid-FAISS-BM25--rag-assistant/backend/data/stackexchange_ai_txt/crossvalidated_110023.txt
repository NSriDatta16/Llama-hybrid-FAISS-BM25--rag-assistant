I once tried an approximational approach in a similar problem which worked quite well. The idea is to start with the normal distribution where arithmetics with distributions is simple. You doubt in this, and you're right since for small samples (small degrees of freedom) the normal distribution has considerably lighter tails than the $t$-distribution. Thus your critical values would be too small and your test becomes liberal. I got rid of it the following way: The heavier tails of the $t_k$-distribution correspond (among others) to larger variance compared to the normal distribution: $\frac{k}{k-2}$ instead of $1$ like in case of the normal distribution. So I took the quantiles from the normal distribution but inflated them by $\sqrt{\frac{k}{k-2}}$. This way I accounted for the higher variance if the sample size is finite. I encourage you to try some simulations if it works in your case. This approach is very easy but yielded quite fair type-I-errors in the small sample cases I simulated. (It was not directly a regression setting but I also had two dependent $t$-distributed test statistics I wanted to transform linearly.) I didn't find something similar in the literature. Perhaps it's too straightforward to write it down.
