I do not think it is in the best interest of accessibility to dynamically alter a user's focus prior to alerting the user of such a change. What you can do that is accessible is redirect a user to a fragment URI pointing to the id attribute of the document object in question. That way you are not having to use any JavaScript. So, for instance, if a user requests a page at this URI: http://example.com/page.html You can redirect the user with your ASP code and a HTTP 302 code to this page: http://example.com/page.html#myInputIDValue That would presume the input field in question had the following attribute: id="myInputIDValue"
