It depends on what you want to achieve, and how you'd define performance. Suppose it is a running exercise program with 3 exercises in a week with increasing targets. The first formula calculates the average exercise success, the second formula defines the weekly success, where the exercises are weighted with the goals. There is no right or wrong, just interpretation of the numbers. Just to confuse you a bit more: suppose: Goal: 8, Achieved 1, Goal: 2, achieved 1 Goal: 2, Achieved 0, Goal: 8, achieved 3. Case 1. beats Case 2. on both instances in formula 1, but loses in formula 2.
