Classical book or jupyter notebooks?

I am working on a series of chapters for a book on Machine Learning, in particular on the mathematics behind it, but with clear references to how to implement it in Python (see vectorization for example). My question to the community is (and apologies if this is the wrong place): would you prefer a classical book (pdf) or a series of Jupyter notebooks with math, text and code in the same place that you can fork, study and use? The book would be mainly focusing on theory, although I will support it with several examples (see for example overfitting, or optimisation algorithms like Adam or Momentum). Feedback would be much welcome, before I start (the huge) work on it. Thanks in advance, Umberto
