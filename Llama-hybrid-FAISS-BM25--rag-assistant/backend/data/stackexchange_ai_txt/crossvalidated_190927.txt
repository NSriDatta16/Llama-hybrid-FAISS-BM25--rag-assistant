FA or PCA is commonly done on the variable-by-variable ($p \times p$) covariance $\mathbf{C}$ or correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$. In your case, since the $p$ variables exceeds the $n$ records ($p>>n$), then by definition, there will be $p-n$ zero eigenvalues of $\mathbf{R}$. In this case, the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) of your $\mathbf{R}$ will overcome your problems. As a totally relevant aside, a problem with FA is that there is an infinite number of solutions, whereas for PCA there is not.
