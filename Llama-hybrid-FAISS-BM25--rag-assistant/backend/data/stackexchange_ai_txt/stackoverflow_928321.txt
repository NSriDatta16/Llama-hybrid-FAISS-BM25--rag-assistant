If possible, I would redesign. This is not something you will ever be able to effectively query 12 values on at the same time on (it will require 12 joins) Please read this wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-Attribute-Value_model#Downsides Never seen a database yet that used this model that didn't run into serious performance issues eventually. This design looks elegant to non-database people but is actually usually a sign of a badly designed database.
