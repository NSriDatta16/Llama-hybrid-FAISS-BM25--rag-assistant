Selecting member IDs as individual variables in a predictive healthcare model

I'm working on a penalized regression model that will predict the number of days until a member's readmission to a hospital following the next discharge, based on past episode data. Many of the 28,474 members in my dataset have multiple episodes: > memb_counts Given that a large number of these members will continue to have hospitalization episodes in the future, I think it makes sense to include separate indicator variables for at least some of the member IDs in the training dataset. However, now I'm faced with a dataset containing over 28,000 dimensions! Is there a feasible method (not manual selection) for determining which Member IDs to retain as predictors? Principal components analysis? Perhaps I could exclude all members with fewer than 5 or 10 episodes from consideration, but I'm still facing a formidable dimensionality reduction problem.
