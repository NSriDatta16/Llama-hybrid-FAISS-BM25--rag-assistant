Regression equation for ordinal data

I'm doing research where a part of the collected data is of Ordinal type. I will implement ANN with Logistic Regression function in the Activation function. What I have learnt from documents of other websites as well as an answer in https://datascience.stackexchange.com/ , the target value is of ordinal type while the independent variables are of ratio or interval type. But my independent data is of Ordinal type and the target data will be label (say Like or Unlike). How should I build a function for ANN if I'm not wrong in my understanding?
