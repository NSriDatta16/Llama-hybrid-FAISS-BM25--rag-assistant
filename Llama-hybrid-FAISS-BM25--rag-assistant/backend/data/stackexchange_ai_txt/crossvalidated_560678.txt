Combining several granger causality tests

I have two time series and I am testing them with gragner. The problem is that it's not continuous, one timeseries is constant while the other one has half of the time data. Example: yes = has data, no = doesn't have data series1 = yes,yes,yes,yes series2 = yes,no,yes,no What I am doing is that I am checking granger causality for 0,0 then 2,2 then 4,4 periods and skipping the periods that don't have 1:1 data. Can I average the F statistics and p values or is this bad math?
