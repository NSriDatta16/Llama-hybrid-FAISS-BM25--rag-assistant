NLME relies on a "univariate" as opposed to "multi-variate" data structure. See the description below, copied from my response to another question here: Data manipulation in R for functional data analysis As to how you would get the data into R and into one of these formats, we'd need to know more about what your input file looks like and the format that it is in. However, here are some general tips on formatting the type of data that you have for analysis in any system. Singer (Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis) suggests two generally useful layouts for the statistical analysis of longitudinal data: the person-level (mutlivariate) structure or the person-period (univariate) structure. The latter is generally preferrable for a number of reasons. The person-level data structure (or the multivariate format) contains one row of data for each observational unit (such as persons) and a variable for each measurement period. Age would not be included in the data set and would be implicit in the levels of your time factor (e.g., in a repeated measures ANOVA). This structure can lead naturally to summaries that aren't very meaningful, is less efficient than it could be, and cannot account for your unequally spaced observations (differing age intervals between observations) or time-varying covariates. That data setup might look something like this... Mutlivariate ID Gender height1 height2 height3 height4 height5 1 Boy 76.2 74.6 78.2 77.7 76 2 Boy 80.4 78.0 81.8 80.5 80 3 Boy 83.3 82.0 85.4 83.3 83 4 Girl 96.0 94.9 97.1 98.6 96 5 Girl 87.7 90.0 89.6 90.3 89 6 Girl 85.7 86.9 87.9 87.0 86 A preferable layout is often the person-period layout (or the univariate format) where each individual has a record for each time for which they were observed. The person-period dataset has a number of advantages. First, it leads to more natural summaries of the data, e.g. getting an average by group, by time or by group and time is now straight forward. Second, the dataset will accommodate entry of unequal intervals in the time dimension, such as you have here. In addition, if you have them, you could add columns for any other demographic covariates and these could differ over time. Also, data in this format is prepared for modern analytical techniques such as multilevel modeling. Finally, the univariate data structure is consistent with good practice in database design and normalization, increasing efficiency and making it appropriate for the typical query structure. The univariate layout would look something like this... Univariate ID Age Gender Height 1 1 Boy 76.2 1 1.5 Boy 74.6 1 3 Boy 78.2 1 5 Boy 77.7 2 1 Girl 80.4 2 1.5 Girl 81.8 2 3 Girl 80.5 2 5 Girl 80 3 1 Boy 115.8 3 1.5 Boy 112.3 3 3 Boy 111.0 3 5 Boy 104.1
