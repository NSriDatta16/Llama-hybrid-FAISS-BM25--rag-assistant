The easiest way, which is also best performance- and security-wise, is to use . Just create small version of your page for embedding. is loaded synchronously and gets access to site's cookies, so it's not a good solution for embedding. If you just ask your users to embed in place where they want the gadget to be, you'll be able to generate markup with document.write (easy, works in HTML only). A better way is to ask users to invoke function from your script that inserts code into selected DOM node (using W3C DOM). This allows smarter webmasters to load script asynchronously. SWFObject is designed like that.
