My own advice is not to talk about the following things: p-values, test-statistics, the likelihood of things happening by chance alone. Don't be too hard on yourself about the lawyer. This is an educated person who spent at least a semester in a university Statistics class, and not a bit of it stuck with him. It's the same story for virtually every other non-scientist I've worked with - statistical significance doesn't stick . It's just too unnatural a concept. I encourage you to explain statistical significance in terms of evidence . Classical statisticians have encoded evidence on a 0 to 1 scale, where smaller values constitute more evidence and 0.05 is where the line is conventionally drawn.
