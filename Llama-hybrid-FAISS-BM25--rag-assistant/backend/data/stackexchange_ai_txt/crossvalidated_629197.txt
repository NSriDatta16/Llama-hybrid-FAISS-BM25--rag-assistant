Interpreting the results of a regression with an interaction

I'm having some trouble with interpreting the output of a regression and showing why (I think) it makes sense. Assume I am regressing the price of a good on a dummy (e.g. whether the good was sold in a specific region), a continuous variable (e.g., the cost of production) and their interaction. Something like: y= a +b1*I+ b2C+b3*I*C Where I=1 if the good was sold in Region A, and equals 0 if sold in region B. C is the cost of production. Now, I get my estimates. Something like: b1= 0.17 b2=0.05 b3=-0.03. Everything is statistically significant. I know that the average cost of production is LOWER in Region A, so it makes sense to me that b3 is negative. My issue now arises when I want to estimate the effect of selling in region A, everything else equal. If I take the derivative with respect to I, I would get: 0.17-0.03*C. This means that the price in Region A would be higher (due to b1) but decrease in the cost of production, compared to selling price in Region B. But I know that prices are not equal, and in fact they are higher in Region B. As I am looking at the difference between Region A and Region B, my immediate (but likely very wrong) idea would be to look at the difference also in cost of production between the two region, and use that delta instead of C; this does not seem correct. Is there a way to numerically show that we should, somehow, consider the difference in the average level of costs of production? Apologies if I was not clear!
