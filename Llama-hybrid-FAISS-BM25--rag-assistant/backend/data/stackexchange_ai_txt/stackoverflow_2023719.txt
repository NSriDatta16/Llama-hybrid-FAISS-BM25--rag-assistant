Local web storing of files using HTML5

I was fascinated by Google Gears and its potential use in online game development, particularly massive online game development. One could take the game resources and store them locally using ResourceStore , thus reducing game load time, server bandwidth issues, etc. I have therefore welcomed the news that HTML5 supports offline storage. However, from what I can tell it only supports a manifest file for resource caching , which looks like something ManagedResourceStore is supposed to offer. I didn't study either in detail. I also didn't find something that would allow programatically loading resources and caching them (as apparently ResourceStore allows). Is it possible to programatically control which resources should be cached? Or would I have to store each "map" on a separate page with separate manifest file (with this being in fact done through a server side script, instead of literally creating pages and manifests -- this is still fugly)?
