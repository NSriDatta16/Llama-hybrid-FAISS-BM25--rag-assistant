Importance of variables in Decission trees

I'm training decission trees for a project in which I want to predict the behavior of one variable according to the others (there are about 20 other variables). Some time ago I was using simple logistic regression models in another project (using R). There is a nice feature in R where you can see the statistical significance of every variable introduced in the model. This helps in simplifying the model by removing not meaningful variables. I wonder if there is a way to do the same with Decission trees (this time I'm using Python and scikit-learn). Can we see which variables are really important for a trained model in a simple way? Thanks!
