Should my persistence class return Option or rely on exceptions?

My application's persistence layer is formed by a Storage trait and an implementing class. I'm vacillating on this issue: should the fetchFoo(key: Key) methods should return Option[Foo] , or should they throw FooNotFound exceptions if the key cannot be found? To add flavour to the issue, the persistence layer - it is written in Scala - is called by Java code. Dealing with scala.Option in Java code? Hmmm. In fact, until yesterday, the persistence layer was written in Java; I've just re-written it in Scala. As a Java code base, it relied on exceptions rather than returning nulls; but now that I've encountered scala.Option, I'm reconsidering. It seems to me that Scala is less enamoured of exceptions than Java.
