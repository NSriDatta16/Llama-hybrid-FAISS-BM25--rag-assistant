In a similar situation but in different field we used correlation matrix shrinkage by Ledoit Wolf . The idea's to calculate the pair-wise covariance matrix using all available data. If instead you drop observations where one student's data is missing, there's nothing left of the dataset. So, we use the intersection of data for each pair of items, not for the entire set. Since s correlation matrix can end up being non PSD in this case, we apply the mentioned shrinkage method to it before plugging into PCA
