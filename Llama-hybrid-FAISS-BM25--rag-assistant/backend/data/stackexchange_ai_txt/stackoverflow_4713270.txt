If there is a better way for this kind of delete. Yes, you could use HQL instead of SQL . If there is a possibility to get the Where condition for Delete [using Expressions]: No, AFAIK that's not implemented. Since NHibernate is an open source project, I encourage you to find out if anyone has proposed this , and/or discuss it on the mailing list .
