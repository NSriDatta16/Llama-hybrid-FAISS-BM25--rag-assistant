Practical interpretation for $u_t = \log(x_t) - \log(x_{t-1})$

I have a time series $x_t$. If I use the transformation $u_t = log(x_t) - log(x_{t-1})$, my new time series $u_t$ has properties of white noise (random). I wonder whether there is any practical interpretation for $u_t$? Thanks for your help.
