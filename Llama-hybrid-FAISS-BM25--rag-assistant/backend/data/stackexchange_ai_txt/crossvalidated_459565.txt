How to estimate parameters of a hierarchical model?

I have the following hierarchical model, where $t$ stands for time and $y_t, x_{1t}, x_{2t}, \dots, z_{1t}, z_{2t}, \dots$ are known. I want to estimate the parameters of the model using a frequentist approach, not a Bayesian approach. Using Maximum Likelihood estimation seems appropriate to me. So, I was thinking of using an EM-algorithm. However, I am not sure if this is the best way. Any thoughts?
