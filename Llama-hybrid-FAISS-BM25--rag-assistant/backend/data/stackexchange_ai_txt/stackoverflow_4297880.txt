The maximum your average varchar field allows (254?). You are not winning anything by making it arbitrarily shorter. The fine-grained size controls on numbers and chars are more or less a relic from the past, when every byte mattered. It can matter today - if you are dealing with tens or hundreds of millions of rows, or thousands of queries per sec. For your average database (i.e. 99% of them) performance comes from proper indexing and querying, NOT making your rows a couple of bytes smaller. Only restrict the length of a field when there is some formal specification that defines a maximum length, like 13 digits for an EAN code or 12 characters for an ISIN.
