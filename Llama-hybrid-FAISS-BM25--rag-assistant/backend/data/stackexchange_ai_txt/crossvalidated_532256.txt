Are LSTMs just RNNs that use a different activation function?

I read online that LSTMs are just RNNs that calculate neuron activations differently. I am not clear on the terminology though. Do we actually call these activations, because they refer not to the output of each neuron but instead to the function that determines the state of each neuron (which the neurons of state-less networks do not have of course). Is it appropriate to say that LSTMs are simply RNNs with a different activation function? (Instead of something like sigmoid, relu, tanh, etc. LSTMs use... well, I'm not sure if it has a name, but it's a particular series of operations that are distinct from any other activation function).
