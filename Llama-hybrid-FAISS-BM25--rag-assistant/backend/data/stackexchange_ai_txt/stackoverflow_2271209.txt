WinPCap Data Getting Truncated

Working on parsing Arp packets and I found this nice problem. when receiving an Arp packet I was parsing the target's IP address. I have c0 a8 in my hex dumb but after that it ends. I am missing data! I see the data in Wireshark but I am not getting the data through WinPCap. I have yet to run into this issue before. Any ideas SO? So far no memory access errors though. Probably just luck. :x EDIT: My main look for processing packets is from the example pktdump_ex. Here is the while line while((res = pcap_next_ex( fp, &header, &pkt_data)) >= 0) After that is executed, the snalen is 2b.
