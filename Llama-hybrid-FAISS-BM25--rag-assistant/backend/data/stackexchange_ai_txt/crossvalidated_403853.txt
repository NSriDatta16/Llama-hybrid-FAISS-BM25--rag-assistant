Starting with your latter point first, it's not the case that scores for the higher-order factor would be calculated using some sort of crude weighted sum. Unique/error variance in your indicators for the first-order factors is going to get left behind, and only the shared variance in the first-order factors is going to be captured by the higher-order factor, so only in the (unlikely) case that all observed variance in your indicators was shared variance from the higher-order factor would something like a sum-score work. And even then, the construction of sum scores on the basis of a true latent variable requires an awfully strange measurement model (Rose et al., 2019). The matter of providing strong evidence of a higher-order factor is, itself, also more difficult than many appreciate, as one must appraise its model adequacy against numerous competitors (e.g., bifactor models, correlated lower-order factor models, single factor models, exploratory structural equation models, etc). A few references/examples to consider in this process are Brunner et al. (2012), Chen et al. (2006), Chen et al. (2012), Credé & Harms (2015), Morin et al. (2016; highly recommended), Mulaik & Quartetti (1997), and Wiesner et al. (2013). Finally, I will note that in my own personal experience, many researchers are (too) comfortable creating "overall" scores (sums or averages) of ostensibly higher-order/general factors on the basis of correlated factor models without ever actually directly appraising the adequacy of higher-order/bifactor models.
