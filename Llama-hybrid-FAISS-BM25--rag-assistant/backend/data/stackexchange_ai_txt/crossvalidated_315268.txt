R -Goodness of fit for t distribution with estimated parameters

I'm trying to find out if my data are fitting a t-distribution. My data set is very large (more than 5000 data) and I used "fitdistr" (MASS package) to estimate mean, sd and df. I used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ("ks.test.t", LambertW package in R) to asses the goodness of fit, but I read that it should not be used if the parameters of my distribution have been estimated from the sample. First of all I was wondering why KS test should not work fine. Is there a test, in R, to asses the goodness of fit with estimated parameters ? I'm really a beginner in using R, so I would appreciate if you can explain me step by step how to do it. Thank you in advance! =)
