Check out the MoveMe sample project in the SDK to see a basic example of dragging and animation. You'll have to implement the logic yourself to figure out where to move the icons based on the geometry of your grid and the progress of the drag operation. Once you know where the icons need to go, animating the views only requires a few lines of code. You'll want to do something like this: CGRect newFrame = iconView.frame; [UIView beginAnimations:@"SnapToGrid" context:nil]; newFrame.origin = newOriginSnappedToGrid; iconView.frame = newFrame; [UIView commitAnimations]; Read the sub-section titled, "Animating Views" under "Window and Views" in the iPhone Application Programming Guide. Then check out the methods in the UIView class reference under the heading, "Animating Views".
