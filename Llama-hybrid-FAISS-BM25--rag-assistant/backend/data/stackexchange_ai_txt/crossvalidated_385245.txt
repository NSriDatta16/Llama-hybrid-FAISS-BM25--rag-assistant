If I center my kernel does it no longer remain positive semidefinite?? If so why is it being used in algorithms like kernel pca?

If I center my kernel then can it still be used in operations where a positive semi-definite kernel is required such as SVM and ridge regression? I am centering my kernel as follows: $$K_c(\mathbf{t}_i, \mathbf{x}_j ) = K(\mathbf{t}_i, \mathbf{x}_j ) − κ(\mathbf{t}_i)\mathbf{1}^T_j − \mathbf{1}_iκ(\mathbf{x}_j)^T + k\mathbf{1}_i\mathbf{1}_j^T$$
