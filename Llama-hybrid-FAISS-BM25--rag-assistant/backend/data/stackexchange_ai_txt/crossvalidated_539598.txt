From whatever little I know about Bayesian method, the best use case is when you have limited pieces of evidence which by themselves are not enough to make a frequentist probability with reliability. But the little evidence you have can add to an informative prior probability to take you closer to the truth. In the particular example you provided, I don't see a great use case for Bayesian application, but consider how you can solve this problem without using Bayesian interpretation - question from arbital Suppose there's a bathtub full of coins: Half the coins are "fair" and have a 50% probability of coming up Heads each time they are thrown. A third of the coins are biased to produce Heads 25% of the time (Tails 75%). The remaining sixth of the coins are biased to produce Heads 75% of the time. You randomly draw a coin, flip it three times, and get the result HTH. What's the chance this is a fair coin? Would it be doable if you throw away the prior information and see how you can answer the question maybe rephrased as "what is the probability of heads for a single toss of this coin which gave a HTH"?
