Does it take progressively fewer EXTRA correct answers to move up a grading curve in standardised exams?

A previous year's grading curve for an exam I will be sitting is : Assuming the exam has 100 (or any number of) questions each equally weighted, will it take fewer extra correct answers to move up percentiles as you move away from the average? E.g. will I need fewer extra correct answers to move from the 60th percentile to the 70th percentile, than from 45th to 55th percentile? And if so, why? My reason for believing this is the case is found in another other curve that I have from a similarly marked exam: This chart doesn't show percentiles, but from looking at it it seems it requires less extra marks to go up (or down) percentiles as you move away from the average. Note: 1 asterisk represents 4 students. The numbers on the LHS indicate how many raw questions correct.* However, I can't think up a formal reason for this (my statistics knowledge is limited). Or is it the case that say 1 extra mark on the exam would move me up the percentile curve the same amount regardless of where on the curve I am originally sitting? FYI : This exam doesn't give us an A B or C depending on what % out of 100 we get. It simply ranks the students, so the 100th percentile (or 99.99th : this always confused me) will be the top student, even if they only got 50% of the answers right. If you are wondering why I wish to know this. My exam has multiple sections and we get a percentile grading for each section. The total score is then the average of each section. So depending on the answer to my question, it will determine if I study evenly for all the sections of the exam (and aim for say 55th, 55th, 55th), or skew my studying in favour of my strongest subjects to push that mark "quickly" (and aim for say 45th, 45th, 80th) up the percentile curve.
