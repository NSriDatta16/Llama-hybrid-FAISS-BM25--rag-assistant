An integer is normally 4 bytes. But if you store a small number like 99, the other three bytes store 8x 0-value bits. The spec is asking for you to use one integer storage (4-bytes) to store 4 different smaller numbers within its bytes. The easiest way is probably to use a toInt function on an array of 4 bytes, e.g. (there is no byte[] length checking nor is this function tested - it is illustrative only) public static final int toInt(byte[] b) { int l = 0; l |= b[0] & 0xFF; l 32-bits of an int 11110101 00000100 00001001 00000000 ^byte ^byte ^byte ^byte Each block of 8 bits in the int is enough to "encode"/"store" a smaller number. So an int can be used to mash together 4 smaller numbers.
