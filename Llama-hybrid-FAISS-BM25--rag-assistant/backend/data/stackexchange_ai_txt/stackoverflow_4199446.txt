How to make innodb as default engine

I am trying to make Innodb as my default engine and I changed this in the my.cnf file. I set default-storage-engine=InnoDB in my.cnf file and restarted mysql but still it's not taking it. Even after restarting the server, it's still showing default engine as MyISAM. show engines +------------+---------+- | Engine | Support | +------------+---------+- | InnoDB | YES | | MRG_MYISAM | YES | | BLACKHOLE | YES | | CSV | YES | | MEMORY | YES | | FEDERATED | NO | | ARCHIVE | YES | | MyISAM | DEFAULT | +------------+---------+- How can I change it to InnoDB ?
