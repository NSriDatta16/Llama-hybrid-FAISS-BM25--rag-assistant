Your selector is being called once when the gesture begins, and again when it ends. Check the gesture's state and act on the relevant one. -(void)handleLongPressGesture:(UIGestureRecognizer*)sender { if (sender.state != UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) return; // otherwise, handle the gesture as before } The class reference for UILongPressGestureRecognizer says: Long-press gestures are continuous. The gesture begins (UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) when the number of allowable fingers (numberOfTouchesRequired) have been pressed for the specified period (minimumPressDuration) and the touches do not move beyond the allowable range of movement (allowableMovement). The gesture recognizer transitions to the Change state whenever a finger moves, and it ends (UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) when any of the fingers are lifted.
