Inside the -touchesXXXX:withEvent: methods of your custom view, call their super methods to forward touch events. For example: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // forward touchesBegan to super class [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; ... // process touchesBegan for this view } Do the same things for touchesMoved, touchesEnded, and touchesCancelled.
