Probably recursion in stored routines is discouraged because MySQL needs to limit its threads' stack size. MySQL typically uses one thread per connection. 100s or 1000s of connections are common. On 32-bit platforms, there is significant address-space pressure when running 1,000 threads, so the stacks need to be set very small to avoid address-space exhaustion. Stack overflow is, of course, very bad - it can't be recovered from safely. So I think MySQL does this to prevent stack overflows, especially on 32-bit platforms. That said, anyone using a 32-bit OS for a production MySQL server nowadays is insane.
