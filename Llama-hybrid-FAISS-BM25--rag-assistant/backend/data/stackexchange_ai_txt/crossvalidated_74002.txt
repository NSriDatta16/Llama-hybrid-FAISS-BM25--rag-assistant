What model should one use for this short time series?

Below I have quarterly total sales on the left (dependent variable), and a sample of the sales on the right. The two variables share a correlation of 98.7%. What model should I use to predict X? For that model, should I include a constant? Seasonal adjustments? Remove outliers? The most important criteria is minimizing out of sample prediction error.
