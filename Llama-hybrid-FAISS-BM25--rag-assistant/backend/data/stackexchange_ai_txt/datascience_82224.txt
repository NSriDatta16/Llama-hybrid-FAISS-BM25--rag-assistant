Match between objective function and evaluation metric

Does the objective function for model fitting and the evaluation metric for model validation need to be identical throughout the hyperparameter search process? For example, can a XGBoost model be fitted with the Mean Squares Error (MSE) as the objective function (setting the 'objective' argument to reg:squarederror: regression with squared loss), while the cross validation process is evaluated based on a significantly different metric such as the gamma-deviance (residual deviance for gamma regression)? Or should the evaluation metric match the the objective function as much as possible, hence the root mean square error need to be selected as the evaluation metric?
