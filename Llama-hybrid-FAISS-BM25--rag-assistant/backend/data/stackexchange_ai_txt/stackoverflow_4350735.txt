Is there an accumarray() that takes matrix as `val`?

accumarray() 's val argument must be a vector. In my case I need columns of a matrix to be summed (or averaged). Is there a function or a method to achieve this? What I am doing now is in a for loop I am summing column values separately: for iCol = 1:nCols means(:,iCol) = accumarray(labels', X(:,iCol)); end
