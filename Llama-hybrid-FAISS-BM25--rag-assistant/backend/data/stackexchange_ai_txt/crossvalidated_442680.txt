I am guessing what Lecun means is the computation of $$ \int L(x^n\vert \theta)\pi(d\theta) $$ Where $L(x^n\vert \theta)$ is the likelihood of a sample $x^n$ ( or $\exp(U(x^n))$ if you think of energy) the marginal likelihood which can be used as a free energy or likelihood of itself. The normalization constant that is needed to make $$ L(x^n\vert \theta)\pi(d\theta) $$ A probability is its inverse (not always a trivial operation in particular you lose unbiasedness of vanilla Monte Carlo alg. Of the first integral). The later is needed for Bayesian statistics (at least formally as it's computation can be avoided through MCMC)
