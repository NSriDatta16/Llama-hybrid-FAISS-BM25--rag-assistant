Referring to your table, you are probably looking for something like: SELECT DISTINCT t1.col1 FROM table t1 INNER JOIN table t2 ON t1.col1 = t2.col1 AND t1.col2 = 'puppies' AND t2.col2 IN ('mice','fish','reptiles') You will probably want to denormalize your table and reorganize the data if this is a common query.
