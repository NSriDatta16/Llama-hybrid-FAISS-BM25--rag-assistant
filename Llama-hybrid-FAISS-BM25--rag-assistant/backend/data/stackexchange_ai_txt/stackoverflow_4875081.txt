exchange managed api 2010 Get emailaddres of owner of appointment

I am using the Exchange Managed API in combination with Exchange 2010 SP1. I can successfully register for streaming notifications on several mailboxes using Impersonation. When I get a notification of an appointment being created / modified, I can retrieve the appointment from Exchange. Now I would like to know who the owner of the appointment is. That is not always the organizer. Do you know a property on that appointment that indicates the emailaddress of the mailbox the item belongs to?
