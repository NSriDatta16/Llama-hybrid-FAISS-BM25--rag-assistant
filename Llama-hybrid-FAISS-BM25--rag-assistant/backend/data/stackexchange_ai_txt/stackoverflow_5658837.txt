The DragonFireSDK appears to want a "C" callable function and you're trying to pass a member function (though not using the right syntax). I think you'll need to do something like: Player *player; extern "C" int PlayerMoveLeft(int id, int event, int x, int y) { // do something - I'm not sure what might be possible // to get a pointer or a reference to the player object // hopefully one or more parameters passed to this callback // will have the information you need to do that // or if you only have one global player, you're set - // just use it Player* player = /* ??? */; player->MoveLeft( id, event, x, y); // or whatever needs to be passed return 0; } extern "C" int PlayerMoveRight(int id, int event, int x, int y) { Player* player = /* ??? */; player->MoveRight( id, event, x, y); // or whatever needs to be passed return 0; } void AppMain() { player = new Player(20,20,10); tleft = TouchAdd(0,0,180,480,PlayerMoveLeft,0); tright = TouchAdd(180,0,180,480,PlayerMoveRight,0); } Note that even though a static member function will often work (since there's no 'hidden' this pointer passed in, strictly speaking you should use non-member extern "C" functions.
