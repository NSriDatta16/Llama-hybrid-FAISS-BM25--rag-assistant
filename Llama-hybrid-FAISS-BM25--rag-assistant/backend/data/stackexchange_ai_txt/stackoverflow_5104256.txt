Is it possiple to run a stored procedure automatically without sql sever Agent?

Hello I am using MS SQL Management Studio express 2005 and I need to have a stored procedure to activate daily. However I do not have SQL agent. The Managemnet studio will not be opened daily so I can't use a startup script. Anyone know how to do this without the Agent? Thanks in advance.
