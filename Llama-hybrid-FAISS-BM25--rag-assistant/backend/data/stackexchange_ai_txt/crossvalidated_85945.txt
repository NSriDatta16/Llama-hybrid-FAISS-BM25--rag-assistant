Increase of odds ratio in a non-significant predictor

I ran a hierarchical logistic regression with 2 blocks/predictors: I found out that block 1 is not a significant predictor, but block 2 is. Still: the odds ratio for block 1 is MUCH higher (2.90) than for block 2 (1.31) and increases when the second block is added. How can it be so high but still not significant? Could that be caused by an underlying effect? Or could that simply be, because my sample seize is too small, so the values are not reliable?
