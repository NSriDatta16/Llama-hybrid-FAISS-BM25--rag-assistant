If you have a (relatively) small amount of data, you might try creating a table with the MEMORY storage engine. That does have a configurable size limit , but of course you're limited by the amount of available memory on your box. If your data size requires disk-based tables, then one straight-forward way to limit your table size would be to run a job that would periodically purge parts of the table. This is probably a better option than using a small partition -- many MySQL commands behave poorly when the disk is full. Also - you can run as many MySQL instances on your computer as you want -- if you're connecting via TCP/IP, you just have to assign each one a different port number.
