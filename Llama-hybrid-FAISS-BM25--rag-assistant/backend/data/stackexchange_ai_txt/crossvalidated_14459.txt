One very famous statistician has a short PowerPoint presentation at http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~casella/Talks/BayesRefresher.pdf explaining the difference between the Bayesian and frequentist approaches. If you need an application to understand what is going on with the Bayesian techniques, an excellent article entitled "Basketball, Beta, and Bayes" written by Matthew Richey and Paul Zorn in Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 78, No. 5 (Dec., 2005), pp. 354-367 can clear up any confusion.
