Well, This is a trade-off scenario where more tests ensure stability. By stability, it not only means that the code under test is more error free and foolproof, it gives an assurance that the program will not break under any case in future. However crazy you pass arguments to a method, the code block will return properly (ofcourse with appropriate error messages whereever required). Even more, you can write your unit test cases before even having to know the internal operation of your method under test. This is like a black box scenario where in you will first finish writing your test cases then start coding. The heavy advantage is that the development effort will become error free in fewer iterations by parallely running the test cases. And the size of the test code does not matter at all. All that matters is the comprehensiveness and the coverage of your unit tests. Whether it just tests for namesake or its a serious test case which handles all the possible cases.
