The key to this problem is how much you trust the preliminary estimate, i.e. how many record is it worth. Let it be $n$ and let your sample has $m$ records. Then, it is possible to calculate $$\hat{p}_{\rm post}=\frac{n\hat{p}_{\rm pri}+\sum_{i}^{m}x_i}{n+m}$$ where $x_i$ are the realizations from the available sample, $\hat{p}_{\rm pri}$ is the prior estimate and $\hat{p}_{\rm post}$ is the posterior estimate. The challenge is to determine $n$ which can be generally any positive number. If you have no other information, I would recommend to try different values and inspect the results. Alternatively, it is possible to treat $n$ as an hyper-parameter in the Bayesian sense. Thus, to assign to have a prior pdf $f(n)$ and to update it by the data using Bayesian learning.
