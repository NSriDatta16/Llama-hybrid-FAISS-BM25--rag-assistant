Leveraging ASP.NET machineKey For Encrypting My Own Data

I have some data I want to encrypt in an ASP.NET MVC application to prevent users from tampering with it. I can use the Cryptography classes to do the actual encryption/decryption, no problem there. The main problem is figuring out where to store the encryption key and managing changes to it. Since ASP.NET already maintains a machineKey for various things (ViewData encryption, etc), I was wondering if there were any ASP.NET functions which let me encrypt/decrypt my own data using the machineKey? This way I would not have to devise my own key management system.
