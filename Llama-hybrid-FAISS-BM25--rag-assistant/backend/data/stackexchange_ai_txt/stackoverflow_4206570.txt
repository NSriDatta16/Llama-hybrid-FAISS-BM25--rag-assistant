One mouse press for several QGraphicsItem's in QT

I have a matrix of QGraphicsItem's in a QGraphicsScene and when I click an element it changes it's color. This is implemented with mousePressEvent() . I want to be able to click and hold and then move the cursor over other QGraphicsItem's and change their color too, hence trigger their mousePressEvent() . The problem is that due to mouse grabbing the first element I click "keeps" all the events and hoverEnterEvent() is not triggered. I tried adding ungrabMouse() to mousePressEvent() but that didn't help. I guess one solution would be to make the QGraphicsitem's drag-able and use QT drag and drop functions for that. In fact I have this: void dragEnterEvent(QGraphicsSceneDragDropEvent *event) { changeColor(); } and when I drag some text from the application over the elements it works like I want it but not when I "drag" a QGrahphicsItem. So is the only solution to make a QGraphicsItem dragable to be able to trigger events while hovering over them with a clicked mouse button?
