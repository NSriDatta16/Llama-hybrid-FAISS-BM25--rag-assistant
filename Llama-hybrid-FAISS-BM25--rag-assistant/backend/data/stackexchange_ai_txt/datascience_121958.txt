Using Autoencoder in Python for Data Selection and Risk Level Calculation

I have a dataset that includes 100 data points from each sensor, representing various measurements. These measurements can be used to calculate the level of risk associated with each sensor. However, collecting all 100 data points for each sensor is time-consuming and unnecessary. I'm interested in exploring the use of an autoencoder in Python to select only the most useful data points and reduce the dataset size. Is it possible to achieve this with an autoencoder? If so, I would appreciate guidance on how to implement it. Specifically, I would like to understand: Can an autoencoder effectively identify the most informative data points for calculating the risk level? Are there any recommended Python libraries or packages that can assist in implementing this approach? Any advice, code examples, or references to relevant resources would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your assistance!
