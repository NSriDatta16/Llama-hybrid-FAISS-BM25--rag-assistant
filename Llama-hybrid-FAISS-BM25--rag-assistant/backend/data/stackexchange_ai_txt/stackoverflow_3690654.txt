Animation in Cocoa Touch?

I have been using UIViewAnimation for simple animations i the past, now I can see that Apple discourages the use of this Class in +4.0. I started looking into CATransitions and -animation. It gives some more fine grained control but seem really bloated for my limited use. When I try to get a grip of the possibilities on the platform I run into a rabbit hole with tons of stuff on Core Animation, Quartz and OPEN GLS, but no simple stuff on animation, to get me started. I need to "tween" the position, alpha, scale and rotation, sometimes all at once on a few UIViews and have a delegate hook for animationDidStart and didStop. Are there any good Tween engines out there? having dealt with flash and Java it is really one of things I miss. If I use CATransitions it seems I am limited to animating one property at a time, i.e. alpha, if I then have to move and rotate the UIView simultaneous I will have to set up individual animations for each property. If I should go with CATransition, is there a way to build an animation object that animates several properties at once? I would be really grateful if someone can get me started on a way where the complexity of the animation is proportional to the amount of code needed:) Thanks in advance.
