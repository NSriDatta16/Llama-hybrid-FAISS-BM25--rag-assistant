You made an array of size zero and then started throwing data in without resizing the array. I'm a bit surprised that you aren't getting an error. You're accessing data from memory outside the safety of defined data storage. It should be an error because the results are not defined. The data past the end of your array could be used for anything. And since your array is size zero, everything is past the end.
