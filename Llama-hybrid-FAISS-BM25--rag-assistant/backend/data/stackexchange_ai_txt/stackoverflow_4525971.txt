I haven't played around with signed bundles, but their is a way to get fragments to override classes in the host bundle. However you need to have planned for this ahead of time. In your Host Bundle define a Bundle-Classpath thus: Bundle-Classpath: jar-not-in-host.jar;. This jar file should not exist in the host. Then your fragment can contain a jar called jar-not-in-host.jar. When the fragment is attached the classes in the jar-not-in-host.jar will be loaded before the classes in the root of the host bundle. Not very nice I know, but it works.
