How to insert data in Infragistics UltraWebGrid via InsertDBRow

I'd like to add rows to an UltraWebGrid directly on the grid, which is connected to an ObjectDataSource. According to the documentation, I'm supposed to use the InsertDBRow method (there are also UpdateDBRow and DeleteDBRow) to handle database persistence. Does anyone has any example on what's the supposed usage of these methods? (I already tried the help and Infragistics forums, with no success) I'm planning on using this grid on a web page for fast data entry. If anyone has any tips toward this end, I'd most appreciate it. I'm using Infragistics 2008 v1, ASP.Net.
