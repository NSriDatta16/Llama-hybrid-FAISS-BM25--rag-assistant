Is there a way to use SSL only during authentication?

Is there a way (on IIS 7) to use SSL during basic authentication, and then somehow go to a non-SSL session? We have an intranet app which users have requested to have visible outside the organization, so we need to SSL encrypt the basic authentication process, but there's no real need to encrypt the rest of the session and don't want to deal with the slowdown.
