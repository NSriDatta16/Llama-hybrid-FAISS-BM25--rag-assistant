If I understand correctly, your point, you are saying that, because the IV estimator gives only the "direct" effect of $x$ on $y$, and not the "indirect", of $x$ on $y$ through the errors (which you claim is non-linear), it does not give the correct interpretation of $\partial y /\partial x$. Instead, you suggest to use other methods such as kernel regression, lasso, etc... and say simply a model with endogeneity is wrong (so it is not clear what is your solution... use kernel/lasso for the model or discard the model?). I see several issues with your argument. You notice correctly that in terms of prediction, OLS would be superior, so I assume your goal here is not to obtain the best prediction, but to estimate the effect of x on y precisely. If such is the case, the indirect effect through $\epsilon$ is generally of no interest for the model, since it is a sort of spurious effect, that precisely the IV estimator seeks to get rid of. If you are interested in the interpretation of the IV estimate, there is an interesting discussion in the potential outcomes framework by Angrist and colleagues, who show that the IV identifies a "complier average treatment effect" (in the case dummy instrument and dummy endogeneous), so IV does correspond to a well defined quantity of direct interest. Now regarding the other methods you suggest, note they no dot solve the problem of endogeneity. These are just different estimators for the same underlying model, and as such won't change the issue of endogeneity, and actually using these would be precisely sweeping under the rug the problem of endogeneity! So you would need to do kernel IV (a quite tough topic), or lasso IV, etc... Coming finally to your last point that a model with endogeneity is a wrong model, here again you are getting confused between a model and its estimator... There are many models we cannot estimate (due to endogeneity, under-identification, too many parameters, etc), but saying that a model is wrong because our estimators are wrong is quite a controversial stand, and correspond to searching the keys under the light although you know they are somewhere else.
