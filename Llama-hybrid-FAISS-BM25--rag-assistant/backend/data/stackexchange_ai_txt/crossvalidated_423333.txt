Here are fake data for Q1 for illustration at the benchmark company (200 responses) and at one of the other companies (352). The p vectors indicate proportions; R turns them into probabilities. The other company is simulated to have more Likert 2 s and 3 's and fewer Likert 5 's than the benchmark company. set.seed(2019) bnchmrk = sample(1:5, 200, rep=T, p=c(1,1,2,3,5)) co.nr.2 = sample(1:5, 352, rep=T, p=c(1,2,3,3,2)) DTA = rbind(tabulate(bnchmrk),tabulate(co.nr.2)); DTA Here is a chi-squared table of counts for various Likert categories: DTA [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 15 13 30 47 95 # benchmark [2,] 28 60 101 100 63 # other co Chi-squared test of homogeneity. The chisq.test procedure shows a highly significant difference in the pattern of Likert responses: chi.out = chisq.test(DTA); chi.out Pearson's Chi-squared test data: DTA X-squared = 61.034, df = 4, p-value = 1.759e-12 A matrix of observed counts is retrieved usind $ -notation to check against the original data. A matrix of expected counts shows that they are all greater than 5. chi.out $obs [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 15 13 30 47 95 [2,] 28 60 101 100 63 chi.out$ exp [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 15.57971 26.44928 47.46377 53.26087 57.24638 [2,] 27.42029 46.55072 83.53623 93.73913 100.75362 Because there are significant differences, Pearson residuals with large absolute values point the way to the largest discrepancies between observed and expected counts. Differences in Likert scores 2, 3, and 5 seem worth examining. chi.out$res [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] -0.1468694 -2.615122 -2.534877 -0.8578879 4.989817 [2,] 0.1107069 1.971223 1.910735 0.6466573 -3.761216 Two-sample tests. A Welch two sample t test and a nonparametric 2-sample Wilcoxon (rank sum) test both show highly significant differences between the two companies. The t test makes sense only if you are willing to view Likert scores as numerical data for which averages make sense. The accompanying one-sided CI shows that Likert scores at the benchmark company average about half a point higher. I did one-sided tests, which would be appropriate if you hypothesized before seeing the data that the benchmark company would have higher Likert scores. t.test(bnchmrk, co.nr.2, alt="gr") Welch Two Sample t-test data: bnchmrk and co.nr.2 t = 6.0534, df = 394.07, p-value = 1.653e-09 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.4784205 Inf sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 3.9700 3.3125 wilcox.test(bnchmrk, co.nr.2, alt="gr") Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: bnchmrk and co.nr.2 W = 46800, p-value = 1.605e-11 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is greater than 0 On request (with parameter conf.int=T ) the Wilcoxon test also provides a confidence interval (not shown here).
