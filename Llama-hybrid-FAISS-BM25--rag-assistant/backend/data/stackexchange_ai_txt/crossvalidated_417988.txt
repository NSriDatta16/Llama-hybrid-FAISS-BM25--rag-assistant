Potential problem if we only get one dataset using MICE in R to fill the missing value

I am just following up with my previous question here In my case, only 2.8% of the data are missing. I can consider Complete Case Analysis but I would like to study time series model and would like to fill the missing values. Both dependent and independent variables have missing data such that if the data is missing for a particular date then it is missing for all variables (monotone). The missing data is MCAR. The question is: if I get one dataset only using MICE, what could be the potential problem? I did this using maxit=5000. RainfallData I got the following convergence plot showing that the convergence was plausible. Please help.
