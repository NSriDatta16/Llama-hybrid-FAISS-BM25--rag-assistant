You propably want to use CoreData. This framework allows you to create an abstract model of your data, just like for databases, and to use it in your app without writing a single line of code. It also provides independence of your persistent data storage, so you can switch between different types of storage (SQLite, XML...) easily. I quite liked this tutorial but you might also want to check out the official documentation .
