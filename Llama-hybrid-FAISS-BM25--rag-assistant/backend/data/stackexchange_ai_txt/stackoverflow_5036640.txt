How to center a CPWindow in Cappuccino

I'm interested in having a CPWindow (specifically a CPPanel) be centered and auto-sized much like you might do the same for a CPView as follows: [view setAutoresizingMask:CPViewMinXMargin | CPViewMaxXMargin | CPViewMinYMargin | CPViewMaxYMargin]; [view setCenter:[contentView center]]; However CPWindows seem to not have these same methods. And while we're at it, how do you prevent a CPPanel from being dragged around? Is such a thing even possible? Thanks.
