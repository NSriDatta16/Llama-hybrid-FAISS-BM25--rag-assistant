Conditional compilation depending on current active project

I am developing a new module for a large Application in Delphi 2010. I have organized my sources in a project group of two projects, one to build the full application and one two launch my test suite (which shares some sourcecode with the main application). During the initalization of a unit, i need to act differently depending on which of the two i was compiling. unit MySharedUnit var flag : TFlagValues; implementation [...] initialization if IsTestProject then flag := TestValue else flag := ReleaseValue; end. Currently, I use a project defined environment variable (defined in only one of the projects' options ) to decide the active project. My question is: Is there another or more elegant way to do this, like a builtin #define'd value or so which would not require me to modify the project options by hand when the test application should be run in Release mode?
