Maximum of a distribution not invariant in different coordinate systems?

Let's say we have a probability distribution in x,y space: $$ p(x, y)=\frac{1}{4 \pi} \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \exp \left(- \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right) $$ This can be converted into polar coordinates as: $$ p(r, \theta)=\frac{1}{4\pi} r^2 \exp (-r), r\geq0 $$ Now let's say we want to know the most probable distance from the centre, that is r = argmax p. This can be done in two ways. We differentiate $p(r,\theta)$ with respect to $r$ , and solve for $$ \frac{\partial p(r, \theta)}{\partial r} = 0 $$ this gives $r=2$ We rewrite $p(x,y)$ as $$ p(x, y)=\frac{1}{4 \pi} r \exp \left(-r\right) $$ Then solving $ \frac{\partial p(x, y)}{\partial r} = 0 $ instead gives $r=1$ . This yields two different answers -- even though they should refer to the same quantity (the most probable distance from the centre). Questions are -- which is correct? and why? and if both are correct then how do we face this contradiction? Related questions seem to be on bayesian inference so I included those tags -- though my question is on generic distributions.
