The most obvious thing that you can do is drop examples with NAs or drop columns with NAs. Of course whether it makes sense to do this will depend on the situation. There are some approaches that are covered by missing value imputation concept - imputing using column mean, median, zero etc. I'm not really familiar with R, but googling suggests that there are a lot of packages for this. Other method which seems to be less standard is to use PCA-like technique (something based on matrix decomposition). For example Generalized Low Rank Models (GLRM) is a family that can be used for this. This tutorial shows how to perform missing data imputation using H2O GLRMs in R.
