Bayesian Regression - Overview

Does anyone know a comprehensive, well-written and recent book / collection of articles about Bayesian regression and variable selection ? The topics I am particularly interested in are: constraints of categorical variables ordinal bayesian regression interaction effects (including hierarchical models incorporating lower and higher order effects) generalised Bayesian regression cross-validation techniques any other topics dealt with in recent research I am mainly interested in the mathematical background of these methods.
