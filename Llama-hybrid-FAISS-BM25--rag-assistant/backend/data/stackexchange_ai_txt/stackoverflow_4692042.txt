Javascript Regex and getElementByID

I'm trying to search for all elements in a web page with a certain regex pattern. I'm failing to understand how to utilize Javascript's regex object for this task. My plan was to collect all elements with a jQuery selector $('div[id*="Prefix_"]'); Then further match the element ID in the collection with this var pattern = /Prefix_/ + [0 - 9]+ + /_Suffix$/; //Then somehow match it. //If successful, modify the element in some way, then move onto next element. An example ID would be "Prefix_25412_Suffix". Only the 5 digit number changes. This looks terrible and probably doesn't work: 1) I'm not sure if I can store all of what jQuery's returned into a collection and then iterate through it. Is this possible?? If I could I could proceed with step two. But then... 2) What function would I be using for step 2? The regex examples all use String.match method. I don't believe something like element.id.match(); is valid? Is there an elegant way to run through the elements identified with a specific regex and work with them? Something in the vein of C# foreach (element e in ElementsCollectedFromIDRegexMatch) { //do stuff }
