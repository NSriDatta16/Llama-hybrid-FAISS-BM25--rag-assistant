To construct a feature vector from text start with data pre-processing: tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming. Then you would want to construct a dictionary mapping indices to words present in your corpus. From here, you could use pre-trained word-embeddings (e.g. word2vec or Glove ) to represent each word as a dense vector. This embedding layer will be the input to your neural network. Alternatively, you can work with dictionary indices as in the following example of sentiment prediction .
