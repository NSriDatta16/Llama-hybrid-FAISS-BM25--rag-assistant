Where is mathematica help notebook?

I apologize that this isn't a question on how to use Mathematica, but rather where the documentation lies inside the applications folder. During a drag and drop, I happened to drag the Mathematica symbol on the help window (on a Mac) onto the desktop, which just ended up dragging the help file onto the desktop. Now, I don't know where in the applications folder folder that file belongs (file name: Mathematica.nb ) so that I can place it back and my help won't start because the file isn't where it is looking. My best guess is somewhere in /Applications/Mathematica/Documentation/ , but theres tonnes of folders in there. Could someone check in their folder and let me know where this file belongs (again, I'm on a Mac)?
