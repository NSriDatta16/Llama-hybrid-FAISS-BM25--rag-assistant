Question Related categories in magento

I have a main category with four subcategories. Whenever I click on the main category, all four subcategory images are displayed. When I click on any image out of this four, then instead of its description I want a link to the subcategory. For example, suppose I have a main category Car with four subcategories: Honda , Hyundai , Suzuki and Chevrolet . When I click on the Car category, it should display images of all four subcategories. Now, when I click on Honda image, it should redirect to Honda's subcategory page, instead of the image description. Please, answer my query.
