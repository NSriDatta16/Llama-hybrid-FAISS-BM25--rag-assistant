Analyzing 3D data: What can be done?

I am new to this kind of analysis, and I want to know what values I can look at in 3D data. The data itself is a 3D volume $(x,y,z)$ with a floating point value in every coordinate. It is a hyperspectral image , meaning: the $z$-space is the same $xy$ plane at a different wavelength. Here is an example from the internet of a hyperspectral image . The goal is to find characteristics in the data that can be exploited to compress it. How could I approach this? [See also PCA of hyperspectral image data ]
