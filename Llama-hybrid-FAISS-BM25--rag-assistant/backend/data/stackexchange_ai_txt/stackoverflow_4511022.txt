Template can now be generated without visual studio dependencies?

There was a former question here: Can the Microsoft TextTransform utility be used standalone? Since VS2010 is it still true as I can read: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/garethj/archive/2010/04/15/what-s-new-in-t4-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx Preprocessed templates to allow embedding of template-based generation in arbitrary applications without a runtime T4 dependency. There is a new custom tool, new service APIs and new engine APIs to support this feature. I'm not asking about T4 tutorial, my question is more about deployment : is the answer to the old question still true or did it change ?
