I would recommend two books not mentioned, as well as several already mentioned. The first is E.T. Jaynes "Probability: The Language of Science." It is polemic and he is a very partisan author, but it is very good. The second is Leonard Jimmie Savage's "The Foundations of Statistics." You will probably be very surprised when you first start reading it as you will not expect it to go the route it goes. Both are writing foundational work in Bayesian probability and Bayesian statistics. The above works are non-Bayesian. Both books are completely contained and self-sufficient. Indeed, they build from the foundation upward. Both approach it axiomatically.
