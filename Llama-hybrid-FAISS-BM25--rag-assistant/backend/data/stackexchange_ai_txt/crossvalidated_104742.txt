Acronyms to use for Bayesian posterior predictive distribution estimators

I am considering writing an article that discusses the Bayesian MMSE and MAP of the posterior predictive distribution. I was wondering if there are acronyms that have been used so that instead of always saying: "The MMSE of the posterior predictive distribution..." I might just say: "The MMSPE..." or "The MMSEP" or something. Any thoughts?
