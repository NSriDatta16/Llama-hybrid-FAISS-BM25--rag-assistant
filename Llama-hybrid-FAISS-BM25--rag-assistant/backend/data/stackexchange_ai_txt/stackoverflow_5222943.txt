Where to keep Page Objects in a Maven project

I'm using the Page Objects approach with Selenium2 and wondering the best way to organize the page objects in the Maven project structure. I currently have a completely separate maven project module for functional testing, so I'm leaning towards putting the page objects in src/main/java of the test project and then the junit tests that use the page objects in src/test/java. I guess the alternative is to put it all in src/test/java. Any thoughts on the advantages/disadvantages to either approach?
