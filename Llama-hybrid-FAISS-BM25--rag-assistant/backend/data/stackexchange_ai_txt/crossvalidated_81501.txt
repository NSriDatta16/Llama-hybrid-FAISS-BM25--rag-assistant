Neal 2000 gives an overview of the MCMC implementations for DP models. Indeed the package docs reference algorithm 8 from that paper as the default in the method you mention. Looking at the docs I'd suggest having a poke at the thetasave save attribute of the returned object. I'd guess the thetas will involve tuples of (mean vector, inverse wishart matrix) as the components of the gaussian mixture model sampled at each iteration.
