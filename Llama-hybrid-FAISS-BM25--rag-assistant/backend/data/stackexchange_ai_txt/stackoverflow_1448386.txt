Custom storage system for GridFS (MongoDB)?

Can anyone point me to any projects/django apps that provide a plugable custom storage system so I can use GridFS with Django to store file uploads? I've found django-mongodb but it doesnt seem to support GridFS, nor does django-storages. I plan to run mysql for the normal database requrements and only use mongodb for file storage so to be clear I dont want to use mongodb as my main database.
