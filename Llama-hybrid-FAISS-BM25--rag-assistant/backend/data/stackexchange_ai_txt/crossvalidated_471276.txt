Understanding Deep Neural Network for Youtube Recommendation Paper

I am trying to understand the paper - deep neural network for youtube recommendation . They divided their approach into two phases - candidate generation and ranking . Candidate generation diagram below: I understand that the video embeddings are learned jointly with all other model parameters. That means embedded video watches and embedded search tokens are trained along with the candidate generation model . If you look at the softmax box, they are getting class probabilities and video vectors vj . This is really confusing. How can you extract two different outputs from softmax ? Or rather I should say how do you extract video vectors vj from this model? Please suggest.
