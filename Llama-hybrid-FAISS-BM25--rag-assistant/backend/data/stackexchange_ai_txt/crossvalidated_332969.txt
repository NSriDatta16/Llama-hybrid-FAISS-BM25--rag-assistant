Interpretation of a partly continuous variable

I have a variable that reflects the prices of a product. It has the typical amounts such as 9.99, 14.99 sometime more random like 18.95 etc. I believe, I can still consider it a continuous variable?! What would be my interpretation if my outcome variable is sale success (binary, using a logistic regression). What exactly is the incremental increase here? I want to be accurate, but Iâ€™m not confident I can use: an increase by 1 cent would result in an increase in sale success by a multiplicative factor of e.g. 2.5. Please help me with the interpretation here
