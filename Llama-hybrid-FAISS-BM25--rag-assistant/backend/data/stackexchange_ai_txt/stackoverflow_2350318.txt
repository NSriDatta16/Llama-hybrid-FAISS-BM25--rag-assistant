You can solve your problem by creating a webpart with the below functionality. Identify the logged user is in admin group. If he is not in that group ganarte a javascript alert that "you have no permission for add new item" and redirect to (location.href="") allitems.aspx page. And place this webpart in Newform.aspx page. (add &toolpaneview=2&sharedview=true in in Newform.aspx url for editing page) Hope this helps. Let me know if you need more help.
