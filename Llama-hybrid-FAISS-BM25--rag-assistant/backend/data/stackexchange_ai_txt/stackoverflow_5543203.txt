Simply cast it: select cast(hashbytes('md5','foo') as uniqueidentifier) But there are two questions lingering: why cast HASHBYTES to guid? Why not use the appropriate type for storage, namely BINARY(16) I hope you are aware that MD5 hashing passwords is basically useless, right? Because of rainbow tables . You need to use a secure hashing scheme, like an HMAC or the HA1 of Digest .
