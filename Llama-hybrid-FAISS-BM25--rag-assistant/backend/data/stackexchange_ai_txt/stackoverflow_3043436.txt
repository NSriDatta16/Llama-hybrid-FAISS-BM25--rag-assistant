DragDrop.DoDragDrop can do this as long as you pass it an appropriate DataObject . First copy the files somewhere. You can use System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() if you don't have anywhere better. Next create a string array containing the full paths to the files and do the following: string[] paths = ...; DragDrop.DoDragDrop(this, new DataObject(DataFormats.FileDrop, paths), DragDropEffects.Copy); It is actually possible to do this without pre-copying the files but that gets into some complicated IDataObject interactions, so unless your files are potentially very large and aren't already in the filesystem I would try this method first.
