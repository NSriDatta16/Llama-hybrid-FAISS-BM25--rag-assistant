A question about Dickey-Fuller Unit-Root Test

I am reading Dickey-Fuller Unit-Root Test in Time Series Analysis with Applications in R by Cryer and Chan and have trouble understanding some discussion on equation (6.4.1). So they took this example for illustration Y t = αY t-1 +X t for t =1,2, ... where {X t } is assumed to be an AR(k) process: X t = φ 1 X t-1 + ... + φ k X t-k + e t . Under null hypothesis α=1. If let a = α-1, then Y t - Y t-1 = (α-1)Y t-1 + X t = aY t-1 + φ 1 X t-1 + ... + φ k X t-k + e t = aY t-1 + φ 1 (Y t-1 -Y t-2 ) +... φ k (Y t-k -Y t-k-1 ) + e t (6.4.1) with a=0 if null hypothesis is true. I can understand till here. But then, they claimed the following: If { Y t } is stationary so that -1 Y t } still satisfies an equation similar to the equation above but with different coefficients; for example, a = (1-φ 1 - ... -φ k )(1-α) Y t } is then an AR(k+1) procss whose AR characteristic equation is given by Φ(x)(1-αx)=0, where Φ(x)=1- φ 1 x -...- φ k x k *. and I cannot undertand. Why we have a = (1-φ 1 - ... -φ k )(1-α) t } an AR(k+1) process with the listed characteristic equation?
