how to calculate the posterior distribution with known mean when variance has exponential distribution?

Here's the problem: $Y\sim\operatorname{Exp} (1)$, $X|Y\sim N(0,Y)$. The joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$: $f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi y}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2y} + y}$. I'm asked to derive the marginal density of $X$. I began with the MGF of $X$ and got $\mathbf{E}\left[e^{tx}\right] = \frac{1}{t^2/2 - 1}$, but I couldn't identify what distribution this is. Any idea? Thanks!
