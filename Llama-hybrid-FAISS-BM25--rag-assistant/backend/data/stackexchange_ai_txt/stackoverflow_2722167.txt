How do you install cocos2d-iphone on the Mac?

There are no good instructions for installing cocos2d for iPhone on the mac. I downloaded the current build from git, a folder called "cocos2d-iphone-0.99.1". i put this folder in /Developer/Libary. Q: is this right? I tried running the file called "install_template.sh". it said the templates were already installed. Instead, I manually dragged the templates folders where they belong, and they ~do~ appear in the XCode's "New Project" dialog. When I create a new cocos2d project, I see all these red links for project files, instead of the regular black links. When I try to open them in the finder, nothing happens. I can tell that something is not linked. Can someone please help walk me through this? Thanks!
