It's a good question. Personally, my answer would be that it never makes sense to throw data away (unless it is for computational reasons), as the more data you have, the better your model of the world can be. Therefore, I would suggest that modifying the cost function in appropriate way for your task should be sufficient. For example, if you are interested in one particular rare class, you can make misclassifications of this class only more expensive; if you are interested in a balanced measure, something like Balanced Error Rate (the average of the errors on each class) or the Matthews Correlation Coefficient is appropriate; if you are interested only in overall classification error, the traditional 0-1 loss . A modern approach to the problem is to use Active Learning. For example, Hospedales et al (2011) "Finding Rare Classes: Active Learning with Generative and Discriminative Models, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (TKDE 2011) . However I believe the these approaches are still relatively less mature.
