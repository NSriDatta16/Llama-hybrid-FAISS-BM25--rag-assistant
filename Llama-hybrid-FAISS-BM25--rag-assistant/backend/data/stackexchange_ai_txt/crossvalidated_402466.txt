Time series analysis (ARIMA) is often flawed when the original series contains deterministic structure see @AdamO's wise reflections Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? . The arima model building/identification process as part of a Transfer Function analysis is not a one and done but rather a sequence of steps to form a useful model following the paradigm presented here Is it possible to automate time series forecasting? . This is easily extended to include user-specified X series leading to a Transfer Function. In general your mission is to form a model following the thread ( particularly the Tsay article ) as discussed here Why to use ARMA model as a time series is either over-differenced or under-differenced? and broadly here https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A3382+intervention+detection Finally https://autobox.com/pdfs/vegas_ibf_09a.pdf slide 16- illustrates the flaw of not dealing with pulses as one can be lead down the path of unwarranted power transformations for the now famous AIRLINE SERIES ( 144 monthly values) . Using lagged explanatory variables to forecast future value of depended speaks to your issue with respect to how to use helping X's that are pre-specified and to identify latent structure reflecting/proxying OMITTED series. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: I took your 192 values and partitioned then to 156 and 36 and obtained a Weighted Mape of 21.2% . and The model included a log xform and an arima of (1,0,0) along with 7 seasonal pulses refelecting a monthly determiistic structure while incorporating your predictor variable contemporaneously and adjusting for 7 anomalies (pulses). The residuals from this model suggested randomness . The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here Finally a derailed loo at the 36 period forecasts vis-s-vis the actual is here
