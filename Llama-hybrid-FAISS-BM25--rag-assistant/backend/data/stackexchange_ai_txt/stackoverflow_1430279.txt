If you want to calculate an average by storing it in an array, will be definitely more expensive than calculating at run-time. Reason-1: If you calculate it at run-time, you will justing keep adding for example look at the following flow init-0: _tempSum_ = 0 step-1: Read current value to _currVal_ step-2: Add current value to _tempSum_ step-3: Check if we have required of values _num_ (eg. 1000), if not goto-1 step-4: Calculate _avg_ = _tempSum_ / _num_ and return step-5: goto init-0 If you store in a temp array of 1000 values, actually things you will all the steps from init-0 to step-5, except that you will end up using a 1000 value array. It might be slower, based on the array access timing ... so beware
