Heuristic argument for matching a confusion matrix with a cost matrix

Logistic regression was applied on a dataset. It produced fitted class probabilities. Class labels were assigned the first time using a threshold determined from cost matrix no. 1. (The threshold is selected to minimize the total cost.) A corresponding confusion matrix no. 1 was obtained. Class labels were assigned the second time using a threshold determined from cost matrix no. 2. A corresponding confusion matrix no. 2 was obtained. Exercise: Match the confusion matrices to the corresponding cost matrices. The two confusion matrices are $$ A = \begin{pmatrix} 88 & 200 \\ 2 & 58 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad B = \begin{pmatrix} 76 & 126 \\ 14 & 132 \end{pmatrix}. $$ The two cost matrices are $$ C = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 11 \\ 55 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad D = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 6 \\ 60 & 0 \end{pmatrix}. $$ Solution: Two heuristic solutions have been proposed. Heuristic solution 1: Both cost matrices penalize predicting class 2 and being wrong about that more heavily than predicting class 1 and being wrong about that. The difference is that in $D$ this is more pronounced than in $C$ . Thus we would expect to see fewer instances in the bottom left corner of the confusion matrix corresponding to $D$ than to $C$ . Therefore, $A$ ( $2$ instances) matches $D$ and $B$ ( $14$ instances) matches $C$ . Heuristic solution 2: Let us obtain the total cost of the two possible matches and see which one is lower. That will indicate the correct match. Match 1 $(A,C)$ and $(B,D)$ yields a total cost of $3906$ . Match 2 $(A,D)$ and $(B,C)$ yields a total cost of $3476$ . Therefore, Match 2 is the correct match. Question: Does the heuristic solution 2 make sense? If not, construct a counterexample to show its lack of validity. This is not self study. It came up while grading homework solutions.
