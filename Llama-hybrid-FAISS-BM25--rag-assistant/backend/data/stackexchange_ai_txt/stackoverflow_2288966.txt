If you just want to know which tables are accessed (or even if you want more details) then the easiest way would be to use Oracle's built-in AUDIT functionality. Find out more . Bear in mind that some database objects may only be used quarterly or even annually. So you really need a decent set of documentation or a suite of regression tests with 100% coverage. Of course if you had either of those you probably wouldn't be asking your question here :)
