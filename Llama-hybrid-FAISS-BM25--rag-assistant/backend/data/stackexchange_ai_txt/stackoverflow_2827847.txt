Personally, I'd use named-checkzone to canonicalise the format of the zone file before further processing: % named-checkzone -i none -s full -D com. com.zone | \ perl -ane 'print $F[0]."\n" if $F[3] eq "NS"' | \ uniq The command line is admittedly longer, but it avoids the need for a potentially fragile regular expression match. The named-checkconf output is guaranteed to have the resource record type ( NS ) in the fourth field, and the whole domain name in the first field. FWIW, named-checkzone also sorts the zone file output, which ensures that uniq works properly.
