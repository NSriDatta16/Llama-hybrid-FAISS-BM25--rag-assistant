This is my homework and the question is this: List the average balance of customers by city and short zip code (the first five digits of thezip code). Only include customers residing in Washington State (‘WA’). also the Customer table has 5 columns(Name,Family,CustZip,CustCity,CustAVGBal) I wrote the query like below. Is this correct? SELECT CustCity,LEFT(CustZip,5) AS NewCustZip,CustAVGBal FROM Customer WHERE CustCity = 'WA'
