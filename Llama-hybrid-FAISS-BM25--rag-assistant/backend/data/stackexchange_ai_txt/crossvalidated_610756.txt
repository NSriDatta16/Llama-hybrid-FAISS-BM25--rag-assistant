Can one variable load onto different components in (varimax-rotated) PCA?

I performed PCA on 33 items with 133 observations. Considering the criteria to take components with eigenvalues >1, 4 factors can be extracted. I then did varimax rotation of those. However, I noticed one variable load under different components. So in this case, how can I say which variables load under a particular component? Or what could have gone wrong in my analysis? New Image for PCA following the comments.
