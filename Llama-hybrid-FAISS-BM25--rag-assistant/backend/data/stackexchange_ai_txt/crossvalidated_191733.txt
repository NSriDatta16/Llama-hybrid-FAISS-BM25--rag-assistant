Differences between Stata teffects psmatch and nnmatch?

I am using Stata 13 to analyse some observational data and a treatment. I came across an abundance of possible ways to estimate treatment effects with Stata. Let me just show you two options below (excluding the popular psmatch2, pscore and attn etc.). use "http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/cattaneo2.dta", clear global treat mbsmoke global match mmarried mage medu fbaby global ylist bweight *Option 1: teffects psmatch teffects psmatch ($ylist) ($treat $match, logit), atet *Option 2: teffects nnmatch teffects nnmatch ($ylist $match) ($treat), atet I use the Cattaneo sample, which offers some material on the mother's habit to smoke (treatment), birth weight of a child (endogenous variable), and a few factors to match (here randomly selected marriage status of the mother, mother's age, and first baby). I always calculate the average treatment effect on the treated and match at least one nearest neighbour. I tried to specify the commands as similar as possible - but the outcomes differ a bit: -245.711 vs. -239.2433. I have a few questions: First and foremost, why do the results differ? When should one use psmatch and when nnmatch? And, why can I specify nnmatch to exactly match on some criteria (via ematch) and why is that not the case for psmatch?
