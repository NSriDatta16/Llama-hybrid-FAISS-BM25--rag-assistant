Download file on click - Ruby on Rails

My application is using Rails 2 backend, Heroku for hosting, Paperclip for file uploads, and Amazon S3 for file storage. Right now users can upload files with paperclip + s3 - this works flawlessly. After upload, an icon appears on their dashboard, linked to the file location (in s3 bucket). When the icon is clicked, the browser opens the file in a new window (for most file types - PDF, MP3, img, etc). Instead of opening, I want the file to be automatically downloaded when the user clicks the file's icon (like Gmail attachments). The solution should be able to work for any file type and cross-browser. Is there a helper to do this in rails, or is javascript needed? I'm really stuck on this one so anything to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
