Guys, this is what I came up with in the end; http://pastebin.me/c46afb39cddf7945967e2a6f17078d52 It's not ideal but I couldn't think of anything else. You can toggle select all of the checkboxes or you can click and drag a selection to select multiple checkboxes in one go. It uses Jquery UI "selectable" to do this.
