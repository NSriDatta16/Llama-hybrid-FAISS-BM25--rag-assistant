How do I check if one logistic regression is better than another?

Background How often will it rain in the desert? One set of predictions assigns grades to different spots in deserts around the world. A past study correlates the grades to chance of rain per day. The grades ranges from extremely low (.01% per year) to much higher (20% per year), with most of the grades in the extremely low range. Question My hypothesis is I can predict rain better - find spots that have a better chance of rain than expected. However, it rains very rarely - and I'm making my predictions across a wide variety of grades. Also, I don't want to overweight results in the areas that have a high chance of rain. How do I test for better logistic predictions? Current thinking My current plan is to: Set up a logistic regression with [DidItRain?] vs [ExpectedProbability], [ExpectedProbability * DoIThinkThisOneIsRainier] If [ExpectedProbability * DoIThinkThisOneIsRainier] is statistically significant, assume that I can predict better than the original prediction Are there hidden flaws in this plan?
