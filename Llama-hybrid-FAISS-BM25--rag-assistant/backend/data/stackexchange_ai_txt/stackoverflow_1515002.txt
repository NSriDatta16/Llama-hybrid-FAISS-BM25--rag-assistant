How to use an OCX from a web-browser context in VB6 instead?

I'm using an EDIMAX IP Cam (IC-1520DP) which has a browser based administration. When you first login, it requires installation of an OCX (IPCamPluginMJPEG.ocx). This OCX then operates within the browser effectively as part of the web page. Now I want to use this OCX to display the camera images on a form in VB6. I can add a reference to the OCX but it is unclear how to initialize or use it . In the browser web page I can see that its asking for some parameters that are being passed to it by the PARAM HTML tag. Obviously I can't use the PARAM tag in VB6, so is there any other way I can pass the parameters? (Or do you have better ways to display the live camera feed on a form in VB6? The camera also has this CGI command that returns One multipart JPEG video stream but I totally don't have any idea how to use it.)
