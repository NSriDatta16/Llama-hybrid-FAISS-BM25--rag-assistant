David Schmitt's idea is the most elegant. I could see a case for using $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] to determine which server you're on and set the path accordingly. One such case could be if you do not have privileges to modify the server's virtual host configuration files. For instance: Note: Depending on your server configuration you may want to replace $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] with $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] .
