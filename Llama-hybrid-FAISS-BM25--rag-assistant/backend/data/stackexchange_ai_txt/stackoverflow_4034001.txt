easiest and best way: use phps session-management - every client is given an id, stored in a cookie (if enabled) or given as a get-variable on every link and form. (alternatively you could set a cookie on your own) identifying every client by ip is a bad idea and won't work. clients that use the same router will have the same ip's - clients connected through a proxy-pool could have another ip with every page load. EDIT: if you need a solution that can't be manipulated by the client in an easy way, try to do a combination of those, using all that are supported by the clients browser and compare them on each page-load: "normal" HTTP Cookies Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies) Storing cookies in RGB values of auto-generated, force-cached PNGs using HTML5 Canvas tag to read pixels (cookies) back out Storing cookies in and reading out Web History Storing cookies in HTTP ETags Internet Explorer userData storage HTML5 Session Storage HTML5 Local Storage HTML5 Global Storage HTML5 Database Storage via SQLite
