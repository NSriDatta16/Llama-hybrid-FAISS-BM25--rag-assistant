I like to organize them like this: First: Constructor ( __init__ ) Second: Any other __ methods Third: Regular methods that roughly can be categorized under "get" Fourth: Regular methods that roughly can be categorized under "set" Fifth: Everything else (with any methods that produce anything other than a return value--ie. actually output something or save to a database--being at the very end of this fifth category) If you follow that pattern consistently, your eye gets used to it and it becomes easy to navigate. Of course, preferences like this vary from person to person.
