Combining data from 2 tables in to 1 query

Hi all Im having some problems combining data from 2 tables in to 1 query. Now I have one table-nr1 with raw data of restaurants and in the other table-nr2 I have a number of restaurants that have been graded. So, now I want to select all restaurants and at the same time select grades of that restaurant from table-nr2 and get the average value of those grades. How can I do this in a single SQL query?
