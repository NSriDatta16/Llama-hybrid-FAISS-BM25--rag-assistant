Extremely High T-Test P-Value but Extremely Low F-Test P-Value

So I'm running a logistic regression on a binomial variable in R and came out with the following model. > summary(Approach_stems_peri_log_model) Call: glm(formula = IndRev_PeriprostheticFractureSte ~ cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i], family = binomial, data = cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train, maxit = 100) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.9714 -0.9714 -0.9088 1.3984 1.9728 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -14.57 394.77 -0.037 0.971 cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i]Antero-lateral 12.77 394.78 0.032 0.974 cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i]Hardinge 13.90 394.77 0.035 0.972 cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i]Hardinge/Anterolateral 13.87 394.78 0.035 0.972 cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i]Lateral (inc Hardinge) 13.62 394.77 0.035 0.972 cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i]Other 12.86 394.78 0.033 0.974 cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i]Posterior 14.06 394.77 0.036 0.972 cpt_prim_stems_peri_log_train[, i]Trochanteric Osteotomy 29.13 738.56 0.039 0.969 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1767.8 on 1364 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1742.1 on 1357 degrees of freedom (32 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 1758.1 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 13 and ran what is analogous to an F-test with the following command > 1-pchisq(1767.8-1742.1, 1364-1357) [1] 0.0005697522 I'm extremely confused on why this is happening. Is this due to the observations deleted due to missingness and that should decrease the difference in the degrees of freedom? I don't think that would matter at all. I can provide a number of graphs or anything requested but this is extremely strange to me. I understand that the t-test can not be significant and the F-test can be significant but the p-values in the model is way too high for me to think that the F-test would state it is extremely predictive of the model.
