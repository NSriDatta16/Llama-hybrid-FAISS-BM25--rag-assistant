As in your example, +40000 possible products or outputs are kind of very large for all types of algorithms. You probably need to be more innovative than using only one approach for that. e.g. you need to define a distance function for such outputs according to your problem. As it is clear, regular distance functions such as Euclidean, doesn't seem to make sense in the context of large vectors and your specific problem. But as a suggestion you may want to read about Structured support vector machine and Random forest . Also you may find other probabilistic approaches interesting too, e.g. HMM . All in all, we may not search for an absolute answer specially in real-world problems and datasets as in your defined problem. Understanding the data and the related features will help you in order to find the best solution.
