Django: How do I redirect to page where form originated

In my Django app I have multiple pages displaying a link that loads a new page displaying a form. When the form is submitted, what is the cleanest way to redirect to the originating page from which this form was accessed? originating page -> form page -> originating page Using a next variable seems unellegant since I have to set it as a GET variable on the originating page link, and then set it as a hidden POST variable in my form? Any other ideas would be appreciated.
