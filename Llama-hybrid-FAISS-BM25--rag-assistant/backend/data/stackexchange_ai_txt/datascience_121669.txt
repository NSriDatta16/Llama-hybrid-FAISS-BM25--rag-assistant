BIO Format (Skills,Qualification,Experience)

I have Dataset (CSV format). My mail goal is to do named entity recognition and use algorithms that are today's SOTA, for example according to the website nlpprogress.com. One of the SOTA is this repository: https://github.com/ZihanWangKi/CrossWeigh/tree/master Now, from what I've seen for named entity recognition I need to create a BIO file format. Which I don't have right now. What I have in my hand is a csv with a division of fields into their respective headers. The question is how do I create such a dataset with the appropriate tags: B-Skill, I-SKILL, B-EDU, I-EDU, B-EXP, I-EXP
