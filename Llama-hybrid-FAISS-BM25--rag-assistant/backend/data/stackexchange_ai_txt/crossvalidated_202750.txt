Time Series Prediction for process plant

Firstly, we have no knowledge about advanced data analysis or data mining. We are working with process plant which gather data that comes into the process plant. We use sensors data for the input to the process plant such as flow rates and concentration of nutrients (minutely time series data). We plan to develop prediction (hourly) to our time series. We are discussing if using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can help us to simplify the variables in prediction. However, I am not sure how PCA can give information for prediction. What do you think? Is there any better way to approach this objective?
