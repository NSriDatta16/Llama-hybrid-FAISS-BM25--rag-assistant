What is the recommended goodness of fit test for binary logistic regression with large sample size?

I have a binary logistic regression with one unique independent variable X and several control variables. My data has over 240k observations. When I ran both HL and Pearson chi square goodness of fit test on stata, the p values were both 0.000, suggesting a poor fit of the model. But the classification test suggests accuracy is 81.4% and ROC is 75.14% (CI : 0.749 0.7538). Is there a problem with my model as goodness of fit tests were rejected? How can I fix this issue? I have read that HL test is not valid for large sample. Is it the same case for pearson goodness of fit test as well?
