Don't issue queries yourself when you can leverage associations better. If a user has_many posts, and a post has_many comments, you can simply do. user.posts and post.comments Also, it looks like a user has_many comments, so you can directly do user.comments To get the post id from a comment, make a comment belongs_to a post, then you can do: comment.post.id # or comment.post.name directly
