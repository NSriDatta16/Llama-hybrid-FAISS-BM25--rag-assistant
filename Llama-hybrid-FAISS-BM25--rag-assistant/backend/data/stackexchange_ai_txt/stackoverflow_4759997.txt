In your MKAnnotationView set the leftCalloutAccessoryView property leftCalloutAccessoryView The view to display on the left side of the standard callout bubble. @property (retain, nonatomic) UIView *leftCalloutAccessoryView Discussion The default value of this property is nil. The left callout view is typically used to display information about the annotation or to link to custom information provided by your application. The height of your view should be 32 pixels or less. If the view you specify is also a descendant of the UIControl class, you can use the map viewâ€™s delegate to receive notifications when your control is tapped. If it does not descend from UIControl, your view is responsible for handling any touch events within its bounds. Availability Available in iOS 3.0 and later.
