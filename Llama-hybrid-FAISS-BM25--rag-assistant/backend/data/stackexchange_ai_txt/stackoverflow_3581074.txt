you may or may not be aware that Opera Dragonfly is a sort of web application, loading from Opera's server on first usage and whenever it's upgraded. If you re-open it and the server version is not updated, it should load quickly from cache. I'm not sure that's always the case, YMMV, and I can completely understand that its unpredictable load time can be annoying. However, this way your are always using the latest version of Dragonfly without having to update any extension. Which brings me to the second point: disabling CSS properties. This is now supported in a pretty obvious way in the latest version. I suggest you just try opening Dragonfly again :-D Regarding comparisons, I'm inherently too biased to comment on this question... But anyway: My general feeling is that Firebug was a giant leap in web debugger UI design (if you're old enough to have used Venkman you know what I mean), however under the hood it doesn't feel stable to use. My use case is mostly the JS debugger (DOM inspector has always been more reliable) and I've seen the debugger misbehave in many weird little ways over the years. I'll quickly add that Dragonfly is not much better yet, it has known problems that can throw you completely off the track when stepping. The current version of Firebug may well be more stable than all past versions, but I'm still a bit reluctant to use it for complex JS debugging tasks, and prefer Dragonfly or Chrome's inspector. YMMV again. ..the main reason I prefer Dragonfly probably is that this user JS lets me use Dragonfly to step through ANY random script, no matter if it's sent over the wire as a whitespace-free text blob: http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/2008/05/13/script-formatter-user-js But then, my use case is debugging ANY random page while most people's use case is to debug their own nicely formatted scripts :)
