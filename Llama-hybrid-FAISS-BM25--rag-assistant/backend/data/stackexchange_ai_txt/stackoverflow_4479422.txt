If you ever programmed COM objects by hand (ATL is even worse), or written C programs with the Win32 API, you'll understand easily that .NET is a good thing. It is a modernization of arcane difficult techniques with a certain lack of organization. I can't agree with you: with the notable exception of C# and Java, languages are not tied to any "framework". Frameworks are just a huge collection of libraries, along with a philosophy, like every huge library. To me, this is just a word for marketing purposes. You can call .NET the "standard windows library" for instance. Is the POSIX API a framework ? Is the collection of Python libraries a framework ? Is the C++ standard library, or Boost, a framework ? Is Qt a framework ? Is BLAS/LAPACK a framework ? Is Intel Threading Building blocks a framework ? The world doesn't revolve around .NET or Java.
