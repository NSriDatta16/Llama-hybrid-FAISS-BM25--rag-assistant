MLS is fragmented and local, there is no one uber-MLS to rule them all nationwide. Contact your local market MLS provider and ask them for rates on a subscription to their database, if they offer one. A local Realtor would have the contacts to get you in the door. If you're looking to provide national listings, the aforementioned fragmentation makes this a tall order.
