how to return a draggable item to its initial position using jquery

I have a set of images placed as position:relative (showing one next to the other). I use this code to drag and drop them (stolen from the jQuery API documentation, modified to my needs). $(function() { $( ".draggable" ).draggable({ start: function(event, ui) { // Show start dragged position of image. var Startpos = $(this).offset(); $("div#start").text("START: \nLeft: "+ Startpos.left + "\nTop: " + Startpos.top); pos_left = Startpos.left; //pos_left is global pos_top = Startpos.top; //pos_top is also global }, stop: function(event, ui) { // Show dropped position. var Stoppos = $(this).offset(); $("div#stop").text("STOP: \nLeft: "+ Stoppos.left + "\nTop: " + Stoppos.top); $(this).css('position', "fixed"); //tried absolute and relative, too $(this).css('left', pos_left); $(this).css('top', pos_top); } }); $( ".droppable" ).droppable({ drop: function( event, ui ) { id = $(this).attr('id'); alert(id); } }); }); What I am trying to do is to return the draggable element to its initial position, after user drops it. However because my elements are relatively positioned the initial left,top coords are the same for all of them (or this is what I understand from the documentation -- I might be wrong here). So although images return, they actually stack each one on top of the other. What am I doing wrong? What am I supposed to do?
