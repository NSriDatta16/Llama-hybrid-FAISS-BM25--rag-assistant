It's not that there's equal weight given to outliers that's the issue (if the data are generated according to the correct model, the observations won't really be outliers). The issue corresponding to what you're talking about is that information of different precision is given equal weight, when more weight should be placed on the information with greater precision (i.e. that lies on average closer to the true line). But even so, that's an issue of efficient use of information. It's possible that the waste of information (and the noisier estimates that result) may not especially bother you. There's another problem, however - one of larger concern. This problem to do with standard errors of the coefficients, and hence with inference such as hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. If you don't properly account for the fact that the variance isn't constant, the standard errors of the coefficients are biased.
