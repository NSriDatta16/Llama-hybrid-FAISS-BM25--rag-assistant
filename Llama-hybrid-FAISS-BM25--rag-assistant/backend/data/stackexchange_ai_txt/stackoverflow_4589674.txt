Since there's no "specification" for contents of HREF (at least in HTML 4 ), the browsers can do whatever they damn well please. UPDATE However, aside from HTML, there's an RFC3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax . It has section 4.4. Same-Document Reference which says: When a URI reference refers to a URI that is, aside from its fragment component (if any), identical to the base URI (Section 5.1), that reference is called a "same-document" reference. The most frequent examples of same-document references are relative references that are empty ... I do not necessarily read the above as "an empty URI MUST cause the client to reload the same socument's URI", but it does sound like a "best practice" type of wording; so if I was implementing my own browser I'd almost certainly follow such a behavior. On a related note, here's a good recent 3/2010) roundup of how browsers treat empty src attribute of tag: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/03/16/empty-string-urls-in-html-a-followup/ and http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/07/13/empty-string-urls-browser-update/ . Please note that it is a big deal , since having and empty img src would cause the page to endlessly re-load itself in the worst case scenario.
