There are a large number of good books about machine learning, including several in the O'Reilly series that make use of Python. Working through one, or several of these might might be a good starting point. I'd also suggest getting some knowledge of statistics - through a course or two, or self study, doesn't really matter. The reason is that there are some machine learning books that focus on the algorithms and the mechanics, but ignore the fundamental question of how likely it is that what your algorithm tells you is just due to chance. And, this is essential to know. Good luck & have fun, it is a great field.
