Different page provided for Google Crawl

I have built a Twitter client that's only one page: index.html. When being used, it draws in content from JSON feeds to populate various columns. The issue is hardly any traffic is coming in from Google except for searches on the site's domain name. This is because Google only crawls index.html when it's blank and before the user enters any Twitter username to be looked up. How can I have the Google spider, when attempting to crawl index.html crawl instead of just index.html (or in addition) also say index.html#CNN (ie site.com/#CNN) or index.html#whitehouse whereby all content from these pages will also be crawled and thus be accessible to users searching on the terms therein.
