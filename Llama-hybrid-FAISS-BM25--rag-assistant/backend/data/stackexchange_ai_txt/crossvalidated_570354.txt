Overlapping data in time series model?

I have some time series data that I am trying to model - basically historical elasticity reads with daily sales data. I really am just interested in finding the 'mean' value - not necessarily predict future elasticity - at least not as of now. Unfortunately, I only have 2 year of so data and daily reads are too noisy. What are the issues with using overlapping data, for example, rolling 30day average where I calculate a value every day? Obviously this would understate variance, but I don't think variance really matters for what I'm doing. And how unrealistic would it be to use this lower variance to build a confidence interval for prediction? I guess technically, any 30 day elasticity should have such a low variance I would think... Would this also cause issues when reading ACF and PACF plots to determine the model to use? I looked at this but none of the links work: Time series regression with overlapping data
