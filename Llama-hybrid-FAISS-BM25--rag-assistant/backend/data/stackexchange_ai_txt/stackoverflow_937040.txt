XML question in SQL Server

In one of my sql scripts, I need to execute a stored procedure with the following xml string I get the Attribute and the Item information from different tables. I am writing a generic function in which you pass an ID and returns this XML string that is used by the SQL script to execute the stored procedure Sometimes, I need to override the attribute values of some elements like SendCustomer . My initial thought was to deserialize this to a temp table, update the temp table with the override value and then serialize it back to XML. So, essentially, the entire process boils down to: Query tables, serialize to XML in the function Deserialze XML, store in temp table Override values if necessary Serialze from table to XML again Is there a more elegant way in sql server 2005 to do this entire process?
