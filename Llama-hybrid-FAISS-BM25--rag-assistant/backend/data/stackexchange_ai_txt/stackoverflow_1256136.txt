I would say that depends on how many different tests you need to run. If you need to check for a large number of different things in your unit test, you might be better off generating HTML output as part of your test initialization. It would still be file-based, but you would have an extensible pattern: Initialize HTML file with fragments for Test A Execute Test A Delete HTML file That way when you add test ZZZZZ down the road, you would have a consistent way of providing test data. If you are just running a limited number of tests, and it will stay that way, a few pre-written static HTML files should be fine. Certainly do some integration tests as Rich suggests.
