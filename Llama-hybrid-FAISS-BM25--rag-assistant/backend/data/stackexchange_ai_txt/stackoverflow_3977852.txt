Requests do not come from within the app or from another domain . They come from a computer, by means of a browser, a crawler, a script or any program really. This means that your question is not specific to google app engine but to web programming in general. A fragile approach would be to rely on the HTTP_REFERRER, but I do not recommend that. You should make sure that your users log in, and only display critical information to users you know who are.
