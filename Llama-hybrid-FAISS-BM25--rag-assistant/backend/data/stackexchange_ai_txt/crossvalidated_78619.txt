Direction of the z-scores in randomForest

I wonder if someone could help me with the interpretation of the "z-scores" (%IncMSE) in the random forest approach. I am using a randomForest library in R. Specifically, I am not sure whether the sign of the score (-/+) can be possibly interpreted as a direction of the effect of a predictor on the outcome variable?
