Applied Predictive Modeling , by Max Kuhn (who wrote the caret package) and Kjell Johnson, is very practical with tons of code and real world datasets. Practical Data Science with R by Nina Zumel and John Mount is an excellent new book that broadly covers data science, including ML, at an introductory-to-intermediate level. An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani is a lucid introductory book written by many of the same authors as the more advanced Elements of Statistical Learning . Hastie and Tibshirani should be familiar names as they have also made major contributions to machine learning and R (packages including glmnet, gam, hierNet, etc). Both ISL and ESL are available as PDFs online but I personally think they're also worth getting in hardcopy. For improving understanding of R as a programming language, I like The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design by Norman Matloff. I also strongly recommend Hadley Wickham's in-progress book Advanced R . For people who are beginning to learn statistics, I often recommend Introductory Statistics with R by Peter Dalgaard. For more advanced statistics, I have benefited from Cosma Shalizi's online draft textbook Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View . (I have yet to read and can't comment one way or another on Data Mining with R by Luis Torgo or Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz.)
