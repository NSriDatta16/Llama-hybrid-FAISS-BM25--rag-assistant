You have a couple of options wrt building unix style libraries on windows: Google for a pre-built binary distribution made for windows of the library in question. If the libraries authors have bothered to support it, you can try installing Cygwin to get a posix like build environment on windows Some libraries - like OpenSSL - have a set of build instructions for windows that include installing ActiveState Perl, and then running the appropriate configure script manually. Where the authors of the library have made no special effort, you are pretty stuck: Create a static library project in the dev environment, add the libraries files to it, create (or move) the headers that the ./configure step usually creates or moves and build it yourself. It is a tragic state of affairs that doing this "simple" task is so hard. Developers seem to take one of two lessons away from this: Microsoft is the devil. Microsoft hates developers. Hates open source software. And is #@#$. Compiling libraries and software from source via a standardized ./configure & make install process is the one true way. Microsoft is the one true way. The microsoft eco system of pre-built .lib files and headers is perfection and people who build everything from source using arcane perl scripts and install into a standardized filesystem are mentally defective. Your pick :P
