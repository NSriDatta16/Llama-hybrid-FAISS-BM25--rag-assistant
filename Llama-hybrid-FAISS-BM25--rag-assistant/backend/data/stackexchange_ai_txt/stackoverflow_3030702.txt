There is a post here: http://java.itags.org/java-programming/164200/ You may find the tutorials on the NTRU website helpful -- http://www.ntru.com/cryptolab is the place to start. Note that we encourage people to develop and play with the algorithms themselves, but you may not distribute your implementation without a license from NTRU. ================================ William Whyte, CTO, NTRU Cryptosystems Perhaps this is why you cannot locate the source code, as you need a license.
