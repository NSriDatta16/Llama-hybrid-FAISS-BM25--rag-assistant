4 node per minute is incredibly slow. Migrate shouldn't normally take that long. You could speed things up a bit by using Drush, but probably not enough to get a reasonable import time (hours, not days). That wouldn't really address your core problem: your import itself is taking too long. The overhead of the Migrate GUI isn't that big. Importing directly into MySQL would certainly be faster, but there's a reason Migrate exists. Node database storage in Drupal is complicated, so it's generally best to let Drupal work it out rather than trying to figure out what goes where. Are you using Migrate's hooks to do additional processing on each node? I'd suggest adding some logging to see what exactly is taking so long. Test it on 10 nodes at a time until you figure out the lag before doing the whole 60k.
