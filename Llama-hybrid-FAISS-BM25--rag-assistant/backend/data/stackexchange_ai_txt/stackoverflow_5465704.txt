Found this post looking for wkhtmltopdf support for vector graphics, and, on initial inspection it seems that there is a better way of embedding svg: the img tag with css width/height to constrain/set the size. Works beautifully... I also tried including my svg more than once - the file size grows, and grows, and grows with each instance added. At a guess it is a logo that you need adding to your pages. What you might want to consider is running the file through Pdftk and watermarking your pages: http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/
