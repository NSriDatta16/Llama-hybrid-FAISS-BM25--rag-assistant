Don't navigate character-by-character. In Vim (see ViEmu for Visual Studio): bw -- prev/next word () -- prev/next sentence (full stop-delimited text) {} -- prev/next paragraph (blank-line delimited sections of text) /? -- move the cursor to the prev/next occurence the text found (w/ set incsearch ) Moreover, each of the movements takes a number as prefix that lets you specify how many times to repeat the command, e.g.: 20j -- jump 20 lines down 3} -- three paragraphs down 4w -- move 4 words forward 40G -- move to (absolute) line number 40 There are most likely equivalent ways to navigate through text in your editor. If not, you should consider switching to a better one.
