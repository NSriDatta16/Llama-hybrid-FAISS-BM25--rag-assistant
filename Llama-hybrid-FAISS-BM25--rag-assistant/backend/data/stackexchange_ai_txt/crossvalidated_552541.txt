Is there a feature selection library in Python for multivariate time series classification dataset?

I have a multivariate time series (3D) dataset of the shape, (samples, sequences, features) . For instance, (patients, time_sequences_in_hour, features) , whereby each sample is a distinct group of time sequences. For each sample, there is a binary or multiclass target. I read through questions such as Feature selection for time series data , but the question covers time series forecasting which libraries like TsFresh can handle. Besides, the feature selection libraries in Python that I have surveyed so far are on tabular (2D) data, i.e: ReliefF . Is there a feature selection library in Python that works well for multivariate time series classification dataset as I mentioned above?
