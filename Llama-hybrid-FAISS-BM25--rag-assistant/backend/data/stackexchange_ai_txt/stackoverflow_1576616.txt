One possible approach is to do the following: Create a database table with a single column and row of type CLOB. On server, insert the produced XML into that table. On client run the SQL*PLus script like this: SET WRAP OFF SET HEADING OFF SET ECHO OFF SPOOL file_name.xml SELECT your\_clob\_column FROM your\_table; SPOOL OFF That will dump your XML into file_name.xml After that, you will need to truncate you table by issuing: TRUNCATE TABLE your\_table DROP STORAGE; otherwise the table won't shrink even if you delete the line with CLOB.
