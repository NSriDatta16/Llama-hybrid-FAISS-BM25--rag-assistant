An increase in validation loss while training loss is decreasing is an indicator that your model overfits. Check out this article for an easy to read general explanation. In the context of autoencoders this means your neural net almost reproduces the input image. Try to reduce overfit by applying regularization, e.g. add dropout, add input noise, use less layers or use less nodes per layer (not all at once but one by one).
