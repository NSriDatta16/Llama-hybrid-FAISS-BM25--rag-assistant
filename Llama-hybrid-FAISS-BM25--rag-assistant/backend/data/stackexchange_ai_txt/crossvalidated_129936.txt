Support vector machine would be good for this. Logistic regression won't be great since it's a linear classifier, and your data do not look separable by a line without a lot of error. This kind of looks like the XOR problem, which support vector machine with a polynomial kernal does very well at. This should be easy to implement in R and I'm quite sure you will do much better than 80% accuracy. See more about SVM in R here: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/vignettes/svmdoc.pdf
