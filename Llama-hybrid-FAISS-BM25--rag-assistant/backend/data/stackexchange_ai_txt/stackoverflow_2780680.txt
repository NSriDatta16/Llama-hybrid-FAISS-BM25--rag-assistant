The problem with a lot of pre-built CMS these days is that they all started out small and overtime eventually grew into bloated piece of software that has more features that an average site will ever need. Make a list of common features you will need and begin coding. Start off with the basic CRUD system (Create/Read/Update/Delete) and start adding components as you need them. And there also lot of 3rd party extensions available don't end up re-inventing the wheel. jQuery - Javascript Smarty - Templating to separate source and design phpmailer - Sending mail Zend - Development framework And I am sure there are lots more. As a developer there's nothing more comforting than knowing you have full control over the code that you are running.
