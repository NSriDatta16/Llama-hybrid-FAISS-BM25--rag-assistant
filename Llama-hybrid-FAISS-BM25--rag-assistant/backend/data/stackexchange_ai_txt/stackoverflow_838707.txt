Converting a Java Project to a Dynamic Web Project

I'm using Eclipse Ganymede to create a web application, but the project's currently just a standard Java project. I want to convert it to a Dynamic Web Project and I need a hand in doing that. I've had suggestions given to me about editing the .project file, but when I restart Eclipse it refuses to open the project claiming the file is corrupt. There's also no facet management options in the project properties. Any suggestions?
