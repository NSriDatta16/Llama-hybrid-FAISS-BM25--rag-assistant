javascript validation inside of fb:serverfbml block

I am trying validate input from a multi-friend-selector that I have embedded like so: As expected, when rendered inside the iframe, the onsubmit function is prepended with my appid. I am assuming that I will need to embed my javascript somewhere within the iframe, so that my definition of the validate() function can be prepended with my appid as well. However, I have not had any luck doing so. I have tried embedding it the js a number of ways with no luck. Thanks!
