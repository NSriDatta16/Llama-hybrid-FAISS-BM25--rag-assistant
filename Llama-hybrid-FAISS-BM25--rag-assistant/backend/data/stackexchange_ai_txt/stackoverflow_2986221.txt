Yes, it's possible to set it up that way. Whether you would see a performance improvement is wildly dependent on the machine, the exact nature of what you're doing with the decompressed data, etc. If it's not too much trouble, and your dataset is substantial, I'd suggest doing it and measuring to see if it's faster. If nothing else, it's similar to the work you'd need to do to leverage some sort of map-reduce framework.
