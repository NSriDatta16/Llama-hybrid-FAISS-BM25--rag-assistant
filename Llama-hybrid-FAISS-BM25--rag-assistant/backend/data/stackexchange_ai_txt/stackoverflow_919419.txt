What is the rationale for document-centric systems?

I know of two famous document-centric systems: Sharepoint server and Lotus Notes. There must be others. I've heard of CouchDB, for example. What are the main implementation differences, and how do they affect: Usability Retrieval performance Search performance/quality Extensability/ integration Bonus if you can elaborate on why you would or wouldn't just store these documents in a relational database and decorate them with metadata stores in an appropriate schema. I find it hard to believe that these systems are very different from forums and blogs, which themaelves are based on relational databases with business code sitting on top. Extra bonus: Is there any reason why Lotus Notes is so hard to find documentation on? I'd be grateful for some pointers.
