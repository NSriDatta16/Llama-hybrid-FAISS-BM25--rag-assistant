How to change a variable equation so that one quantity impacts the outcome more than it currently is?

Forgive my lack of vocabulary, I've never formally studied statistics. I'm currently working on a project involving quantifying genres of music, and there are only two variables at play: The Total Points that genre has received, and the Average Points that genre has received. Currently, I'm just taking the mean of these two quantities, but this has lead to the Final Points depending almost entirely on the total, rather than the average. See the attached picture for what I mean. How can I change the Final Points formula to rely more on the average?
