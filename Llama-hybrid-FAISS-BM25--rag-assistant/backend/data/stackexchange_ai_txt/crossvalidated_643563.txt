The 10:1 rule of thumb is highly approximate and doesn't include the sample size needed to just estimate the intercept. For example in binary logistic regression you need n=96 just to estimate th e intercept (i.e., when there are no predictors needing to be modeled). If you have a single categorical predictor with 3 levels you'd need at least n=96 in each of the levels.
