How to perform binomial logistic regression on this dataset?

I have a dataset that looks like this: id quantity effect 1 1 0.00 3 2 1 0.00 1 3 1 1.50 1 4 1 0.00 1 5 1 0.00 1 6 1 0.00 2 7 1 0.00 1 8 1 0.00 1 9 2 4.00 2 10 2 0.00 1 To explain this dataset, we are evaluating the effect of a potential medicine on rats. Quantity column has 3 categories (0.00, 1.5, 4 g/kg) . Effect column has 3 categories : 1 = alive, 2 = sick, 3 =dead I would like to perform a binary model in order to indicate the developmental effects of this medicine by doing Alive rats VS ( Sick and Dead ). I created a new column called is.alive that had rows following this rule: mydata $is.alive=1 mydata$ is.alive[mydata$effect!="1"] = 0 quantity effect is.alive 0 3 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 Afterwards I fit a glm using is.alive as my response: mymodel=glm(data $is.alive~data$ quantity,data=mydata,family="binomial") summary(mymodel) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.71412 0.15346 17.69 But this is not what I'm looking for, I'm trying to examine the developmental effect of this medicine by fitting a model that takes dose as response for an alive VS a dead or sick . For some reason I don't have 2 parameters for the **Quantity* covariate although it is categorical.. I also am not sure whether I did the right thing... I can't understand the summary of this model. Why don't I have the parameter estimates for each Quantity categories? I'm new to R and logistic regression so any help would be greatly appreciated.
