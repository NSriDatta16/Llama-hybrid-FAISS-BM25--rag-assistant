Using LRT with alpha = .2 in lmm reduction guided by PCA

I'm wondering if it's valid to combine the methods for lmm reduction that Bates et al. (2015) and Matuschek et al. (2017) recommend: Bates et al. suggest an iterative reduction of degenerate maximal models. First they use PCA to obtain the appropriate dimensionality of the variance-covariance matrix of the random-effect structure. Given this reference point, they suggest to drop all non-significant variance components and correlation parameters from the model. A significant loss in goodness of fit is indicated by significant LR differences - in which case the parameter should stay in the model. Is it, in this PCA context, a good idea to choose an alpha level of 0.2 as model-selection criterion as suggested by Matuschek et al. to balance Type I error rate and power?
