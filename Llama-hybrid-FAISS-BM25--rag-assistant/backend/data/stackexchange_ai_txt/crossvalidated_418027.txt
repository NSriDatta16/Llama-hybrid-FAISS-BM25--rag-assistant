If the impetus behind your two models was two different subpopulations, then it sounds like the most natural course of action would be to apply the appropriate model to each sample, depending on what subpopulation the sample belongs to. No combination required. If you do want to combine, I don't see a clear reason to prefer one over the other of your approaches. Try both. Combine your scores (how exactly will depend on the semantics of your scores), then transform to probabilistic predictions, e.g., using a simple logistic regression, possibly spline-transforming your scores. Extract probabilistic predictions from your two separate scores. E.g., run a logistic regression using the two scores (possibly spline-transformed, again) as two separate predictors. Then see which approach performs better on a holdout set. Of course, the first approach presupposes that your two models and their scores are even comparable. If this is not given, then the second approach is probably the only reasonable one.
