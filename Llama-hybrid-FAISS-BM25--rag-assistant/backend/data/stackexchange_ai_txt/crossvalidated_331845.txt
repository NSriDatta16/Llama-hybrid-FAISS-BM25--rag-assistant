Structure your data as an msts (multiple seasonality time series), where you can specify msts(your_data, start=2010, seasonal.periods=c(144,1008,52560)) . Then, when fitting fourier terms for seasonality you must specify the three seasonal periods on fourier function: reg , this will look for fourier terms over each seasonal period. You can loop through a linear regression where the explanatory variables are the fourier terms to obtain the best fit and then put them into the ARIMA model as regressors. These will be equivalent, because ARIMA with regressors actually is a regression with ARIMA errors. auto.arima(your_data, xreg= as.matrix(reg), seasonal= F) DonÂ´t forget to specify seasonal=F to avoid maximum supported lag = 350 .
