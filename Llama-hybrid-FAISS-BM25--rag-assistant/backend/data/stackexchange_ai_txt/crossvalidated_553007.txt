Here, how can I "pool" or build one dataset on which I can perform the mean and then use that data set into the cox model? The way to proceed isn't to pool the datasets, it's to pool the model results. If you have 20 imputed data sets, you do 20 separate Cox models. Each Cox model uses the 10-day-average covariate values for the corresponding data set. Then you average the results of interest among the 20 Cox models, with error estimates that include both within-imputation and among-imputation variances. See Stef van Buuren's book for details.
