The PCA decomposition explains the 'total variance' for your data set. Therfore, it really depends on the question you are asking. If the majority of variance in your data is caused by the effect under investigation then discarding of lower variance PCs can be seen as denoising. But if your data set has variance caused by something irrelevant for the question you are asking this variance is also covered in PCA and might contribute stronger to the total variance then the effect you are interested in. Interpreting the loadings of the PCA often helps to find out how many PCs are important for your data set. Your S looks like the list of eigenvalues corresponding to the PCs, Scores in contrast can be seen as a meassure of how much each PC contributes to each individual object in your data set... So to answer the question as it is asked - scores do not correlated with the importance of the PC - the eigenvalues can correlate depending on the structure of your data if there are no confounders.
