Why the common trend assumption is not testable in the simple two-group two period DID?

From this paper, page 459 , the author documented that In the simple two-group two-period DID, the common trend assumption is not testable And Visual evidence may be less compelling when the data are noisy or the time series is short. In such cases, it may be difficult to distinguish between statistical noise and genuine deviations from the common trends I am wondering if you can clarify it for me because I think we can plot the lines with three points for each of control and treatment groups in two-group two period DID? For example, an event is on the 31/12/2015 and the period is one week, so there are two periods:24/12/2015 to 31/12/2015 and from 1/1/2016 to 7/1/2016, and we have three points to generate two lines: 24/12/2015, 31/12/2015, and 7/1/2016, so why the author say it is not testable. Apart from that, why "difficult to distinguish between statistical noise and genuine deviations from the common trends" as well.
