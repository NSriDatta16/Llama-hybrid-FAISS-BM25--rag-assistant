Calculate probability for LibLinear classification results

I am using LibLinear for a document classification task, in which I would like to calculate the probability of correctness for each prediction. In fact, in the LibLinear , it does provide probability output for logistic regression , but not for default support vector classification task. Furthermore, based on 10-fold cross validation, the logistic regression is nearly 10% worse than support vector classification . So can anyone tell me, if I continue to use the support vector classification for the solution, is there a method to calculate the probability separately from the program?
