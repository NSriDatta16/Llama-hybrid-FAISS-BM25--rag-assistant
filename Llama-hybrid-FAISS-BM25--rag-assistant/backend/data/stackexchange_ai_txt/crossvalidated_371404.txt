One way to proceed would be to code the surgeons as random effects in a mixed model rather than as fixed main effects. The simplest inclusion of a random effect for surgeons would allow their intercepts to differ. In your case with a logistic regression for admission, this means that each surgeon has a different probability of admitting patients, all else equal. The single random effect captures the variability in that characteristic among the surgeons without treating them as fixed main effects. Insofar as the effects of the treatments themselves on admission probability don't depend on the surgeons (except for the surgeons' overall tendencies to admit) then that could be OK. In principle you could have more complicated mixed models that allow for random slopes (the relationship of each treatment type to admission also depends on the surgeon), but I'm not sure that you have enough data to do that reliably. To avoid overfitting you typically need 10-20 events per predictor that you are evaluating. You're already at that limit with your 3 treatment types and a single random effect for surgeon admission probabilities, given that you have only 50 events. The lme4 package in R provides this functionality.
