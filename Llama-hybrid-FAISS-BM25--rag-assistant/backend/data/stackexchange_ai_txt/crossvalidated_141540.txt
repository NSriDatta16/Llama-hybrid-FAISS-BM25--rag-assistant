Ranking batters by average when number of observations (innings) vary

This is my first post here and I'm new to this area so please forgive me if I'm asking a naive question. I want to rank a number of batsmen (e.g., in cricket) by their skill. I'm planning to use batting averages as a measure of skill. But there are some batsmen who have only been to bat a few times and therefore their average is not a good estimate of performance (I.e., I don't have a very good estimate of their "true" average). Assuming that, for each batsman, I only have scores of each time he came to bat (e.g., 89 4, 92, 45, ... ). How could I best sort them? Thanks in advance.
