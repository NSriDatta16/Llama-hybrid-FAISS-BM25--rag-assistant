Implementing Google Crawlable AJAX URL's with Mod Rewrite

I'm looking to implement the Google crawlable AJAX states as described here: http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html Essentially this requires specifying your AJAX states with a #!state value at the end of the url. This should then be passed to the application server (PHP in my case) as part of the query string eg. http://www.example.com/#!open would become http://www.example.com/?_escaped_fragment_=open Unfortunately i'm having trouble figuring out how to implement this via mod_rewrite on Apache 2. Can anyone offer some help? Cheers James
