IO Other Operations Performance Counter Explanation

I have received perfmon counters from customer site. We noticed unusual values in \\COMPUTERNAME\Process(PROCESS_NAME)\**IO Other Operations/sec** . The best explanation for the counter I came up with is:- The average rate at which the process is issuing I/O operations that are neither read nor write operations (for example, a control function). This counter counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include file, network and device I/Os. This counter is equivalent to the perfmon counter Process\IO Other Operations/sec. On Technet , its description does not appear. Who knows what this counter (**IO Other Operations/sec**) actually counts? Which system call may cause this counter to be increased and how it can be monitored. We are working with C++.
