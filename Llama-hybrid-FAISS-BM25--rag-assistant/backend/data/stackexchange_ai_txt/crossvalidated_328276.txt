GLMM with nested and random effects

I have been trying to apply the correct model with GLMM to a data set that I believe has nested and random effects. Specimens were collected from 7 sites from 4 states that fell into 3 biome and 3 latitude groupings and a different number of families (replicates) were obtained (see image). Basically state X is either in Biome A with state W or in Latitude B1 with state Y. Grouping scheme Specimens were then subjected to 3 temperature treatments and most of my data is not normally distributed. I've been toying with these two models because I first want to know if Biome or Latitude grouping has a larger affect on my outcomes: a1 The biome AIC is lower but I feel confused when I look at a graph of averages by grouping over temperatures like this: Graph of mean +/- se I've gone over a couple of nested GLMM (HGLMS modeling in R, Cake example- https://books.google.com/books?id=cTsrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT86&lpg=PT86&dq=hglms+in+r+cake&source=bl&ots=8bAJ9CtUJl&sig=4RYWiaYySBGl-_ths11fyxEEwGo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2w8zjjqHZAhXE54MKHdohAnYQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&q=hglms%20in%20r%20cake&f=false ) and this Tufts guide ( http://ase.tufts.edu/gsc/gradresources/guidetomixedmodelsinr/mixed%20model%20guide.html )
