I would say to take the average of the RGB value itself over the whole picture. I would say that the pseudo below should give you the "average blue" of the picture. SUMr SUMg SUMb for pixel If this doesn't work out; then I would think that you would need to rank a "blue" pixel as being higher/lower weighted based on the G/B values. Then add up your weighted value(s) and compare those. weight for pixel
