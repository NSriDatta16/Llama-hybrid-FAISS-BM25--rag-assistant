If you have a table which returns the same set of columns you can assign the stored procedure to return that type in the data model diagram. (Either by dragging the stored prcoedure onto it, or by setting it in the properties of the stored procedure.) Alternatively you can create a view with this set of columns, and assign the stored procedure to return that. (On the return type property of the stored procedure.)
