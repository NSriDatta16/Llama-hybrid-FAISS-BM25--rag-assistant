In general, there isn't much to a 2-way contingency table, but you are trying to unpack this at such a level of detail that some confusions are arising. Typically, with a simple contingency table like this, people just want to know if the variables ( sex and citizen ) are independent. To assess that, you can run a chi-squared test: chisq.test(tab.sex.citizen) # Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction # # data: tab.sex.citizen # X-squared = 2.389, df = 1, p-value = 0.1222 You can perform a likelihood ratio version of this test (the chi-squared test above is a score test), by performing a nested model test of the Poisson GLM you ran against the full (saturated) model: phd.mod.indep Chi) # 1 1 2.5721 # 2 0 0.0000 1 2.5721 0.1088 deviance(phd.mod.indep) # [1] 2.572123 deviance(phd.mod.sat) # [1] 3.308465e-14 1-pchisq(deviance(phd.mod.indep)-deviance(phd.mod.sat), df=1) # [1] 0.1087617 You can also get the Wald test of the interaction term (which is the test of independence): summary(phd.mod.sat) # ... # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) 5.56068 0.06202 89.663 (To read about score vs Wald vs likelihood ratio tests, see my answer here: Why do my p-values differ between logistic regression output, chi-squared test, and the confidence interval for the OR? ) Note however, that the way you conducted your test of phd.mod.indep is incorrect (see here: Test GLM model using null and model deviances ). The test of that model against the null model is the test of whether all cells have the same probability in the population. It would be implemented as follows: 1-pchisq(191.5-2.57, df=3-1) # [1] 0 Setting aside the test of whether all cell probabilities are equal (which I doubt is of much interest to you), if you believed that there was an association between sex and citizen , you would not interpret the model phd.mod.indep . That would be a misspecified model.
