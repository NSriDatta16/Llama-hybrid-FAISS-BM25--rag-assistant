I'm wondering why you would want to do that. PDF is such a general and widely supported format that if you try to avoid it you're limited to: A more obscure or less well supported format (dvi, svg until it gets better support) Converting to text/HTML like Google does with less than perfect results Converting to an image format like TIFF which bumps up file sizes and removes all the niceties of PDF like real, selectable text and hyperlinks If you don't want your users to have to install Adobe Reader (understandable), there are many free lightweight PDF viewers available (Foxit Reader for example), I'm sure many of these have browser embedding capabilities.
