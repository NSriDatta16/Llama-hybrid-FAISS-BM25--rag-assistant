"Random Forest" variant of other classifiers

I am using SVM with linear kernel for one of my multiclass text classification problem and getting accuracy of 0.78. I also tried Random Forest but the best accuracy I could get was 0.72. This set me thinking what if I could simulate Random Forest but with a SVM classifier and not decision tree. I am not sure whether it will result in improved accuracy or not. I wanted to have something in favor before I implemented this and a quick google search didn't help either. Any thoughts on this?
