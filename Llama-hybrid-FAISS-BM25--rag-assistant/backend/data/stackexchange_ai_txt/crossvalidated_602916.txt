Plotting multinomial choice regression model in R

I generated myself some data to try some data with 4 levels (health status based on body-mass-index, please don't judge me if the values don't make sense): library(tidyverse) library(ZeligChoice) set.seed(100) health_excellent % pivot_longer(cols = health_excellent:health_poor, names_to = "health_condition", values_to = "bmi") %>% mutate(health_condition_nr = case_when(health_condition == "health_excellent" ~ 1, health_condition == "health_good" ~ 2, health_condition == "health_fair" ~ 3, health_condition == "health_poor" ~ 4)) %>% arrange(health_condition_nr) health_condition_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = health_condition_nr))+ geom_point() The plot looks like this: Now I run an ordered choice logistic regression health_condition_regression And get the following output: Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value bmi 0.6146 0.0893 6.883 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value 1|2 13.7532 2.0962 6.5610 2|3 16.7425 2.4167 6.9277 3|4 20.2020 2.9289 6.8975 So far, so good. I now want to plot this, but I don't know how and also can't find a good example of how such a plot would look. I tried coef_health % ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = health_condition_nr))+ geom_point()+ stat_function(fun = function(x) {exp(coef_health*x)/(1+exp(coef_health*x))}) But that does not give me the wanted result: I also tried adding in an intercept from the output above like this health_condition_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = health_condition_nr))+ geom_point()+ stat_function(fun = function(x) {exp(15.4+coef_health*x)/(1+exp(15.4+coef_health*x))}) but without success. Maybe I have a wrong understanding of the matter. Help (regarding the plotting and my perhaps wrong understanding) would be very much appreciated. Thank you
