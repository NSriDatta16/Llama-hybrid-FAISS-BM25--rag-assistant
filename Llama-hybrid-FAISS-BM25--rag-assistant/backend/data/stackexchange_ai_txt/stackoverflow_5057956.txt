Create a view using multiple models data

My (rails 3) application use collection and product as models. collection has_many products and product belongs_to collection. I managed to have interactions between products and models. I created a menu displaying the different collection. I want to display a view showing only the product belonging to a specific collection. 1) Is it more elegant to create a new view/controller, or do i create a new view in the product views 2)It seems that i must do something with the routes.rb, but how and what? 3)What link_to arguments must i use to pass the value of my collection? 4)I read a whole book (pragmatic ROR) and depspite that and doing a lot of online research i keep ending here asking for not so much complicated Rails question. What am i doing wrong?
