The most common way to create sequences for NLP is masking. Mask (aka, redact) some of the words in a sentence and predict which words should replace those masked words. Your examples are suboptimal. Both examples use fragments of sentences, the entire sentence should be used. Also both examples, only the last words are targets, any word(s) can be a target(s).
