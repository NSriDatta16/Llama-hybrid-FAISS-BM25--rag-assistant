If you application uses the Java EE stack and you are using Hibernate you can use the Compass Framework maintain a searchable index of your database. The Compass Framework uses Lucene under the hood. The only catch is that you cannot replicate your search index. So you need to use a clustered database to hold the index tables or use the newer grid based index storage mechanisms that have been added to the Compass Framework 2.x.
