Faced with this situation, I try two approaches. The Golden Master approach. Generate the report once, check it yourself, then save it as the "golden master". Write an automated test to compare its output with the golden master, and fail when they differ. Automate the tests for the data, but check the format manually. I automate checks for the module that generates the report data, but to check the report format, I generate a report with hardcoded values and check the report by hand. I strongly encourage you not to generate the full report just to check the correctness of the data on the report. When you want to check the report (not the data), then generate the report; when you want to check the data (not the format), then only generate the data.
