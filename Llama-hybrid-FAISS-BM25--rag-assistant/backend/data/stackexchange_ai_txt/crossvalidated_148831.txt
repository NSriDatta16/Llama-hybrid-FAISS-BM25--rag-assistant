Random forest regression prediction for high dimensional data

I am working on a project by using a high dimensional data set. Close to 50000 Obs. with 392 Variable. I used lasso to reduce it to this point from a total of 1200 variables. And the whole data set is grouped into several clusters. The data is of a product and its specifications and other relevant details as covariates and time to get sold is the response. I am trying to predict the time with the help of covariates and I am using randomForestSRC package. library(randomForestSRC) options(rf.cores = 8) rfdata But the accuracy is not good, am I doing something wrong here ?â€‹ Can I adjust the accuracy by doing some changes. Or is it because of the high number of variables ? Thanks for your time and response.
