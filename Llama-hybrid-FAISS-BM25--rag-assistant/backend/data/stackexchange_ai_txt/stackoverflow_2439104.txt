I totally agree with you, PowerShell should be taking over the world and your statement is where PowerShell is heading. GUIs over PowerShell makes a alot of sense. I did a screencast How to Host PowerShell in a WPF Application Microsoft Exchange's GUI is all layered over the PowerShell. What you can do in the GUI you can do at the command line. Exchange can even "record" the GUI steps and present them as a PowerShell script. Going this route takes you up the learning curve. Embedding the PowerShell engine, runspaces, collections of PSObjects, error handling and more. There is not much out there yet.
