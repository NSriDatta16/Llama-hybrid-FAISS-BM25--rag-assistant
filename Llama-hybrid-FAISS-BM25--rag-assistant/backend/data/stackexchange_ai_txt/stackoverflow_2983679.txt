Sharing authentication between forum and main CMS in Rails

I have a Rails forum product that resides under the subdomains of my customers (i.e. http://forum.customer.com ). Their main site has a CMS and an authentication system, and my forum product has a separate authentication system. Is there an elegant way to have "cross-signins" across these systems? I want someone already logged into the main CMS to seamlessly (as possible) transition into my product.
