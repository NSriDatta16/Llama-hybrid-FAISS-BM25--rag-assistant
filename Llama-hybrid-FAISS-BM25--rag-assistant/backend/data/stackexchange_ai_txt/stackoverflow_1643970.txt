What level of technical know-how will the users have? As product manager at Red Gate I can give you our perspective. Although we're not considering support for data in our v1 release of SQL Source Control (currently under development), it will inevitably follow. However, this would still require those who wish to edit static data to do so in SSMS, although they could of course use edit the values using SSMS's graphical designers. Or is this still less intuitive than you'd like? They would be changing the data on a dev or staging database and would be expected to verify that the changes are correct and function as expected. These would then be committed to source control via our tool. To deploy it would be a question of launching SQL Data Compare, although we plan to provide simple shortcuts from SSMS, rather than requiring users to negotiate their way around a completely separate tool. We haven't nailed down designs for this functionality so I'd encourage you to participate in our Early Access Program and state your case. More details of the Program can be found here: http://www.red-gate.com/Products/SQL_Source_Control/index.htm
