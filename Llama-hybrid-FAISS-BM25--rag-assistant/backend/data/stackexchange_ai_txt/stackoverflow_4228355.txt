You can use a Code Coverage tool to find unused code. Just run the application and execute all parts manually. The code coverage report will show which parts have not been touched. (Running the tool on the unit tests is not helpful because unused code still can have unit tests). A free (open source) Code Coverage Tool for Delphi is available here . After running it, check for red lines in the reports, these are the lines which have not been reached. Delphi Code Coverage is a simple Code Coverage tool for Delphi that creates code coverage reports based on detailed MAP files. For each unit there will be a unit.html with a summary of the coverage, followed by the source marked up. Green lines were covered. Red lines were not covered lines. The other lines didn't have code generated for it. There is also a CodeCoverage_summary.html file that summarizes the coverage and has links to the generated unit reports. Maybe the author can add a 'search for dead code' feature in a future version.
