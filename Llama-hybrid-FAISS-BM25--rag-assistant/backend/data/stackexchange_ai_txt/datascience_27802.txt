I would focus on data augmentation first. Since your images have a white background you have it a little bit easier. Turn the white background into a transparent background, scale down the image, rotate it and put it in backgrounds similar to your target data. Do this a bunch of times with different combination and have a label for each watch. Then I would suggest you use a regular convolutional neural network for the classification. Each label will have a score, pick the one with the highest confidence and that one should be the most similar . For example lets say you run the classifier with an image and get this result: Watch1: 0.51 Watch2: 0.30 Watch3: 0.25 The CNN is saying that it has a 51% confidence that Watch1 is the watch in the input image. But also what is true is that it is the one it thinks looks more similar, Watch2 would be the next one more similar and so on. If you don't get good results, do the usual. Experiment with the parameters and/or add more layers. Try to find out where it is failing. After you have that insight, you can use it to choose a more specialized type of convolutional network for your particular problem. Looking for that without prior knowledge of how it would perform is not the right approach. I would suggest you start with a basic convolutional model and then work from there.
