You can either roll your own mocks, as Anurag Uniyal has suggested, or you can use a mocking framework. In response to those saying you can just create an ordinary user as you would anyway in Django... I would suggest this defeats the point of the unit test. A unit test shouldn't touch the database, but by creating a user, you've changed the database, hence why we would want to mock one.
