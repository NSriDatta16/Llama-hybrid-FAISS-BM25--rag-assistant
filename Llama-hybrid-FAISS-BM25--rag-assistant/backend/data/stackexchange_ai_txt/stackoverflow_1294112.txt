I am using xml extensively for communicating to handheld devices and am using XQuery in most all my stored procs to retrieve only the data from the XML that I need. It works GREAT!! I am just worried about storage space because with only a hundred thousand records or so, the DB size is 1 to 2 GB. We are expecting going live with millions of records stored for logging and customer usage.. so it will be worrisome until I see what it's actually going to do in terms of space usage.
