A few IE6 quirks that I am unable to solve

I have been working on a site for a client and I am about to wrap it up.. but unfortunately IE6 is being a pain in the buttocks. My main problems are on this page: http://seaport.bythepixel.com/#storage The list items dont have bullets The spacing below the floated items are not being cleared correctly. I applied "clear:both" to my h2 tags and it is clearing.. but the spacing bellow the floated items doesnt seem right. If you compare any other browse with IE6 you will see the spacing issue I am speaking of. maybe this is just an IEtester problem, but the background image I have applied to "#full" stops and starts randomly. You can see this on the storage page and the floor plans page. I am referring to the gray to white gradient that separates the left navigation column with the right content column. Any help as always is greatly appreciated!
