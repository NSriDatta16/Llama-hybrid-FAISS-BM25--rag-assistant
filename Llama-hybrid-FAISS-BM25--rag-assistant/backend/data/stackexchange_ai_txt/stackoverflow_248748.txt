File Structure / Architecture for AJAX Site?

I'm building a site using ajax and am trying to decide where to put the files that supply the data for the ajax requests. For example, I am going to have a .js file that can be included in a page that will create country/state select boxes. I will have the .js file under /inc/js. However, I am not sure where I want to put the ajax file that supplies the state data based on the country selected. I could put it next to the file it supports, make a folder for ajax data request files, etc. What do you do to keep your ajax requests organized by file?
