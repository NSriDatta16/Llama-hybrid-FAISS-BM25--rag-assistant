GAM factor-smooth interactions and model selection

I'm working with a dataset which is a long-term animal abundance survey collected from 11 sites, which have different average temperature(also there are some missing years for some sites). Here, the abundance [referred to as TrapRate3 (a probability of capture ranging from 0~1) in the code] from all sites suggest a decreasing trend, which I hypothesis influenced by the increasing temperature (referred to as PT36 ). My aim is to model the temperature effect on abundance while accounting for Site as a random effect and make predictions to see abundance change if temperature continue increase in the future. For clarify, here are simple plots of my dataset, TrapRate3 vs. Year , PT36 (Temperature factor) vs. Year and TrapRate3 vs. PT36 ,respectively. Because I’m interested in the global temperature effect, so I fitted as TrapRate3 ~ Site + s(T) + s(T, by = Site, m = 1) + s(Year) : m1 summary(m1) Family: binomial Link function: logit Formula: TrapRate3 ~ Site + s(PT36, k = 5, m = 2, bs = "tp") + s(PT36, by = Site, k = 5, bs = "tp", m = 1) + s(Year, bs = "tp", k = 5) Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -4.37220 0.23710 -18.440 draw(m1) My questions are: 1, Does this model appropriate for my issue? I could understand this kind modeling could account for the random intercept and slope, but I’m not sure for the different range of predictor (in my case, sites have a different average temperature---PT36). I mean, if site that experience colder temperatures on average also have a lower abundance (eg. site DF), then the model will suggest a global temperature effect with a rise of abundance with the increasing temperature. However, this wrong message is given by the site character, rather than the actual temperature-abundance relationship. (Is that right?? Or I misunderstand). 2, I'm not sure the Year trends I add with a right way. Should I need include a Year effect by Site : s(Year,by=Site) or s(Year)+s(Year,by=Site) ,which one? For the model, could anyone give me any advices for improvement. 3,For the result, I could understand “s(PT36):Site” indicating how the functional response of that site differs from the global smoother, but does the significance means PT36 has a significant effect on TrapRate3 for this site or has a significant different effect from global smoother?? If the global smoother is significant, could I say 'for all sites, PT36 has a significant effect on TrapRate3'? 4, I’m a little confused about y ~ Site + s(x, by = Site) and y ~ s(x, by = Site) + s(Site, bs=“re”) . Are they both for the random intercept but with different way?? 5, Besides the temperature (PT36) in my case, I also have other alternate climate factors, for example different period temperature and rainfall. I want to make model selection to choose the most influencing factor. My question is could I perform this kind of model selection just depend AIC? Also, in my case, models with different climate factor give similar AIC, so I guess I’d better check the prediction performance, right?? Really appreciate for any explanation and advices.
