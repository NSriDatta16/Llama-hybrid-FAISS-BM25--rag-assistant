LOGIC - I just overstate the importance of logic in programming. You said you did Mechanical Engineering so you must know how much mathematics can make your life easier. Propositional Logic , First-Order Logic , Second-Order Logic : these are very powerful tools. Probably the most (and only) important things I've learned at university. Logic is like the heavy artillery of a programmer - lots of very complex problems (as well as the less complex ones) become much simpler once you have put them into an organized, logical form. It's like what Linear Algebra is for Mechanical Engineers.
