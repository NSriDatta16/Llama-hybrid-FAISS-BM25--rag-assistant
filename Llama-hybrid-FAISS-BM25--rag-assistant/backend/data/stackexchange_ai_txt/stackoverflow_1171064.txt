Django can use many different database backends one of which is MySQL, to help support this it provides an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) layer which abstracts away the SQL code and storage medium and allows you to write Models containing storage fields and logic as necessary without worrying about how they are stored in the persistence layer. Django also contains basic authentication (login/logout) functionality and has the concept of users and admin-users built into it. As an example using the built in user models and the ORM would allow you to get all questions asked by a user with something like the following code: Question.objects.all.filter(asker=request.user) Where Questions is the model you have defined to hold your questions (with a field called 'asker' which is a foreign key to the user) and the request.user is the user logged into the website. I suggest you read up on the Django ORM . As far as hosting it, you could use Ubuntu on a desktop computer, or if you need an external host then would recommend Webfaction or Djangohosting.ch as two of the most 'Django Friendly' Hosts.
