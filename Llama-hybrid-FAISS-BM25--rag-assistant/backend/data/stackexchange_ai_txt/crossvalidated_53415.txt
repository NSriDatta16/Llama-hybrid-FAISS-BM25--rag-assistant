I've arrived at this post while trying to find my own answer to a similar question (i'm a year late I know). A PCA I've done on nested data is producing some pairs of axes which are highly correlated when you account for the nesting. So makes me think a standard PCA is inappropriate for nested data.... or at least some of the things you assume it will do (like creating new uncorrelated variables) wont necessarily be the case. My own question about this is posted here: principal components analysis is creating correlated axes with nested data
