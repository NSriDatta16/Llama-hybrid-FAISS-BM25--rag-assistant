I did find the answer by myself the hard way. All this while, the way I was measuring the response time was wrong. One should spawn X number of threads, where X is the number of concurrent users one wants to simulate. In each thread, open the connection only once and have while loop to only execute the WCF Method that you want to test for a given duration. Measure the response time against each return, accumulate it and average it out against the number of calls that were executed within the given duration.
