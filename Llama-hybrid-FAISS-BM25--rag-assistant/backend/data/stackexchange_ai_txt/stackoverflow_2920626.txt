To answer my own question: The snapshot expires when: Any schema change or any change to the publication properties When the snapshot is older than the subscription expiration NB: When you create the publication, sql creates a sql agent job that runs every 14 days (the default subscription expiration period). If you subsequently change the expiration period (e.g. to 7 days), the schedule of this job is not updated, and needs to be manually done, otherwise you risk getting snapshot obsolete errors.
