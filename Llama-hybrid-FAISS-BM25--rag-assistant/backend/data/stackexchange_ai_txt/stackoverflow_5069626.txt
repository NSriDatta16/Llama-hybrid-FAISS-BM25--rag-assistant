Meaning of the word yield

Currently, I'm reading "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" by David A. Black, and I'm stuck at chapter 10.9 (Enumerators and the next dimension of enumerability). My question is about the yield method. What is the meaning of the word yield in the Ruby context? My native language is Russian, and Google Translate shows me a bunch of translation variants, that are confusing me. Some of them are: give , bring , surrender ( give up ), produce , agree , comply and many others. UPD: please, pay attention to the fact, that I'm trying to understand the meaning of the Enumerator::Yielder#yield method, but not the yield keyword itself. UPD_2: I've found an interesting article about Enumerators: " Lazy Enumerators in Ruby ".
