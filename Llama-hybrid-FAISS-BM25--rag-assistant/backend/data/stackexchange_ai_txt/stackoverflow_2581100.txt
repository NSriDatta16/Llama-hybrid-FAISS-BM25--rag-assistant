SQL Average Data Based on Distance

I'm pretty new to SQL. I have a database with records based on road/milepoints. My goal is to get an average value every 52.8 ft along the road. My related table has data every 15 ft, this table of course has a foreign key relating it to the primary table. If I wanted to pull out the average value every 52.8 ft, along a given milepost, how would I go about this? Example Data: RecID Begin_MP End_MP 100 0 0.56 RecID MP Value1 Value2 100 0 159 127.7 100 0.003 95.3 115.3 100 0.006 82.3 107 100 0.009 56.5 74.5 100 0.011 58.1 89.1 100 0.014 95.2 78.8 100 0.017 108.9 242.5 100 0.02 71.8 73.3 100 0.023 84.1 80.2 100 0.026 65.5 66.1 100 0.028 122 135.8 100 0.031 99.9 230.7 100 0.034 95.7 111.5 100 0.037 127.3 74.3 100 0.04 140.7 543.1 The first Data is an example of a Road. The second subset of data are the values I need to query out every 52.8 ft. Thank you
