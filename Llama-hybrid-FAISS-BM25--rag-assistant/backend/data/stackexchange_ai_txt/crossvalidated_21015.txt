Risk bounds for Gaussian regression

Does anyone know references for non-asymptotic risk bounds for Gaussian regression. Specifically, I am interested in Bayesian regression with a Gaussian prior on the estimator space, and a Gaussian likelihood. I would like to know any results that bound the difference between the risk of the Bayesian estimator and the risk of the "best" estimator, from among the space of estimators on which the prior is defined. I am new to the field, and the only results I have been able to find by googling are regret bounds for online Bayesian regression by Kakade and Ng. Is this a standard result, if so, can anyone recommend a textbook? Thanks much!
