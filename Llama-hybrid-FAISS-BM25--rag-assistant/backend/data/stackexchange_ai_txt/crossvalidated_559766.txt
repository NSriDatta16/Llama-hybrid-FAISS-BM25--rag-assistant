There is a straight test for equality of several proportions, see for example prop.test in R (or in fact chisq.test ). There is also some work about testing for monotonicity (if you want to test that proportions go up as a function of a Likert score), see Sec. 6 of Mervyn J. Silvapulle, Pranab K. Sen, "Constrained Statistical Inference: Inequality, Order, and Shape Restrictions", Wiley 2001, although I'm not sure whether software is available (a comment mentions this: https://restriktor.org/ ). One could in principle also fit a logistic regression model, but in my view it is more relevant here whether proportions can be monotonic (which is assumed rather than tested by a logistic regression) rather than estimating a regression coefficient. That said, as you have no information about which of the tested null hypotheses are really true (or at least true in the sense of "scientific approximation" - in fact no formal statistical null hypothesis is literally true) and which are not, I don't see how these data can tell you anything about "performance" or "efficiency". Surely this is not measured by your importance score in any sense. (I'm not denying that your data and the question they could address may be interesting in their own right anyway, but chances are if done seriously this would require the incorporation of more information such as sample sizes, number of tests performed per study etc.) I'd by the way advise against trying to do something sophisticated for the sake of it. Your table of probability vs. Likert score plus numbers of observations summarises the data properly. An equality or monotonicity test may tell you something worthwhile on top of that, but I don't really see the added value of Spearman, logistic regression, receiver operating curves etc. here.
