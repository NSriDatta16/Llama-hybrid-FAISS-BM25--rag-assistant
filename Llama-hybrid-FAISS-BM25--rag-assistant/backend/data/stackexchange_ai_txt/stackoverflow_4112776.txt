Drupal - Hide block with PHP code

I've installed the module - http://drupal.org/project/formblock (Enables the presentation of node creation forms in blocks) I've enabled it for a particular content type and then exposed that block, to show when an Organic Group node is being viewed. What I would like to do is hide that block if the current logged in user, is not the author of the Organic Group node being viewed. i.o.w I only want the organic group author to see that block. thanks in advance :)
