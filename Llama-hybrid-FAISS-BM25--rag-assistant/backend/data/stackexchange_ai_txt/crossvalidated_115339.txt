There are two ways of making an SVM implement a smooth model, the first is to make the regularisation parameter large, the other is to make the kernel function smooth (i.e. less sensitive to the values of its parameters). There isn't a-priori much of a reason to prefer one method of making the model simple over the other, so choosing a combination to minimise the cross-validation error is a reasonable thing to do. In practice any combination of values lying along the bottom of the valley in the contour plot will be pretty much as good as any other. If you don't have too many hyper-parameters to tune and are not minimising the cross-validation too aggressively (a coarse grid search is fine), then you won't have a real problem with over-fitting the model selection criterion , so anything along the bottom of the valley will do.
