Forgive me for answering my own question, but this sparked some conversation on twitter (er, perhaps the site formerly known as twitter) with one of the authors from the paper linked by Robert Long. You can read his answer in the linked thread, but I will distill it here for completeness. He writes: Your problem is that a deterministic node (e.g. BMI) is technically barren. It cannot have a causal effect independent of its parents (e.g. weight and height) because it contains no additional information... When interested in a deterministic variable, you hence have chose whether to focus on the causal effect of the parents (e.g. weight & height) or the weighted average effect implied by the child (e.g. BMI), acknowledging that the latter still technically acts through the parents. This makes sense to me. One should either estimate the effects of the constituent variables on the outcome or the implied weighted average of effects of the composite score, but not both . With regards to confounding, one needs to be careful not to introduce time varying confounding. The paper linked by Robert provides very interesting examples of this in figure 5.
