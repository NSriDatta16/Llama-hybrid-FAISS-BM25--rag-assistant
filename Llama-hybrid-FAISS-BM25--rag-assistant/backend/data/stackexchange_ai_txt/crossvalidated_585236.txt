Success Stories of "Statistics"?

When it comes to Machine Learning, the successful application seem to be very well known. For example, Neural Networks have been successfully used to create Self Driving Cars and Game Playing Algorithms (e.g. Go, Chess). When we think of classical statistical models such as regression model, it seems more difficult to think of equally well known and successful applications of such models. I understand that this might be in part because Machine Learning might get more news/media attention and the problems in which Machine Learning tends to be applied in are in some ways easier to quantify success - e.g. does this neural network beat the world champion?. I also understand that Machine Learning itself is heavily rooted in statistics, e.g. PAC learnability. But in terms of the classical statistical models such as regression, have their been any successful applications of these models on a similar scale to the successful applications of machine learning? Thanks!
