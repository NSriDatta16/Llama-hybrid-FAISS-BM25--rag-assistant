There are different scenarios for which certain algorithms may be more appropriate. Decision trees are often used when it is necessary for a human to be able to understand the decision (for example, in medical diagnoses). However, it's easy to overfit single decision trees, which can be mitigated by using ensembles of decision trees, or random forests. Another example is that convolutional neural networks are widely used in current research, especially image recognition, because the convolutional kernels can capture many aspects of images, especially invariance to translation. In many cases, the specific domain of your problem has a large effect on the best learning algorithm to use.
