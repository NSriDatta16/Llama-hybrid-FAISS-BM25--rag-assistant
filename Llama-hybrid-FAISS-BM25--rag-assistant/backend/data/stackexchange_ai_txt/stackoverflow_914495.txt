How to use JPL (bidirectional Java/Prolog interface) on windows?

I'm interested in embedding a Prolog interpreter in Java. One option is using JPL , but the download links on the JPL site are broken, and the installation page mentions a jpl.zip that I can't find. I downloaded SWI-Prolog which seems to include JPL (it lists it as a component when installing), but I'm still not sure how I'd use it along with Java. Any ideas on how to use JPL on Windows? Is there another library I could use to achieve the same thing? I've come across a few but they don't seem as stable as JPL.
