Show that linear predictor of a stationary Gaussian time series depends only on the first 2 moments of the series

I would like to convince myself that the best predictor of a stationary Gaussian time series depends on more than just the first 2 unconditional moments of the series, whereas the best linear predictor depends only on the first 2 moments. Let "best" be defined, as usual, in terms of minimal mean squared error. " ... the fact that the best linear predictor depends only on the mean and the ACF of the series means that it can be calculated without more detailed knowledge of the joint distribution " Brockwell & Davis page 40.
