enabling multi touch... need help with storing the 2nd touch

need to be able to store 2 touches, how I go about this i how no idea... this is how I'm doing a single touch - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { /////checks whether the screen has been touched and stores its location and converts the coordinates to be avaible for use//// UITouch* myTouch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint locationLeft = [myTouch locationInView: [myTouch view]]; locationLeft = [[CCDirector sharedDirector]convertToGL:locationLeft]; how would I be able to store the 2nd touch? Thanks in advance
