Timer\Counter in C for rate calculation?

Need a running (moving, rolling) average algorithm to calculate the 5-minute average bits that are passed in. All I have to work with is an accumulative value for the bits that are passed in. For example: I start with 0 bits, 5 minutes later, I have 10 bits, so my average is 10 bits. 5 minutes later, I have 15 bits, so now my average is 7.5 bits. Another 5 minutes later, I have 30 bits, so my average now is 10.8 bits. My question is, how can I implement a timer\counter in C++ so it would poll the bits value in exact 5 minutes intervals? Obviously I can't use delay 300 seconds. But can I make a timer in the background which would only fire an event (poll the bit value) every 5 minutes?
