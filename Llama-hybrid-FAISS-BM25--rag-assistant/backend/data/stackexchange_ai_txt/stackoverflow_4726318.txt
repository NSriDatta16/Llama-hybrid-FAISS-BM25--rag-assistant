How can I specify which TreeViewItem Style/Template for a TreeViewItem Generated from HierarchicalDataTemplate?

The Situation: I have two classes that are represented in a TreeView. DiskSpec and DiskSet. DiskSpec can exist by itself, or it can be a child of DiskSet. I am working on enabling DragDrop functionality so that the user can drag a DiskSpec from the DiskSpec node onto a DiskSet to add it to that DiskSet. Now all is working except for one thing. My DragDropHelper class needs to specify in an ItemsPresenter (or related class) that that control is a drag source or a drop target. My TreeView is set up like so: . The Problem: So I really need to have two TreeViewItem Styles. Once for DiskSets (which specifies that the ItemsPresenter that will present the DiskSpecs is a DropTarget) and one for everything else which specifies that it's ItemsPresenter is a DragSource. Unfortunately I have not seen any way to set the TreeViewItem Style or Template from the HierarchicalDataTemplate object, and there does not appear to be a way to specify that this ItemTemplate is only for a particular DataType. Any thoughts? Or am I missing something? Find below some samples from my XAML. Default TreeViewItem See the ItemsPresenter section for an example of the DragDropHelper properties settings.
