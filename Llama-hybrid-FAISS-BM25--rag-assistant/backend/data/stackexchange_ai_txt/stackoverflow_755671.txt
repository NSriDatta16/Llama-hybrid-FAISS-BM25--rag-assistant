How do you make a Winform track bar (slider) behave sensibly on a touch-screen monitor

What's the easiest way to modify a Winforms track bar so that when a user clicks on it the track bar jumps to the location of the mouse? By default the track bar moves to half way between it's current location and where the mouse was clicked. Update: I'm trying to do this so that I can use the track bar on a touch-screen. With a touch-screen dragging is really hard, hence the requirement for the track bar to jump straight to where the user taps.
