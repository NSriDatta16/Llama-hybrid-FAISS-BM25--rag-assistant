Moving more than one divider at a time in HDividedBox

I'm trying to have a minimap display with a draggable viewport below a chart. I essentially have this to control the viewport of the chart: With the following script: private function rangeWindowMouseHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { if(event.target === centerBox) { var coords:Object = rangeDragCoordinates; switch(event.type.toLowerCase()) { case 'mousedown': rangeDrag = true; break; case 'mouseup': rangeDrag = false; break; case 'mousemove': if(rangeDrag) { var xDiff:Number = -(coords.x - event.stageX) * 4.0; for(var i:Number = 0; i Problem is, only one divider actually moves at a time. I found that if I set a timeout of about 50ms before moving the next divider that both dividers move. However, this seems like a rather awkward way to approach this and is error prone. Anyone know if it's possible to move two dividers in a HDividedBox simultaneously or should I be taking another approach?
