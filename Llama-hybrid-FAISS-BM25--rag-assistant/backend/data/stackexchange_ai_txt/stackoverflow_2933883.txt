I think that you should start by now. Understating basics as design patterns, architectural commons and styles of programming for iPhone. I think this is better if you acquire some practice now with little APIs to learn that latter. APPLE has a very strong emphasis on making SDKs solid and very extensible since the beginning and not doing radical changes over the time (Open/Close Principle). I encourage you learn, not only iPhone SDK or CocoaTouch, but to acquire a deep understanding of Objective C.
