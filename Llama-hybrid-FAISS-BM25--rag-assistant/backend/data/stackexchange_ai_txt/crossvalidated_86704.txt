How are these probabilities being calculated

This is an excerpt from the BBC website: A recent study into speed dating habits concluded that if men and women go to an evening and have 22 separate dates, men are keen to see about five women again, while women would only choose to see two again, on average. That means that for every offer a woman makes, she has roughly a 50-50 chance that the man will want to see her again too. But for every offer a man makes, he only has a one in five chance that the desire to meet again is reciprocated. I have read the story a few times, but I don't see how the probabilities (of a successful date) for men and women are being calculated. Anyone care to shed some light on this?
