Maximize one data point

I am completely new to data science and looking to narrow down the search and reduce the learning curve required to solve problems like the one given below I have a data set with 7 columns , Column A(all positive decimal) is the data point I want to maximize. Column B and C are boolean values remaining columns are a combination of positive and negative decimal numbers. I want to find some relation and insights from all colums such that I can maximize the sum of column A.
