Multinomial logistic regression - centering and using dummy coding?

I have two IV's: cognitive ability test scores (a continuous variable), and task difficulty levels (3 levels: easy, medium, difficult) I want to predict a categorical outcome with 3 types of behavior (type 1, type 2, type 3) with the main effects and interactions of both IV's. I'm using multinomial logistic regression. My questions: Should I, like in multiple regression, center the continuous IV and dummy code the categorical IV?
