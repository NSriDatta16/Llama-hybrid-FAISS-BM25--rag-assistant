If you went for C++ the following information might help you: Objects are typed, functors are functions wrapped as objects, RTTI allows the identification of type at runtime. Functors carry a runtime overhead with them, and if this is a problem for you I would suggest hard-coding the knowledge using code-generation or leveraging a OO-heirarchy of functors.
