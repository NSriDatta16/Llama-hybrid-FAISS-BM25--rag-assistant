When should I normalize data?

I often see that numeric values in machine learning is scaled to 0-1 range. Why is it better? I have some temperature values in my training set. What if I will have some values to predict that will be outside training set values? I mean that eg in training set I will have range of temperatures like 5-20 and MinMaxScaler will fit to these values, and then I will have 25 to predict.
