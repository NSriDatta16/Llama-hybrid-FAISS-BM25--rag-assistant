Theoretical work on validity of restricting movement of Centroid of K-Mean

I recently received a manuscript for review in which author used ~1000 "fake" data points, so that the final centroid of K-mean stays within the required range. Neither me nor the author seems to have background in data science and the paper is more of application into our research area. I have tried to find published work related to such method of restricting k-mean centers, but failed to do so. However, on simple logic, it seems like valid way, so maybe author used wrong terminology. Hence, I would like to ask, is this a valid way to restrict k-mean center and are there any published work on it?
