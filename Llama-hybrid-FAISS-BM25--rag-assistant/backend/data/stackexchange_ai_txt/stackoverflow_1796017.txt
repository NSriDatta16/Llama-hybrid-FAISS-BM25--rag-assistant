Without cookies, you have two options. The first is passing a sessionId through Urls. This requires a lot of work on the server because every url you send back must have a sessionId appended to it (usually in the form of a query string parameter). For example: /path/to/page becomes /path/to/page?sessionid=ASDFG-ASDFG-ASDFG-ASDFG-ASDFG The other option you have would be to combine what information you have via http into a "unique" key and create your own session bucket. By combining the Http UserAgent, RemoteIp and RemoteXfip you can get close to uniquely identifying a user, but there is no guarantees that this key is 100% unique.
