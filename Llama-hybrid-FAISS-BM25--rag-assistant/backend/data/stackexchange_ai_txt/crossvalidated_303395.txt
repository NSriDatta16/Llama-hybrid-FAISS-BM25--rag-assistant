This answer doesn't address the underlying reason why the manual calculation in the Excel file does not calculate the correct slope. This answer shows an approach to get the correct slope value using mean corrected values ( thank you to Glen_b ) Using the example data in the initial post, the manual calculation and the SLOPE function did not give identical values. If the X and Y data is each mean corrected ( subtract mean value from each value ), then manual calculation and the SLOPE function give identical values. So, in the above data examples X and Y values become: Average X = 1504356725 Average Y = 150435.67089 Subtracting the average X from each X value yields: -45 -35 -25 -15 -5 5 15 25 35 45 Subtracting the average Y from each Y value yields: -0.00450 -0.00350 -0.00250 -0.00150 -0.00050 0.00050 0.00150 0.00250 0.00350 0.00450 Using the adjusted X and Y values yields 0.0001 for both the manual calculation and SLOPE function for calculating slope.
