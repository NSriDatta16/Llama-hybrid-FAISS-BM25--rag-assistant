jQuery SQlite - Client Side Storage

I am looking for JQuery or any other ways to store data on client-side (i.e. browser). I am preferring SQLite as it seems to have support as part of all the latest browsers supporting HTML5. The plan is to basically to incrementally sync data from server-side & provide some search functionality on client-side. Not sure how much sophisticated search I can do with javascript. Does anyone know of any such plugins or javascript solutions. Is it viable at all? UPDATE: I am looking for sqlite based solution in browser as it provides good support for full text search. Also what are the limitations on size? I know sqlite3 performs well even for data more than 1GB. Does browser have any such size limitations? Is this possible at all??
