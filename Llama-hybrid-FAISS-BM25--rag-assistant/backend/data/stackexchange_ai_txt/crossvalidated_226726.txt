This error message seems to indicate not that the number of variables exceeds the number of observations but rather that the exogenous variables have a different number of observations than the dependent variable. You should make sure that the variable lengths coincide, i.e. dim(xreg)[1]==length(y) . For example, if we have 38 observations, should we cut off the PCA matrix to 38 rows? You would use the same (sub-)sample for running the PCA and fitting the regression with ARIMA errors. Therefore, there should not be a discrepancy in variable lengths at this stage. Next, when you do $h$-step ahead forecasting, you need to make sure to supply $h$-long predicted vectors of the exogenous variables. Another approach could be to use the PCs to predict all the regressors and then use these predictions in the xreg parameter. Obtaining PCs from regressors first and reconstructing regressors back from PCs does not seem to add value in this exercise. But probably I do not get your idea.
