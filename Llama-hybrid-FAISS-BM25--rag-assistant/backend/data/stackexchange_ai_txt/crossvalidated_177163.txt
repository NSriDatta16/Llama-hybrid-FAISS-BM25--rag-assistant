What is the distribution for various polyhedral dice all rolled at once?

Take the 5 Platonic solids from a set of Dungeons&Dragons dice. These consist of a 4-sided, 6-sided (conventional), 8-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided dice. All start at the number 1 and count upwards by 1 to their total. Roll them all, and take their sum (minimum sum is 5, max is 50). Do so multiple times. What is the distribution? Obviously they will tend towards the low end [Edit: this is wrong.], since there are more lower numbers than higher. But will there be notable inflection points at each boundary of the individual die? [Edit: Apparently, what seemed obvious isn't. According to one of the commentators, the average is (5+50)/2=27.5. I wasn't expecting this for some reason. But, now, it's so trivial I should have known already. Perhaps there needs to be an "algebra" of probabilities or an axiom "If a algebraic transformation works for the natural numbers, it works for probability distributions."]
