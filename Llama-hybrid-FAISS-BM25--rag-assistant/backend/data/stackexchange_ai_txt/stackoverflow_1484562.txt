Flash itself is setup in a way that, with a small amount of programming and art skill, you can put together pretty simple games. If you don't have these skills (and aren't interested in spending the time to acquire them) you're looking for something wherein you can drag and drop pregenerated components and click together a game like legos. The types of games that you can make with these 'engines' will be pretty basic, and you'll most likely exhaust their potential fairly quickly, leaving you to have to learn how to do it 'the right way' anyways... With that rather lengthy caveat... You can start by just googling for 'flash game creator' and get a few promising looking items. Sploder is at the top of the list, and that looks kind of interesting, although I haven't tried it myself. Also, the advantage of learning Flash/Actionscript rather than a proprietary 'engine' is that, when you inevitably run into a problem, there exists much more documentation and community help for Flash and Actionscript than for whatever niche product you'll find.
