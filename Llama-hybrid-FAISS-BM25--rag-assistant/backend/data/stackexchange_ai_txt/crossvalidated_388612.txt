Multiple filters during backpropagation in convolutional neural network

Let's say we have an Input 10x10x3 (WxHxD) and 5 filters 3x3x3 . Convolution between Input and filters will be 8x8x5 . During backpropagation we will get error with the same size 8x8x5 . While calculating dE/dF how do I perform convolution when depth between filters and error do not match. The same thing goes to dE/dX . I understand that I need to perform 'FULL' convolution while calculating dE/dF but that's just impossible without the same depth.
