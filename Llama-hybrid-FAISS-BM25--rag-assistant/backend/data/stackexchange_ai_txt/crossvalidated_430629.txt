Figuring out the margin for the soft margin SVM (exam question)

This is an exam question and I am not sure whether it is solveable with the given information. We were given a graphic that displayed binary labelled points $x^{(i)}\in \mathbb{R}^2$ with $y^{(i)} \in \{-1,1\}$ in 2d space and a seperating line with equation: $$2x_2=-2x_1+4\quad \quad (1)$$ This equation described the decision boundary for a Soft margin SVM with unknown complexity parameter $C$ , i.e. $\min_{\theta, \theta_0, \zeta^{(i)}}\frac{1}{2}||\theta||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n\zeta^{(i)}$ $s.t. \quad y^{(i)}(\theta^Tx^{(i)}+\theta_0)\geq1-\zeta^{(i)}, \quad \zeta^{(i)}\geq0$ Our task was to find out the margin $\gamma= \frac{1}{||\theta||}$ So we were only given this information: coordinates of the points + their label equation for decision boundary So again my question: is it even possible to solve this question and if so, how? My first intention was to set $||\theta||=\sqrt{2^2+2^2}$ , simply reading off the parameter values from equation $(1)$ . However this is of course invalid as you can simply multiply the equation for the decision boundary with any arbitrary constant which makes this solution completely abitrary and incorrect.
