Javascript modal draggable popup

Maybe someone knows where can I find some SIMPLE JavaScript code for Draggable Modal Popup Window like http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ Microsoft AJAX is too heavy, jquery needs to include many js files include whole jquery core and css. I need something very simple - include one js file to show hidden div's content with blocked background.
