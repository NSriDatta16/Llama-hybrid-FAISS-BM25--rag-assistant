One of the reasons for Namespaces are for organisational purposes, how finely grained you make them is up to personal preference - I keep them fairly generic personally, for example I'd have TransferObjects. Vehicles, but not go any finely grained than that. Unless you have many many types, I don't see a point in going into that much detail. But that is up to you. If it's a small project, then should the code base be relatively small and easily navigable, thus removing the need for such an approach?
