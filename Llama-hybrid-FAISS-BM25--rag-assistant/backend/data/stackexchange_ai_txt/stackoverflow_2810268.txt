From http://www.zhangkf.com/2010/06/linkedin-developer-network-oauth-authentication/ : Yes you can get connected with Linedin withyour Native Application by following simple steps: You get an API key from LinkedIn. This is also called a Consumer Key in OAuth terminology. You build a feature into your site that leverages the user's LinkedIn network. Your user clicks on your UI to request to use that feature. You make a call to LinkedIn to ask to use our authentication. This is called getting a Request Token. LinkedIn replies with an OAuth Token indicating that you can use the authentication system. You send your user to a LinkedIn URL. That URL includes the OAuth Token you got and a few other parameters such as a URL for LinkedIn to return the user to after granting access. The user grants access to your application by signing into that page. Upon successful signon, LinkedIn will return the user to your site. You will then make a call to LinkedIn to get an Access Token. LinkedIn replies with an Access Token for the user. You use that Access Token for any API calls to LinkedIn to identify the user on whose behalf you are making the call. Or Download the Code from here,you could get it.Just Provide your API Key and Secrete Key http://github.com/ResultsDirect/LinkedIn-iPhone Or see this for details: http://developer.linkedin.com/docs/DOC-1008
