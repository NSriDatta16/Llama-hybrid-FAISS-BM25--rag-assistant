mbeckish is right. Could you make a linear combination of the different energies, and adjust the coefficients? Possibly log-transforming them in and out? I've done some MCMC using Metropolis-Hastings. In that case I'm defining the (non-normalized) log-likelihood of a particular state (given its priors), and I find that a way to clarify my thinking about what I want.
