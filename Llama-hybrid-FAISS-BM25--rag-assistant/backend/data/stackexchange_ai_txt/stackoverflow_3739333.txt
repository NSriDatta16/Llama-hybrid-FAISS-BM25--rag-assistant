iOS Default.png status bar not drawn over

This is probably something simple but I'm having a problem with my Default.png file. I created it using the XCode organizer to take a screenshot and having it assign it as the Default image. According to this post ( Best way to create Default.png image for iPhone app ) iOS is supposed to draw the real status bar over top of the status bar in my Default.png but that's not happening; it shows two status bars stacked on top of each other until the app completely loads and everything is normal. This is distracting and obviously looks like crap. I've tried hiding the status bar during startup and reenabling it during application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: but the status bar in my Default.png is still at the top. I'm sure it's something simple but I can't figure it out.
