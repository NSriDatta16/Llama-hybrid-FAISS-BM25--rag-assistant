How to improve the way I browse an array with .each while trying to keep track of the index ("i") using Ruby?

Let's say I'm doing a simple .each but I still want to keep the position in the loop, I can do: i = 0 poneys.each do |poney| #something involving i #something involving poney i = i + 1 end This doesn't look very elegant to me. So I guess I could get rid of the .each : for i in 0..poneys.size-1 do #something involving i end ... or something similar with a different syntax. The problem is that if I want to access the object I have to do: for i in 0..poneys.size-1 do poney = poneys[i] #something involving i #something involving poney end ... and that's not very elegant either. Is there a nice and clean way of doing this ?
