You can specify your own "helper" on the draggable definition. Whatever html you specify as your helper is what will be shown during the drag animation. In your sortable (the drop area in the demo) you can override the beforeStop function. In there you can replace the item with whatever you want to be actually dropped into your shopping cart. In that, you could add the X button with javascript or something to remove the item I recently implemented this to drag from a datatable into a list, so had to convert the tr into an li. It works in jQuery 1.4 but I get strange results on the drop when I drag out of the top in 1.5, and I haven't resolved that yet. Here's my helper defintion helper: function() { var text = this.children[0].innerText; var result = " "+text+" "; return result; }, and here's my beforeStop function beforeStop: function( event, ui ) { var id = ui.helper.attr( "id" ); var text = ui.helper.text(); var li = " "+text+" "; $(ui.item).replaceWith( li ); }
