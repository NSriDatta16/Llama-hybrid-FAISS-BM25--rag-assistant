You can use the pragma directives: private void HardTerminalExit() { #if DEBUG // Soft Exit #else // Hard Exit #end if } I believe it's better practice to use the newer ConditionalAttribute, but I don't think you can negate that, so you'd need to set an environment variable for "RELEASE" yourself: [Conditional ( "RELEASE" )] private void HardTerminalExit() { // Hard Exit, only called when "RELEASE" is defined. } This will tell the compiler to only call this method when the "RELEASE" environment variable is declared somewhere - this can declared in during compilation (Conditional compilation symbols on the Build property pane) or as part of the operating system shell, see ConditionalAttribute for more inforamation on this.
