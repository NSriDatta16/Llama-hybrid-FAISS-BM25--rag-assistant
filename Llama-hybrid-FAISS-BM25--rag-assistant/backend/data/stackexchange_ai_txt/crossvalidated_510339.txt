Poisson variate corresponding to the Exponential variate

According to Wikipedia, In probability theory and statistics, the exponential distribution is the probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. A certain example from the book on Statistical Inference by George and Casella is as follows, Let X1,.....Xn be a random sample from an exponential (a) population. Specifically, X1,....Xn might correspond to the times until failure (measured in years) for n identical circuit boards that are put on test and used until they fail. P(X>2) is the probability that the board will last more than 2 years. What is the corresponding poisson variate for the exponential variate, X?
