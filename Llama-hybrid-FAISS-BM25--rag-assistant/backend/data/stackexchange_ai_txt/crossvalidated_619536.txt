Difference in difference marginal probability from logistic model

I am trying to estimate the interaction term from a glmer model as a marginal probability contrast using emmeans. I can calculate the difference in differences marginal probability, but I was assuming that given the interaction term in the regression model was significant, the corresponding emmeans estimate would also be significant. It's not. If I have in fact calculated it correctly, what is the intuition in a statistically significant interaction term in a non-linear model not translating to a statistically significant probability difference? I understand that whereas odds ratios remain constant over the range of a covariate, differences in probabilities change depending on the value, so is it just that? And if that's the case, how does one report these findings? e.g. "The interaction effect between x and z was found to be statistically significant on the odds ratio scale but not when calculated as a difference in probabilities..." > summary(test_mod |z|) (Intercept) 0.782608 0.191114 4.095 4.22e-05 *** periodpost -0.145077 0.135121 -1.074 0.282967 DMT_effhigh -1.701113 0.133809 -12.713 test_mod |> + emmeans(~ period + DMT_eff, type = "response") period DMT_eff prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL pre low 0.574 0.0234 Inf 0.5281 0.619 post low 0.539 0.0259 Inf 0.4877 0.589 pre high 0.198 0.0158 Inf 0.1684 0.231 post high 0.107 0.0118 Inf 0.0862 0.133 Results are averaged over the levels of: GENDER Confidence level used: 0.95 Intervals are back-transformed from the logit scale > (test_emm + emmeans(~ period + DMT_eff, type = "response") |> + regrid() |> pairs(reverse = T)) contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value post low - pre low -0.0358 0.0333 Inf -1.074 0.7056 pre high - pre low -0.3768 0.0274 Inf -13.757 custom contrast(test_emm, custom) contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value DiD -0.0546 0.0385 Inf -1.418 0.1561 Results are averaged over the levels of: GENDER The interaction term from the regression model: periodpost:DMT_effhigh -0.572917 0.205676 -2.786 0.005344 ** and the emmeans probability estimate: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value DiD -0.0546 0.0385 Inf -1.418 0.1561
