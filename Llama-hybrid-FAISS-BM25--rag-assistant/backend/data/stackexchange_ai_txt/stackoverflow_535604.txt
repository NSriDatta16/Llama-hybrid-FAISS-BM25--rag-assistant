The ridiculous behavior when you attempt to use click-drag to select text on a line that is wider than its physical window. The pieces of the history window that I need to copy/paste into bug reports are frequently wider than the physical window. I've gotten so used to the triple-click workaround that I find myself attempting to misuse triple click in other (well behaved) applications.
