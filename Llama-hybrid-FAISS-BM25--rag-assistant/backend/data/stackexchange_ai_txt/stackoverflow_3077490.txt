Pylons and NodeJS / Comet

I'm building Pylons web applications that use a lot of jQuery and AJAX/JSON to make these apps more Web 2.0'ie. I've been looking at the server push technologies and have questions about how to do this with Pylons. I've looked at Comet and NodeJS (though I don't know much about NodeJS yet) and am confused about what would be a good method to implement server push techniques in Pylons. I'm currently "emulating" this by having my JavasScript client app perform periodic polling in order to update the app content. Does anyone have any information/pointers/hints/help about what I'm talking about in the paragraph above? Your help would most definitely be appreciated! Thanks in advance! Doug
