I just wanted to give an update for anyone interested: I understood that both rstanarm and brms use Stan for the computation of the Bayesian models. Therefore, I assumed that the decision between these two packages is not crucial and I opted for brms, because I found it more intuitive and found enough resources to conduct and interpret my analyses. A comparison between the packages is also included in the source I listed above ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf ). Because there is only little research on the specific effect I investigated, I decided to discard the specification of priors and sticked to the default prior (an improper flat prior over the reals, see https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v080i01 ) for my parameters. I decided to interpret the mean of the posterior distribution and the respective 95% credible interval of all included parameters (including control variables). For my central effect (the one referring to my hypothesis) I also computed the evidence ratio, which can be interpreted as a one-sided Bayes factor (see https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms/issues/311 ). I will now mark my question as answered. However, if anyone with more expertise detects a mistake or is willing to answer my original questions I would still be grateful for hints and corrections.
