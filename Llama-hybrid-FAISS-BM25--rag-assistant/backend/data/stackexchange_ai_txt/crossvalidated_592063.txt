Is it correct to say average salary increase was 3% when every employee got x dollar more?

Let's say we have three employees. Their salary is 2000, 2500 and 6000 USD. Due to inflation each employee got an increase of 500 USD. 2000 -> 2500 USD: 25% increase. 2500 -> 3000 USD: 20% increase. 5000 -> 5500 USD: 10% increase. Can HR department say the average salary increase was 18.33% by calculating (25+20+10)/3? To me, averaging the percentages doesn't feel right here as the salaries are different at the beginning. I would argue the salary increased by 10% by calculating (5500+3000+2500)/(5000+3000+2000)=1.1
