Oracle 11gr2 connection to Sql Server using dg4msql problem

To whom it may respond to, We have installed Oracle 11g r2 on a Redhat Enterprise Linux 5.4 . We are trying to connect to a Sql Server 2005, after applying some notes the error below is the result we got : "ORA-28513 internal error in heterogenous remote agent". listener.ora is as below : [oracle@oracledb admin]$ less listener.ora ) (SID_DESC = (SID_NAME = dg4msql) (ORACLE_HOME = /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1) (PROGRAM = dg4msql) (ENVS=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1/dg4msql/lib:/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1/lib) ) ) LOGGING_LISTENER = on LISTENER = (DESCRIPTION_LIST = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = oracledb)(PORT = 1521)) ) ) ADR_BASE_LISTENER = /u01/app/oracle TRACE_LEVEL_LISTENER = on tnsnames.ora is as below : [oracle@oracledb admin]$ less tnsnames.ora # tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora # Generated by Oracle configuration tools. fasdat = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = oracledb)(PORT = 1521)) ) (CONNECT_DATA = (SID = fasdat) ) ) dg4msql = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL= TCP) (HOST = oracledb) (PORT = 1521) ) (CONNECT_DATA= (SID=dg4msql) ) (HS=OK)) init4msql.ora is as below : [oracle@oracledb admin]$ less initdg4msql.ora # This is a customized agent init file that contains the HS parameters # that are needed for the Database Gateway for Microsoft SQL Server # # HS init parameters # HS_FDS_CONNECT_INFO=192.168.1.48:1433//NAVISION # alternate connect format is hostname/serverinstance/databasename #HS_FDS_TRACE_LEVEL=0 HS_FDS_RECOVERY_ACCOUNT=RECOVER HS_FDS_RECOVERY_PWD=RECOVER #HS_LANGUAGE=turkish_turkey.WE8ISO8859P9 HS_NLS_NCHAR=WE8ISO8859P9 #HS_FDS_TRACE_LEVEL=DEBUG We have setup a system dsn at Sql Server 2005 named 'dg4msql' , chose the driver as 'Sql Server' and server as 'local' We would be glad to hear any ideas to resolve this problem,
