Aliases in fractional factorial designs

I am looking at using a fractional factorial design in order to reduce the number of treatment runs for an experiment involving a binary outcome. The idea is to create the design, then, since this is a marketing application and not an engineering one, use some number of replicants per treatment combination (say 20,000 in each) and analyze the result in a logistic regression. I am using the package FRF2 for fractional factorials. Say I have a 2^8 factorial and wish to be able to see the main effects and a selected group of second order interactions: #now lets say we want to be able to read all the main effects A-H and also a couple of the 2nd order interactions we *think* will be important/large # specifically, lets say we want AB, AC, AD, FH and GH dMod3 This yields a design with 16 "runs", which will each receive 20,000 replicants. The aliasing is as follows: $fi2 [1] AB=CF=DG=HE AC=BF=DH=GE AD=BG=CH=FE AE=BH=CG=DF AF=BC=DE=GH AG=BD=CE=FH [7] AH=BE=CD=FG If I simulate the responses (1 or 0) to these 20000*16 cases, I can use a logistic regression to analyze the experiment. What I am confused by is that I can fit main effects and interactions that are supposedly confounded, for example I can fit glm(Y~A+B+A:B+C:F). even though AB and CF are confounded. Questions: Is it because I have replication that I can fit this model? What is the implication of fitting such a model? Is a fractional factorial using this situation (like the linked paper) nonsensical?
