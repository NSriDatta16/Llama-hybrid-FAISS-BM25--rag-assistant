Looking for an adaptMCMC (R package for adaptive MCMC sampling) tutorial

I need to fit a very complex Bayesian hierarchical model and I want to use the adaptMCMC package of Andreas Scheidegger to do the posterior sampling. I can only find the adaptMCMC package reference manual, which doesn't provide a very helpful example of the core sampling function. Does anyone know if there is a more helpful tutorial out there? Thanks.
