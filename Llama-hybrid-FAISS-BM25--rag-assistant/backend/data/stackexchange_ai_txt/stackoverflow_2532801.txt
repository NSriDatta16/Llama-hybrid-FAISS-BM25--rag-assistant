I have an answer that's a little bit different if (preg_match('/^[^\da-z\s_-]$/i', $str)) { // auto post, but flag to moderator to inspect title OR // instead of auto posting, put in 'waiting to be authorised' by a mod } I hope I have that regex correct, but I have not tested it. Basically it should detect when someone has in their title characters that are not 0-9, A-Z (case insensitive), whitespace, underscore and dash. Of course, you can modify this to suit your liking. It would also be a good idea to inform the end user "Titles that deliberately try to attract attention without benefiting the product description may be deleted without warning"
