Here are some I found that could potentially be very dangerous (not including the ones above :) GET_ACCOUNTS - Allows access to the list of accounts in the Accounts Service MOUNT_FORMAT_FILESYSTEMS - Allows formatting file systems for removable storage. PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS - Allows an application to monitor, modify, or abort outgoing calls. READ_SMS - Allows an application to read SMS messages. SEND_SMS - Allows an application to send SMS messages. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows an application to read from external storage WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows an application to write to external storage And of course the best way to transmit some of this data INTERNET - Allows applications to open network sockets.
