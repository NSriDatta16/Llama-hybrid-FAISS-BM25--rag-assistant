This caught my attention so I downloaded ExpressionSerializationTypeResolver.cs and ExpressionSerializer.cs and then I: class Purchase { public decimal Price {get;set;} public string Description {get;set;} } ... var purchases = new List () { new Purchase() { Price = 150, Description = "Flute" }, new Purchase() { Price = 4711, Description = "Bike" } }; Expression >> queryExp = () => from p in purchases where p.Price > 100 && p.Description != "Bike" select p; ExpressionSerializer serializer = new ExpressionSerializer(); XElement queryXml = serializer.Serialize(queryExp); and then I got into problems, but maybe you could do something with the pretty big expression tree of your query? You can find it here .
