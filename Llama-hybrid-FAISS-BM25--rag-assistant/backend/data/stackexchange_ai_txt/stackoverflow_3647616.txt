Creating an array of custom objects in Objective C

EDIT What i am trying to achieve with the code, is to create an array of 20 unique 'Person' objects. I know now thanks to the guys below that i am going way off calling dealloc. for (int i = 0; i In the process of learning Objective C, hence why this code might seem crazy to you. But I am coming from Java so my logic isn't great for Objective C yet. I was trying to populate my array with 20 person objects. But it seems i am adding the same Object person all the time. Then deallocating it which defeats the point. So my question is: What would be the correct way to to fill the array with 20 different person objects. The names and ages will be different in the future for each person but at the moment they all be the same while i learn. Is the only way to do this to type a lot of code like this : Person *myPerson1 = [[Person alloc] init]; myPerson.name = @"Brian"; myPerson.age = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:23]; [myArray addObject:myPerson1]; Person *myPerson2 = [[Person alloc] init]; myPerson.name = @"Brian"; myPerson.age = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:23]; [myArray addObject:myPerson2]; Person *myPerson3 = [[Person alloc] init]; myPerson.name = @"Brian"; myPerson.age = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:23]; [myArray addObject:myPerson3]; 20 times? Or is there a more elegant solution? Thanks for you advice. -Code
