Interpretation of Accumulated Local Effect (ALE) values in a classification task

I'm working with the ALE implementation provided by the iml package in R. This package is accompanied by the usual documentation , a vignette and even a very nice book . I've studied all three of them trying to figure out the exact interpretation of the resulting ALE values in a classification task. I do have a high level understanding which is: Increasing ALE values when moving from one feature value to a neighbouring one mean that the probability of the model predicting a specific class has increased. What I cannot figure out is: what is the exact ALE value? The closest thing I find is around figure 8.17 in the book where it says " For the age feature, the ALE plot shows that the predicted cancer probability is low on average up to age 40 and increases after that. ". Is it really a probability such that a value of 0.075 for an age of ~82 means the probability for cancer="yes" at that age is 7.5% higher compared to the average prediction probability for that class (cancer="yes") across all feature values for age? Here is an example I have copied straight from the documentation : library(rpart) library(iml) rf $new(rf, data = iris, type = "prob") plot(FeatureEffect$ new(mod, feature = "Petal.Width")) The result looks like so: And what is the ALE value when you apply it to a classification model which does not return probabilities but just predicted classes? E.g. I'm using a caret trained random forest w/o specifically extracting the prediction probabilities and iml 's ALE still produces values which seem to make sense. What are these? I guess while qualitatively my high level understanding applies to all implementations of ALE I would be interested in the exact meaning of the ALE values produced by the iml package for a classification task.
