The relationships established in a RELATIONAL database are the very core of the relational database model. In a database, we model entities. We use relationships between entities to maintain data integrity, and ensure the records are organized properly. Relationships also create indexes between related tables. If you are not using the relationships, and/or modelling your table structure based upon the relationships between discrete entities, then you are not harnessing the true power of your relational database. Yes, you can make queries work, and yes, you can get the Db to do some usefule work. But can you ensure that, say, every Employee record is properly RELATED to the proper company? Can you ensure that there is only one record for that company, and that all the emplotyees of that company are related to that record? Without designing your database structure around entities and the relationships between them, you might as well use a spreadsheet, or one big, flat table. RELATIONSHIPS and NORMALIZATION form the basis of the modern relational database.
