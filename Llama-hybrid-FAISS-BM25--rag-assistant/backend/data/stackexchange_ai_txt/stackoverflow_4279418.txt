How to reuse Spring XML fragments

I am working on Spring based application. The XML is simple but contains several almost identical fragments. For example I have 5 different DAO objects, 2 queues etc. Configuration of each DAO looks like: com.mycompany.dao.DeviceDAO hibernateInterceptor deviceDaoTarget I'd be happy to use some kind of import with parameters. For example I'd like to create parametrized configuration of DAO like this: ${dao.interface} hibernateInterceptor ${dao.target} and then call it several times with different parameters, e.g.: com.mycompany.dao.hibernate.DeviceDAO com.mycompany.dao.hibernate.DeviceDAOHibernateImpl deviceDaoTarget Is something like this possible?
