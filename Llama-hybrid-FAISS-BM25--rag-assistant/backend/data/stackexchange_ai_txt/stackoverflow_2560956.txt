VisualSVN and VS2008 integration - moving files

If I drag and drop tracked .cs files to new folders in VS2008 with VisualSVN what message should I see when I commit the .cs file? I see added (+) shouldn't I see a "move"? I'm asking because I'm getting ready to do a major refactoring (including moving lots of files) and I don't want to lose my version history on these files. Note: I'm very new to Subversion, TortoiseSVN, and VisualSVN.
