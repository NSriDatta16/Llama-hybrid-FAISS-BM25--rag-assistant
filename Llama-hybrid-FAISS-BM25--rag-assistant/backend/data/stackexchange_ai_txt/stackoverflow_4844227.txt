I am repeating a basic theory of mine, but models are just that - only models. The model defined by OOP is a very effective way to structure a program, and for many application programming domains, is entirely appropriate. For some problem spaces, the model may become decreasingly effective (or less efficient, or both). A potential metaphore exists with physics. For many, many years Newtonian physics did (and in fact, still does) a remarkable job of modelling the laws of motion, time, and space (with some help from euclidian and sperical geometry). But when science began probing into the micro-and macro aspects of the problem space, Newtonian physics (AND euclidian/Spherical geometry) begin to break down. Hence we now have Relativity and quantumn mechanics. These do a fantastic job of modelling the universe at the macro and micro levels respectively, but are overly convoluted for use as descriptors of every-day, human-scale events. OOP is very effective for application programming in a lot of cases, when considered in the context of the complexity involved with modelling real-world problems and human interactions for consumption and processing by a linear machine. As someone above observed, there are no silver bullets. And my impression (having never used C++) is that languages which attempt to be multi-paradigm also become more complex, and not necessarily as efficient for smaller problems more easily handled with a higher-level, more targeted language. Much like Quantumn mechanics and/or relativity theories (I mean, really, is anyone interested in the relationship between mass and velocity when travelling at 60 MPH on the freeway? OR the probability of Los angeles being where you expect it to be when you arrive?). In my impression, adherence to qa specific model is important, so long as the model is suited to the problem space. At the point when this stops being true, the model may need to evolve, and there will be resistence to this. There will be attempts to force the problem space into a model not suited (review the history of physics again, or check into the evolution of the helio-centric model of the solar system, and include the key word "epicycles"). All of the above is simply MY best understanding of the state of things, and if I have missed the mark somewhere, I am happy to hear some contrary news.
