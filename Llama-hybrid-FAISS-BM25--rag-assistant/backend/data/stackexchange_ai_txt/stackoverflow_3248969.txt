Selector api and sun's impl are horrible. The document allows you to have multiple threads blocking on one selector's select(), but there is no point doing that. You should have only one thread blocked on one selector.select(). And the actual impl simply does syncrhonized(this) in select() to achieve thread safety. It's like the Vector and Hashtable of the old days of excessive synchronization. They should have simply exposed low level primitive non blocking methods, without wrapping them in so many nanny abstractions - average programmers won't use selectors, and those who do can take care of themselves.
