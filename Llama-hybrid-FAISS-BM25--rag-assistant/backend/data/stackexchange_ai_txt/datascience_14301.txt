Extrapolation? Happens a lot when your data distributions change over time, so a system that is well modeled in the training set wont know how to deal with values that are not in a similar range. More of a general term, so it might be what you're looking for. It also has different effects depending on the technique you use. Something like random forests is not very good at extrapolation, where others like logistic regression can still perform OK.
