Applications of Neural networks?

I am currently learning about Nueral Networks in Machine Learning and think it very interesting but I don't really know any other Applications NN have other than in Machine Learning and AI. I have tried researching these things but have come up short. Could anyone tell me if you could use it in "Inventory management" or "Finance"? If you can would you have any examples?
