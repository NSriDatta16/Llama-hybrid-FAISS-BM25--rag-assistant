The term learning curve can mean different things in different context, which is confusing. When talking about neural networks (and other iteratively trained models) the learning curve describes the model's training progress. It is often used to determine when it's time to stop training. In scikit-learn, the learning curve is interpreted differently. It describes how your model would perform if it was (re-)trained with less data. This can help you guess if the model would likely improve by getting more data. The same hyperparameters specified when constructing the model are used when the model is re-fitted. The score function used is also a parameter of the model. Many regression models default to the R2 score, which is likely the score you plotted.
