+dateWithNaturalLanguageString seems to be only available on the Mac : NSDate Class Reference in Mac Dev Center vs. NSDate Class Reference in iPhone Dev Center Also, the documentation says that: It may give unexpected results, and its use is strongly discouraged In the overview section of the class reference you can find the following information: NSDate provides several methods to interpret and to create string representations of dates (for example, dateWithNaturalLanguageString:locale: and descriptionWithLocale:). In general, on Mac OS X v10.4 and later you should use an instance of NSDateFormatter to parse and generate strings using the methods dateFromString: and stringFromDate:â€”see NSDateFormatter on Mac OS X 10.4 for more details. Given that this is only officially available on the Mac, but not on the iPhone, I wouldn't use it in an iPhone project. Even on the Mac it seems that Apple recommends using an NSDateFormatter instead.
