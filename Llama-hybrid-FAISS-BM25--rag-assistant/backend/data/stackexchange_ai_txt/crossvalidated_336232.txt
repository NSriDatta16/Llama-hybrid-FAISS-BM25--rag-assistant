Why is the penalty in the logistic regression likelihood ratio test different from the penalty I specified when fitting the model?

I'm fitting a penalized logistic regression model using the rms package in R. When I print the result, the penalty in the model likelihood ratio test is different from the penalty I used to fit the model. Why is this? library(datasets) library(rms) fit = lrm(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris, x=T, y=T) pen = pentrace(fit, seq(0,5, by=0.1)) pen$penalty # penalty = 1.3 fit
