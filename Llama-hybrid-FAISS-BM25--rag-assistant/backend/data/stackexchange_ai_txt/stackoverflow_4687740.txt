How to update/store changed XML Node value in Flash/AS2?

I've succesfully loaded and parsed this XML file, using XMLParser and AS2: Sample paragraph Sample paragraph 2 Now, what I need, is to increase and store the "like" and "dislike" values with the click of a button, but I don't know how to modify and store them in the existing nodes (eg., without adding new ones). Do I need to use PHP, or can AS2 handle it by itself? Any help on the subject? Thankyou!
