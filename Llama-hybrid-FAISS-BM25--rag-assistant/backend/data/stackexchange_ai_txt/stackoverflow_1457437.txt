The easiest way to redirect to the last page, is to use the URI directly: Logout ( request.forwardURI is the complete URL as displayed in the browser, while request.contextPath is the URL part representing the app context, eg. " http://localhost:8080/yourApp " - thus, the result of removing the context path from the forward URI is the app-relative URI, eg. "/mycontroller/myaction") In your logout action simply redirect to this URI: def targetUri = params.targetUri ?: "/" redirect(uri: targetUri) AFAIK, using the referrer is not entirely safe, because this relies on the user agent (browser) to append the referrer HTTP header (which may have been disabled). As to your 2nd question: Grails automatically interprets list or map attribute values in GSPs as Groovy expressions. So, this Logout is equivalent to Logout and wrapping parts of this expression again in ${...} seems to confuse the GSP compiler. Hope this helps.
