Okay, I am currently at 0.81340 in the competiton. And I will just clear out certain things. I would suggest that you try feature engineering before you go for ensemble methods. There are actually quite a decent tutorials as mentioned before. One can actually score upto at least 0.82 just relying on feature engineering and a ten-fold cross validated RandomForest. Certain things for you to ponder at: Look at the Age, what other information does it give you. Do SibSp and Parch actually represent different things? Can you get something out of the Name of the passengers? All the Best. Cheers.
