There are so many models can handle this kind of problems. Decision Tree algorithm (it can also include regression analysis) can be useful. Neural Network is always powerful but also computationally expensive. Logistic Regression is another approach, that I personally would follow as the first step since it is relatively powerful for prediction problems and does not consume so much computational resources relatively compared to aforementioned techniques. Just to have a list of available algorithms in R (that I have used): Random-Forest Logistic Regression Naive Bayes Neural Network There are some other methods available that I am not familiar with therefore won't recommend. Another suggestion is using some measures like Coefficient of determination before converting date (i.e. year, month, day) to categorical variables (@Ronald's comment is helpful). Good luck!
