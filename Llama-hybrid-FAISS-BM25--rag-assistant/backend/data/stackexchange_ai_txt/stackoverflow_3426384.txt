Many Methods Kill Code Speed?

I'm building an application that is seriously slower than it should be (a process takes 4 seconds when it should take only .1 seconds, that's my goal at least). I have a bunch of methods that pass an array from one to the other. This has kept my code nice and organized, but I'm worried that it's killing the efficiency of my code. Can anyone confirm if this is the case? Also, I have all of my code contained in a class separate from my UI. Is this going make things run significantly slower than if I had my code contained in the Form1.cs file? Edit: There are about 95000 points that need to be calculated, each point goes through 7 methods that does additional calculations.
