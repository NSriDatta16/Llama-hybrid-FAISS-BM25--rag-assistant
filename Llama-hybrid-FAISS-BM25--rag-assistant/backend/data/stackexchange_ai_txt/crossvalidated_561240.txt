Detecting and dealing with outliers in a sales prediction dataset of "Rossmann"

I have been working on a dataset for which the task is to forecast the sales of the drug sold by 1115 drug stores of the Rossmann chain. The dataset is fairly large with over 1m records and as many as 9 variables of which "Sales" is one . I began analyzing one of the variables named "Customers", demonstrating the "the number of customers on a given day", as per the description given in the dataset. I plotted the box plot of the variable in order to gain some insights of its spread and central tendency. Following is the graph that I thus begot; From this plot, it is quite tempting to conclude that this variable is overwhelmed with many a outlier and is verily right skewed. However, refusing to make irresponsible inference, I now wish to answer a 2 fold question; What definition of outlier fit the best for this variable and how to detect those? What factors must have influenced such spread of the dataset? I attach an image of first few records of the dataset so it subserves likely claims. Having identified the outliers and having inferred their causes, how then must I deal with those? Now I particularly am interested in the following things: a. How must I deal with the outliers given the realm that I'm working on which is a sales prediction problem for a drug stores chain. I want to identify a domain specific and less profound solution. b. (The fact that it's a "regression" problem must be kept in mind) What transformation suits the best? I'm posting this answer in order to demonstrate further analysis on this question; Heeding earlier advice of taking the logarithm of the "Customers" (IV) variable as well as the "Sales" (DV) variable, I begot the following graphs Box plot of the "Customers" variable before and after the (log base 10) transformation Box plot of the "Sales" variable before and after the (log base 10) transformation Relationship (scatter plot) between "Customers" and the "Sales" variable earlier and after transformation (original vs original Having added this information, I want to put a few more questions; From predictions' point of view, did taking logarithm really help, for the relationship between the IV and the DV was already linear. From the inference point of view; what typical inference could a statistician make by comparing the respective box plots? P. S. I have actually taken log10(values + 1) in lieu of log10(values) for a lot of records in both the variables were 0s.
