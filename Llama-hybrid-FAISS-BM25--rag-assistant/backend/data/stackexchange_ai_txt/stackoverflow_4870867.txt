Where's offline storage cache directory of Firefox?

I am using Firefox 3.6 as my browser, it's installed on " C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox ". But I cannot find offline storage cache directory in it, and I cannot find configuration about cache directory in Firefox either. Anyone knows the directory? Thanks!
