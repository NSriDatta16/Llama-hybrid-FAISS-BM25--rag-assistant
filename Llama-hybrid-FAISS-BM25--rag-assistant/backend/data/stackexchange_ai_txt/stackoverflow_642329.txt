Can you review my Perl rewrite of Cucumber?

There is a team working on acceptance testing X11 GUI application in our company, and they created a monstrous acceptance testing framework that drives the GUI as well as running scenarios. The framework is written using Perl 5, and scenario files look more like very complex Perl programs (thousands of lines long with procedural-programming style) than acceptance tests. I recently learned Ruby's Cucumber, and generally have been using Ruby for quite a lot of time. But unfortunately I can't just shove Ruby to replace Perl because the people who are writing all of this don't know Ruby and it's quite certain that they wont want "this" kind of interruption. So to bring Ruby's Cucumber a bit closer to their work, I rewrote it using Perl 5. Unfortunately I am really not a Perl programmer, and would love to get a code review and to hear suggestions from people who both know Perl and Cucumber. Hi Perl/Cucumber StackOverflow users - please help me create this "open source" attempt to re-create Cucumber for Perl! I would love to hear your comments and will accept any acceptable help. The minimal source code is here: http://github.com/kesor/p5-cucumber Thank you for your attention. For those not familiar with cucumber - please take just one small moment to take a look at this one small little page: http://cukes.info/
