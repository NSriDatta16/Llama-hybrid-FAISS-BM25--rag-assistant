No, you cannot treat two samples from the same mouse as independent and identically distributed - two technical replicates from the same mouse are obviously going to be more similar than two samples from different mice. As a general rule of thumb, you can only assume that samples at the level of your treatment unit (in this case, individual mice) are IID samples. Failure to do so results in a higher false positive rate than you intend. You have a few options available to you. A. You can average your technical replicates so that you have a single measurement from each mouse, then perform an unpaired t-test. This errs on the side of being slightly conservative depending on how skewed your data is. B. Do a randomization test that considers every level of hierarchy in your experimental design, see here . For full disclosure, I wrote this paper. Basically, when you have a hierarchical (or nested) experiment like this one, it's important to make sure your statistical analysis plan maintains whatever alpha level you choose (typically 5%). Treating technical replicates as independent samples (which many call "pseudoreplication") automatically fails this criterion.
