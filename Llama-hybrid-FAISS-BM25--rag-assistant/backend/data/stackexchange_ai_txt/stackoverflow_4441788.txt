Strangely enough, clojure.xml/emit still exists when you (use 'clojure.xml) that namespace at the REPL in 1.2.0. To verify: user=> (use 'clojure.xml) user=> (emit (parse "http://feeds.feedburner.com/burningonesblog")) For full disclosure I discovered this using the useful (ns-map 'user) function user=> (doc ns-map) ------------------------- clojure.core/ns-map ([ns]) Returns a map of all the mappings for the namespace. nil Now please note that you are entirely correct about their disappearing from the documentation in 1.2 ( clojure.xml and clojure.contrib.lazy-xml ) for all but prxml which isn't really what you're looking for. I can't speak to why that is the case but the reason they no longer show up in the web interface becomes evident upon examining their docstring. user=> (doc emit) ------------------------- clojure.xml/emit ([x]) nil nil Now there is this thread over at the Google Group which indicates that use of the emit function is discouraged for 2 reasons. It is undocumented and thus subject to change without notice. It, in general, does not produce valid xml (although I suppose if you know your data is valid it would emit valid xml). At the end of that thread, Stuart Halloway talks about a project to extend Clojure's XML support. Of course there's always dipping into the Java pool and using any of the excellent XML tools on the Java end. It sounds like clojure's XML story is mostly told in parsing at this point. Hope that helps.
