CRM114. A language specifically designed for interfacing with a very powerful Bayesian filter, useful for spam-filtering and similar tasks. I was asked to use it by a client last year and after looking into it, used some simple Bayesian code off of Codeproject.com instead. Later, I found a message posted on a forum somewhere from the original author of CRM114, apologizing for it. The main problem was Latin-derived grammar. The author admitted that he'd been learning Latin at the time, and so integrated it into his project. Thus, it gets strange operator-order and argument conventions. This also led to using the word 'alius' (Latin for 'otherwise' or 'else) where you'd use 'else' in any other language. Very difficult to make it do anything at all.
