Neural networks for regression vs. more classical regression methods?

I am interested in learning about when one would use neural networks for a regression problem over a more classical regression method such as least squares. Is it mostly related to the complexity of the expected relationship between the output and input? Are complicated and strong non-linearity relationships with many dependent variables, and a large amount of data more suitable for neural networks?
