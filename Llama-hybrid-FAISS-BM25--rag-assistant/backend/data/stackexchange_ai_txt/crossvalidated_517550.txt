Limiting the Bonferroni correction to 2 of 7 explanatory variables?

I have a single response variable (X) and a hypothesis that there exists a relationship between it and two explanatory variables (A, B). I also have five potential confounders (C, D, E, F, G), so a total of 7 explanatory variables. All my variables are dichotomous and I'm using logistic regression. If the analysis shows that neither A nor B contribute to the model, my hypothesis is not supported. Is using a Bonferroni N of 2 (i.e., .05/2) adequate? The readings I'm finding suggest I should include all 7, but it seems unnecessary to include variables that aren't associated with my hypothesis? E.g., a post here says, "such a correction should be used primarily when the researcher is looking for significant associations but without a pre-specified hypothesis." I have a pre-specified hypothesis, but also have two explanatory variables, so am more likely to see a type I error than if I only had one explanatory variable. So, adjusting my alpha by 2 seems reasonable? I'm reading here that "Bonferroni adjustment procedures (generally named "family-wise error rate (FWER)" procedures) are correct if you want to control the occurrence of a single false positive." Unless I'm missing something, I don't care about false positives among my confounders, so wouldn't need to include them in my Bonferroni N?
