Looking at the code, I can see nothing obvious that would make it a bottleneck. If you are getting times like 7ms and 15ms for this, I suspect that the root cause is that you have significantly more active (runnable) threads than physical processors. If this is the case, then the longish delays are due to waiting for a processor to become available to run a thread that has become runnable. You might be able to improve the average delays by reducing the number of threads, but this might also reduce overall throughput. Incidentally, I think that your custom synchronization code could be replaced with use of FutureTask , though I don't expect this would reduce average call times.
