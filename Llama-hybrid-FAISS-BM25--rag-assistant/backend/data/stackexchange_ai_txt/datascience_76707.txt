How do i perform feature selection for clustering?

I am new to Data science and trying to learn clustering? I have to partition the given dataset into different clusters into customer clusters based on their purchasing habits? How do I select the features that important for clustering? Heirarchy_1, Herarchy_2 etc describe the product.
