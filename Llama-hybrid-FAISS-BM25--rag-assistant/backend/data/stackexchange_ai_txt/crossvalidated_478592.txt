How to calculate ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,0,1)12 prediction by hand

I have converted the ARIMA (1,0,0)(1,0,1)12 into the following equation, $ (1-\phi_1B) (1-\zeta_1 B^{12}) Y_t = (1- \eta_1 B^{12})e_t$ where $\phi_1$ AR coefficient, $\zeta_1$ is SAR coeffiecient, and $\eta_1$ is SMA coefficient. When i expand this equation i get the following equation, $ y_t- \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \zeta_1 \phi_1 y_{t-13} - \zeta_1 y_{t-12} = c + e_t - \eta_1 e_{t-12}$ My question is how do i get the $e_t$ and $e_{t-12}$ from R? My time series is univariate. R generates standard error when I run coef(df_arima) but does not give the previous error terms. Same goes with the $c$ . I am not sure how to get this either. is c the intercept ? My aim is to predict the value for the next month , taking into account, the previous data, by hand. I have all the values except $e_t$ , $e_{t-12}$ and $c$ .
