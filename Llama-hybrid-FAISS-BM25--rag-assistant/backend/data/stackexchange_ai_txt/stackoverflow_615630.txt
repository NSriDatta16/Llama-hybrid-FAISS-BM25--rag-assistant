Look at the System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement namespace. You might also want to look at the Account Management sample application for idea. To check for an OU you can use System.DirectoryServices to instantiate a DirectoryEntry based on the OU's path (or a searcher to find it). If it doesn't exist, you need get the DirectoryEntry object for the parent OU and then create a new OrganizationUnit using Invoke to invoke the ADSI create method.
