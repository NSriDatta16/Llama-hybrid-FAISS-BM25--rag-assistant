Choosing a statistical test based on the outcome of another (e.g. normality)

So I have heard it said that it is not a good idea to choose one statistical test based on the outcome of another. This seems strange to me though. For example, people often choose to use a non parametric test when some other test suggests that the residuals are not normally distributed. This approach seems pretty widely accepted but does not seem to agree with the first sentence in this paragraph. I was just hoping to get clarification on this issue.
