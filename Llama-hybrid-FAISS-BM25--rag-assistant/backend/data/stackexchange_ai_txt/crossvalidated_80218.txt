You could do a weighted average in which the final score for each genre is the average over all artists weighted by the percentage of artists that don't make music in that genre. $x_i = (1 - \frac{1}{m + 0.5}) \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{m} x_{ij}}{N}$ Where $m$ is the number of artists in a genre (i.e. $m = 3$ for rock and $m = 1$ for industrial) and $N$ is the total number of artists, 4 in the example data given. I added 0.5 so that if there was only 1 artist in a genre, like Melodic Death Metal, the weight wouldn't be 0 , making the assumption that if only 1 artist has made music in that genre that it is less popular than genres with more artists. When I do that on your data, I get: rock = 38.21429 metal = 36.96429 alternative = 19.5 industrial = 5.416667 alternative rock = 8.333333 melodic death metal = 6
