Normalization is not for MYSql only. Its a general database concept. Normalization is the process of efficiently organizing data in a database. There are two goals of the normalization process: eliminating redundant data (for example, storing the same data in more than one table) and ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table). Both of these are worthy goals as they reduce the amount of space a database consumes and ensure that data is logically stored. Normal forms in SQL are given below. First Normal form (1NF): A relation is said to be in 1NF if it has only single valued attributes, neither repeating nor arrays are permitted. Second Normal Form (2NF): A relation is said to be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and every non key attribute is fully functional dependent on the primary key. Third Normal Form (3NF): We say that a relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): A relation is said to be in BCNF if and only if every determinant in the relation is a candidate key. Fourth Normal Form (4NF): A relation is said to be in 4NF if it is in BCNF and contains no multivalued dependency. Fifth Normal Form (5NF): A relation is said to be in 5NF if and only if every join dependency in relation is implied by the candidate keys of relation. Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF): We say that a relation is in DKNF if it is free of all modification anomalies. Insertion, Deletion, and update anomalies come under modification anomalies Seel also Database Normalization Basics
