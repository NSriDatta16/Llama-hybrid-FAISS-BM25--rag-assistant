Physical experiments with mechanized tossing of coins have shown that it is very difficult to make an actual coin that is heavily biased. But it is easy to make unfair dice (by shaving edges or embedding lead weights), so I'll consider a die with 3 faces labeled H and three labeled T . Suppose I've had a chance to look at a die and to know how it will be rolled, I see nothing suspicious, but I'm not absolutely sure the die is exactly fair. So I choose the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(10,10)$ as my prior distribution. This distribution puts almost 95% of its probability in the interval $(.3,.7).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 10,10) [1] 0.2886432 0.7113568 Also, suppose the die shows faces with H in $x = 1272$ rolls out of $n = 2500.$ Then using Bayes' Theorem to multiply the beta prior by the binomial likelihood, I get the beta posterior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(10+1272=1282, 10+1228=1238),$ and a 95% Bayesian posterior probability interval for the Heads probability (credible interval) is $(0.489, 0.528).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 1282, 1238) [1] 0.4892104 0.5282368 The die may not be precisely fair but I have faith that it will take a session with many more rolls of the die and at higher stakes than I'm ever likely to undertake before any slight bias will seriously impact my winnings or losses. (The Nevada commission that oversees casinos may require more evidence, but I am happy enough to use the die.)
