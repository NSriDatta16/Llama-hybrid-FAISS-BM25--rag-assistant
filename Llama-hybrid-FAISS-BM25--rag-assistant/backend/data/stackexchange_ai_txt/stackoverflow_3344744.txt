embedding a website inside a modal box on a different domain

I need to embed an iframe on different domain, that when click opens a modal box using fancy box. It would work something like this. user clicks image Once click loads a modal box(fancybox) that holds the iframe I need to do this because the fancybox needs to take up the majority of the screen 960x700 How would I do this?
