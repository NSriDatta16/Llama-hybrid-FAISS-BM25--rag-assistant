After some thinking of my own, the current best solution I can see is to throw together a light weight facade web-service that accepts an xml blob as input. I can then get my facade service to call the real service with the input data provided by the client and then: handle any errors, logging the source data and the returned soap fault Pass back to the client the responses from good data This would only be a temporary measure (I'm strongly opposed to web-services that are not explicit about the XML they accept) but it would perhaps give me more leverage to get over the hump of diagnosing errors like this in production where the client connecting to the web-service is not honouring the wsdl or able to read soap faults returned. Thankfully in this case there is only one party posting to the web-service - the packet sniffer methods (fiddler or wireshark) are feasible but the lack of logging for 500 errors did get me thinking "what nicer options are there?".
