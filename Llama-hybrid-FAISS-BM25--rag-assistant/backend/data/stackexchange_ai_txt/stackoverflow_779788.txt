Image browse by color/color range: need examples and/or code

At some long-ago Flash conferences I recall seeing a demo of a Flash app that had a color picker. Based on the user's color choice the app would show the user a set of images within the approximate range of that color: a bunch of mostly red images, a bunch of mostly blue images, etc. I'm looking for two things: 1) A link to a demo of this sort of app, ideally a Flash app 2) ActionScript or C# code that describes how to pick a bunch of images that fall within a color range. I know how to extract the aggregate/average RGB from individual images and persist this info to a database. I need to know how exactly to select out images within a certain range of color tolerance. Could this be done purely using SQL and a knowledge of the alphanumeric assignments of RGB color codes, or is there a better way?
