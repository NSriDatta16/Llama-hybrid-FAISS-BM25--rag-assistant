MINA is an excellent framework. Does a Server side need to have a GUI, to report status, connectivity and exceptions. If so how do I implement this, should I use Swing? Short Answer: No! Long Answer: A server normaly doesn't have a GUI, because most of the big server systems doesn't even have a display at all. A better solution is to use JMX to provide statistics. MINA has predefined MBeans which you only have to add to the JMX service. With a JMX-Client you can access these informations and build a GUI. Just try the JConsole and choose a local java application to get an idea about it. MINA is handling the connectivity but how do I handle the database(MySQL)? There are many ways to handle the database. Either pure JDBC, Hibernate or another ORM framework. Just make sure, that the thing you are using is thread safe! How could I test this app for scalability, how can I simulate client connections to the server. Either write a simple client and start it some thousand times, or use a specialized testing framework. If you are using an existing protocol, then there may be a specific one for that. Is there any framework that can do all of the above or do I have to handle each aspect. Depends on the protocol and what you want to achieve. There is an FTP server based on MINA which does all in one, but that's a specific implementation and won't fit on your needs. If you are using your own protocol, you have to implement en-/decoders and the handling of protocol and messages on your own. This includes the storage of message informations at the database.
