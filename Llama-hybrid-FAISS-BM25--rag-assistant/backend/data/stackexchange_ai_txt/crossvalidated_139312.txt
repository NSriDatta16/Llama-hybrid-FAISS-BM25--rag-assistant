The first sentence of the current 2015 editorial to which the OP links, reads: The Basic and Applied Social Psychology (BASP) 2014 Editorial *emphasized* that the null hypothesis significance testing procedure (NHSTP) is invalid... (my emphasis) In other words, for the editors it is an already proven scientific fact that "null hypothesis significance testing" is invalid, and the 2014 editorial only emphasized so, while the current 2015 editorial just implements this fact. The misuse (even maliciously so) of NHSTP is indeed well discussed and documented. And it is not unheard of in human history that "things get banned" because it has been found that after all said and done, they were misused more than put to good use (but shouldn't we statistically test that?). It can be a "second-best" solution, to cut what on average (inferential statistics) has come to losses, rather than gains, and so we predict (inferential statistics) that it will be detrimental also in the future. But the zeal revealed behind the wording of the above first sentence, makes this look -exactly, as a zealot approach rather than a cool-headed decision to cut the hand that tends to steal rather than offer. If one reads the one-year older editorial mentioned in the above quote (DOI:10.1080/01973533.2014.865505), one will see that this is only part of a re-hauling of the Journal's policies by a new Editor. Scrolling down the editorial, they write ...On the contrary, we believe that the p So it appears that their conclusion related to their discipline is that null-hypotheses are rejected "too-often", and so alleged findings may acquire spurious statistical significance. This is not the same argument as the "invalid" dictum in the first sentence. So, to answer to the question, it is obvious that for the editors of the journal, their decision is not only wise but already late in being implemented: they appear to think that they cut out what part of statistics has become harmful, keeping the beneficial parts -they don't seem to believe that there is anything here that needs replacing with something "equivalent". Epistemologically, this is an instance where scholars of a social science partially retract back from an attempt to make their discipline more objective in its methods and results by using quantitative methods, because they have arrived at the conclusion (how?) that, in the end, the attempt created "more bad than good". I would say that this is a very important matter, in principle possible to have happened, and one that would require years of work to demonstrate it "beyond reasonable doubt" and really help your discipline. But just one or two editorials and papers published will most probably (inferential statistics) just ignite a civil war. The final sentence of the 2015 editorial reads: We hope and anticipate that banning the NHSTP will have the effect of increasing the quality of submitted manuscripts by liberating authors from the stultified structure of NHSTP thinking thereby eliminating an important obstacle to creative thinking. The NHSTP has dominated psychology for decades; we hope that by instituting the first NHSTP ban, we demonstrate that psychology does not need the crutch of the NHSTP, and that other journals follow suit.
