Attribute importance can be found in several ways. Personally I prefer gain.ratio In your case it will look like: library('FSelector') res Here is result: attr_importance a 0.08255015 b 0.18738364 c 0.22898040 d 0.32410280 e 0.21155751 f 0.12846603 From result it seems that d feature has strongest predictive power from all the features while a is weakest. From the same package you can try cfs method as well. res But it gives just a character vector containing chosen attributes: [1] "c" "d" Also you can check chi.squared res Which model to use for you classification task is hard to tell. The No Free Lunch theorem for machine learning states that there is no one model that works best for every problem. You will have to try different models and see which one is best. I suggest you start with caret package and try few of many classifications supported. Here's one interesting document which can give you suggestion about which classification algorithms to focus on: Do we Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems?
