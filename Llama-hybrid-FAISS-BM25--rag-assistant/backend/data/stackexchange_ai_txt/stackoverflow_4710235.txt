Oh noes, not vertical centering with CSS. It's complicated, but read here: http://www.jakpsatweb.cz/css/css-vertical-center-solution.html . If you are set on JS, just position the element like so (crudely typed, 90% chance it won't work): $('#element').css('top', parseInt(($(document).height() - $(this).height()) / 2)); $('#element').css('left', parseInt(($(document).width() - $(this).width()) / 2)); It's not really elegant, but it might work. Good luck (I would tweak that animation. It's a good design, but the animation overlap lowers it's quality).
