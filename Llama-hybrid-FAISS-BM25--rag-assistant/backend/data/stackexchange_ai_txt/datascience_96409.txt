CNN: training accuracy vs. validation accuracy

I just finished training two models, while the one is pretrained and the other trained from scratch and created two diagrams afterward with their data, but as I am very new to machine learning, I don't get what they state. Why is the training accuracy so low? Did I use to less data? I had about 7200 pictures for training and 800 for validation! What does it mean, that the validation accuracy of the pretrained algorith is so much higher as the other one? Does it mean the pretrained is two times better then the one trained from scratch?
