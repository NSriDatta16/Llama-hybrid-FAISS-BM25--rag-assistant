I would start by saying this is impossible. Speech recognition is really, really hard. You're not clear in your question - are the voices overlapping? If so, splitting them up will be absurdly difficult. If they are separate, your more likely bet is to have a large set of samples of male and female voices, and look for common characteristics (and a way to programmatically identify them). If the samples aren't recorded cleanly (if they have background noise), things get even more complicated. You may get away with an average tone - male voices are generally deeper than female..
