Duplicate file in Isolated Storage

I hope this is not a stupid question. So, I simply want to duplicate a file from the Isolated Storage to be used as a backup. However, speed is really important in this case and I wondered what's the fastest way to do that. Should I open the file from the IS, read it to a stream, then create a backup file and write to it, well from what I've seen so far this will take at least half a second which is a lot.
