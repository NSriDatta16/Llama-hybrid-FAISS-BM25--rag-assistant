How can I set a Java applet transparency to show contents behind it?

I've got a web page with an applet inside. This applet is a drop target on a drag and drop action from the OS, I simply take an image from a folder, drag it on the applet and something happens. I give this webpage to a graphic designer and he ask to if he can put an image behind the java applet so he can simulate to change the background using CSS (it is a skinned app and graphic design can change during execution). Practically i supposed to do: with this CSS: div { width:50px; height:50px; background-image: url(image.jpg) center center no-repeat; } But it doesn't work (background is opaque). It is possible to set transparency to the applet without loosing drag and drop capabilities ? I'm searching something similar to flash wmode parameter. Better solutions implies only changes on the CSS/HTML without recompiling java class so the designing team can change the page structure without changing the Java.
