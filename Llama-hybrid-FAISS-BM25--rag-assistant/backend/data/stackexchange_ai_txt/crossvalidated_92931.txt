first, you don't have a lot of data to play with, only 24 observations. In your case it means that you barely have a couple of parameters to estimate reliably. the most systematic way in forecasting is to come up with a data generation process (DGP). you make an assumption about what is the true process for your sales, then try to estimate its parameters. consider a pure time series model with AR(1) DGP: $x_t=\phi x_{t-1}+c$, i.e. your sales this month are weighted average of sales last month plus and a constant. you already have 3 parameters (two coefficient and an error variance), which means about 8 observations per parameter - clearly not a lot. since your sales are seasonal, we must do something about it. one way is to add multiplicative seasonality : $(1-L)(1-L^{12})x_t=c$ in lag operator notation, or in expanded form: $x_t=c+\phi_1x_{t-1}+\phi_{12}x_{t-12}-\phi_1\phi_{12}x_{r-13}$. this adds one more parameter to estimate, so you go down to 6 observations per parameter - a real stretch. in Matlab this model is specified as arima('ARLags',1,'SARLags',12) this is assuming that your sales are stable, i.e. generally not growing. if you think that your sales are growing, then you have two options: random walk (RW) and a time trend. in Matlab RW is specified with arima('D',1,'SARLags',12) obviously, these are only examples of different DGPs. whatever you do keep in mind the number of parameters to estimate. with 24 observations your model must be very simple, 4 parameters at most (including variances).
