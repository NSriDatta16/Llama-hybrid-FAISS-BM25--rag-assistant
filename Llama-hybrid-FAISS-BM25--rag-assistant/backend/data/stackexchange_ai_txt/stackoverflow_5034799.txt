SQL first of every month

Supposing that I wanted to write table valued function in SQL that returns a table with the first day of every month between the argument dates, what is the simplest way to do this? For example fnFirstOfMonths('10/31/10', '2/17/11') would return a one-column table with 11/1/10, 12/1/10, 1/1/11 , and 2/1/11 as the elements. My first instinct is just to use a while loop and repeatedly insert first days of months until I get to before the start date. It seems like there should be a more elegant way to do this though. Thanks for any help you can provide.
