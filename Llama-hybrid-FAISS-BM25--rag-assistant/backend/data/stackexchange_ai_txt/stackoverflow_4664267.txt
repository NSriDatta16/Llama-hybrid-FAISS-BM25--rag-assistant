This depends very much on what you actually want to achieve, if all you want is an even distribution then you could simply take all the points on the circle and average them, the closer this average is to the centre of the circle, the more even the distribution. The caveat here though is that a distribution with 180 points at 0° and 180 points at 180° is just as good as a distribution with a single point at each degree. It's simply a matter of definitions if this is what you want or not. A related, but a bit more complex concept is that of Geometric standard deviation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_standard_deviation Another method would be like suggested in your other question, look at the mean number of points at all angles and see how much for each angle the number of points deviates from that. i.e. let I be your set of angles, say {0..359} and v_i = #points at angle i, for i in I , where a point p is at angle i iff floor(p) == i . Then mean_v = (sum of v_i for i in I) / length(I) and d_v_i = v_i - mean_v . Now you can define several metrics: maximum of abs(d_v_i) for i in I sum of abs(d_v_i) for i in I sqrt((sum of (d_v_i^2) for i in I) / length(I)) (this is standard deviation) There are lots more metrics you could take, any number that expresses the deviations contained in d_v_i would do the trick. It's all a matter of what exactly it is that you want that would determine the best metric. One last note, seeing as you probably want to be comparing the metrics between various input sets, i.e. sets with varying number of data points, which, in your case is differently sized images. You probably need to scale the metrics according to the size of your input and depending on the metric you use you might need to scale in different ways. There's an easy way to validate your metric though, just calculate the metric for an image, then scale the image to a different size and calculate it again for the scaled image. Both metrics should be the same of course.
