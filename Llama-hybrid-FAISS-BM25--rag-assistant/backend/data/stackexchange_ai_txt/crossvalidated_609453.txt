My experience with deep neural networks (DNN) on regression convinced myself that it does not work well if the number of features are high and the accuracy requirement is also high. The probable reason is that the DNN is a only a function approximator. When the original function is complicated and # of features are high, it is very difficult to have “right” model for DNN, the training seems to alternate between underfitting and overfitting if you change the size of DNN and/or size of training data.
