While, in practice, I agree with the sentiments of those who discourage this type of writing (when reading, you have to do extra work to scan the expression for its side effects), I'd like to offer !inVar1 ?: v.push_back(inVar1); !inVar2 ?: v.push_back(inVar2); ...if you're going for obscure, that is. GCC allows x ?: y in place of x ? x : y . :-)
