Is this data appropriate for keeping in a database?

In relation to my previous question where I was asking for some database suggestions; it just occured to me that I don't even know if what I'm trying to store there is appropriate for a database. Or should some other data storage method be used. I have some physical models testing (let's say wind tunnel data; something similar) where for every model (M-1234) I have: name (M-1234) length L breadth B height H L/B ratio L/H ratio ... lot of other ratios and dimensions ... force versus speed curve given in the form of a lot of points for x-y plotting ... few other similar curves (all of them of type x-y). Now, what I'm trying to accomplish is store that in some reasonable way, so that the user who will be using the database can come and see what are the closest ten models to L/B=2.5 (or some similar demand). Then for that, somehow get all the data of those models, including the curve data (in a plain text file format). Is a sql database (or any other, for that matter) an appropriate way of handling something like this ? Or should I take some other approach ? I have about a month to finish this, and in that time I have to learn enough about databases as well, so ... give your suggestions, please, bearing that in mind. Assume no previous knowledge on the subject, whatsoever.
