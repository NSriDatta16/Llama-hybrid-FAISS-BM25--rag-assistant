I suggest some sort of balanced binary tree such as a red-black tree. A search on PyPi throws up a couple of implementations. Searching on google will give you more. bintrees on PyPi looks very complete and has both Python and C/Cython implementations. I have not used it though, so caveat emptor. A red-black tree is kept sorted and most operations (insert, delete, find) are O(log2(N)), so finding an element in a tree of 200,000 entries will take on average 17-18 comparisons.
