Kernel methods on Categorical Data

I have a basic understanding of kernel methods and the kernel-trick and the advantages of it, why it is preferred over conventional machine learning algorithms etc. However, I have some trouble using them. The problems I face are as follows, 1. can I use a kernel metric for (dissimilarity) calculation? 2. what steps need to be taken for using a kernel method (say, using the gaussian kernel) on a set of categorical (along with numerical) data. consider the following sample data Age State Day 12 NJ Tue 24 NM Wed 89 CA Thu . . . . . . The question is do I need to explicitly encode the categorical values in order to use it on the gaussian kernel for similarity calculation?
