Is there an NLP corpus that contains common medical terms?

I am trying to use the NLTK library to extract keywords denoting medical symptoms from medical reports of patients. For example, I have a medical report as follows: s:a 33 year old female crystallographer presents with mild spells of vertigo, mild headaches particularly at the back of the head and in the morning x 2 weeks. pt also reports chronic mild occasional lightheadedness. o:Height 160 cm, Weight 53.8 kg, Temperature 37.3 C, Pulse 76, SystolicBP 146, DiastolicBP 93, Respiration 15, Heart = 2/6 systolic murmur at base of heart, Chest = clear to auscultation B/L, no rales or wheezing, Extremities = no edema or clubbing, Heart = normal S1, S2, RRR a:Hypertension p:performed E/M Level 2 (established patient) - Completed, and prescribed Hydrochlorothiazide - 50 mg po qd, and ordered Cholesterol. Here, I would like to find all the keywords or bigrams that represent medical symptoms. In the text above, these keywords are 'mild spells of vertigo', 'mild headaches', 'lightheadedness' etc. For this, I need some kind of collection of terms that represent symptoms, so that I can detect similar terms in the medical reports I have. Is there any NLTK corpus associated with medical terminology? If I find a list of words that denote medical symptoms, I can tokenise and lemmatise the words I have detected in the medical reports and compare them to the words found in the corpus. Thank you.
