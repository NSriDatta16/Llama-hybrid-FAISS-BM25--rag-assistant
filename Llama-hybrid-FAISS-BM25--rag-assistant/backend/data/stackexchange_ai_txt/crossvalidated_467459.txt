Optimize black box multi output function with one of the output as constraint

I have used deep learning to obtain an multi output objective function (or black box). So it's multi input -> multi output. Now I need to optimize one of the outputs to get max output. I managed to get some ans using black box optimization libaries like hyperopt, changing the problem slightly from multi input -> single input. But what if one of my constraints now involves one of the output? So e.g. input i1,i2,i3 -> output o1,o2,o3 I need to get max o1, but at the same time o2 Is there any tool or library which has this capability? Thanks for reading.
