This is your query which does not perform the eager load: context.Agents.Include("Account"); Agent ag = context.Agents.Where(x => x.Login_ID == "2").SingleOrDefault(); If you change the query to place the Include within the expression I believe you will get the results you want. Agent ag = context.Agents .Include("Account") .Where(x => x.Login_ID == "2").SingleOrDefault(); In my testing, and I have looked at the resulting generated SQL, the first expression does not join in the related table. Your Include is ignored because it is not part of the query expression.
