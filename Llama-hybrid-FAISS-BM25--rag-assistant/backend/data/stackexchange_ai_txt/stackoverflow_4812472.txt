I use xml IFF i need a human readable (for certain definitions of readable), hierarchical, verifiably (schema/relax), interoperable( from app to app or even serialized objects) storage format. I also use it when the goal is to allow 3rd party tools to transform the data into other presentations (xsl->docbook,xhtml, etc). If you need a private/internal data format, xml is about as overkill as you can get.
