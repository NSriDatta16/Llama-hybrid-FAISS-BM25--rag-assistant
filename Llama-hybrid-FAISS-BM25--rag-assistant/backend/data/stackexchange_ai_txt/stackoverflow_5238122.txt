Yeah, there's a hard way, a simple and and even simpler way to do this with Linq-to-XML. Note that I am not using the Open XML SDK - I'm just using VB.NET with XML Literals and System.IO.Packaging. You can certainly do this in a more complex manner using the SDK, C#, etc. - depends on what your environment/preferences are. The hard way : Go through every paragraph, and not only pull the text, but also pull all the formatting (bold, bullet points, etc.) The simple way : Go through every text entry and just pull the text, no formatting. The even simpler way : Go to each slide and just pull all text. Here's how you would do #2 (the simple way): Imports System.IO Imports System.IO.Packaging 'Add reference to WindowsBase for this Imports Imports Imports Module Module1 Public Const documentRelationshipType As String = "http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/officeDocument" Sub Main() Dim slide, document As XElement Dim pptPackage As Package = Nothing Dim slidePart, documentPart As PackagePart Dim filePath As String = "C:\Users\Todd\Desktop\yourpresentation.pptx" pptPackage = Package.Open(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite) Using pptPackage Dim documentRelationship As PackageRelationship = pptPackage.GetRelationshipsByType(documentRelationshipType).FirstOrDefault Dim documentUri As Uri = PackUriHelper.ResolvePartUri(New Uri("/", UriKind.Relative), documentRelationship.TargetUri) documentPart = pptPackage.GetPart(documentUri) document = XElement.Load(New StreamReader(documentPart.GetStream)) Dim slideList = From e In document. . For i = 0 To slideList.Count - 1 Dim slideReference As String = slideList(i).@r:id.ToString slidePart = pptPackage.GetPart(PackUriHelper.ResolvePartUri(documentPart.Uri, documentPart.GetRelationship(slideReference).TargetUri)) slide = XElement.Load(New StreamReader(slidePart.GetStream)) Dim rawText = From e In slide... For Each t In rawText Console.WriteLine(t.Value) Next Next End Using Console.ReadLine() End Sub End Module
