Say you have $n$ data points (data of the student academic history) and you want to be able to predict whether they continue studying advanced math in college as you suggest. In this case, a good choice of model would be simple logistic regression. You would encode the response (in this case whether or not they continued in advanced math) as $Y_i = I(A)$ where we let $A$ be the event of continued advanced study in college. So far, you mentioned you would include two groups as predictive features in the model. This would also be binary encoded, since they are categorical variables (being in group A or group B). Then, $$ \pi_i=P(Y_i=1) = \frac{exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1I_{GA})}{1 + exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1I_{GA})} $$ where we let $GA$ denote membership to group A. You could do further research from here on these methods.
