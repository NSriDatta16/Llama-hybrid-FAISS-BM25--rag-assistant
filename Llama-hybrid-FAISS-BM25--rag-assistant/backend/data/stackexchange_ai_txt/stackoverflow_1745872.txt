php session id and ajax, javascript

It has come to my attention that my website is not working correctly under many versions of Internet Explorer. After looking around everywhere, I did a "cookie" test ( http://www.rgagnon.com/jsdetails/js-0092.html ), and realized that cookies are not working when I use any version of IE, but works fine with Chrome, Firefox, Safari ... It seems that when cookies are not working, then my session variables keep disappearing. I use php session. Isn't PHP supposed to deal with that problem automatically? I do use some javascript window.location, and some ajax calls (phplivex). Could it be because of that? Does it not append the phpsessionid at the end of all urls no matter what?
