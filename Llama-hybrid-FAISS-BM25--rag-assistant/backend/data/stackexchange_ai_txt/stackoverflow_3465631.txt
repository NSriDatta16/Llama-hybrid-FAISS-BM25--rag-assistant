AppleScript Droplet on DMG not working

Hey I have the following AppleScript saved as a Droplet. It is saved on a DMG file like this one http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1839051/TestDMG.dmg The Problem is, while some can drag the template onto the Droplet and have it working, when I try to drag the template onto the droplet the crossed-out circle-symbol shows up indicating that this action is not possible. Nothing happens, the file is not copied. Does anyone have any idea why I have this problem and how it can be fixed? Thanks in advance guy. on open thefiles set outputFolder to (path to application support folder from user domain as text) & "iWork:Pages:Templates:My Templates:" do shell script "/bin/mkdir -p " & quoted form of POSIX path of outputFolder tell application "Finder" duplicate thefiles to outputFolder end tell end open
