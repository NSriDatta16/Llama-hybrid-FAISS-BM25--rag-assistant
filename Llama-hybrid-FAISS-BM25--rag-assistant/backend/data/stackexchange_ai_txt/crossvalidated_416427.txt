Since you are modelling the proportion of damage to a building, the data must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. This is troubling because the go to models for this sort of data (namely, logistic regression) usually operates with an integer number of trials from which the proportion was derived. The other option is to use a beta likelihood, but since your data can and do achieve either 0 and 1, then you have to use a ZOIB Model . ZOIB stands for: Zero One Inflated Beta. You can fit these very easily with brms . Also, since you specify that your mean should look like an erf function, then you should pass link='probit' to the family argument. here is a small simulation example I just cooked up. library(brms) #Simulate some data set.seed(0) x = sample(1:50,200, replace = T) a = -12 b = 4 eta = a+ b*log(x) p = pnorm(eta) y = rbeta(length(p), 20*p, 20*(1-p)) model.data = data.frame(x = x, y = y) #The model model = brm(y~log(x), data = model.data, family = zero_one_inflated_beta(link = 'probit')) marginal_effects(model) The mean of this model is a normal cdf (aka the erf function), which depends on the linear predictor of the form $\beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(x)$ . This is equivalent to the linear predictor you provide, and it is easy to show with application of log rules and some algebra. Also note that the ZOIB model has many more knobs to tune/learn than what I have shown in this small example. I don't have a wealth of experience with these models myself, so I can't point you in the best direction for your application as of now. This should maintain the overall structure of your model while solving the issue you have with the credible intervals going outside the support of the data. At least, I think. I will let much smarter members of the community let me know if I have made a gross misstep.
