You will probably split text into words, and than use these words as keys to your "index". Each word will contain timestamp ordered column family with list of IDs to your articles, messages etc. So you can only perform simple searches over keys (words). When searching more than one word, use intersection over these column families. This is very simple approach, if you need more complex queries look at Lucandra - http://github.com/tjake/Lucandra - Lucandra is a fulltext search engine with Cassandra as backend storage.
