Where is the VGG in Cartoongan?

When I read through the paper of Cartoongan [CartoonGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Photo Cartoonization], I was so confused about where is vgg located in the entire network. Based on the paper about GAN [Generative Adversarial Nets], I could not see anywhere that vgg exists in the network. I feel that I couldn't see a clear picture of the entire construction of Cartoongan. I know how GAN is constructed with a generator and discriminator, but Cartoongan no. If someone can help, I appreciated it.
