Usually fractions are expressed as $0.45 or Â£0.12. Using number_format() in PHP can help you format the values any way you like. There is also money_format() that takes into account the locale settings to try and figure out how to display currency. If you were to use cents, most currencies have different names for these as well as different formatting. So the easiest and safest way to use currencies is to take the currency code/name and keep all of the values in the same form. Also make no mistake here, formatting the currency symbol is also very different in different countries. The symbol can be placed to the left or right, with or without a space and it can be one or several letters or symbols. Therefore it makes sense to use functions like money_format() if possible to take away a lot of the logic involved. If you want to know how others handle it, take a look at some of the e-commerce platforms, such as Magento, Prestashop, Zencart, osCommerce etc. These also have libraries and functions to deal with currency display, and sometimes currency conversion as well.
