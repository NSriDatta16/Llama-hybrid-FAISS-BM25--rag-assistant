Overfitting SVM with Gaussian Kernel

It seems that I'm having a bit of an overfitting problem. I've tried playing around a lot with my SVM (rather, MATLAB's fitcsvm ), and I'm not sure how to fix it. From my knowledge, Gaussian kernels have two basic parameters: sigma ('KernelScale' in MATLAB) and C (~1/'BoxConstrant' in MATLAB). I've tried to optimize these with no avail. My training sets are EEG signals that are 125 indices long, and my training size is about 2000 observations. I'm doing multiclass classification, with three classes in all, each with about equal in size. I've tried to optimize using fminsearch to minimize the 10-fold cross validation loss of my SVM, starting at various initial conditions. For example, right now my [BoxConstraint, KernelScale] are in "z" in the following code, which creates a grid from 10^-3 to 10^3. y = logspace(-3,3,6); meshgrid(y); [xx,yy] = meshgrid(y); z = [xx(:),yy(:)]; All of these values result in my k-fold losses in the three SVM models created for my multiclass classification: 0.3318 0.2724 0.3959 I have also had larger BoxConstraints, to no avail. For one of my SVM models, for example: |-------------|---------------|-----------| | KernelScale | BoxConstraint | KfoldLoss | | 1.001001 | 1.001001 | 0.331762 | | 1.001001 | 1.010050 | 0.331762 | | 1.001001 | 1.105171 | 0.331762 | | 1.001001 | 2.718282 | 0.331762 | | 1.001001 | 22026.47 | 0.331762 | | 1.001001 | 2.69E+43 | 0.331762 | Any ideas on what I might be doing wrong? I don't understand how a BoxConstraint of 2.69E+43 (as seen in the last row of the above table) could possibly still have overfitting.
