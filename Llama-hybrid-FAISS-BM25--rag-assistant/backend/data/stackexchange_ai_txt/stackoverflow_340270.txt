Should I use decimal, float or double for this simple math result?

I'm doing some really simple math and saving the result to a MS SQL2008 DB. I'm averaging out the some numbers, which are byte values between 1 5. I wish to record probably 2 decimal places only. I don't care about rounding for the 2nd decimal place (eg. a 1.155 == 1.5 or 1.6 .. i'm not too phased). So .. should i store the average result as a float, decimal or double? When i check what LINQ returns, it can return all three values! Lastly, what would be the relevant SQL datatype field, also. cheers!
