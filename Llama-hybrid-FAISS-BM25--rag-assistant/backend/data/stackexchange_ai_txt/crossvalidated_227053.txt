What is the correct analysis for this type of question? (Conditional Logistic Regression?)

Given the following experiment, what is the correct statistical method to answer the question below: A participant is shown pictures consecutively and is required to respond whether she saw an object or a face after each picture. In each trial (picture presentation) the presented picture (either 1 of 210 individual faces or 1 of 210 individual objects) is superimposed with a certain amount of random noise (between 5% and 98%). The presented picture in each trial is rather small, so each trial has also a background. The background can either be black, a large object or a large face. The individual pictures are matched, meaning each individual picture is presented 3 times in total, 1 time with a black background, 1 time with a large object as background, and 1 time with a large face as background. The amount of random noise superimposed on an individual picture is kept constant over the 3 different background conditions. The object in the large object background does not change and is not included in one of the 210 individual object pictures presented. Similarly, the face in the large face background does not change and is not included in one of the 210 individual face pictures presented. No noise is added to any of the backgrounds. The question I'd like to answer is whether the perception of either faces, objects or both significantly differs between the 3 different background conditions. See question 5 down below for more details on the question I'd like to answer So in the end, I have a data table, looking like this: +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Participant | Category | Pic ID | Noise level | Background | Response* | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 1 | 0 | 1 | 5% | 1 | 0 | | 1 | 0 | 1 | 5% | 2 | 0 | | 1 | 0 | 1 | 5% | 3 | 0 | | | | | | | | | 1 | 0 | 2 | 24% | 1 | 0 | | 1 | 0 | 2 | 24% | 2 | 1 | | 1 | 0 | 2 | 24% | 3 | 0 | | | | | | | | | 1 | 0 | 3 | 80% | 1 | 1 | | 1 | 0 | 3 | 80% | 2 | 0 | | 1 | 0 | 3 | 80% | 3 | 1 | | | | | | | | | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 1 | 1 | 211 | 12% | 1 | 1 | | 1 | 1 | 211 | 12% | 2 | 1 | | 1 | 1 | 211 | 12% | 3 | 1 | | | | | | | | | 1 | 1 | 212 | 20% | 1 | 1 | | 1 | 1 | 212 | 20% | 2 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 212 | 20% | 3 | 1 | | | | | | | | | 1 | 1 | 213 | 75% | 1 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 213 | 75% | 2 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 213 | 75% | 3 | 1 | | | | | | | | | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ where Category is face (0) or object (1) and Response is also face (0) or object (1). The participant's response is the dependent variable. Dichotomous with an underlying continuum. Since every participant is measured in all 3 background conditions, it is a dependent design. Since, for one individual picture, I keep the noise constant over the 3 background conditions, it is somehow paired or matched. First I thought about calculating the biserial correlations and comparing them based on the t-statistic but then I saw logistic regression which seemed to fit my data structure better. But I still feel that the matched samples and dependent design should be incorporated in the analysis somehow. So when I searched for that, Conditional Logistic Regression popped up. The problem is, in Conditional Logistic Regression, the matching is done on the dependent variable. They usually match a 1 in the dependent variable with one or more 0 samples. I didn't match on the dependent variable but on the independent variables (same pictures with same noise level in each background condition). So I don't think I can use Conditional Logistic Regression for this data but I couldn't find anything else that fits. Could someone with more experience in statistics explain to me what the correct way is to answer the above question whether the perception of either faces, objects or both significantly differs between the 3 different background conditions. Thank you for your help. [Experimental procedure] The experiment has 1260 trials in total. Made up of 210 individual faces and 210 individual objects presented 3 times each (one time with each of the 3 different backgrounds). Trial order is randomized with the constraint that in the first, the second and the last block of 420 trials, each background is presented exactly 140 times and each individual object and each individual face is presented exactly once. Most but not all of the different individual faces and objects have a different amount of noise added to them, but the noise for an individual face or object is kept contant over the 3 different background conditions it is presented. [Questions & Answers] 1. How many participants? There are 5 participants in total. 2. Are there any bounds on noise? The noise is discretized in 0.5% steps and in the range [5%, 98%]. The noise is randomly drawn from a noise vector (without replacement) and assigned to a picture. This vector includes a noise distribution (210 entries for each category) that does not include every possible value between 5% and 98% in 0.5% steps but skips some of those values and includes some other values up to 3 times ( answer to question 3 ). This ensures that each participant experiences the same noise levels (though not likely for the same pictures since the noise levels are randomly assigned to the individual pictures at the beginning of the experiment) and that there is a good coverage over the whole range but the focus is on noise levels near the threshold at which (for our setup) the participants can recognize the picture in about 50% of the time. This threshold was found in a preliminary study with other participants using the same pictures presented on a black background. Thus the black background is the default background in this experiment. 3. Is it possible that two or more pictures could be presented with the same level of noise? Yes, this will happen several times and include up to 3 individual pictures for the same level of noise, but not more than 3. 4. Can you confirm you are not interested in the association of noise with the response? This question is hard to answer for me. It is to be expected that the effect of different backgrounds is (if at all present) most prominent if the pictures are harder to see i.e. there is more noise present. So I want to consider the noise in the analysis, but I don't necessarily require the analysis to tell me anything about the association of the noise with the response. I'm only interested in detecting any kind of difference between the background conditions with as much power as possible. At first I wanted to fit 2 psychometric curves for each of the 3 different background conditions (probability to respond with the respective category vs noise level) and then compare the shifts of the psychometric fits to check for differences in the background conditions. However, a bootstrapping analysis revealed that the variance of the fitting procedure is too large to be able to detect shifts in the range I am expecting them to be. So I assume information about the association of noise with the response might decrease the power of other kinds of analyses as well. If this is the case, I don't need it. 5. What do you mean by 'perception' and 'both'. What do you actually want to know? By 'perception of [category]' I don't mean percent correct but '[category] responses'. The assumption I have (and I'd like to test that) is that a face -background would influence a participant to respond with face BUT an object -background would NOT influence a participant to respond with object (this assumption probably doesn't make any sense to you as a reader but that's what I need to test). What I mean with 'both' is that should it be the case that a face-background influences a participant to respond with face AND an object-background influences a participant to respond with object, my assumption that only the face-background has an effect on perception would be false. The different noise levels were included because the chances to influence perception towards one of the categories should be greater when the pictures are harder to see/recognize. So if there is a background dependent effect on perception for any of the categories it is unlikely to show in the e.g. 5% - 20% noise range but rather in the higher noise range. Please let me know if you need further information.
