This could be an interpretation (and possibly exagerration) of the less tolerant side of Fisher's personality (in his role as frequentist advocate in chief). For example see Joan Box's comment of Fisher's personality in http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/6/938.full and note it is quoted by someone who is very well disposed towards Fisher. Fisher rejected Harold Jeffreys' early development of Bayesian statistics, and attacked it vigorously.The book "Interpreting Probability: Controversies and Developments in the Early Twentieth Century", by David Howie (Cambridge University Press, 2002) apparently has coverage of a lot of the back and forth that went on.
