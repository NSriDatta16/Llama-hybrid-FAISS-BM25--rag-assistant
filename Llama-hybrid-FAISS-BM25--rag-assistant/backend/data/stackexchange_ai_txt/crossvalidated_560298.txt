Which statistical test should I use in my problem? (Permutation, Bootstrap, or some other test)

I have a dataset like this: H_0: The Test values are randomly generated. H_A: The Test values are related to the True values. A True: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 A Test: 0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 0.3, 0.1 B True: 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 B Test: 0.9, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.8, 0, 0.2 … I would like to test whether the test values are random or is it related to the True set using a statistical method. My hypothesis is to prove the test values are not random and related to the True set. The True and Test are paired in position, and A, B, C … are having different lengths. I have been suggested to use a permutation test, but I am not sure whether it is correct to use it and how to apply it in my problem. Edit: The test values are probabilities generated by machine learning models, and can be transformed into 0/1 by a threshold of 0.5. A and B themselves are sequence time points of patients, where 0 means normal and 1 means high blood pressure. I would like to test if the model predictions are related to the events or it is just random.
