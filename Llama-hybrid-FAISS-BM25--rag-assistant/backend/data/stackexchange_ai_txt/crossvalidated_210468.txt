Is it correct to compare likelihood ratio indices between logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression models?

In the paper "Including Transfer-Out Behavior in Retention Models: Using the NSLC Enrollment Search Data" ( http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/colleges/files/ST_UofMD_casestudy.pdf ) the author compares two models of student retention: A binary logistic regression (with DV coded as either retained/not retained) A multinomial logistic regression (with DV coded as retained/not retained/transferred out) The author uses two criteria for model comparison (p.14): "Predictive ability" measured by the the log likelihood and model chi-square "Explanatory power" which is a comparison of which IVs were predictive in each model, and the change in probability associated with a change in each IV. Based on the goal of the study I understand why criteria #2 is useful for comparison. However, I am wondering if it is correct to compare likelihood ratios between these two types of models. Additionally, are there any other tests that could accurately compare logistic vs. multinomial models?
