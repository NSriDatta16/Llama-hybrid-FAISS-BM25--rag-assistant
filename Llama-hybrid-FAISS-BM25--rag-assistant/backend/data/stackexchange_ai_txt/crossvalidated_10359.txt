Generating dependent time series from a given distribution?

How can I generate dependent time series from a given marginal distribution? I want to be able to adjust the level of dependence, to influence the predictability of the series, which will be given as input to a Monte Carlo simulation. The dependence parameter can be the correlation, the mutual information, or something along those lines. You may assume the distribution is Bernoulli for discussion purposes. MATLAB code is gratefully accepted.
