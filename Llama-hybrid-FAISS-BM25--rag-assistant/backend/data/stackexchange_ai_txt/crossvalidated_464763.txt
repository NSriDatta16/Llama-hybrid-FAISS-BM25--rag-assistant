With the limited resources online, I tried my best to decipher the related papers and also confirmed with Dr Josse, one of the authors for MissMDA. Bayesian PCA imputation in layman terms: 1. Imputation by random draw from posterior distribution given current parameters in dataset 2. Draw from recalculated posterior distribution by complete dataset from set 1, given PCA applied on dataset from set 1 FAMD in layman terms: 1. Missing values imputed with initial values such as mean of variable for continuous variables and proportion of category for each category 2. Perform FAMD on complete dataset 3. Impute missing values with reconstruction formula to compute a fitted matrix. Missing values will be replaced by fitted values 4. Repeat until convergence Hope it helps someone out there! :) Related research papers: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.4797.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299498837_missMDA_A_Package_for_Handling_Missing_Values_in_Multivariate_Data_Analysis https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missMDA/missMDA.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5747.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1549-bayesian-pca.pdf
