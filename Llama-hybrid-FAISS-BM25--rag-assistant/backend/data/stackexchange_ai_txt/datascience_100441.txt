NLP techniques for converting from a direct speech to a reported speech

Any idea of some NLP techniques to transform a direct speech to a reported speech ? Example converting : "I'm learning NLP" said a user to : a user said he's learning NLP. I thought about paraphrasing but not sure.. Thank you!
