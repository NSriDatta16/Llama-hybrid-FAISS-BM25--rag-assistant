Labeling KPCA in R

The function $\texttt{biplot}$ in R is very useful for creating visualizations when performing PCA. However, when performing kernel PCA in R, I cannot find a way to label the loadings on the graph. Here is an example below. The loading vectors are clearly labeld. In KPCA, I get an output that looks something like this. As you can see, there are no labels whatsoever on the graph. Is there a way to add labels? I am using $\texttt{plot(kpc@pvc)}$ to plot the data. Thanks!
