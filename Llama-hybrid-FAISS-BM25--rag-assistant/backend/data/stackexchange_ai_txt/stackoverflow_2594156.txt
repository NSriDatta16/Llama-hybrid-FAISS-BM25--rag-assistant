Here are a few suggestions/corrections: Your second for loop should look like this: for i = plottedloops This is because plottedloops is already an array, and you want i to take on each sequential value in the array for each pass through the loop. For example, a common form for a for loop is: for i = 1:someScalarValue Where the term 1:someScalarValue creates an array for you. It looks like you are wanting to plot something in a figure window, then save it with save2word , then plot something else, then save that, etc. Therefore, I suggest creating your figure window outside your for loops, and simply replotting the window contents within the loop. If you move these two lines outside your loops: scrsz = get(0,'ScreenSize'); %left, bottom, width height figure('Name', 'Geometry at each loop','NumberTitle','off',... 'OuterPosition',[scrsz(1) scrsz(2) 700 700]); Then you should only have one figure at a time open.
