how to adjust padding between paragraphs in xml data using action script 3..?

Its me again come up with another question, how to adjust padding between each paragraphs in AS3..? Actually I'll show you an example that I've coded now. style.setStyle(".readmore", {fontWeight:"normal", color:"#6184b7", fontSize:11}); style.setStyle("body", {fontStyle:"italic"}); like the code above I want to set a 5px padding-bottom for tag, now it is 10px default. Is that possible..? If yes how to write that single line code..? Thanks in advance! Paul
