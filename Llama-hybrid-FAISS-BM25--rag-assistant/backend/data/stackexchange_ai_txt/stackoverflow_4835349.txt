Best practices to insert time/time stamp in mysql

I've had some trouble choosing an efficient way to insert a time in mysql database. I know mysql has its own timestamp system but it is not what I'm looking for. I currently use date("Y-m-d H:i:s", time()); and it gets the job done. But I would like to know what the standard is or what the best practices are to insert time that make it easier for retrieval later . Thanks. ps. I've searched the site for any dupe posts but I could not find any, if you think this is a dupe feel free to close .
