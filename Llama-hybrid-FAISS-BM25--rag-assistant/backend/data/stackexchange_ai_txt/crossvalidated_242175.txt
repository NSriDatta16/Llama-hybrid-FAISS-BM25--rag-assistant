Difference between logistic regression and linear regression on aggregated dataset

What's the intuitive difference between logistic regression of $P(Y|X)$ on the dataset X1 X2 Y 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 and a weighted linear regression on X1 X2 Y w 0 0 0 1 1 0 0.5 2 0 1 0.25 4 1 1 1 2 I know they are defined differently , and I feel like the second approach is probably kind of "wrong" philosophically, however for a very large dataset, it could be very beneficial computationally. I'm more asking for a feel of how big of a tradeoff this would make from a practical point of view, and how different the classifiers would be in practice.
