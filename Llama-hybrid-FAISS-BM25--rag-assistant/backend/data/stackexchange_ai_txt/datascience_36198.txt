Text Similarities: which nlp methods to use?

I have data where there is text for each user A visiting a business B. I want to find similarity between each user using their text. Question 1: Which NLP method should I start with? I have tried cosine similarity, I know its a great method but it's very slow in computing similarities. I have thought about extracting important information from text (for example: Term Extraction, I don't want to use LDA) and computing similarities between that information. Question 2: Any suggestions?
