I am not sure i got what you want to do. Perhaps something like this would work, although it is not automatic. I am making the assumption that the last value of each simulation is the MAX value. Put the following formula at cell "I4" =if(B5 = "---------" ; B4 ; "") Pull the cell formula down till the last row of "Floor 1" Calculate the average =average(I:I) . Don't put this type on column I!!! Notes use as many "-" as there are at cell B22 you may want to insert a new column between I and J, in order to average SIM_TIME. The procedure is the same. Only the cells change. You could easily automate this procedure a little bit with macros.
