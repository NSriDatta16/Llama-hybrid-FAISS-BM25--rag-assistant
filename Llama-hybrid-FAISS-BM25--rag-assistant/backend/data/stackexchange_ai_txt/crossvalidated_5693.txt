First of all, your usage of the term "prior probability" seems to be wrong. For any node N with discrete values $n_i$ the probability that a certain value of N occurs a priori is $p(N=n_i)$. If a node has no parents, one is interested in calculate this prob. But if a node has parents P, one is interested in calculating the conditional probability , i.e. the probability that a certain value of N occurs given its parents. This is $p(N=n_i|P)$. Regarding your actual question: How to calculate the conditional probabilities of a child node if the parents are continuous and the child node is a) discrete or b) continuous. I will to explain one approach using a concrete example, but I hope the general idea will be clear though. Consider this network: where subsidy and buys are discrete nodes meanwhile harvest and cost are continuous. a) p(Cost|Subsidy, Harvest) Two options: Discretize Harvest and treat it as discrete => maybe information loss Model a mapping from the current value of harvest to a parameter describing the distribution of Cost. Details to 2.: Let's assume cost can be modeled using a normal distribution. In this case it is common to fix the variance and map the value of Harvest linearly to the mean of gaussian. The parent subsidy (binary) only add the constraint to create a separate distribution for subsidy=true and subsidy=false. Result: $p(Cost=c|Harvest=h,Subsidy=true)=N(\alpha_1 * h + \beta_1,\sigma_1^2)(c)$ $p(Cost=c|Harvest=h,Subsidy=false)=N(\alpha_2 * h + \beta_2,\sigma_2^2)(c)$ for some $\alpha$s and $\beta$s. b) p(Buys|Cost) In this case on need to map the probability of occurrence of certain costs to the probability of Buy=True (p(Buy=False) = 1-p(Buy=True)). (Note that this is the same task as in logistic regression). One approach is if the parent has a normal distribution, to calculate the integral from 0 to x of a standard normal distribution, where x is the z-transformed value of the parent. In our example: $p(Buys=true|Cost=c) = integral(0,\frac{-c+\mu}{\sigma})$ with $\mu$=mean and $\sigma$=standard deviation of the Cost distribution. In this case $-c+\mu$ instead of $\mu-c$, because an observation (knowledge extracted from data !) is, that the lower the cost the more probable is a buy. In the case of a non-binary discrete child-node, one approach is to transform the one multi-value-problem into multiple binary problems.
