I think you can interpret autoencoders as essentially performing kernel PCA, but with an extremely complex kernel. Like, really, stupidly complex. The kinds of things you can accomplish with autoencoders are spectacular. For example, consider BicycleGAN . If kernel PCA is a step above PCA, autoencoders are miles away. If you have an application where PCA makes sense but isn't working out, try kernel PCA. If you have an application where condensing your input into an embedding of some kind would be valuable but PCA is unlikely to be very helpful, use an autoencoder.
