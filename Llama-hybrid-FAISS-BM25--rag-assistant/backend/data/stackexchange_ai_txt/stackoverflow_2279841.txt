View file is useless without the controller to load and displaying it. You must create a controller to receive the form data, process it, then displaying the process result. You can use a form helper to set the form open tags, also the close tags: Without using form helper, you can still write it this way: "> Then add the search method into form controller: function search() { //get form field $search = $this->input->post('search'); // do stuffs here //... } Remember that CI only help you with the basic code organization and provide a helpful library and helper. But you still need to write the algorithm of the process in your site. Don't forget to read the included user guide in the downloaded codeigniter package. You can learn many stuffs from the example in there. Don't hesitate to ask things you don't know here, many member of stackoverflow will help you.
