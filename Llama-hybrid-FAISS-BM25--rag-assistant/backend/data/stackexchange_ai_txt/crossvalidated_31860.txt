"Bayesian" really means "approximate Bayesian". "Fully Bayesian" also means "approximate Bayesian", but with less approximation. Edit : Clarification. The fully Bayesian approach would be, for a given model and data, to calculate the posterior probability using the Bayes rule $$ p(\theta \mid \text{Data}) \propto p(\text{Data} \mid \theta)p(\theta) \>.$$ Except for very simple models, this has too large computational complexity, and approximations are necessary. More accurate approximations, such as using MCMC with Gibbs sampling for all parameters $\theta$, are sometimes called "Fully Bayesian". Less accurate approximations, such as using point estimation for some parameters, cannot be called "Fully Bayesian". Some approximate inference methods are in-between, like Variational Bayes or Expectation Propagation, and they are sometimes (rarely) also called "Fully Bayesian".
