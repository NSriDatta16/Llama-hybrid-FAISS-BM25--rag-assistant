HMM with unknown number of hidden states

The Baum-Welch algorithm can estimate the parameters for a given structure of a HMM. However, how to determine the structure, specifically the number of hidden states? Ideas so far: Trial and error, examination of the quality of fit, then increasing or decreasing the number, adopting the CV. Use RNN, export the values in the memory. Cluster them, e.g. via DBSCAN Thank you for any help/reference.
