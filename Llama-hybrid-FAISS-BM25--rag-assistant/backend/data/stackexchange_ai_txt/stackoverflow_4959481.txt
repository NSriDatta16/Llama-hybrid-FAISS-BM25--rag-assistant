As for database, you can probably use Amazon's RDS service , which currently offers you MySQL and there's plans to add Oracle in the short term. As for the filesystem, that would probably depend on the needs of your application. If it's going to be very data-intensive, you could probably setup a Hadoop filesystem, if it needs only to be distributed, something like AFS could do the trick. If reliability and availability are your top requirements, probably the underlying S3 storage service already offers those attributes to you, so you may even manage to use EBS volumes over the S3 storage.
