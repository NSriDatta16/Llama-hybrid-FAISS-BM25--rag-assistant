Visualizing distributions of start and stop dates/times

I am looking for good ways to visualize the distribution (by group) of durations of events measured by start and stop dates (or times). For example, let's say I am interested in visualizing life spans of two cohorts. # example data -- not intended to be realistic n I have tried something like: ggplot(vets, aes(y=index, yend=index)) + geom_segment( data=vets, aes(x=birth_date, xend=death_date, col=conflict) ) + xlab('Life Span') + ylab(NULL) + theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank()) Which makes either the start date or end date distribution unclear (depending on which one I sort by): And then I tried simplifying the durations to average rectangles, with error bars at the ends: mean_birth And I could combine the approaches by adding error bars to the first plot. What are some good approaches for visualizing this type of data? Are there any well-known examples? edit: removing the R tag since this is not an R programming question. A solution on a bar napkin is helpful.
