You should include the rating field directly in your posts table. It is a question of normalization and you win nothing if you separate that value because there is no functional dependency. In some rare situations you might add such fields as separate tables. For example if you have to add the rating value to an existing table and you are unable to add a new column for whatever reason. Or may be you can gain some performance if the rows are very large and change very infrequent while the rating value changes very frequent. But I would not say that your case falls into neither category; so just keep it in the posts table. I am going to summarize some common situations. Posts ======== PostId Ratings Text ========== RatingId ====> RatingId RatingName Use this if you have a set of possible rating values, such as 'Good', 'Average', and 'Poor' and all posts share this values. RatingValue would be a string identifed by an id. If the rating value is a simple number, just include it in the posts table. That is probably your point. Why include a integer rating value and not a string with a rating name? The difference is as follows. The integer rating should be included because every value is a legal rating. This is not true for the string ratings. They should be moved to a separate table, because only a limited set of strings represent legal ratings. Posts =========== PostId Text RatingValue If you have multiple ratings per post the following is the way to go for a limited set of possible ratings. Posts PostRatings ======== =========== Ratings PostId RatingId RatingName If you have integer ratings you put them back into the post ratings table. You need to add an artifical primary key if you require one because there is no natural primary key. PostRatings Posts ============== ======== [PostRatingId] PostId If you associate a rating with a user and allow only one rating for a given post per user you get a natural primary key again. Posts PostRatings ======== =========== User PostId UserId RatingValue Name
