Likert item results reporting from Likert index

I have a likert scale developed from a pilot survey, an EFA, and Cronbach's alpha. The survey questions are on an agree/disagree 5-point scale. We are reporting the index score - calculated as the average individual-item mean of the 6-item index for each participant, so an average of averages. However, I also want to inform my stakeholders on how to improve their index score. Would the most helpful form of reporting at the individual item-level for the index be: the mean of each individual item, a distribution of responses for each item, a distribution of score groupings to show the percent top-box and the percent bottom-box, a median, a mode? What is the reasoning? Results reporting example image attached.
