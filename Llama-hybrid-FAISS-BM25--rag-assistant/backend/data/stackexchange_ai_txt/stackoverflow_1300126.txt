Microsoft Windows Gadgets * HTA - HTML Applications * Adobe Adobe AIR * Can be done with only HTML/JS but can also can use Flex/Flash Adobe Director Adobe PDF Yahoo Konfabulator Google Google Desktop Gadgets - SDK link on the left Mozilla/Firefox Greasemonkey XUL Runner Appcelerator Titanium What did I miss? Should I also list JScript.NET, managed JScript, Rhino ? note: I've set this up as a community wiki.
