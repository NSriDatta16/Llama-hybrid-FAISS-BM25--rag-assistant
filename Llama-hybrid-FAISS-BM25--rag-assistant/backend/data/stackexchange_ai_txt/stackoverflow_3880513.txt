It's a straight no for attributes... the values are constants baked into the metadata. One option you could use would be to have some sort of templating built into whatever uses the attributes... so you could have a storage location of posts\{GetBlogId()} and call the method at execution time. It's not exactly elegant though... you might want to consider using an interface instead.
