Infinite Variance of Harmonic Mean Estimator of Marginal Likelihood of Data

If y denotes the data and t denotes set of parameters, then the marginal likelihood is Here, is a proper prior, f(y|t) denotes the (conditional) likelihood and m(y) is used to denote the marginal likelihood of data y . The harmonic mean estimator of marginal likelihood is expressed as , where is set of MCMC draws from posterior distribution . This estimator is unstable due to possible occurrence of t with a small likelihood which influences the result because is often not square integrable. Hence the estimator may have infinite variance. [Source : Newton and Raftery (1994), P -21; DiCiccio et al. (1997), P - 905] Question: I am not being able to understand or visualize the situations where may not be square integrable and the estimator may end up in having infinite variance. Can you help me to understand this (may be with an example) ?
