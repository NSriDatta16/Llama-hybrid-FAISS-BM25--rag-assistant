Difference between sequence length and batch size in time series forecasting

I am using Keras for time series forecasting and I am trying to understand the tutorial on the offical site of keras about time series forecasting that you can find here ( https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_weather_forecasting/ ). They use one keras-method called keras.preprocessing.timeseries_dataset_from_array and it has the following parameters (here is a documentation https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array ): dataset_train = keras.preprocessing.timeseries_dataset_from_array( x_train, y_train, sequence_length=sequence_length, sampling_rate=step, batch_size=batch_size, ) So my question is what is the difference between the sequence length and the batch size. I think the sequence is the size of the sliding window (x-features and one target y-value). But what is the batch size? Unfortunately I can't have a look at the output of this method as print(dataset_train) or print(dataset_train.head()) does not show me the data and I do not know any other function how I could have a look at the output of the method. Has anyone of you had expercience with this method or generally with sequences and batches? I'd appreciate every comment.
