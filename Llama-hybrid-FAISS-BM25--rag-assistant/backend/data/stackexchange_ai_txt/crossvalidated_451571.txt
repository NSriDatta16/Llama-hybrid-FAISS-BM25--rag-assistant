I think I found the answer to my question. A friend pointed me towards the paper: Some Generalizations of Poisson Processes . On first sight the "Gamma Count Model" of chapter 2 looks most like what I was looking for. I still have to see how to integrate that into an MCMC software like PyMC3 or Stan. But that's a different matter.
