ASP.NET page content - where does this belong?

I am working on a web application that has a single master page and several content pages. Each page will have a small sidebar to the right of the main content with some brief content. However, that brief content is specific to the page you are on. I can't decide whether to put that on each individual page, or in the master page in a MultiView with some logic in code-behind to specify which view is shown based on which page you are on. Which seems more elegant? I'm still fairly new with ASP.NET and I'm trying to get a good feel for proper architecture, etc.
