Say a professor/instructor is introducing a new concept to his class. He or she probably has a tentative outline for how the day will/should go: introduce a super easy example before to motivate the idea, using the idea that hasn't been explained yet, before the proof, tell how it will be completed (preferably using very few sentences), do proof, justifying every line with tools that have been used before, after proof, reiterate how everything "went" (basically do step 2 again), do another example, using the concept again assign homework problems having them re-prove it, and use the idea. Most instructors get pretty close to something like this. If they can't or don't, it might be for circumstantial reasons, which makes me suspect that t would be difficult to legislate some rule(s) that would improve every university's instructors' performance. For the average student, I think the primary enemy is frustration. Frustration can be useful when it drives a student to work more on a problem; however, it can also push a student away from his/her work. For that reason, I am pretty optimistic on the capacity for educational technology, as well as extracurricular programs. I think the capacity for the number of students to learn statistics "well" can be increased quite a bit if parts of the classroom experience are gamified, if the perceived stakes are lowered, and they spend leisure time working on problems (for example: a summer program that teaches techniques to analyze data and provides students with internships). It seems that often times there will be one or two students that do very well in a statistics class, but these students will also be the ones that are self-driven and prefer to do their assignments by themselves. Explaining this "optimal" behavior is unnecessary, and it probably isn't effective to try to have the other students replicate it. Rather, extra resources that are "fun" should be provided to the others.
