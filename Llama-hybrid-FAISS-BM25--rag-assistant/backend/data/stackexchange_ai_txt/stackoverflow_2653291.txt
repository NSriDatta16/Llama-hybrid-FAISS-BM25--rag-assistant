First of all you're correct that SVN uses a database structure to store (the changes to) your files so you shouldn't expect to see the raw files in the repository folder. Once you've created a repository you almost never need to do anything else in that directory, except for configuration stuff (user authorization for example). All your work should go on in working copy directories. To get the code into your www folder type: cd /var/www/project svn checkout /var/svn/project Now you can edit code in that working directory ( /var/www/project ) as you want. When you want to commit these changes type svm commit -m "Commit message" And the changes will go back into the repository.
