The best way to go is to use a proxy cache (Squid, Varnish) and serve appropriate Cache-Control/Expires headers, along with ETags : see Mark Nottingham's Caching Tutorial for a full description of how caches work and how you can get the most performance out of a caching proxy. Also check out memcached , and try to cache your database queries (or better yet, pre-rendered page fragments) in there.
