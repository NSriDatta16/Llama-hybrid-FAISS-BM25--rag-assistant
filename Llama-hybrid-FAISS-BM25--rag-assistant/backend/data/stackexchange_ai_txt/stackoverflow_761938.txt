I would suggest investing your time in learning Microsoft SQL Server itself, Data Access Application Block from Enterprise Library and ADO.NET Entity Framework . Entry point for learning SQL Server is here -> SQL Server Developer Center Entry point for learning ADO.NET is here -> Learning ADO.NET at MSDN First of all, in order to gain a good understanding of what ADO.NET is, check the links below: ADO.NET at Wikipedia ADO.NET Entity Framework at Wikipedia Learn how to write direct queries in C# to SQL Server without using any frameworks and ORM tools, then proceed to learning more advanced technologies in ADO.NET family. See also : Data Access Application Block at MSDN The ADO.NET Entity Framework Overview at MSDN Learn ADO.NET Entity Framework ("How Do I" videos and more) Videos, Screencasts, Tutorials at ASP.NET Microsoft SQL Server 2008: ADO.NET Entity Framework You may also want to download LINQPad , which is perfect tool for playing with LINQ. Also I suggest subscribing to ADO.NET related RSS feeds : ADO.NET Team Blog at MSDN Also check existing open source projects at CodePlex.com which use these technologies and digg into their source codes. Great books on the subject for you: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 T-SQL Fundamentals by Itzik Ben-gan (Oct, 2008) Programming Entity Framework by Julia Lerman (Feb, 2009) Murach's ADO.NET 3.5, LINQ, and the Entity Framework by Anne Boehm (Mar, 2009)
