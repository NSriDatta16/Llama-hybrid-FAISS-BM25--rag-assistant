If I understand your question correction, you are trying to determine the type of web server that is serving your files, correct? If so, use a tool like Fiddler (a stand-alone freeware app) or FireBug (free plug-in for FireFox) to view the HTTP responses coming from the server. In most cases you will see an HTTP header called "Server" that contains a description of the server being used. For example (from cnn.com): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 04 Apr 2011 04:24:46 GMT Expires: Mon, 04 Apr 2011 05:21:59 GMT Last-Modified: Fri, 29 Oct 2010 13:42:35 GMT Cache-Control: max-age=3600 Content-Type: application/x-javascript Accept-Ranges: bytes **Server: Apache** Content-Length: 1907 ...or for another example, from brinkster.com: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 04 Apr 2011 04:28:02 GMT **Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0** Set-Cookie: BrinksterM1=2; HttpOnly X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Cache-Control: private Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 44943 You may or may not get specific versions, etc. of the server--it depends on what information the server provides--but it would be a very quick, free way way to check and would probably be the first step I would take.
