Git and ssh authorizating

I can't login to github with generated ssh-keys. I've followed this manual: http://help.github.com/linux-key-setup but at step: ssh git@github.com I get: Agent admitted failure to sign using the key. Permission denied (publickey). What's wroing? And, of course, I'm adding my own user email. Tried dsa-key, the same thing.
