I have been thinking over the same question in my head for the past few weeks. I don't have a good answer yet sorry. I know for certain that averaging the WRs is not correct. For example, consider a theoretical character with a 100% WR (broken, I know!). Regardless of the other characters picked in the game, they always win. If we have a team of 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%, and our 100% character, on average we get 60% WR. But this does not logically fit with the fact that the character we described is guaranteed to win! So there must be a more fitting statistical method. I haven't come up with a good method yet sorry. In my thinking, it's clear that more weighting needs to be given to characters who are further from a 50% WR: i.e. a character with a 15% WR will make their team MUCH more likely to lose, even if the "average" WR of the team is 43%!! It's probably best to focus on a formula that produces an accurate average for one team (against any given five characters in the second team) before then making a more complex formula for comparing two teams' individual WRs. I somehow wish I'd paid more attention to Statistics in school! Best of luck, R.
