how to add content to the right structural block in magento

how do i manage which blocks go inside the right structural block. ie with getChildHtml('right') ?> i want to add some custom code that will go on all pages that use the "right" structural block i know i can over the individual elements but i would prefer it is the elements i don't use don't get called.
