Reduce File Size Upload for Azure

I Have a hosted service on Azure, every time I want to put the package (cspkg & cscfg files) it always take so long. My cspkg file is 18 MB. Is there any better way to do the upload? my thought is to put the images, style, etc in Storage on Azure and pointing my web app image references (src) to the storage account, so I don't have to include those files in cspkg, or something like that. It is just too much if I only have to modify a single line of code and but have to wait almost 30 min for the upload to be completed. thx
