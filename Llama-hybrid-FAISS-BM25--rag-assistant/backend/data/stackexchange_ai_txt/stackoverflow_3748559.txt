Clojure: creating new instance from String class name

In Clojure, given a class name as a string, I need to create a new instance of the class. In other words, how would I implement new-instance-from-class-name in (def my-class-name "org.myorg.pkg.Foo") ; calls constructor of org.myorg.pkg.Foo with arguments 1, 2 and 3 (new-instance-from-class-name my-class-name 1 2 3) I am looking for a solution more elegant than calling the Java newInstance method on a constructor from the class using eval, load-string, ... In practice, I will be using it on classes created using defrecord. So if there is any special syntax for that scenario, I would be quite interested.
