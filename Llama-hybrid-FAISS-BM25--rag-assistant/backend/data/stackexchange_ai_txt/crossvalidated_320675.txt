theoretical basis for logistic regression

Sorry if this is obvious but why does it seem that some papers/studies (usually in economics discipline) use utility theory as a basis for discrete choice models while others (often social science) do not? If what is being modelled is a binary choice, is a specification of the reasons why this choice is being made (as in, to maximise utility) and an accompanying utility model necessary? It just seems some use it and some don't, even when what is being modelled is essentially the same thing. Thanks
