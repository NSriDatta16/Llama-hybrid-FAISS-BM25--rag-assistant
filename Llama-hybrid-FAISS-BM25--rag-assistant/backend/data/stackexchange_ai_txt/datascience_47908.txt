Plotting ROC curve in cross validation using Matlab perfcurve

I have the following code for a binary classifying using SVM, and 10 cross-validation, k=10; cp = classperf(lables); cvFolds = crossvalind('Kfold', lables, k); for i = 1:k testIdx = (cvFolds == i); %# get indices of test instances trainIdx = ~testIdx; %# get indices training instances svmModel = fitcsvm(data_features(trainIdx,:), lables(trainIdx), 'Standardize',true,'KernelFunction','RBF','KernelScale','auto'); pred = predict(svmModel, data_features(testIdx,:)); cp = classperf(cp, pred, testIdx); end acc= cp.CorrectRate; conf= cp.CountingMatrix; I want to Plot the ROC curve using the perfcurve function in Matlab, However, the input 'score' changes each fold and can't be used outside the k-fold loop. [X,Y] = perfcurve(labels,scores,posclass) Any suggestion on how to plot a ROC in such case?
