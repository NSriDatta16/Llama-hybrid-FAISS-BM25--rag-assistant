glGetError hangs for several seconds

I am developing an OpenGL application and I am seeing some strange things happen. The machine I am testing with is equipped with an NVidia Quadro FX 4600 and it is running RHEL WS 4.3 x86_64 (kernel 2.6.9-34.ELsmp). I've stepped through the application with a debugger and I've noticed that it is hanging on OpenGL calls that are receiving information from the OpenGL API: i.e. - glGetError, glIsEnabled, etc. Each time it hangs up, the system is unresponsive for 3-4 seconds. Another thing that is interesting is that if this same code is run on RHEL 4.5 (Kernel 2.6.9-67.ELsmp), it runs completely fine. The same code also runs perfectly on Windows XP. All machines are using the exact same hardware: PNY nVidia Quadro FX4600 768mb PCI Express Dual Intel Xeon DP Quad Core E5345 2.33hz 4096 MB 667 MHz Fully Buffered DDR2 Super Micro X7DAL-E Intel 5000X Chipset Dual Xeon Motherboard Enermax Liberty 620 watt Power Supply I have upgraded to the latest 64bit drivers: Version 177.82, Release Date: Nov 12, 2008 and the result is the exact same. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing the system to hang on these OpenGL calls?
