I found a few more benchmarks with the help of reddit : https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks : feedforward and convolution layers in many different libraries. ( overview ) https://github.com/DeepMark/deepmark : LSTM and CNN, torch only so far. https://github.com/baidu-research/DeepBench : "DeepBench attempts to answer the question, "Which hardware provides the best performance on the basic operations used for training deep neural networks?" (another page on it: https://svail.github.io/DeepBench )
