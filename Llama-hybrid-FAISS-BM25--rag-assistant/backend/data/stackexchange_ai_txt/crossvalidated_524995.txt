How to interpret "true value" being outside of the 90% confidence interval a certain percentage of the time for a bayesian regression model

I have developed a bayesian regression model that predicts a mu and sigma of a continuous variable. Lets say the model was trained on 10,000 samples, and validated on 1000 unseen test samples. Afterwards, I calculated for each of the 1000 predicted samples if the 90% confidence interval (calculated using the predicted mu and sigma for each sample) contained the "true" test value. Here are hypothetical results for three variables: Variable #1: 90% CI contains true test value 80% of the time (800 out of the 1000 test samples). Variable #2: 90% CI contains true test value 60% of the time (600 out of the 1000 test samples). Variable #3: 90% CI contains true test value 95% of the time (950 out of the 1000 test samples). Can someone help me understand how to interpret these results? How can I explain my confidence/uncertainty in the model in regards to the three variables?
