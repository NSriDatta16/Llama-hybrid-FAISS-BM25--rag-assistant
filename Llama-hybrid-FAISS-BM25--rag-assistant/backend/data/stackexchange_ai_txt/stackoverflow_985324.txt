I am currently using OmniGraffle for both sketching and documentation (combined with paper and pencil of course). It is quite elegant, fast and makes it easy to produce good looking documentation. The major drawback is that it is not connected to the code at all, which makes refactoring a bit harder, but that goes for many of the tools right? It not free either, although quite cheap for a tool with it's maturity and strength.
