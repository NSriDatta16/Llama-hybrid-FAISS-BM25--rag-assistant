If the population mean and variance exist ($\mu$ and $\sigma^2$), then under random sampling of the population: the expected value of the sample mean is $\mu$ and the expected value of the Bessel-corrected sample variance is $\sigma^2$ (i.e. the version with the $n-1$ denominator), as long as $n$ is at least $2$. These results don't depend on $n$. However, if you're asking about the sampling distribution of the sample mean of sample means and the sample means of sample variances (where you take $m$ samples of size $n$) then those are sample averages of sampling statistics and those second-stage averages will of course have their variance affected by sample size.
