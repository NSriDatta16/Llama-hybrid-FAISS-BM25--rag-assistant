Is there a way to keep a DataGridView row selected when the user clicks on a cell in another row?

The DataGridView control allows you to click the row headers and select the rows (the whole row is highlighted), or use the mouse and click and drag to select multiple rows, etc. to select all of them. Anyway, I need the rows to stay selected if the user decides to click on a cell somewhere in the DataGridView . So, if the user clicks on a cell in one of the selected rows, the selected rows should stay highlighted. If the user clicks a cell in a different, unselected row, all the currently selected cells should stay highlighted. As a matter of fact, I don't want the row selection to change at all unless they use the row headers. Is this something that's easy to configure, or am I in for a few days of hacking?
