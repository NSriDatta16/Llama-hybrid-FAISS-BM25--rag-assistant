It depends on how similarity is defined. If similarity is defined as human-defined semantics, then a synset (i.e., synonym set) is most appropriate. If similarity is defined as frequent co-occurrence, then word embeddings are most appropriate. Even within semantic similarity , there are many approaches beyond synsets. One advantage of word embeddings over synsets is the ability to automatically find similarity with multi-word term vocabulary. For example, the common word analogy - Man is to king as woman is to queen .
