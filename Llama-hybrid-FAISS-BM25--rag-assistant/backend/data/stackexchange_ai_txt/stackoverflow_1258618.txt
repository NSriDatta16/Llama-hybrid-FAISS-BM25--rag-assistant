The AudioUnit plugins in both Garage Band and Logic are exclusive to those programs and can't be used in other hosts, as you had suspected. However, there are plenty of great third-party plugins out there which you could use to achieve the same effect... just do a search over at the KVR Audio plugin database . You might be able to find a nice freeware plugin that does what you want, or you could possibly cut a deal with a developer to redistribute a plugin with your app. Also, you should keep in mind that while there are plenty of vocal processing plugins out there, you can also brew your own with an effect chain built from several other effects. For instance, you can generally get pretty good results by chaining up a noise reducer, EQ, stereo enhancer, reverb, and compressor. There are some more suggestions in this nice harmony central article , or just google for "studio vocal processing" (or some variation thereof).
