I can log-transform it to be normally distributed, and then perform a t-test and get confidence intervals (CI). But how do I interpret the results of the t-test and the CIs? If you want to compare 2 groups, the jump to log transformation to ensure normality isn't necessary and might end up confusing things. Think first about what aspect of the 2 groups is most important to compare. Here's a simple data set close to what you describe: set.seed(101) grp1 Simple comparison If what you care about is whether randomly sampled members of one group are likely to have greater values than those randomly sampled from the other group, you can use the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test directly on the untransformed values (or on any monotonic transformation of them): wilcox.test(val~grp,data=grpDF) ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum exact test ## ## data: val by grp ## W = 409, p-value = 0.04023 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 Semi-parametric comparison That non-parametric test doesn't provide a confidence interval (CI). If you want a related CI, try ordinal logistic regression. Frank Harrell explains in Chapter 10 of his course notes that the WMW test can be considered a special case of ordinal regression, as implemented in the orm() function of his rms package . rms::orm(val~grp,data=grpDF) # Logistic (Proportional Odds) Ordinal Regression Model # # rms::orm(formula = val ~ grp, data = grpDF) # # Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. # Ratio Test Indexes Indexes # Obs 68 LR chi2 4.41 R2 0.063 rho 0.251 # Distinct Y 68 d.f. 1 g 0.457 # Median Y 194.0303 Pr(> chi2) 0.0357 gr 1.580 # max |deriv| 8e-07 Score chi2 4.38 |Pr(Y>=median)-0.5| 0.112 # Pr(> chi2) 0.0364 # # Coef S.E. Wald Z Pr(>|Z|) # grp 0.9041 0.4351 2.08 0.0377 Given any outcome value, the coefficient is the log-odds difference between Group 2 and Group 1 of being at least that high. The estimate is assumed to be asymptotically normally distributed, so you can use the standard error to get CI. Generalized linear model If you care about the mean of the values in the original scale, you can model in that scale directly via a Gaussian generalized linear model with a log link as Kjetil Halvorsen suggested in a comment. That models the log of the mean as a function of group membership. glmGrp |t|) ## (Intercept) 5.12880 0.07046 72.788 The intercept is the estimated log of the mean value for the first group and the grp coefficient is the difference from that for the second group. Those methods all avoid the need to start with a transformation. Log-transform, then t-test If you do a log transformation of the values and then do a t-test, you are modeling instead the mean of the log values , or the geometric mean in the original scale. t.test(log(grp1),log(grp2)) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: log(grp1) and log(grp2) ## t = -1.9694, df = 62.558, p-value = 0.05334 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.168314383 0.001239952 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 5.212947 5.296484 How do I interpret this result for my original data? Do I have to transform back the p-value... There's no assurance that the "significance" (p-value) of a test on the geometric mean would represent the "significance" of a test on the arithmetic mean, which seems to be the p-value transformation that you're asking for. How do I back transform it to get the original CI? If you need to work on log-transformed values, it's best to stay in that transformed scale. Sometimes a log-based scale makes a lot of sense, as with Cq values in real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, or with pH values . A simple back transformation of a mean and CI in the log scale, as suggested in another answer, can fail to include the mean on the original scale. For example: set.seed(11) lnDat Back-transforming log-transformed regression coefficients is similarly prone to error. If the original data are log-normally distributed , then the mean of the log-transformed values is the log of the median in the original scale, not the mean. There's no assurance that relationship will hold for other skewed distributions, however. For log-normally distributed data, there are asymptotic formulas for back-transforming CI from the log scale to the original scale when there are large numbers of observations. This page shows the formula for the CI for a mean value, and this paper presents a formula for a likelihood-based test to compare 2 mean values properly, given what the authors call the "Inappropriateness of t-Test Based on Log-Data." But why do that? Decide what type of comparison of the groups makes the most sense for your study. If, on that basis, it should be a comparison of log-transformed values that's OK, but then you should stick with that log-transformed scale.
