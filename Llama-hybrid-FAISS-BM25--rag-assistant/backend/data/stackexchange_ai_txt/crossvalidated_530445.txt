wouldn't every study that measures lifetimes have left truncation? By this I mean every study conducted on lifetimes where individuals were not observed since birth. That's basically correct. But many models don't follow lifetimes since birth. Rather, they consider survival after some other defined reference time. My aim is to create a model for the survival probability for covid-19 patients (Kaplan-Meier), and then try to study which covariates are associated with the hazard function (Cox). In that case, then the reference time would seem best to be taken as the time either of first symptoms or of Covid-19 diagnosis, and survival would be calculated from that reference date . You aren't modeling survival up to a certain age , so the type of left censoring you worry about isn't a problem. Instead, you could include age at first symptoms/diagnosis as a covariate in your model. You model would include some bias in terms of the broad population, in that asymptomatic individuals or those with minimal symptoms and thus never tested for Covid won't be in your data set. Your data on disease severity are left truncated, in that you have no data on disease severity below a certain level. But that's not the outcome you're modeling; it's left truncation of outcome that needs this particular type of attention in survival analysis. Your outcome data, in terms of survival since initial symptom/diagnosis, aren't left censored. You would, however, have to be careful about just what class of patients is covered by your model. Note that a standard Cox survival model might not be best for these data. The assumption is then that all individuals have the same basic shape of survival curve, with relative hazards proportional to values of predictors. Death from this disease might better be evaluated with a cure model if the time to death is of interest, or a simple binary-outcome model otherwise.
