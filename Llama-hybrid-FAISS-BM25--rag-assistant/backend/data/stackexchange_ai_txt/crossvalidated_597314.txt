Can I use data with different temporal scales in a random forest?

I have GPS data on animal movements from 3 populations which record their position every hour. My hypothesis is that the 3 populations have distinct movement characteristics. I think a random forest would be a good way to determine this. My issue is that I can generate metrics on different temporal scales. For instance, I can measure daily displacements but also monthly displacements, both of which would be informative. The random forests I've seen seem to have covariates on the same scale though, so I was wondering if it's possible to combine them into the same model? My data would look something like this though with a lot more covariates and of course I could have multiple daily distance measures: ID daily_dist1 daily_dist2 monthly_dist population bird1 4 4 13 1 bird1 6 5 67 1 bird2 3 6 34 1 bird2 4 7 64 1 bird3 6 3 75 2 bird3 6 2 13 2 bird4 4 2 56 3 bird4 1 5 56 3 Thanks
