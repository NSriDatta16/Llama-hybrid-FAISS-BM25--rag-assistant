How do I separate periodic data from time series data?

I am currently working on a classification task of gym exercises based on accelerometer data. I am trying modularize window extraction so I can train my model based on metrics within a window (which ideally should be one complete motion of a specific exercise). I am quite new to data processing and currently struggling on how to separate periodic data (circled by red) from the rest of the data. Thanks
