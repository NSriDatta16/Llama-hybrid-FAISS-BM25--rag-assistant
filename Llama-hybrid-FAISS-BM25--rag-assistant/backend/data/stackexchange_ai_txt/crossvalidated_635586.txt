Minimal number of features and observations for random forest regression analysis?

Linear regression is a suitable regression method even for small numbers of observations as long as there are enough observations per predictor (with factors 5 to 15 given as rules of thumb) and we have certain ideas of how the predictors "work" (linear or curved fashion, interactions etc.). Random forests promise to work out of the box with no assumptions about linearity or interactions etc. whilst still provide guard over overfitting. Software packages such as ranger promise p-values for inference on variable importance. I am therefore inclined to expand my knowledge on Random Forest. However, in comments on CrossValidated I seem to often find opinions, that a specific sample size within the specific question is to small to use random forests sensibly. I work in medicine, often with sample sizes of 30 or 150 or 500, rarely over 1000. Do random forests make sense in that range? Are there sensibe rules of thumb on what samples sizes are suitable for random forest analysis (be it prediction or inference)? I am obviously aware, that that will depend on the individual circumstances case-by-case but rules such as "have at least 10 observations per predictor in OLS linear regression" are still usefull, even if not "true" for special circumstances.
