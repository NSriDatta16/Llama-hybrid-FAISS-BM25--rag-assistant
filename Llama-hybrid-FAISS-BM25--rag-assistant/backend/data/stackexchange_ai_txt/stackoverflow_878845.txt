The table answer would work. Easily. I can't encourage its use but ease-of-use does have merit. I was going to suggest using the clip: CSS property, but I can't get it to work on my local machine (for some reason, though it renders the example at cssplay.co.uk perfectly). The downside of this is that it probably only works if you define fixed-widths for the containers. I'm sure there must be a way, though. I'll keep looking.
