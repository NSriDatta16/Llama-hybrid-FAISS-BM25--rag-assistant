2500x2500 is not such a large problem. Even without leveraging the sparsity the SVD implementation of scipy.linalg is able to decompose it in less than a minute. See my answer to a related questions for more details. For larger problems you will need to use the sparsity explicitly. The gensim project my help you for middle size problems that fit on a single computer but not in RAM and the mahout implementation is able to deal with sparse matrices that don't even fit on a single hard-drive.
