Testing data in Ruby Arrays

Say I have an array of arrays in Ruby, array = [["bob", 12000, "broke", "ugly"], ["kelly", 50000, "rich", "attractive"]] Each subarray is just a record. What's syntactically the most elegant construct for testing certain elements of each subarray for certain conditions, such as Is the zeroth element in every array a string? Is the second element in every array an integer? Thanks!
