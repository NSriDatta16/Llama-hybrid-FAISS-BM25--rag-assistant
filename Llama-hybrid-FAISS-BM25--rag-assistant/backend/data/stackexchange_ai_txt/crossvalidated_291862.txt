Throughout the literature on transfer learning, there is a number of terminology inconsistencies. Phrases such as transfer learning and domain adaptation are used to refer to similar processes. Domain adaptation is the process of adapting one or more source domains for the means of transferring information to improve the performance of a target learner. The domain adaptation process attempts to alter a source domain in an attempt to bring the distribution of the source closer to that of the target. In the Domain Adaptation setting the source and target domains have different marginal distributions p(X). According to Pan's survey, Transfer Learning is a broader term that can also include the case when there is a difference in the conditional distributions p(Y|X) of the source and target domains. In contrast, Daume discriminates the two terms [1], referring that Domain Adaptation is when p(X) changes between source and target and Transfer learning is when p(Y|X) changes between source and target domains. https://nlpers.blogspot.com/2007/11/domain-adaptation-vs-transfer-learning.html
