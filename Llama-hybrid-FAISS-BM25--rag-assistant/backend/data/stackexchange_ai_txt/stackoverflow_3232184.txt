If you already have code to integrate force and mass to acceleration and velocity, then you just need to calculate the individual part of each of the two elements you're talking about. Keeping it simple, I'd forget about the fin for a moment and just say that anytime the body of your rocket is at an angle to it's velocity, it will generate a linearly increasing side-force and drag. Just play around with the coefficients until it looks and feels how you want. Drag = angle*drag_coefficient*velocity + base_drag SideForce = angle*lift_coefficent*velocity For the rudder, the effect generated is a moment, but unless your game absolutely needs to go into angular dynamics, the simpler thing to do is let the rudder control put in a fixed amount of change to your rocket body angle per time tick in your game.
