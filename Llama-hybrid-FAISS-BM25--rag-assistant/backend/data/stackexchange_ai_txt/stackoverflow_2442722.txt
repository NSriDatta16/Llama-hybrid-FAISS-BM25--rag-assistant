OpenGL "out of memory" on glReadPixels()

I am running into an "out of memory" error from OpenGL on glReadPixels() under low-memory conditions. I am writing a plug-in to a program that has a robust heap mechanism for such situations, but I have no idea whether or how OpenGL could be made to use it for application memory management. The notion that this is even possible came to my attention through this [albeit dated] thread on a similar issue under Mac OS [not X]: http://lists.apple.com/archives/Mac-opengl/2001/Sep/msg00042.html I am using Windows XP, and have seen it on multiple NVidia cards. I am also interested in any work-arounds I might be able to relay to users (the thread mentions "increasing virtual memory"). Thanks, Sean
