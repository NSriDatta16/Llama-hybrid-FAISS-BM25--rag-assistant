You should only return a value if a caller is going to do something with that value. If you want to do "nothing" in an if statement, it's a sign that your logic is wrong. Change your statement to this: if (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) == null) { //Usual script here } This way you don't need to "break" out of your function with the return (not a good practice in this scenario).
