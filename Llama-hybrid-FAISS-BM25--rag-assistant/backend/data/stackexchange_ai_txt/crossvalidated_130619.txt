Yes, HMM is generative model and can predict next character given input sequence. It basically emits next symbol based on its current state and then changes state according to transition probabilities (thats informal but reasonably good description). What you want to achive is called HMM character-level language model. You can also read more about language models, for example neural-network based language models were shown to be particularly powerful . Also, you may want to consider building model that takes into account next know character.
