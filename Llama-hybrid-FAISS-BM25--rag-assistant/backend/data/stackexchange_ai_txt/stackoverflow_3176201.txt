You may be better off counting shake events as each shake will correspond to a foot-strike. Then use the GPS as a means of calibrating the runners average stride length every 10 seconds or so. Over time, you may be able to correlate frequency of foot-strikes and GPS data with the average stride length. I would expect a more tired runner to use a shorter stride and fewer foot-strikes per second.
