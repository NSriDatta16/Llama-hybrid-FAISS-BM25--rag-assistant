You should be able to do that using winelib . Here is an interview with Ulrich Weigand a prominent WINE developer: I managed one to get WineLIB to use a windows dll for VQF playing. Do you forsee people using WineLIB to write applications in Linux that need a closed source windows dll? Sure. IMO that's one of the main features of WineLib: you can use it to link native Windows DLLs into Linux apps. I think there are lots of examples where this could be useful; think of ODBC drivers, video codecs, etc. (That's why I recently added support for executing even 16-bit DLLs inside WineLib apps, because Win95 drivers tend to thunk down to 16-bit ...)
