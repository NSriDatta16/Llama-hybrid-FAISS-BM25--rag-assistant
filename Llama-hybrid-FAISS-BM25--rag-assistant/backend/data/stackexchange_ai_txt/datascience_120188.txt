A stationary point of a function is typically a local minimum or maximum, i.e. the gradient is zero, think of a parabolaâ€™s minimum. A stationary function would be a function that is constant wrt. some partial derivative. So for an objective function for a neural network, the cost or objective function is zero when the minimum is found. I believe that when they refer to a stationary objective function in the paper, they mean a function whose partial derivative with respect to the parameters of the network is constant.
