This is called touch events. more so Swipe touch on the iphone. And here are two examples. Heres a code snippet: You first need to tell the application that touchesBegan. You can find some details on the API for this. Then the delegate methods will be called automatically everytime a user touches the iphone screen. - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if (touch.info & UITouchSwipedRight) { [self changeViewRight]; } else if (touch.info & UITouchSwipeLeft) { [self changeViewLeft]; } return; } check this example: http://devblog.wm-innovations.com/tag/touchesbegan/ Its a really good example. Hope this helps. Let me know if it did a little. Thanks PK
