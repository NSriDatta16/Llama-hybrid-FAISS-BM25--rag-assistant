Best practice in CakePHP for saving data, using models in component

I'm writing a Cake component and it seems to make sense that I use it for saving data rather than doing so in a controller. In the manual it says using models in a component is discouraged, but the other way of doing it would mean I'd be repeating code in the controller. The component basically analyses a load of data from various sources and will then insert data for various models.
