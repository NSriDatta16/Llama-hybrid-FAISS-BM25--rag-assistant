It depends entirely on your release schedule. If all the work currently being checked in periodically is intended for release at once, they can all be checked into one area, like the trunk. If there's some work which will be held back while other, as yet unfinished work, has to go out first, the first code to go out could be committed to trunk, and the next code in it's own branch, OR vice versa. You should find that merging and refreshing branches can be a hassle where things occasionally go wrong. So naturally trying to minimize that would make sense. The overall idea of source control is that everyone can work in one place. Often when you get larger teams, the release schedule is organized by sub-teams and their projects and these have their own branches.
