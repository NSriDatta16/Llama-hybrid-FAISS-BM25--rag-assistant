Model averaging when linear and quadratic effects are modeled in a global model

I am trying to derived estimates of model-averaged parameter effects on a fairly complicated set of models using an information-theoretic approach. I have several models that investigate continuous and categorical variables, interactions of these variables, and I have a global model which includes all of these variables and interactions. My question is, when I am model averaging, I read that the beta estimates for the slope of the effect of a quadratic term are represented by x+x^2. But, I also have a linear model of this same variable (e.g., x=linear time and x+x^2 = quadratic time). My first question is: Do I use both beta estimates for the quadratic model (e.g., x and x^) as part of calculating my model-averaged estimate? Second question is: In my global model, the way I've set up my models (which I assume must be incorrect) I only have a beta estimate for x and x^2 I assume these are to be interpreted as the quadratic term x+x^2). Should I somehow be able to have an extra parameter in the global model, so that I have two estimates for x? An x to represent the linear term by itself, and a different estimate for x that is part of the x+x^2? Thanks for any help you can give to explain this.
