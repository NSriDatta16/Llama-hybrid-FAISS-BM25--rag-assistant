In terms of what they're allowed to do , constructors don't differ all that much from methods. The main conceptual difference between a method and a constructor is its purpose. A constructor brings an object into a valid, usable state, and is called only once, at the beginning. A method changes an object from one valid state to another. (Okay, some methods only retrieve information, they're not required to change the state of an object). Edit: It occurs to me that, particularly for C#, the above explanation might be confusing, as immutable objects aren't exactly uncommon idioms in the language, so a lot of objects the OP will encounter won't have a changeable state. Complex concepts often have one-line explanations that are simple, elegant and wrong.
