There are several ways of doing this. Examples are: Binary classifier Train a separate binary classifier for Known vs Unknown, using supervised learning. The Known data would come from your dataset, and the Unknown dataset be a large set of samples from a diverse dataset like AudioSet et.c Anomaly detector Train an anomaly / out-of-distribution model, using only your dataset (Known) and unsupervised learning. This should be done on the learned representation in your CNN. You can use a Gaussian Mixture Model (e.g. from scikit-learn) as the anomaly model. To verify that it works, and to set hyperparameters such as number of gaussians, anomaly threshold you should use a few samples from another dataset (AudioSet et.c.).
