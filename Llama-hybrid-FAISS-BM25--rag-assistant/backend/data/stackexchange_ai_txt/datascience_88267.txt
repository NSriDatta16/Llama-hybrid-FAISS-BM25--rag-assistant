What is the use of using width/height shift in data augmentation?

I'm not sure to understand the use of augmentation data using width shift and height shift. Say I have limited image data, and I want to create new data using Keras' ImageDataGenerator. To classify between images, I use CNNs. Since CNNs are translation invariant, aren't the translational shifts from keras useless as those shifts will not result in new images per say? (I know new images will be created from the generator, but the CNNs will not learn new features from the pictures, and might instead cause overfitting?)
