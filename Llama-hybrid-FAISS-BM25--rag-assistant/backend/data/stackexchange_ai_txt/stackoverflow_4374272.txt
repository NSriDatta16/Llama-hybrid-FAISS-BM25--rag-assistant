Magento (PHP): Add Product invisble to Cart

I am looking for a way adding a product to cart without display it. Example: New customer order -> welcome letter in the cart, but the customer doesnt see it. The added product cost always 0 â‚¬, so it never changed the shopping cart total. The solution should be changed as few as possible. Any idea? Thank you! (Sorry for my very bad english...)
