Javascript Click/Drag and Select Table rows and columns

I am wondering if anyone knows a java script library that would add a "select" type of functionality as seen in excel/google docs where you can click and select several different parts of a row and/or column. I am looking at adding this functionality to my web application. Does anyone know where of library's preferably in java script that will be able to add this. Thanks in advance
