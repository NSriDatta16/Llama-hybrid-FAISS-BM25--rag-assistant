For that many booleans in a single model you might consider using a single integer and bitwise operations to represent, store and retrieve values. For example: class Model Then some model attribute called flags would be set like this: flags |= HAS_FIREPLACE flags |= (HAS_BASEMENT | HAS_GARAGE) And tested like this: flags & HAS_FIREPLACE flags & (HAS_BASEMENT | HAS_GARAGE) which you could abstract into methods. Should be pretty efficient in time and space as an implementation
