Perceptron trained on time series always predicting the same answer

Using the model from theano's tutorial , I'm training a 3-layers perceptron with log returns over a very large dataset (~55,000 points). The output's layer contains two neurons, one for each of the classes (either the returns are + or - ) in which I am trying to cluster my inputs (returns for the past n days). The machine always predicts the same value, ie the output which has the highest probability over the entire dataset. Has anyone faced a similar problem before? How is this even possible? Inputs: 100d-array of log returns (quasi normally distributed). Target Output: sign of consecutive log return (1 or 0).
