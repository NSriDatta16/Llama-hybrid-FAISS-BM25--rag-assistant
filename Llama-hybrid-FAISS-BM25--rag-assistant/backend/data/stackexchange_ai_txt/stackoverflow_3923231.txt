How to specify exceptions to be thrown by an implementor of an interface?

I'm currently developing a solution and have designed it in a way such that it strongly implements the strategy/provider pattern. As such the solution exposes a number of interfaces and contains default implementations of these interfaces which can be replaced via a DI type methodology. Where the host application uses a number of these interfaces it is expecting to handle certain exceptions that may occur, for example IDataRetriever interface has a method SomeDataType GetData(int timeout); and the host can handle some custom exceptions such as DataRetrievalTimeoutException or NetworkConnectionException . My question is, what is the best way to mark up the interface class such that when a developer implements it they would know that certain exceptions should be thrown and would be handled by the host? At the moment I have just added the exception xml tags to the methods xml comment - does this suffice?
