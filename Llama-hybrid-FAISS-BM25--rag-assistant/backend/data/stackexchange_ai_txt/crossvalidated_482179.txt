If two sample means of $X$ differ significantly and $X$ predicts $Y$, can it be inferred that the samples differ in their $Y$?

In the following model: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon $ $X$ is found to be significantly related to $Y$ . Now, I observe $X$ within two groups. I compare the two means and find that the $X$ values significantly differ between the two groups, on average. Can I conclude that $Y$ is significantly different between the two groups?
