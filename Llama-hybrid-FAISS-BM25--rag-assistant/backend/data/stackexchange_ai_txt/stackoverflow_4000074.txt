System for language versioning of .NET sites or Apps

Many years ago I build a simple system for handling languageversioning of texts in ASP.classic sites. Since then I have not converted or maintained it, and have been using various sub-optimal solutions (and lets face it, the system was probably not as great as I remember it ;-) What do you use for language versioning texts for your sites and apps? I have looked at the following: .NET resource files: No easy way to get external translators to use it. Plus it is to mingled into the .NET controls (and also - "I just don't like it" :o) ResourceBlender (www.resourceblender.com): An excellent solution, but it seems build for some other uses than I have in mind ("bundles" and "elements" in the way they are constructed have no meaning to me). My feature-wishlist consist of: Translation: Being able to export the texts to some format that external translators can edit, and then re-import the data when it comes back from translation. Data source: MS SQL Server, SQL Lite or XML (or some other reasonable array of options, covering both RDBMS and simple file storage) Interface: Full fledged interface for searching, editing etc. Integration in app/site: Very simple way of actually fetching the texts in the target application, or a way of easily implementing it yourself (KISS) Source code readability: The code should remain readable. So text names are preferred to integer IDs. E.g. GetText("intro_headline") instead of GetText(4564) Must not be tied to .NET controls as the resx files, since I also need to use them for e.g. subject and body texts for emails. I can't seem to find anything that matches this, so I'm considering building it myself, but would just like to make sure I haven't missed something. (this is a cross-post from Experts-Exchange, where I did not find a solution).
