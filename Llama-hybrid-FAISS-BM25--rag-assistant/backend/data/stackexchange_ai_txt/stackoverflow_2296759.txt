You should put as much under version control as much you can. Versioning something that wont change has zero cost, realizing later that you can't recover a state you need to is fatal. Storage is very cheap, text files are very small, most SVM-s store deltas which are marginal in size and speed. Agile practices also explicitly include this. Besides source code and project files, consider build, deploy scripts, database schemas and mocks, configurations, documentation(!), test files, dependent libraries, todos, the project's website... Of course sometimes it is difficult to put for example a virtual machine image under version control (binary), regular snapshots might be more applicable for that. But if you ever asks yourself, should I put this under version control, the answer is almost always yes, you should. (Following this practice makes it also easier to make decisions about versioning.)
