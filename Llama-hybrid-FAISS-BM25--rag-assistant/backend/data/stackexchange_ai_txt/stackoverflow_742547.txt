Conditional median in MS Excel

I'm trying to calculate the conditional median of a chart that looks like this: A | B ------- x | 1 x | 1 x | 3 x | y | 4 z | 5 I'm using MS Excel 2007. I am aware of the AVERAGEIF() statement, but there is no equivalent for Median. The main trick is that there are rows with no data - such as the 4th "a" above. In this case, I don't want this row considered at all in the calculations. Googling has suggested the following, but Excel won't accept the formula format (maybe because it's 2007?) =MEDIAN(IF((A:A="x")*(A:A<>"")), B:B) Excel gives an error saying there is something wrong with my formula(something to do with the * in the condition) I had also tried the following, but it counts blank cells as 0's in the calculations: =MEDIAN(IF(A:A = "x", B:B, "") I am aware that those formulas return Excel "arrays", which means one must enter "Ctrl-shift-enter" to get it to work correctly. How can I do a conditional evaluation and not consider blank cells?
