OneHotEncoder Showing error while encoding two columns

I am encoding two columns with index numbers 1 and 2 that is column number 2 and 3, using the following code, however, I am facing an error of invalid syntax : If I am using only 1 in the index value it is ok, please help on this.. how can I encode two columns simultaneously using OneHotEncoder here. from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers = [('encoder', OneHotEncoder(),[1:2])], remainder ='passthrough') X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X)) If I am using the following it is ok but I want to encode the other column as well. from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers = [('encoder', OneHotEncoder(),[1])], remainder ='passthrough') X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
