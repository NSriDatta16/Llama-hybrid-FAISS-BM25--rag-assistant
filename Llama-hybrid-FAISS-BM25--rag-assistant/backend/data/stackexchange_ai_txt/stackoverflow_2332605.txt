The workaround you look for is going to end with you writing the equivilant of swfobject, except it won't be as well tested or perform as well. Why reinvent the wheel when there is a perfectly good existing solution, especially when it is only 10KB minified? if you are deadset on not adding another http request, why not slipstream the swfobject code into the page or into another js file. I never use anything other than swfobject for embedding flash.
