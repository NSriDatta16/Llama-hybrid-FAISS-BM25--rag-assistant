Every time you generate an interval, it's a Bernoulli trial. Either the interval includes the true mean or it doesn't; the trials are independent and the ( a priori ) probability is constant. So when you generate 800 such intervals, you conduct 800 Bernoulli trials with an unknown population proportion, $p$ (being the actual coverage probability of a randomly selected interval). Could you estimate $p$ from the data? Can you give an interval for $p$ from the data?
