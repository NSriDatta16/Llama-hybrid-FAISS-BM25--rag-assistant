@robertmyers CSS contains the aural media type specifically to control the "rendering" of things when screen readers are doing their work. So, for you example, you would only set it as visible for the aural media type. @Ross I'm quite aware that the screen reader doesn't actually read the screen, but you would think that to work well, it would have to build a model of what a person with sight would see, otherwise, it seems like it would do a really poor job of getting across to the user what's actually on the page. Also , putting things in the order you would read them doesn't really work, as a sighted person would scan the page quickly and read the section they want to read. Do you put the contents first so that the user has to listen to them every time, or do you put them at the end so that they can get to the content first? Also, putting content in order would mean some tricky CSS to get things positioned where you wanted them to be for sighted users. It seems to me that most web pages contain very similar construction, and that it should be possible to, in many cases, pick out where the repeated headers and side columns are. When viewing many subsequent pages on the same site with the same formatting, it should be easy to figure out which sections are navigation, and which are content. Doing this, the screen reader could completely skip the navigation sections, and move right onto the content, as most sighted users would do. I realize there are limitations, and that doing these types of things wouldn't be easy. However, I feel like as far as screen readers go, we only did the bare minimum and left it at that.
