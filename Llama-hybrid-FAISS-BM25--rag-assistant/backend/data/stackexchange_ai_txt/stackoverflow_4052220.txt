Pull data from one couchdb doc via ids in another (Python)

I have two databases in CouchDB - DB1's documents are user data - name, email address, username, password but within one field that I store a list of the ID's saved in DB2 where user projects are saved (containing a username field and some Textfields. Example DB1 Document (Users) { "_id": "bobsmith1000", "_rev": "83-1e00173cac0e736c9988d3addac403de", "first_name": "Bob", "password": "$2a$12$sdZUkkyDnDePQFNarTTgyuUZS6DL13JvBk/k9iUa5jh08gWAS5hpm", "second_name": "Smith", "urls": null, "email": "bob@smith.com", "projects": [ "ee5ccf56da22121fd71d892dbe051746", "ee5ccf56da22121fd71d892dbe0526bb", "ee5ccf56da22121fd71d892dbe053433", "ee5ccf56da22121fd71d892dbe056c71", "ee5ccf56da22121fd71d892dbe0579c3", "ee5ccf56da22121fd71d892dbe05930d" ] } Example DB2 Document (Projects) { "_id": "ee5ccf56da22121fd71d892dbe05930d", "_rev": "1-c923fbe9de82318980c7778c4c089321", "url": "http://harkmastering.s3.amazonaws.com/testprojects/testfolder.zip", "username": "bobsmith1000", "time": "2010-10-29 07:13:47.377085", "file_size": "5.2 MB" } I am trying to write a view in Python (using the Flask web framework and Python Couchdb library) that will check db1, grab all the project ids, and then go to db2 and in a batch way pull out the url, time, filesize for each document with matching ids so I can can place that data in a table. I only began programming earlier this year and this involves techniques that I can only imagine. Can anyone help me find a solution? Kind thanks
