Moving pictureBox in panel

I have a project in C#, WindowsForms and I created a panel that contains a pictureBox that is much bigger than his parent. I turned panel.AutoScroll to true and what I want to do is dragging this pictureBox in panel instead of catching a scroll and moving it. I.e. when I grab an image and move cursor to left and down I would like to get the same behavior as I will do it with panel 's scrolls. How to do it ?
