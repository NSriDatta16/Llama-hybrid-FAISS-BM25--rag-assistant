Can you clarify the requirements. Is the user of the application going to be building some Form and defining its workflow? Does each separate entity have a base set of properties that is included? You can dynamically create asp.net code by using "Page.Parse". Create the asp.net code using any method such as XSLT and parse it into the page.
