Unless you're developing a high-capacity server of some sort, you'll likely never need to examine the bytecode, except out of curiosity. Source code that adheres to acceptable coding practices in your organization will provide ample performance for most applications. Don't fret over performance until you've found issues after load-testing your application (or the entire customer service force lynches you for that screen that takes "forever" to load). Then, hammer away at the bottlenecks and leave the rest of the code alone. Bytecode requires a modest learning curve to understand. Sure, it never hurts to learn more, but pragmatism suggests putting it off until it's necessary. (And should that moment come, I recommend finding someone to mentor you.)
