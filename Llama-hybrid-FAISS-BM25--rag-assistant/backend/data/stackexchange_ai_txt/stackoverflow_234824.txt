I'd recommend EditPadPro ( http://www.editpadpro.com ). Aside from full Unicode support, it has one of the best regex engines built-in (it's from JGSoft, the makers of RegexBuddy (which incidentally integrates perfectly into EditPadPro)). You'll need RegexBuddy for the Find/Replace in files feature, everything else from your list is covered by EditPadPro itself. I've switched from UltraEdit to EditPadPro a few months ago precisely because of its superior regex engine (UltraEdit's Perl regex engine has a few annoying bugs especially concerning multi-line find/replace operations). A portable version that installs on any USB stick is included for free. Jan Goyvaerts, EPP's creator, is a Belgian living in Thailand, so you can be pretty sure he knows his way around Asian languages.
