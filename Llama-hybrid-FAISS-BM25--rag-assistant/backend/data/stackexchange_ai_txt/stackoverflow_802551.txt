Ever had to talk yourself more or less completely out of a project?

I recently had a project that almost failed miserably. To me it's a complete failure but somehow it passed, shouldn't have, just did. There was a lot of good will on all sides and the blame was shared equally. But now that I put the project files into "cold storage" I wonder what will happen in "the worst-case scenario". You are on a sinking ship, the complexity is exploding because there is a (not so) tiny hole in the specification, the customer is totally flipping out, it simply can't be done period Ever had to talk yourself completely out of a project midways? How did this work out? What was your reaction and what did you do (or intended to do) to avoid such things in the future? Like "From now on it's scrum or bust", "Darn, I will never do xyz again", "hm, does my insurance cover that " or maybe even "shit happens, stop whining and get over it"?
