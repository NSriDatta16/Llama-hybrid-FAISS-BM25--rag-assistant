Ruby got a lot of credibility with software engineers as an interesting language to consider when people like the Pragmatic Programmers and Martin Fowler started talking about it as a great language to think in. I'm using Ruby as a code generation language in my rewrite of AppMaker . The decision was influenced by them and by the book Code Generation in Action . You can use Ruby to do native GUI's with Cocoa (Ruby projects are templates available in the latest XCode, right alongside other application templates). Dynamic language support is a hot topic in the .Net space with IronRuby being supported in SilverLight for web client-side programming as well as being a significna language It's early days and I don't think there will ever be a career market for it like C# or Java but momentum is building.
