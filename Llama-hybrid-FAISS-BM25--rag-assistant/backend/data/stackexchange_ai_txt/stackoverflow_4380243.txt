It depends on the database; using varchar fields as your PK wastes space in your DB storage and indices in MySQL (for example). Having a table and unique integer id for your part numbers may seem less pure, but such things are sometimes necessary in the face of performance. (And further, it does allow you to update a product number if necessary in one spot, though I suspect this is likely not probable in your business logic.)
