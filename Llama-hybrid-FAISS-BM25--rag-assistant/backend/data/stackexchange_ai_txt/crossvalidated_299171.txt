How to train a CNN with non-squared data?

I'm having serious problems with this task. It already has weeks that I'm trying to achiev a way to train a non-squared (256x16, for example) data. How could I do that? I'm trying to apply conv with ksize = [32,3] then max pooling it (I think it goes to [16,2] then...) but this is not working... Please see this gist as a reference of the model(tensorflow): https://gist.github.com/denisb411/ccb470ee31d66cdaf647264fb6e20576 Correct my commentary, if needed. I'm not sure if this is right...
