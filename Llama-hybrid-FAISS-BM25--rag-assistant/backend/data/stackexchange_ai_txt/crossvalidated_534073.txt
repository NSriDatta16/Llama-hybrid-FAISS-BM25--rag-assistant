If you mainly care about prediction, you need to determine the model's functional form (e.g. consider a linear vs. a more flexible model) and estimate the model's parameters (start with point estimates but also consider interval estimates and perhaps densities (Bayesian) or confidence distributions (fiducial)). You may also want to estimate the model's expected predictive performance on new data. If you care about causal effects, in addition to the above, you need to find an estimator that yields causal effects as contrasted to merely parameters of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the regressors.
