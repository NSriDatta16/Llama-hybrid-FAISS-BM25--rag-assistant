How to report and quantify the random effect in a logistic model? glmmTMB

I'm fitting a logistic regression model with mixed effects using the package glmmTMB. (Because the dataset is very large and lme4 produces out of memory errors). And I need help to interpret and report the output. Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: OUTPUT ~ SEX + YEAR + OTHER + (1|CITY/ID) Data: mydata AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 890000 891000 -450000 889000 1000000 Random effects: Conditional model: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ID:CITY (Intercept) 10.0 3.1 CITY (Intercept) 1.5 1.2 Number of obs: 1000009, groups: ID:CITY, 200000; CITY, 20 Conditional model: Estimate Std.Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.79 0.28 2.9 0.005 SEX1 -0.21 0.017 -12 Output from sjPlot: Random Effects σ2 3.29 τ00 ID:CITY 10.0 τ00 CITY 1.5 ICC 0.78 How can I report the effect of CITY? I think most people would calculate the Confidence Interval of the odds of the Intercept with the variance as { exp(Intercept-1.96*1.2) , exp(Intercept+1.96*1.2) } but this doesn't take into account the standard error of the Intercept from the conditional model, 0.28. How should I combine them? (I think this is the estimated deviation for the Intercept excluding the random effects). Is it acceptable to disregard the Intercept value and just say...? "The 95% Confidence Interval for the odds ratio for CITY is {exp(-1.96*1.2),exp(+1.96*1.2)}" or "The odds of OUTPUT is multiplied by a number between exp(-1.96*1.2) and exp(+1.96*1.2) due to the variability of CITY". I don't know how to include here the 95% argument. I have also tried to calculate the residuals with residuals(model) but it produces an out of memory error. Is there any way to do it approximately? I just need to say what proportion of the total variance (or of the residuals) is explained by the variable CITY. The σ2 value reported by sjPlot is the variance of the residuals. What about the variance of ID:CITY (Intercept) 10.0? How should I report it? How can I split it in variance due to ID and variance of the interaction of ID and CITY?
