Am I better off using Python packages than coding my own stuff in C++? (MACHINE + DEEP learning)

For Machine and Deep Learning purposes, is it recommended to simply use Python and the packages available for it, rather than coding it manually in C++? I wished to do so for performance gains, but I am hearing that the Python packages are so well-optimized that they perform better than anything I could write in a short time in C++?
