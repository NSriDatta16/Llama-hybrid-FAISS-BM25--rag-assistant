Why does this SQL result in Index Scan instead of an Index Seek?

Can someone please help me tune this SQL query? SELECT a.BuildingID, a.ApplicantID, a.ACH, a.Address, a.Age, a.AgentID, a.AmenityFee, a.ApartmentID, a.Applied, a.AptStatus, a.BikeLocation, a.BikeRent, a.Children, a.CurrentResidence, a.Email, a.Employer, a.FamilyStatus, a.HCMembers, a.HCPayment, a.Income, a.Industry, a.Name, a.OccupancyTimeframe, a.OnSiteID, a.Other, a.ParkingFee, a.Pets, a.PetFee, a.Phone, a.Source, a.StorageLocation, a.StorageRent, a.TenantSigned, a.WasherDryer, a.WasherRent, a.WorkLocation, a.WorkPhone, a.CreationDate, a.CreatedBy, a.LastUpdated, a.UpdatedBy FROM dbo.NPapplicants AS a INNER JOIN dbo.NPapartments AS apt ON a.BuildingID = apt.BuildingID AND a.ApartmentID = apt.ApartmentID WHERE (apt.Offline = 0) AND (apt.MA = 'M') . Here's what the Execution Plan looks like: . What I don't understand is why I'm getting a Index Scan for NPapplicants. I have an Index that covers BuildingID and ApartmentID. Shouldn't that be used?
