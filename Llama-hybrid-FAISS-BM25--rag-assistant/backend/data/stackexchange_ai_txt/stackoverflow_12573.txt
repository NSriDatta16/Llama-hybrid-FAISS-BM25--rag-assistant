A good code coverage tool really helps. 100% coverage doesn't mean that it definitely is adequately tested, but it's a good indicator. For .Net NCover's quite good, but is no longer open source. @Mike Stone - Yeah, perhaps that should have been "high coverage" - we aim for 80% minimum, past about 95% it's usually diminishing returns, especially if you have belt 'n' braces code.
