GridView, RowDataBound(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e)

Firing a RowDataBound event, my question is how do I pull out the DataKey for GridviewRowEventArgs e? I have a table of Publications and surprisingly enough the key is PublicationID, however I do not have a boundfield to publication id but have it specified as a datakeyname. I can get the information using: int pID =Convert.ToInt32(DataBinder.Eval(e.Row.DataItem,"PublicationID")); But was wondering if there is a more elegant way of getting the information?! Also, if I investigate e, i can see the underlying table (publication) which also has a child table owner, does anybody know how I could, from the point in the app i.e. inside the RowDataBound event pull information out of the child table? This is all .Net 3.0, C#. Thanks, R.
