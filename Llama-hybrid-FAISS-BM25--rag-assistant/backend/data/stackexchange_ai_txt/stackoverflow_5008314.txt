jQuery selector to get last child that doesnt have a class

I have a page of nested UL s and LI s, I need to get the last LI of each UL , so I'm doing: $('li:last-child') this works great. But I need to extend this so it gets the last child LI of each UL , where the LI doesn't have a given class ( x ). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 I need to return LI 5 and 11 (as these are the last children within their parent ul that don't have .x ) How can I do this elegantly?
