Game problems that machine learning won't solve better than humans

Is there any type of game that could not be beaten by machine learning algorithm? Checkers and chess is not a problem for computers, go also.. But is there a class of problems in terms of let's say 'games' where people are still (and probably will be in the future) better than computers. To sum up: Is it possible to create a board game with fairly simple rules but hard to masterize for machine so that people playing such game would perform way better than computers?
