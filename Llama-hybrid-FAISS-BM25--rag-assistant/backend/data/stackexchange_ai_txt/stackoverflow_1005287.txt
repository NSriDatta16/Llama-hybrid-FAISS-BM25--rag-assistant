As Wikis were originally designed to work in a standard browser, and most browsers did not support anything except GET and POST, REST is not a concept used a lot on the wiki world. However, nowadays, some wikis (foswiki - the community fork of TWiki for instance) provide you a REST API to it http://foswiki.org/System/CommandAndCGIScripts#rest ). But you need the opposite: a wiki with a customizable backend (storage) that could be plugged on top of a REST storage service. As wikis with a pluggable backend, I know only of pmwiki http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki and foswiki (the open fork of TWiki) http://foswiki.org .
