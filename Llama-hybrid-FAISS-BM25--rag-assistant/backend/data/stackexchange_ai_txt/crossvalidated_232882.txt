What kind of t-test should I use for testing the significance of a Professor's IQ?

Imagining that the mean IQ of the population is 100, sd is 15. If the calculated IQ of the academic is 125, a two way t-test fails to reject the hypothesis that the professor is significantly smarter than the average person in the 5% significant, 100+1.96*15 ~ 130 is the rejection margin. Now a one way t-test however rejects the hypothesis with the margin being at 124.67. My question is knowing that the academic cannot be less gifted than the lower 2.5% percentile or to that effect, even the average person, is it logical to use the one way test, in this circumstance?
