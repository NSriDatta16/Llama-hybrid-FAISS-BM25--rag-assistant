Flash. Prevent mouse drag on child

I have a movieclip with a child button in it. The movieclip can be dragged and dropped. I want to disable dragging and dropping of the movieclip when I press/drag on the child button. mouseChildren=false and mouseEnable=false don't work, since I want to keep my mouse events for the button. --------------------------------- | Movieclip --------- | | |Button | | | | | | | --------- | --------------------------------- Thanks.
