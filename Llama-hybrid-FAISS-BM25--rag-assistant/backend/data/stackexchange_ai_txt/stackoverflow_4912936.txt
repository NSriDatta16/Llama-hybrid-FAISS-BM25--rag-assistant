Using subfolders for Sass partials in Compass project directory structure

I've got a compass project up and running with scss files in a src directory which are being compiled into a sttylesheets directory as css. This is all fine and I'm able to use the sass @import command no problem. However, I'd like to bring a bit of organisation to my sass partials and place them into relevant folders within the src directory. However, when I try to do this the @import command fails. Is there a way of doing this? UPDATE: I found in the compass docs that I can add add_import_path to my configuration file, but I can't get this to work either. I've tried a full path to the directory and a path relative to the project but nothing is happening. Someone please help, it can't be this hard!
