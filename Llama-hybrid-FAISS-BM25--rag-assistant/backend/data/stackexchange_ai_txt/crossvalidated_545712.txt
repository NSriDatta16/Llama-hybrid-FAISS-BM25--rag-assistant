Which machine learning or AI algorithm is best for this scenario?

I have a program which takes 3 inputs (a, b, c) and produces 2 outputs (x, y). The program is deterministic; if I give the same inputs, I'm guaranteed to get the same outputs. My objective is find the best combination of (a, b, c) which results in maximizing x, while minimizing y. Increases in y will generally lead to an increase in x, but there is a cap which y cannot exceed and a x cannot fall below. Which machine learning or AI algorithms should I start looking into as a possible solution to solving this problem?
