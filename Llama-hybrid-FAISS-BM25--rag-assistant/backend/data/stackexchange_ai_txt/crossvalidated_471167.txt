Such counts can be regarded as statistics in both an informal and a somewhat formal sense. There may well be some question as to whether this can in any reasonable sense be called a random sample of some population (and so whether analyses that rely on it being one can reasonably apply), but it's definitely collecting data , and fits your definition of statistics . For example if there was interested in the average number of words per paragraph in some body of work, the information in this passage of text would potentially be relevant.
