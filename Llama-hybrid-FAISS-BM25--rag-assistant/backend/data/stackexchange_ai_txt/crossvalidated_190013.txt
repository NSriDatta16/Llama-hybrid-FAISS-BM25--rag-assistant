Calculating Reorder Quantity

I already know average and variability for supplier lead time for each item. What formula can I use to include the supplier lead time average, sd, and also the projected sales forecast Known Variables Supplier Lead Time + Sd 1 period out for projected sales Current On Hand Inventory Thank you very much .
