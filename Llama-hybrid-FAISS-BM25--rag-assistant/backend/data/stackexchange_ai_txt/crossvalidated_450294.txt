You are currently only including a random intercept, that is the base rate of $FA$ can differ between subjects. While that is a good first step for a multilevel model, you should usually also include random intercepts, in other words, the effect sizes should be allowed to differ between subjects. This closely relates to your question about within-subject variables. Your model understands that the categorical variables have multiple levels, because these variables can't be interpreted numerically directly. What number would correspond to "left" or "right"? However, multilevel models (basically an advanced form of regression analysis) always require numerical predictors. So whenever R encounters a categorical variable, it automatically recodes it into numerical values using dummy coding. Dummy coding is used because in most cases it is not too wrong. If you need more control over the coding (e.g. choosing the reference class of the dummy coding, centering, ANOVA coding, etc), there are additional methods that you may use. Categorial variables (with multiple levels) and within-subject variables are two quite different concepts you seem to confuse somewhat. If you had included handedness or gender, those would have been between-subject but categorical (with different levels instead of numerically). It's good to keep those two concepts separate. The (1|Subjects) term in your model indicates that the intercept may vary between the subjects (random intercept). So different subjects can have a different base level of $FA$ but the effects that switching from right to left side of the brain must be the same for each subject. A simple example: Assume I want to estimate the average weight gain per year for members of my family, so I measure my son and my cat at birth (don't think to much about this, it's just an example for illustration), year 1, etc. So if I then use weight ~ age + (1|subject) , this model captures the fact that my cat was much smaller than my son at the time of birth. However, this model does not capture the fact that my son also grew much faster, so it will try to fit the same growth rate for both my cat and my son. So you should also include random intercepts. Random intercepts can only be used on within-subject variables (think about this for a while, if it isn't obvious why this is the case than re-read the previous until you understand what random-intercept mean). So you could use a model like FA ~ Age + Wholebrain_FA + Volume + Group + Tract + Hemisphere + (Tract + Hemisphere|Subjects) . In this model, the effects of Tract and Hemisphere are also allowed to vary between subjects. If I understand your data correctly, the tracts have been measured for both hemispheres. So you could even nest factors: FA ~ Age + Wholebrain_FA + Volume + Group + Tract + Hemisphere + (Tract|Hemisphere:Subjects) + (Hemisphere | Subjects) , which indicates that the effect of tract could vary for each hemisphere within each subject, and the effect of hemisphere can vary between subjects. Warning: If you don't have enough data, a complicated model often cannot be computed. If you include all random intercepts and random slopes, the model may not converge. Nevertheless, it is often a good idea to start with the most complete model (all random intercepts and slopes) and then work from there to reduce parts of the model until you get convergence. Have a look at the between-subject variances and correlations of between-subject differences to see what should be dropped (often it is advisable to drop the smallest between-subject effects first) until you reach convergence. You should also describe this process in your publication: "We started with a model that included all random intercepts and slopes. Because this model did not converge, we dropped the random slope on Factor XYZ (SD=...). After dropping this random slope, the final model converged." I found this page to be a very good primer on multilevel models in R.
