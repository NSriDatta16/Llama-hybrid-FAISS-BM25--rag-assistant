Factor investing research

I am studying the effects of market and funding liquidity on the returns of a portfolio formed on the Quality factor, QMJ (from: https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Quality-Minus-Junk-Factors-Monthly ). I am using the Pastor and Stambaugh liquidity factor ( https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/lubos-pastor/data ) as proxy for market liquidity and the TED spread as a proxy for funding liquidity. I have monthly returns of the QMJ portfolio in the sample period of July 1963 - December 2019 and I would like to know what the best way would be to run a time series regression of QMJ on these 2 liquidity factors. I'm unsure of whether I should study the contemporaneous effect of market and funding liquidity on the QMJ portfolio returns or their lagged effect. As such I would get 2 different regressions and I would like to know which one would result in better interpretations in my case. QMJ(t) = PastorLiquidity(t) + TEDSpread(t) + (some other control variables, such as the Fama-French factors) or QMJ(t) = PastorLiquidity(t-1) + TEDSpread(t-1) + (some other control variables, such as the Fama-French factors) What would be the difference in interpretation between these 2 regressions and which one would be better? Thanks! Btw, I'm using Stata
