Firstly, I'd love to know why you need a different ID for every single TD. Is the ID holding important information, such as an index? In this situation it might be better creating each TD within a loop. Also, obviously you can't attach an event handler to a DOM element which doesn't exist! It doesn't have to be injected into the DOM but it DOES have to exist in some capacity. jQuery's live() isn't a magical mystery, it just uses event delegation, so it attaches the event to a parent element, such as the table and then decides what happens dependent on the target of the click. Here's a rudimentary example. I register a handler to the 'body' element, and then I test each time to see what the target is, if it's a TD element I doSomething() -> document.body.onclick = function(e) { var realTarget = e ? e.target : window.event.srcElement; if ( realTarget.nodeName.toLowerCase() === 'td' ) { doSomething(); } }; Event delegation relies on something called event bubbling (or "propogation") which is the way in which modern browsers implement the event model. Each event, when triggered will travel upwards through the DOM until it can go no further. So if you click on an anchor within a paragraph the anchor's 'click' event will fire and THEN the paragraph's 'click' event will fire etc. etc.
