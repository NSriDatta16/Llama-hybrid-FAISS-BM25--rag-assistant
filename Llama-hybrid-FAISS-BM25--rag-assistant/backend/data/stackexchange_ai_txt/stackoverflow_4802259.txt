Another possibility is XPF , an XNA-compatible library that seeks to replicate some of WPF's UI architecture. I use it myself - it's simple and elegant. It will be free for non-commercial use, with commercial pricing TBA. (I haven't been able to load the XNAML website, but I'd guess XPF and XNAML have similar goals.)
