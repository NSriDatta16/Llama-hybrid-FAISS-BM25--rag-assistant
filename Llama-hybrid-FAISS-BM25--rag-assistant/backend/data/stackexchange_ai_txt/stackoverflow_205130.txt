Performance wise there should be essentially no impact. The slow part here is going to disk to read a file header, but if you're going to load the file you'll have to do that anyway and any decent storage system (pretty much any one from the past couple of decades) will cache the read from the check so that part of the read is much faster when you actually open the file. Having said that, I agree with mattlant that it would be generally better to catch the file not there exception and deal with it properly if the file is generally expected to be there.
