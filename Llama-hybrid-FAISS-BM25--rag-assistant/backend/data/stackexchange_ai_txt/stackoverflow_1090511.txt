How does the operating system know how much memory my app is using? (And why doesn't it do garbage collection?)

When my task manager (top, ps, taskmgr.exe, or Finder) says that a process is using XXX KB of memory, what exactly is it counting, and how does it get updated? In terms of memory allocation, does an application written in C++ "appear" different to an operating system from an application that runs as a virtual machine (managed code like .NET or Java)? And finally, if memory is so transparent - why is garbage collection not a function-of or service-provided-by the operating system? As it turns out, what I was really interested in asking is WHY the operating system could not do garbage collection and defrag memory space - which I see as a step above "simply" allocating address space to processes. These answers help a lot! Thanks!
