What is next after finished reading Elements of Statistical Learning?

I am a Pure Maths PhD student specialising in functional analysis. I would like to work as a data scientist after my PhD graduation, particularly in the field of machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. I have some backgrounds on machine learning such as linear regression, logistic regression, K-mean clustering, SVM. For deep learning, I know neural networks and CNN. To build up more on my theoretical background in these fields, I started reading Element of Statistical Learning (ESL) where I think it is known as the bible in statistical learning. I find its contents manageable. In terms of programming, I have been using Python for the past 2 years and tutored an undergraduate Python course last year. So I think my Python skills, data Structures and Algorithms are average (at least, not beginner). I have implemented some projects involving stochastic differential equation models using Python. My question is: what is next after I finish reading ESL? I found a post in CV asking for reference BEFORE reading ESL, but not AFTER ESL.
