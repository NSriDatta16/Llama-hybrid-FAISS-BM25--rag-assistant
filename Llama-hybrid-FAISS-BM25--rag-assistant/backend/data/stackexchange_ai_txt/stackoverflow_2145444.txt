I wonder if the standard deviation is the best choice: If the image gets sharper, the sobel filter image will contain brighter pixels at the edges, but at the same time fewer bright pixels, because the edges are getting thinner. Maybe you could try using an average of the 1% highest pixel values in the sobel image?
