I just ran this type of command while I was cleaning up my repos, reorganizing them. I was basicly moving all of the content from one repo to a new folder in another repo, joining similar projects. I used svnadmin dump d:\repoPathToMove > d:\backupFolder\repoName.dump And used svnadmin load d:\pathToNewRepo --parent-dir InternalFolder At d:\pathToNewRepo is the path to the destination repo, and InternalFolder is the new folder where the loaded files will be deposited. This works if I create the InternalFolder befor doing the load. I created the Internal Folder using Toitoise SVN's RepoBrowser on the destination Browser. Just tried running the load WITHOUT creating the folder and I got the same error you presented. SO I guess the easy way is adding a command to create the missing parent-dir. I did not use any filtering here.You can also shorthand it a bit by writing the dump and load one after the other: svnadmin dump d:\repoPathToMove | svnadmin load d:\pathToNewRepo --parent-dir InternalFolder avoiding the need to create the dump file
