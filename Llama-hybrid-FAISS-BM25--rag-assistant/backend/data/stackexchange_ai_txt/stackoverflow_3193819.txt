The beta version of Sencha Touch has drag and drop support. You can refer to their DnD Example . This only works on webkit browsers by the way. Retrofitting that logic into a web page is probably going to be difficult. As I understand it they disable all browser panning and implement panning events entirely in javascript, allowing correct interpretation of drag and drop. Update: the original example link is dead, but I found this alternative: https://github.com/kostysh/Drag-Drop-example-for-Sencha-Touch
