I've some test cases that run a server in the setUp and close it in the tearDown. I don't know if it is very elegant way to do it but it works of for me. I am happy to have it and it helps me a lot. If the server init is very long, an alternative would be to automate it with ant. ant would run/stop the server before/after executing the tests. See here for very interesting tutorial about ant and python
