why is the 'space after' different between two sIFR headlines?

At clientarea.hexatrope.com/nathanael/ I am using sIFR to create two headlines in the main content column. For some reason, when the headline is two lines long, there is less space between the bottom of it and the following paragraph than when the headline is one line long. Why is this, and how do I fix it?
