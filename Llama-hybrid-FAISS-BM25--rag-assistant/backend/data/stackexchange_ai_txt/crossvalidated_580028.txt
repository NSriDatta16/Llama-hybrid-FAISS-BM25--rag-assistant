Multimodal is with regard to models, not data. If I understand correctly, you are trying to find the optimal number of clusters given a specific model structure. Typically in this set up selecting "number of clusters" is part of a standard model selection process. Take GMM for example, If you use Bayesian GMM, you can try a set of possible "number of clusters", and select the one that minimize BIC on your complete data set; If you use GMM (without Bayesian), you need to split the data set into training and validation, train each variation on the training set and select the one that maximize the likelihood on validation set.
