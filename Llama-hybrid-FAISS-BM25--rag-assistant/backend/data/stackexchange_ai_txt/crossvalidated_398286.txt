(Multinomial) Logistic regression with missing values

I want to do a (multinomial) logistic regression to predict 5 different physical activity classes based on different variables extracted for each subject. However, I have one variable (i.e., time after disease onset) in my dataset with missing values for some of the subjects, i.e. for the healthy control subjects. These missing values are thus not missing at random, but don't make sense for healthy controls. How would you deal with this variable? I could remove this variable completely from the model, but it does have a strong predicting power. Or would you simply set a to an arbitrary value, e.g. -100?
