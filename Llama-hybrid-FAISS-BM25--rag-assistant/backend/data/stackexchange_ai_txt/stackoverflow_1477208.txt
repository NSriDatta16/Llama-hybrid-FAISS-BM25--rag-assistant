Third option: Having HTML normally embedded in XML is far more flexible than encoding it, or embedding it with CDATA. It allows parsers to handle the entire document including the HTML in a high-level way. It allows use of XSL transformations on both the containing XML and the HTML data. So I'd suggest directly embedding it unless your HTML is not valid XML, in which case encoding or CDATA would be the only option anyway.
