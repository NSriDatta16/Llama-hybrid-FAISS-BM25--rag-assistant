Why does the variance of the Random walk increase?

The random walk that is defined as $Y_{t} = Y_{t-1} + e_t$ , where $e_t$ is white noise. Denotes that the current position is the sum of the previous position + an unpredicted term. You can prove that the mean function $\mu_t = 0 $ , since $$E(Y_{t}) = E(e_1+ e_2+ ... +e_t) = E(e_1) + E(e_2) +... +E(e_t) = 0 + 0 + \cdots + 0$$ But why is it that the variance increases linearly with time? Does this have something to do with it's not “pure” random, since the new position is very correlated with the previous one? EDIT: Now I have a much better understanding by visualizing a big sample of random walks, and here we can easily observe that the overall variance does increase over time, and the mean is as expected around zero. Maybe this was trivial after all, since in the very early stages of the time series (compare time = 10 with time = 100) the random walkers have not had yet the time to explore as much.
