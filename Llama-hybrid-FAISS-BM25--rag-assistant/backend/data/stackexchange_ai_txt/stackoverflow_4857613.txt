best practice for django request.method methods

I'm building a REST api and one of the methods from my view needs to accept the following http methods GET POST DELETE PUT What is the best practice to achieve this ? So far I came up with the following with_id_storage = { 'GET' : _with_id_get, 'POST' : _with_id_post, 'PUT' : _with_id_put, 'DELETE': _with_id_delete, } def with_id(request, id): try: log.info('calling %s' % request.method) return with_id_storage[request.method](request, test_id) except KeyError: return HttpResponse('Not ready yet') thanks
