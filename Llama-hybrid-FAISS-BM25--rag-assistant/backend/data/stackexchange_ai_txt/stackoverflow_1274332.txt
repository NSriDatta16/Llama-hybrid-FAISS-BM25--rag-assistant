I'm not sure this will work, but it may give you some options... Instead of trying to reload the current agent (let's call this the tool agent), add a new agent (an installer agent). The installer agent would have exactly 1 function: use RedefineClasses() to replace the original tool agent classes. If you name the installer agent with a version number as part of the classname (MyToolInstallerV1), you can keep loading new installers that update the tool agent. If size becomes an issue, perhaps an installer agent could look for previous installers and replace their classes with a small no-op stub.
