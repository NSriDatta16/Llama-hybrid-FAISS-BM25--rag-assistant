Random forests does not generate a final tree. There are however ways to get insights from a random forest: Obtaining knowledge from a random forest Ideas for outputting a prediction equation for Random Forests ( in particular have a look at point 3: Combining Multiple Models, where for example you might build a tree on top of random forest outputs) I implemented a version of this method in WEKA, however it might be old: file I just found this publication: Eibe Frank, Michael Mayo, and Stefan Kramer. Alternating model trees. In Proc 30th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, Data Mining Track, pages 871-878. ACM Press, 2015. try to have a look. Moreover, many attributes will be selected in random forest. One way to see which attributes are selected more often is to use random forest variable importance. Unfortunately I don't think it is implemented in the standard WEKA RandomForest.
