Ordinary logistic regression (as opposed to, say, regularized logistic regression) is effectively invariant to the means and SDs of the features. Changing the means and SDs of the features would only rescale the coefficients; any good method of computing confidence intervals (CIs) for the coefficients should give exactly analogous CIs, and any good significance test should make the same decision. As for the dependent variable (DV), you shouldn't try to change the mean or SD of a logistic regression model's DV because the DV ought to be dummy-coded (generally just 0 and 1), and you'll break the dummy codes if you transform the variable. All the above concerns transformations to the entire dataset, without segregating by group. Segregating by group seems counterproductive, assuming you wanted to include group as a feature in the model, because the two transformations will interfere with estimating the effect of group, particularly, any interaction terms involving group.
