A.I.: How would I train a Neural Network across multiple machines?

So, for larger networks with large data sets, they take a while to train. It would be awesome if there was a way to share the computing time across multiple machines. However, the issue with that is that when a neural network is training, the weights are constantly being altered every iteration, and each iteration is more or less based on the last -- which makes the idea of distributed computing at the very least a challenge. I've thought that for each portion of the network, the server could send maybe a 1000 sets of data to train a network on... but... you'd have roughly the same computing time as I wouldn't be able to train on different sets of data simultaneously (which is what I want to do). But even if I could split up the network's training into blocks of different data sets to train on, how would I know when I'm done with that set of data? especially if the amount of data sent to the client machine isn't enough to achieve the desired error? I welcome all ideas.
