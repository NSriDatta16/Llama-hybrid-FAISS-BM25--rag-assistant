An answer from Kohonen, inventor of the self-organized map himself: "The true mathematical form of Ïƒ(t) is not crucial, as long as its value is fairly large in the beginning of the process. Say, on the order of half of the diameter of the grid, whereafter it is gradually reduced to a fraction of it in about 1000 steps." From: Kohonen, T., 2013. Essentials of the self-organizing map. Neural networks, 37, pp.52-65.
