How to prove variable is ordinal

I want to run a model that determines the probability of self curing for loan customers who entered arrears. The thing is that when a customer enters arrears there are 3 ways he could go: -not cure -cure not by himself -self cure I was thinking of running either an ordinal logistic regression or a multinomial logistic, but I figured maybe I had to prove that my variable of interest is ordinal (let's say in the order: not cure, cure not by himself and self cure). Is there any test I can do to prove this?
