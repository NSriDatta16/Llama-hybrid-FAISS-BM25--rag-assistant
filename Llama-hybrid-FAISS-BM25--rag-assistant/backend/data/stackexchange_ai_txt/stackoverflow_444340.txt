The Infragistics webgrids expose a very complex client side object model that you will be able to use to populate your data client side. The first thing you will want to do is get a look at the full CSOM for the webgrid control, you can find the current doc version at: http://help.infragistics.com/NetAdvantage/NET/2008.3/CLR2.0/ To make a short example, you will need to grab a refence to your grid(s) and then add some rows and data. It would probably be easier to setup the column definitions for your grids at design time, rather than try to do it all in the javascript. First: get a refrence to your grid: var grid = igtbl_getGridById('dataGridControlID'); Then add a new row: var newRow = grid.Rows.addNew() After thats done you can loop the columns of your row to fill the data: var oCols = newRow.Band.Columns; for(var i=0; i or address each one by key to populate its data: newRow.getCellFromKey(colKey).setValue(yourValue,fireEvents);
