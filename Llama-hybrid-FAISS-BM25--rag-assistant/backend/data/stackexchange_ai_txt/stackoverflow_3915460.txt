Alternative to Wireshark for raw Ethernet capture over USB-Ethernet adapter

(Apologies: I uninstalled and reinstalled WinPcap and now I can see the extra interface! Suggestion found in Wireshark FAQ. I leave the original question below.) I use WireShark to examine ethernet packet contents at the byte level (in/out of custom FPGA-based hardware). I have a USB-Ethernet adapter to add a second Ethernet port to my laptop. It was a cheap Chinese device bought on Ebay but now that I've found an appropriate driver, it works OK. However, I see that, on Windows, WinPcap/WireShark doesn't support Ethernet capture over USB . While it would be nice if WireShark could be made to work on USB capture, I'm really looking for an alternative way to grab the raw ethernet bytes. I have some perl scripts set up that operate on the raw frames output from tshark, (Wireshark command line) and I could easily feed it from any stream of frames/bytes. Is anyone doing something similar or is there a tidy way to output the raw bytes? Sniffed raw USB bytes would be OK, but it would be nicer if someone has already programmed/scripted extracting the Ethernet frames. I'm using perl but any compiled app or python or C# or C++ or .. would be fine.
