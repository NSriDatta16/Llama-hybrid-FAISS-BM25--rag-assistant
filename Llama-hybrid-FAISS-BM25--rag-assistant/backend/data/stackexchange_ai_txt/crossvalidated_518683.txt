duplicate feature with same data in logistic regression

this is not a duplicated question What happens if I train a model on a data set that includes a duplicated feature? we have some feature such as x(1) and the label is y(1). we add a new feature that its data is clearly similarity to x(1). what happen if we train a model with this {x(1), x(1), y(1)} feature instead of {x(1), y(1)}. does any change in logistic regression efficiency? What changes performance?
