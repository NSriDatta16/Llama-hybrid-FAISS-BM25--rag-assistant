What is the reason for using the mean instead a regression inside a decision tree?

A common problem with decisions trees is that they don't generalize outside the range of the data, e.g. time series. For this reason, I want to code a regression version of the decision tree, that performs regression estimation instead of estimation with the mean. I havenÂ´t seen this kind of implementation in ML packages, so I guess comes with statistical or computational issues. What issues would I face in this coding journey? Can you point me towards resources on the topic?
