This might not be the answer you are looking for, but I solved this (and other) problems by embedding the report into a web page (using the ReportViewer control). I use AJAX to cascade values across dropdowns in ways that would be exceedingly difficult in Reporting Services, and then pass the parameters to the reports in the codebehind. I've found this to be much easier, as I'm not constrained with how I create my input controls. YMMV, though.
