I think this resembles a TreeMap data structure similar to the one in Java described here . It does the same thing (key/value mappings) but retrieval might be different since you are using the nodes themselves as the keys. Retrieval from the TreeMap described is abstracted from the implementation since, when you pass in a key, you don't know the exact location of it in the tree. Hope that makes sense!
