Multiplying coefficients of logistic regression to get per 10 unit increase?

I'm working on a project in R where I'm looking at California's census tract-level demographic data in an explanatory logistic regression model. I have 6 demographic variables of interest and am controlling for population density. My binary predictor is 1=exposed to pollutant/0=unexposed to pollutant for each census tract. Here is the summary of my log regression in R: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.767410 0.782963 0.980 0.327019 percent_unemployed -0.089417 0.036507 -2.449 0.014312 * percent_minority -0.008516 0.011571 -0.736 0.461755 percent_no_diploma 0.053393 0.021160 2.523 0.011627 * percent_uninsured 0.064070 0.039517 1.621 0.104945 percent_under150 -0.016423 0.017528 -0.937 0.348798 percent_disabled -0.023421 0.033759 -0.694 0.487828 pop_density -0.352425 0.098325 -3.584 0.000338 *** I know that exponentiating the coefficients will give me the ORs per 1% increase in the variable. However, I want to know the odds of exposure per 10% increase in the variable (i.e., for each 10% increase in the percent of the population living with a disability, the odds of being exposed increases/decreases by a factor of x). When I code cali_logit$coefficients and re-run the summary, all of my coefficients suddenly become significant (when many weren't before), as shown below. Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 7.67410 0.78296 9.801 This doesn't seem right...am I missing something? How do I get odds ratios per 10% increase rather than per 1% increase?
