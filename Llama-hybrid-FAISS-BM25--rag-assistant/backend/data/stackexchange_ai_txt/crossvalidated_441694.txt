Conclusion of my logistic regression with interaction terms

I ran a logistic regression, all assumptions checked and so on, and I have two models with four predictory variables predicting one dependent. In my first model I just check the variables themselves, and only variable 2 is significant. In my second model I include all possible interaction terms between my four predictors and now one of these interactions becomes significant. For my conclusion, do I just show the odds ratios of the models separately? And how do I explain the significant interactions in words? I understand that for variables I can say: This variable has a significant effect and its odds ratio is Exp(B) so we can see that category 1 occurs 3 times as probable as category 2 for instance. But how do I say this for interaction terms that are significant with their odds ratios? Thanks if anyone could help me and happy holidays guys!
