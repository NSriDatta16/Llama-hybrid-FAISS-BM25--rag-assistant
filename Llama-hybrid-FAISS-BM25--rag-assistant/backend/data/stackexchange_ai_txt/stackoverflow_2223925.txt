My shop is Java/Windows, using IBM software; ClearCase, WAS, WMB, WPS. We went with Hudson, and it's done some wonderful things for productivity. We also use a small stuffed animal, in this case, a singing Frosty The Snowman that's about 12" high. Whenever a developer breaks the build, as identified by Hudson, they have 15 minutes to clean up the mess, or Frosty winds up on their desk. Frosty stays there until someone else screws it up the same way. I've had Frosty once or twice, as has all of the team; it helps mentally encourage better coding practices, or at the very least, coding practices that don't handicap your teammates.
