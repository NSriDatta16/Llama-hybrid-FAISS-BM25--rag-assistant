How to train a Deep Neural Network to predict conditional probability distribution?

I am working with non-stationary time series data sampled at 128 Hz. I have segmented the entire time series into 1-second segments, meaning now I have a bunch of vectors, say $x_i$ , where i = 1,2,3,..500 (500-sec data). Each vector will contain 128 data points, and I have corresponding labels (there are five labels/classes) for each vector. I have trained a neural network to classify these 1-second signals. I want to find the probability of occurrence of Class-5 in 2nd-second ( $x_2$ ) given I had the vector $x_1$ (1st second) and its label Class-1. i.e., I want to find the probability of occurrence of Class-5 after classifying every second until the end. How can I train a deep neural network to get this task done? Please give me your valuable suggestions. I was working with EEG data where I wanted to predict the onset of seizures in advance. I have to identify class-5 as early as possible for seizure prediction. That's why I wanted to calculate probability of occurrence of class-5 after each and every second. Class-4 represents where the seizure is actually happening (in my data), and Class-5 just precedes it. As I wanted to predict seizures before its onset, I wanted to identify Class-5 as early as possible or atleast I want to calculate its probability of occurrence so that I can raise an alarm if the probability is high.
