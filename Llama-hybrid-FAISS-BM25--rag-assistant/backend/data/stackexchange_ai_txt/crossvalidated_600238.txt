Show that a sequence of MA(n) processes does not converge to zero

I am trying to investigate whether a certain MA( $n$ ) process does not necessarily converge to zero when $n \to \infty$ . Consider $X_n=(X_{t;n})_{t =1}^\infty$ a MA( $n$ ) process such that: $$X_{t;n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \theta_{j;n} \varepsilon_{t-j;n}$$ satisfies the two following properties: $\underset{n \to \infty}{\lim}\underset{1\leq j \leq n}{\max} |\theta_{j;n}|=0$ For each $n$ , we have that $(\varepsilon_{t;n})_{t\in \mathbb Z}$ is i.i.d. with $E[\varepsilon_{t;n}]=0$ and $E[\varepsilon_{t;n}^2]=1$ Intuitively, at first glance, this might look like $X_n$ converges to zero. For example, consider the following simulation in Julia when the innovations are Normal: using Distributions using Plots # Size of my Time Series MA(n) T=1000 # Order of the MA(n) n = 10 # Property 1 max_n = 1/n θₙ = rand(Uniform(-max_n, max_n), n) # Normal distribution N(0,1) dist = Normal() # I need lags εₙ = rand(dist,T+n) # My X times series MA(n) Xₙ = [0.0 for i = 1:T] for t in 1:T τ = t + n Xₙ[t] = θₙ[1]*εₙ[τ] for j in 2:n Xₙ[t] = Xₙ[t] + θₙ[j]*εₙ[τ-j] end end plot(Xₙ, size = (950, 350), legend = false , title = "MA($n)") For n = 800, we have But I have the impression that for non-Gaussian innovations (maybe t-student), MA(n) doesn't necessarily converge to zero (satisfying properties 1 and 2 above). So, I would like to know if there is any way to show that for some innovation $(\varepsilon_{t;n})_{t\in \mathbb Z}$ and for some $\epsilon>0$ , I have $$|X_{t;n}|> \epsilon, \quad \forall \, t \in \mathbb Z , \forall n \in \mathbb N.$$
