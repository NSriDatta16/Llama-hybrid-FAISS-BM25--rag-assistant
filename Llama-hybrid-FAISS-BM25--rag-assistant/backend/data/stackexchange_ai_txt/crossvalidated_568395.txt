Negative Binomial: Estimating r (# failures until stopping) when p (success probability) is known

I have a NB(r,p) distribution (let's say with the conventions of the wikipedia page ). Suppose I know the success probability p, observe Y the number of successes, but don't know and want to estimate r, the number of failures until the experiment is stopped. Getting a point estimate isn't too hard. One could use MLE or method of moments. But what if I want an interval estimate, like a confidence interval or something similar? One way I can think of is use a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm in a Bayesian estimation scheme. But I imagine there also must be something simpler. If anyone has a good reference for this, I'd much appreciate it. Thanks in advance!
