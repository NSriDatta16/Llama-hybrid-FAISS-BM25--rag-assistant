Anytime you can push the calculations back into the relational model, It will increase MDX query performance; but also have a negative impact on processing performance. If you can pre-calculate some measures using in-row sql logic, then expose these as measures in your data source view. The storage engine can build aggregates and the formula engine will have less work to do. You are basically pushing the the heavy lifting down to sql. This works really well for static calculation and conversion factors and things like simple arithmetic etc. Another thing you can do is create any intermediate calculated members that shouldn't be used by end user as hidden, This won't have any affect on performance; but will de-clutter the cube from the end users perspective.
