From what I read, I see you are trying to perform a logistic regression by using linear and ReLU functions. Since your model outputs the probability the input has to be in each class, I recommend to use function such as sigmoid or softmax in the last layer. I post here the difference between using only linear and ReLU and using the sigmoid function. Also in evaluation, the model with sigmoid has an accuracy of 98.8%.
