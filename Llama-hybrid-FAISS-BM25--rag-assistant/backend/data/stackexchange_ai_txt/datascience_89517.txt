Looking for more recent dataset for document classfication

I am trying to develop an NLP - CNN algorithm to detect documents with sensitive information such as passport, license and distinguish them from other documents like resume, email, form or advertisements. I personally consider this as a document classification problem and looked for open source datasets which had documents from different category/classes. I found the RVL-CDIP Dataset and tobacco3482 dataset with classes such as Email, form, letter, news, resume, scientific. However, the dataset collection looks from an old collection (ie samples in these datasets represent how resumes were written in 20000 and invoices collected in early 2000 )These datasets doesn't quite represent recent sample set of documents that we might come across on a daily basis. Is there a more recent document classification dataset available which would be more relevant to the current format of these documents? EDIT : Looking for a similar dataset to RVL-CDIP Dataset and tobacco3482 dataset but which is more recent created. Use case is to still distinguish between resumes, advertisements, passports, and emails. I am not looking at detecting sensitive information within emails so my usecas is similar to RVL-CDIP Dataset use-case
