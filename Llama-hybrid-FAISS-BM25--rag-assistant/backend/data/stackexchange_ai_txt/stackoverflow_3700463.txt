We have a similar situation, though, in our case, we do a baseless merge from multiple branches into a "scratch" build branch. The only way we were able to do this is by writing our own utility leveraging the TFS API. The good news is, you should be able to accomplish this in less than a couple hundred lines of code. The basic steps are: Connect to TFS Get an instance of the VersionControlServer (let's call it VCS) Create a workspace Do a VCS.GetChangeset() Iterate through the Changes to get a list of items that have changed Perform a Workspace.Merge for each of the items from your source branch to your destination branch. Check in the items in the destination branch. Delete workspace
