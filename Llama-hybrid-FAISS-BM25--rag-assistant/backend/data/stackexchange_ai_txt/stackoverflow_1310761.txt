Why would You want to ask user about its User-Agent? Pulling appropriate http header - as you've mentioned, should be enough. But if you need that badly, I'd go for regular expressions - for checking http user-agent header and cutting out unimportant info from that header present possible match based on the previous step ask user if the match is correct, if not, let him enter its own answer then I'd try to match what he entered to some dictionary values, so as to be able to enter IE and MSIE and get the same result. The above seems vague enough :) and abstract, maybe you could provide an explanation - why you want that? maybe there is some other way?
