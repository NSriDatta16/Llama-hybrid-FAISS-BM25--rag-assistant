Run multiple mysql instances in mysql

I want to use MySQL server on two different ports on the same machine. I have made two separate config files. When I'm trying to connect to the MySQL server on the second port I defined then I can't connect. The OS running MySQL is Windows Vista. I also tried to start mysqld from command line after specifying port. This is the sample file I have changed for MySQL server to read from two different ports: # CLIENT SECTION # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # # The following options will be read by MySQL client applications. # Note that only client applications shipped by MySQL are guaranteed # to read this section. If you want your own MySQL client program to # honor these values, you need to specify it as an option during the # MySQL client library initialization. # [client] port=3306 [mysql] mysql-path="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin" default-character-set=latin1 [client] port=3307 [mysql1] mysql1-path="C:\Program Files\MySQL2\MySQL Server 5.1\bin" default-character-set=latin1 # SERVER SECTION # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # # The following options will be read by the MySQL Server. Make sure that # you have installed the server correctly (see above) so it reads this # file. # [mysqld] mysqld-path="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin\" # The TCP/IP Port the MySQL Server will listen on port=3306 #Path to installation directory. All paths are usually resolved relative to this. basedir="C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.1/" #Path to the database root datadir="C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.1/Data/" # server_id=1 [mysqld1] # The TCP/IP Port the MySQL Server will listen on port=3307 server_id=2 mysqld1-path="C:\Program Files\MySQL2\MySQL Server 5.1\bin\" #Path to installation directory. All paths are usually resolved relative to this. basedir="C:/Program Files/MySQL2/MySQL Server 5.1/" #Path to the database root datadir="C:/ProgramData/MySQL2/MySQL Server 5.1/Data/" # # The default character set that will be used when a new schema or table is # created and no character set is defined default-character-set=latin1 # The default storage engine that will be used when create new tables when default-storage-engine=INNODB # Set the SQL mode to strict sql-mode="STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"
