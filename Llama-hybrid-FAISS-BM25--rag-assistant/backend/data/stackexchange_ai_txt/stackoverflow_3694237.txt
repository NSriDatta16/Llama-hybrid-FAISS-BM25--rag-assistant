Using SQL to compute average daily unique usage

I have a MySQL table "stats", which is a list of entries for each login into a website. Each entry has a " userId " string, a " loginTime " timestamp and other fields. There can be more than one entry for each user - one for each login that he makes. I want to write a query that will calculate the average of unique daily logins over, say, 30 days. Any ideas?
