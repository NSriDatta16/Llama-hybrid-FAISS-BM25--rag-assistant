This is a fairly common problem but very tricky.It can be found by googling Intermittent Demand , Sparse Data Analysis and some other "names". We deal with time series data where there are two random variables ; The interval and the actual demand at each point.We have not experimented with cases like yours where the demand is ALWAYS a "1" but we see no reason that our approach wouldn't work . What we have found to be useful is to model the rate ( in your case 1/interval ) as it can be prdicted from Interval. This approach allows you to detect level changes in rate and of course unusual rates ( pulses). Try googling "analysis of time series with many zero values" and you will get some information on dealing with this "tricky problem".
