DBMS to store RSS feeds

I'm not very experienced with DBMS systems so I need some advice about which DBMS to use for storing RSS feeds. The DBMS must be available on Linux and be free. I have some experience with MySQL but I am unsure if it performs fast enough to handle the storage and updates of hundreds of thousands of xml documents.
