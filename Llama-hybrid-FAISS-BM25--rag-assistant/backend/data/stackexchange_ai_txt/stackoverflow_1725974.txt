http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/garbage_collection.html This is the best document I have found regarding garbage collection. In short VM2 uses a technique called Mark Sweeping. It basically traverses every object of your application like a tree and marks them. Any objects no longer marked can be deallocated. This process happens over a number of frames and not all at once. Therefore for something to be eligible for garbage collection there must not be any references to it, so for example it must be removed from display list, no other objects holding a reference. One thing to pay attention to is weak references. Dictionary objects for example can make use of weak references by passing in a boolean. What this means is when an object is placed in a dictionary that has been set to use weak references it will not count as a reference and therefore be eligible for garbage collection (assuming there are no other references to it)
