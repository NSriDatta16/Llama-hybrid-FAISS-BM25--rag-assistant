Have you looked at the Facebook Developer Toolkit? http://facebooktoolkit.codeplex.com/ If you want to access Facebook APIs from within Silverlight, it's where you should start. This project leverages the Facebook Toolkit above: http://www.silverlight.net/content/samples/apps/facebookclient/sfcquickinstall.aspx So far as I know, the source for it hasn't been released. You could presumably do something similar, but open-source it.
