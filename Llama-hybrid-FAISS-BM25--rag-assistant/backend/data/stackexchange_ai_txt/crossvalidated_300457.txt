Approach #1 and approach #2 are the same kind of approach in broad terms. They are both discrete-time hazard models, where the hazard rate takes logistic form, and they are both estimated using logistic regression. The difference is in the choice of independent variables: approach #2 effectively adds interactions between the time factor and every other independent variable. (Although estimated using 36 separate regressions, this is equivalent to estimating it once including full interactions between the time factor as a categorical variable and every other independent variable.) Since it has (roughly) 36 times more parameters than approach #1, it's not surprising that the AUC and pseudo $R^2$ are much higher. Depending on the number of observations, values close to one could be virtually guaranteed, along with plenty of "insignificant" parameters. Likely, approach #2 is simply overfit, and would not perform well out-of-sample. Approach #1 might, however, benefit from including interactions between age and other variables. For example, it would not be surprising (based on my own domain knowledge) if default rates varied with age in a way that varied with credit rating.
