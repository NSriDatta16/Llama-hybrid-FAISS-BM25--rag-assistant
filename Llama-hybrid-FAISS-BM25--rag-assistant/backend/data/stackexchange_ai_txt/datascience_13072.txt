Data Science Companies

I'm interested in data science market. I was expecting that there would be a lot of companies who are making algorithms and models for companies like in kaggle competitions. But i struggle to find any. Practically every data science company is selling some automated software which makes algorithms/models by its own. So why is that so? Did i understand situation correctly? and if there are companies who make algorithms and models which are the leaders and best companies in that field. thanks p.s. sorry for my bad english
