Under Account tab on the Teamcity Agent's Service property window ( services.msc ), check "Allow service to interact with desktop", that will allow local service account to spawn internet explorer. But you will most certainly get stuck with other stuff, like cookie blocking, password saving etc. so login as local service and fix those stuff. Easiest way to do that is with psexec ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx ), call psexec -i -s cmd.exe so spawn a cmd running as local account, then start internet explorer at setup everything up (the privacy settings in IE for local account is extremely high).
