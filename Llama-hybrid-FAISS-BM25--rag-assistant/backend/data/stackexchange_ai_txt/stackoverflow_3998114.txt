How to organize in folders the UnitTests when the source code is in many folders?

THe source code of my the legacy application I am maintaining is in many folders and subfolders. I am starting creating unittests as a base for refactoring. Do you suggest I put all tests in a single place or for every folder of code i create a subfolder called \FolderNameTests ? Or do you have other suggestions?
