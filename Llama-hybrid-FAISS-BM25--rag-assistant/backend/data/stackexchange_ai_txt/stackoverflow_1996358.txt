How to move all referenced DLLs into seperate folder in c#?

I have a solution with 3 projects in it. 2 of the projects are referencing log4net, and a couple of others DLLs. When I create the install package and add project output for each of the projects - it drops the DLLs into the main "Application Folder". If I drag these DLLs into a seperate folder I've created in the Setup Project, the applications will not run saying "Cannot find log4net". I want these DLL references in something like "bin" or any name really, just not the main folder they add confusion - I just want my 2 .exe's in the main folder. I tried adding a reference path in each project to point to the "bin" folder. Then in the setup project, I added an output folder called "bin" and moved the DLLs into that folder, still doesn't work. What am I missing! I've spent a couple hours looking around trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong, maybe it was the way I was born! Thanks for any help!
