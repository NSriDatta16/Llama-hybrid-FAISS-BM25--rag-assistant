It's a good question but I don't think there's an easy solution. I believe you'll have to create a separate method that groups together your methods to achieve batching in a similiar way to DWR. Ie if you have: public int add(int x, int y); public int sub(int i, int j); You'd create a new method to combine them: public Map addAndSub(Map methodsAndArguments) { // Call add and sub methods with it's arguments } You will still need to handle the whole response in the same callback method of course. I realize it might not be the most elegant solution but due to the way GWTs RPC work I think it's the way to go. With GWT I think you should generally try to write your methods so that batching won't even be an issue you need to consider.
