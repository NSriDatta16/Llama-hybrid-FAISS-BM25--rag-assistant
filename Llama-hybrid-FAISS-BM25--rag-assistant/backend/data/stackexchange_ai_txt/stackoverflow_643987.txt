Abstract storage of data for class based on environment(web/windows)

I have a class and the storage of its information is going to depend on if it is getting consumed by a web or windows application. I was going to use the factory pattern to pass out the correct object. I guess the caller would then store that object appropriately if I did not want to have recreate the object. Anybody have other suggestions on abstracting out the storage of data based on the platform? For example I want to store data as local variables when invoked by windows app (sending out the appropriate subclass) and save in Session when invoked by web app.
