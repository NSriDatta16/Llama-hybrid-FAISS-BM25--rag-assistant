Unfortunately, you have to validate your model using just your training set. When it comes to time series, you also need to be really careful that your training set and your test set have similar seasonality and trends. In other words, if you have ten years of data, and each year has a 12-month cycle, be sure not to split you test/train set in the middle of a year.
