Trainable decision tree? A decision tree that relearns decision boundaries based on new examples?

Trainable decision tree? A decision tree that relearns decision boundaries based on new examples? Does this exist? Application: I can draw good boundaries on the data I have based on intuition, but it's possible that future observations would lead to readjusting of these boundaries, when there comes cases in which the boundaries would lead to a different outcome than what the observed outcome is. There are few references on "SVM partitioned support vector machines". But results seemed mixed.
