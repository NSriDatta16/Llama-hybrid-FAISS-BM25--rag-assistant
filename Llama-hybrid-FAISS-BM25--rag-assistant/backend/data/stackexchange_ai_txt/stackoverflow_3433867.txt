I'm trying to do a similar thing, but the layout only works if I put into one of the following directories: app/design/frontend/base/defaut/layout/[MYMODULE].xml app/design/frontend/[PACKAGE]/defaut/layout/[MYMODULE].xml I don't want to put it into the former because I read that base/default should stay the same, always. I don't want to put it into the latter because it's my theme package folder, which is not the correct place for an unrelated module. I'm running 1.4.1.1. Where should I put this file? EDIT: Got an answer on #magento mattalexx: you should not modify wiles in app/design/frontend/base i (personally) see no problems in adding XML files. Hence it is the only directory you can trust on is present on the user system. mattalexx: place it in base (or default if your still coding 1.3) rooty, 1.4.1.1 it will bubble up I've heard I should completely not touch that folder, as if it were part of the core. well thats true if your writing a customer module but if its a community module your planning on releasing to everyone thats the place to put it in rooty, I like to write customer modules as if I am to be releasing it to the world later. Usually it means that they're more portable Hm, okay, that's great. Thanks rooty then go with the base/default but don't change any existing files to make yours work. TL;DR: Use app/design/frontend/base/defaut/layout/[MYMODULE].xml
