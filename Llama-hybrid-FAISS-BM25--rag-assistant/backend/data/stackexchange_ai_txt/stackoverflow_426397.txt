Do line endings differ between Windows and Linux?

I am trying to parse the Linux /etc/passwd file in Java. I'm currently reading each line through the java.util.Scanner class and then using java.lang.String.split(String) to delimit each line. The problem is that the line: list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/bin/sh" is treated by the scanner as 3 different lines: list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager... When I type this out into a new file that I didn't get from Linux, Scanner parses it properly. Is there something I'm not understanding about new lines in Linux? Obviously a work around is to parse it without using scanner, but it wouldn't be elegant. Does anyone know of an elegant way to do it? Is there a way to convert the file into one that would work with Scanner ? Not even two days ago: Historical reason behind different line ending at different platforms EDIT Note from the original author: "I figured out I have a different error that is causing the problem. Disregard question"
