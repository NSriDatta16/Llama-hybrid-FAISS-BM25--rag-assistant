SVM classification

I have a small data set of 450 instances with feature vector of 21 feature and and I need to classify (binary classification) I applied Support Vector Machine Kernel Linear and RBF. In my case RBF perform poor and Linear kernel perform better. Can anybody suggest why is it the case? Although as we know RBF do perform better. I did optimization for C and gamma and found that C=1 and gamma= 0.7 is best otherwise either the accuracy is same or it get worse.
