Multiple config files across libraries

My ASP.NET MVC 2 application uses Entity Framework 4.0 for the data model. Following the instructions on http://blogs.msdn.com/b/aspnetue/archive/2010/09/17/second_2d00_post.aspx I put the .edmx in its own assembly so my solution has two projects: MyApp.Core (ASP.NET MVC 2 Web Application Project, references MyApp.DataLayer) Models/ Controllers/ Views/ Web.config MyApp.DataLayer (Class Library Project) Entities.edmx App.Config ( When I regenerate Entities.edmx, it creates the App.Config file under MyApp.DataLayer with connection strings to the database. The problem is that when I deploy the solution, the Web.config is the only config also deployed, so I have to manually add these connection strings to it otherwise I get an exception at runtime because they cannot be found. I'd like to not the same connection string defined in both Web.config and App.Config. How should I organize my projects/config files such that the connection string to the db are found in only one place? Is this possible?
