The case is well-covered in Bayesian textbooks , including ours !, and can be summarised by the constraint that one can only test hypotheses for which the prior has a positive probability mass. When the prior is given as a Uniform(0,1), it is impossible to test whether or not $\theta=1/2$ . A contrario, if one comes up with the question as to whether or not $\theta=1/2$ , a prior must be constructed with this possibility in mind, hence must include a point mass at $1/2$ . For instance, a mixture of a Uniform(0,1) and of a point mass at $1/2$ .
