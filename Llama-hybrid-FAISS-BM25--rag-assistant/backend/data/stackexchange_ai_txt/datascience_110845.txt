There is no single best similarity metric, unless a query and found images are near identical. Similarity is not a universal concept. It is trained. Maybe it happened to you to say that a person A looks like B, but your friend does not see the similarity. Here is a nice example of image similarity by Flickr Code illustrating the concept. This article collection helps better understand similarity. Here is a nice example of practical solution to find image similarity for fake photos. I am closely monitoring the topic on Stackexchange, only to observe that many people are trying in vain to find some magic metric. A typical beginner uses SSIM for everything. But the problem is intractable, because of huge number of visual information dimensions, especially semantic ones. One could only imagine what image similarity is for an insect or an octopus. Deep learning works, because a trained network is an approximation and generalization over training examples. It is like web-search results, which can be good based on click stats from many users, but not good in one specific case. It is a ranking problem with focus on particular metrics of interest, or common cases.
