you can configure your bus manually and start it only after your data has been loaded: bus = Configure.With() .StructureMapBuilder(ObjectFactory.Container) .XmlSerializer() .MsmqTransport() .IsTransactional(true) .PurgeOnStartup(false) .MsmqSubscriptionStorage() .Sagas() .UnicastBus() .ImpersonateSender(false) .CreateBus() .Start(); this is just an example. you have to edit the configuration for yourself. for alternatives please post more details about the nature of your data and what transformations are being done with them.
