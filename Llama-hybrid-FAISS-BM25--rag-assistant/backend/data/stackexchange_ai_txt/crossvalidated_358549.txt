not sure if it's correct to do so but I found the answer to my question so I'll answer myself: the way I am (was) addressing the issue is not correct . In fact, I was using NMF to factorize a matrix, and then trying to reconstruct the matrix using its own values (both when the dictionary was derived from the same matrix, of from another dataset). This is NOT correct, as explained here about PCA: How to perform cross-validation for PCA to determine the number of principal components? More correct approaches to perform CV in these contexts are provided in this article: Cross-validation of component models (Bro et al., 2008) , and an alternative method for performing CV in SVD and NMF has been suggested in: Bi-cross-validation for SVD and NMF (Owen and Perry, 2009) . Hope it might help someone else!
