How to use JQuery to remove dynamic content?

I have an html page that is generated by a CMS. I cannot modify the page, but can add JavaScript. Each time the page loads, a JavaScript function (that I cannot modify) dynamically inserts a paragraph onto the page. How can I use JQuery to .remove() that paragraph whenever it is loaded? For example, when the page first loads, it look like this (blank): Then, a few seconds later, a JavaScript function (that I have no control over) adds a paragraph to the page. The page then looks like this: bar How can I use JQuery to remove the paragraph with id=foo each time it is dynamically loaded onto the page?
