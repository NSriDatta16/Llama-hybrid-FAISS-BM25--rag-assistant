What is the input for Conv2d for text?

I have an embedding layer that returns a tensor of type: batch x max_len x embeddings_dim (8 x 200 x 300) I want to input this to a Conv2d layer with kernel 3x3. I tried conv = Conv2d(300, 100, (3,3)) conv(embedding) # embedding.shape = (8 x 200 x 300 x 1) I get an error: Torch: invalid memory size -- maybe an overflow? What should be the input of the Conv2d ?
