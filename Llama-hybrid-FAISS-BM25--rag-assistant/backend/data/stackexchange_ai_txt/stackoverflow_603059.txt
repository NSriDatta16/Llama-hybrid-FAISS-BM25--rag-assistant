How to use draggable sections like on iGoogle?

When viewing iGoogle, each section is able to be drag-and-dropped to anywhere else on the page and then the state of the page is saved. I am curious on how this is done as I would like to provide this functionality as part of a proof of concept? UPDATE How do you make it so that the layout you changed to is saved for the next load? I am going to guess this is some sort of cookie?
