If it does, how could one deal with this problem? Any references? You can use hierarchical softmax, importance sampling, noise contrastive estimation, or negative sampling: they are commonly used in language modeling, for example. FYI: Why is hierarchical softmax better for infrequent words, while negative sampling is better for frequent words? (The answer gives a brief overview of what hierarchical softmax and negative sampling are) http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ section "12.4.3 High-Dimensional Outputs": presents hierarchical softmax, importance sampling, noise contrastive estimation, and negative sampling.
