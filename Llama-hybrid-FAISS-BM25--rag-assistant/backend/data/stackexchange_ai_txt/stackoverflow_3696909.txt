This has nothing to do with PHP, but is the default behaviour of your browser. # is not a valid URL, but a so-called Fragment Identifier. It has a special meaning in URLs, directing the browser to look for an anchor of that name in the target document. A URL pointing to # only will point to the current document's beginning. I'm not sure what you want to do, but URLs must not contain this character in their address part.
