A simple-minded (that is, non-measure-theoretic) version of the answer is as follows. If random variables $X$ and $Y$ are such that every point $(x,y)$ in a region $\mathcal A$ of the plane is a possible realization of $(X,Y)$ The area of $\mathcal A$ is greater than $0$ and $P\{(X,Y) \in \mathcal A\} = 1$ then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be jointly continuous random variables, and their probabilistic behavior can be determined from their joint density function $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ whose support is $\mathcal A$. Note that $X$ and $Y$ are also (marginally) continuous random variables. If $(X,Y)$ have a bivariate normal distribution, then they are marginally normal random variables too. In particular, $X$ and $Y$ are continuous random variables. But $X$ and $Y$ are jointly continuous (and thus enjoy the bivariate normal joint density function that you have found or been told about) only if their (Pearson) correlation coefficient $\rho \in (-1,1)$. When $\rho = \pm 1$, $X$ and $Y$ are not jointly continuous and they don't have a joint density function. They do, however, continue to enjoy the properties stated in the highlighted paragraph above. that is, they are still said to have a bivariate normal distribution (even though they don't have the bivariate normal density ), and they are individually normal random variables (and hence continuous). Note that in this case, all realizations of $(X,Y)$ lie on the straight line $$y = \mu_Y + \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}(x-\mu_X)$$ passing through $(\mu_X,\mu_Y)$. Note that the straight line has zero area. Since $Y = \mu_Y + \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}(X-\mu_X)$, any questions about the probabilistic behavior of $(X,Y)$ can be translated into a question about the probabilistic behavior of $X$ alone and answered based on the knowledge that $X \sim N(\mu_X,\sigma_X^2)$. Since it is also true that $X = \mu_X + \frac{\sigma_X}{\sigma_Y}(Y-\mu_Y)$, contrary-minded folks might prefer to translate the question about $(X,Y)$ that has been asked into a question about the probabilistic behavior of $Y$ alone and answer it based on the knowledge that $Y \sim N(\mu_Y,\sigma_Y^2)$
