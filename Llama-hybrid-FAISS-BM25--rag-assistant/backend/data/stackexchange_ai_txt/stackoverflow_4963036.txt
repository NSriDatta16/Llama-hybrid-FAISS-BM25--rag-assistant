Python: How to replace a property with a regular attribute?

The base class has this: def _management_form(self): # code here return form management_form = property(_management_form) In my derived class, I'm trying to write this: self.management_form = self.myfunc() But of course it doesn't work. It tells me "can't set attribute" because that property has no setter. But I don't want to set it, I want to redefine what "managent_form" means. I tried putting del self.managent_form first, but that didn't work either. So how do I unproperty-ize it?
