Have seperate tables for the total pages in your system and have a cross reference table between the pages table with users table. Perform only updates and update the indicators that you need in the reports. Are users registered on your site? Did you try using the server log files for site statistics (Apache/IIS)? You should also plan to analyze the data in the access log to extract information about total request and page counts, bandwidth, popular pages, user paths, browser usage etc. There will be lot of information in server log files. Also take a look at ganglia , maybe you can externalize this whole operation from your core system
