Well you are both right and you are both wrong. A big part depends on what you mean by "guessing". If by guessing you mean flip a coin and therefor predict good/bad each with 50% probability independent of the actual value then you would predict correctly 50% of the time. Since you predict the correct value 75% of the time that means that yes your are doing better than guessing. But, by guessing you could also mean predict bad every time (guess the most likely outcome ignoring the x variables) then you would be correct 75% of the time, since your model does not improve on this, it is not better than guessing (for this definition of guessing). What this really shows is that percent predicted correctly is not really a very good metric for logistic regression. There are other metrics that are better, if you use the lrm function from the rms package (by the way, there is no glm function in MASS) it will compute some better measures (the C statistic for example). Do you find value in the actual predicted probabilities? This is sometimes the advantage of a logistic regression model over just choosing a classification. If you only care about the prediction class and you use 0.5 as the cutoff then that means that you will treat a prediction of 0.01 and 0.49 exactly the same as each other, but you will treat a prediction of 0.51 differently than 0.49, but the same as 0.99. Does knowing that one subject has a prediction of 0.1 and another 0.45 (even though they would both be the same predicted class) gives us additional information.
