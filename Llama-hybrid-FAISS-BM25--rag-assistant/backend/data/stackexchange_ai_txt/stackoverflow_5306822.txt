C++ HTTP always 301 using sockets

I'm sick of this. ALWAYS when I make a HTTP GET query from a C/C++ program using just plain sockets I get 301 Moved Permanently's. Normally I'd use libcURL, but in this case I don't want to add another library, I just need to download one flat identification file from one fixed server. This is my current query: GET /game/getversion.jsp?user=nightcracker&password=yeahright&version=12 HTTP/1.1\r\n Connection: close\r\n Host: www.minecraft.net\r\n Accept-Encoding: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, */*; q=.2\r\n \r\n I have tried EVERYTHING, and everything just gets answered with this funny message: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Server: nginx/0.6.32 Date: Tue, 15 Mar 2011 02:18:11 GMT Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 185 Connection: close Location: http://www.minecraft.net/game/getversion.jsp?user=nightcracker&password=yeahright&version=12 301 Moved Permanently 301 Moved Permanently nginx/0.6.32 I remember this issue from before and I ragequitted before. Now I want to fix this damn bugger. So tell me SO, why do all my HTTP queries always give back a 301?
