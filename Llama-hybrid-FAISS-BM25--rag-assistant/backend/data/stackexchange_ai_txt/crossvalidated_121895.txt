Creating a treatment group to measure uplift in sales for an advertising campaign

I have sales by state and week. Alabama|Alaska|Arizona|... 231|139|277|... 256|154|307|... 267|160|320|... 256|154|307|... 267|160|320|... I need to create a treatment group that bunches up the states that represent 30% of sales (which will be impacted by an advertising campaign) and a 70% control group. How do I go about splitting them in a way that will give me the maximum correlation? The idea is to use a time series analysis and measure uplift in sales in the treatment vs. control group. I am diving into R head first, so any way of doing so in that language would be icing on the cake. Thanks! J
