MCMC with flat prior vs. glmer

Is MCMC-based mixed model with flat prior basically just a robust variant of a classical mixed model? I mean â€“ frequentist analyses work with a flat prior anyway so the only difference should be in the more reliable method. Am I right? If so, what is the point in NOT using MCMC all the time on modern devices? Thanks.
