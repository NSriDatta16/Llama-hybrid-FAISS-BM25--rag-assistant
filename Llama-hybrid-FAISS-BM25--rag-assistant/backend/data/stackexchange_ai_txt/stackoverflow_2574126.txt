The naive approach is simply calculating an average per timeinterval corresponding to a pixel. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Euro_exchange_rate_to_AUD.svg This does not show flunctuations. I would suggest also calculating the standard deviation in each time interval and plot that too (essentially making each pixel higher than one single pixel). I could not locate an example, but I know that Gnuplot can do this (but is not written in Java).
