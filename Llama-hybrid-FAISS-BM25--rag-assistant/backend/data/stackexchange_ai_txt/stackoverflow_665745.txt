What's the best way to do a reverse 'for' loop with an unsigned index?

My first attempt of reverse for loop that does something n times was something like: for ( unsigned int i = n-1; i >= 0; i-- ) { ... } This fails because in unsigned arithmetic i is guaranteed to be always greater or equal than zero, hence the loop condition will always be true. Fortunately, gcc compiler warned me about a 'pointless comparison' before I had to wonder why the loop was executing infinitely. I'm looking for an elegant way of resolving this issue keeping in mind that: It should be a backwards for loop. The loop index should be unsigned. n is unsigned constant. It should not be based on the 'obscure' ring arithmetics of unsigned integers. Any ideas? Thanks :)
