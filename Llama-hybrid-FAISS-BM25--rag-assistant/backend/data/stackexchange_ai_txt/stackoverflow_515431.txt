Interesting set of posts. I have a web application which is customized on a per customer basis. Each customer gets a core set of components and additional components depending on what they have signed up for. For each release we have to 'assemble' the correct set of services and apply the correct menu config (we use struts menu) based on the customer, which is tedious to say the least. Basically its the same code base but we simply customize navigation to expose or hide certain pages. This is obviously not ideal and we would like to leverage OSGi to componentize services. While I can see how this is done for service APIs and sort of understand how resources like CSS and java script and controllers (we use Spring MVC) could also be bundled, how would you go about dealing with 'cross cutting' concerns like page navigation and general work flow especially in the scenario where you want to dynamically deploy a new service and need to add navigation to that service. There may also be other 'cross cutting' concerns like services that span other of other services. Thanks, Declan.
