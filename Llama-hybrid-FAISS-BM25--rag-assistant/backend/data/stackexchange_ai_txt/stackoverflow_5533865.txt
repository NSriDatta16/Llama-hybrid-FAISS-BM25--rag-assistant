Need help with Zend_Auth Storage

Currently I have this code (Fetching user informations from Database then store into Zend_Auth session storage) $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance(); $storage = $auth->getStorage(); $storage->write($authAdapter->getResultRowObject(array('email', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'providerId'))); // store into session But now I wanted to store a role variable in the storage as well (the problem is that my user table doesn't have a role column therefore I wanted to add a role variable to the storage). So how can I add an extra role variable to the storage? is it possible? Thanks so much !
