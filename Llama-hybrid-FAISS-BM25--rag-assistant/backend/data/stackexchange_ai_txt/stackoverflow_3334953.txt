There are plenty of methods with catchy names, but in general I prefer the management style to be lightweight and encourage communication. I suspect a lot of us have had the experience of having to spend more time filling out forms than actually developing. Than is both frustrating and unnecessary. Controls are important, but a new form is not the solution to every managerial problem. As far as communication goes, many managers seem to believe that it will work if everyone reports up to them and then they send the collected information back down. That can really lead to disaster. The team needs to communicate with each other well and often. Finally, I'd like to throw in that as tempting as it is to take a new resource for a project and get them developing as quick as possible, I think it will always work out better in the long run to hold off and get them properly trained and oriented to the project.
