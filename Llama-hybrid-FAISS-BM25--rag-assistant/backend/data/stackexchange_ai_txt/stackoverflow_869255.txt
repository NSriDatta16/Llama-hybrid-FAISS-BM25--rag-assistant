IIS WCF Service Accesed via JAVA with NTLM Authentication

We have a WCF Service hosted in IIS 6 with Integrated Windows Authentication turned on under Directory Security. Consuming this service from a .NET Windows client the cached NTLM credentials flow to the Server PC and things work great. We would like to have the same occur when a Java client accesses the service (via the WSDL generated objects) from a Windows PC. Everything we have scoured on the net seems to state that we will not need to hard code the username/password into the Java code if we leverage the Sun java.net.authenticator and run the process on the Windows platform. Is this true? We have a solution using Axis 2.0 and its proprietary NTLM authenticator, however we had to hard code the username/password. Ideally, we'd like the NTLM cached credentials to flow automatically to the server. It seems like this should be possible since the Java process is running on a Windows PC. Thoughts?
