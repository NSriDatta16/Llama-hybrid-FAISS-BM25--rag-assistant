selectAnnotation after removing then re-addingAnnotation

Hey all, I got somewhat of a dense question about the mapKit for the iPhone. I'm using the MapKit framework and what I'm trying to do is basically click a pin, reload it and then show it's callOut after it has been added again. This is the code I'm trying to get to work.. -(void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didSelectAnnotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)view{ NSLog(@"count of selected Annotations: %d",[mapView selectedAnnotations].count); MKAnnotation* pin = view.annotation; [mapView deselectAnnotation:pin animated:FALSE]; [mapView removeAnnotation:pin]; [mapView addAnnotation:pin]; [self.mapView selectAnnotation:pin animated:TRUE]; A few observations: If I comment the removeAnnotations and addAnnotation lines out, I enter an infinite loop because when I selectAnnotation:pin, the callback (which is this method) is called... otherwise, it isn't, but then what is? why isn't [self.mapView selectAnnotation:pin animated:TRUE]; being called? I've already read far too much and broke my head for far too many hours trying to figure this out that an explanation and a fix to my code would be much more helpful than a link. Thanks in advance. ~Fydo
