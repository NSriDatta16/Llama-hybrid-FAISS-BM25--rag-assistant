This is something I'm currently considering myself, but I haven't tried it yet. TableServiceContext inherets from DataServiceContext, so I figure if you could inject the TableServiceContext as a DataServiceContext, you could model the Table Store using data services. Taking it a step further, if you use Entity Framework "Code First" to create your Entity Model - you could just use the Table Entities you've already created as the backing entities for your data service and everything should work smoothly. That's the theory at least. I've never tried it. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.storageclient.tableservicecontext_members.aspx
