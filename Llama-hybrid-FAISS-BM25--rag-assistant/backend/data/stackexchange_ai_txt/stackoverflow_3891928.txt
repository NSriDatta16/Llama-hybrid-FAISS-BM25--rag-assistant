There is no URL that will point to this. Everything within WEB-INF is not exposed to the outside world. Rather, if you organised the WAR layout like this: foo.war -->/WEB-INF -->/classes (..) -->web.xml -->/js -->bar.js -->index.jsp Then you could access your Javascript as http://example.com/blah/js/bar.js . P.S. You won't be able to access index.jsp either, the way you have things set up at the moment.
