Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) VS Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

What's the difference between Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? This is our data. It's a 3D plot. Here I use LPP and PCA to reduce the 3D data to 2D data. It gives different results. I know that PCA reduces the dimension on maximum variance, but what about LPP? Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
