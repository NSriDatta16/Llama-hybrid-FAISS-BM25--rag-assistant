Consistency of covariance matrix estimate in linear regression

Show that $\hat{\theta} =\frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}\hat{u_i}^{2}x_i'x_i $ is a consistent estimator for $E(u^2x_i'x_i)$ , by showing: $$\frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}\hat{u_i}^{2}x_i'x_i = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}{u_i^{2}}x_i'x_i + o_p(1),$$ where $\hat{u}_i=y_i-x_i\hat\beta$ are the OLS residuals of the following regression model $$y_i = x_i\beta + u_i,$$ where $x_i$ is a $1\times K$ vector, $\beta$ is a $K\times 1$ vector and $y_i$ with $u_i$ are scalars. We assume that $(y_i,x_i,u_i)$ , $i=1,...,N$ forms an iid sample. We should use the following hints: $\hat{u}_i^2$ = $u_i^2 - 2u_ix_i(\hat{\beta}-\beta) + [x_i(\hat{\beta}-\beta)]^2$ $\hat{\beta} - \beta$ = $o_p(1)$ Sample averages are $O_p(1)$ . We assume all necessary expectations exist and are finite. I'm getting stuck with this. I know I must be missing some simple sort of substitution or there is some gap in my knowledge or understanding preventing me from making the necessary manipulations. I would love if someone could walk me through this and explain the intuition a bit here.
