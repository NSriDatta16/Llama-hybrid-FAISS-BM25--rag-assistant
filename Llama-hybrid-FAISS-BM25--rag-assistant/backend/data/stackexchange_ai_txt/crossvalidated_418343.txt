There are a whole host of options to determine variable importance. As you mentioned random forest has a variable importance metric built in. R package DALEX also has a model agnostic approach similar to the random forest importance but is model agnostic. When you say these donâ€™t have effect sizes I would disagree and say they are quite interpretable. I would also suggest information theoretic methods such as information gain, though this assumes conditional independence between variables. Lastly you could look at the relief algorithm which to some extent considers dependence between predictors and works with all variable types
