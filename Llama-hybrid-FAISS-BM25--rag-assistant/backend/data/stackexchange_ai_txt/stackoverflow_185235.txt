jQuery tabs - getting newly selected index

I've previously used jquery-ui tabs extension to load page fragments via ajax , and to conceal or reveal hidden div s within a page. Both of these methods are well documented, and I've had no problems there. Now, however, I want to do something different with tabs. When the user selects a tab, it should reload the page entirely - the reason for this is that the contents of each tabbed section are somewhat expensive to render, so I don't want to just send them all at once and use the normal method of toggling 'display:none' to reveal them. My plan is to intercept the tabs' select event, and have that function reload the page with by manipulating document.location. How, in the select handler, can I get the newly selected tab index and the html LI object it corresponds to? $('#edit_tabs').tabs( { selected: 2, // which tab to start on when page loads select: function(e, ui) { var t = $(e.target); // alert("data is " + t.data('load.tabs')); // undef // alert("data is " + ui.data('load.tabs')); // undef // This gives a numeric index... alert( "selected is " + t.data('selected.tabs') ) // ... but it's the index of the PREVIOUSLY selected tab, not the // one the user is now choosing. return true; // eventual goal is: // ... document.location= extract-url-from(something); return false; } }); Is there an attribute of the event or ui object that I can read that will give the index, id, or object of the newly selected tab or the anchor tag within it? Or is there a better way altogether to use tabs to reload the entire page?
