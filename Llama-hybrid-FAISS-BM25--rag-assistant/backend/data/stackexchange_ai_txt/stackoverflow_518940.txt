As others have noted, including windows.h is probably your problem. Microsoft provides a means to "turn off" parts of windows.h with preprocessor symbols. You can define these symbols as part of your build or directly in code. Using preprocessor symbols to conditionally skip sections of windows.h may or may not be considered elegant but in the general case it is an easier, more general and more scalable solution than #undef . Here's how to skip defining min or max as macros: #define NOMINMAX #include Note that many include files will, at some point, include windows.h . In such cases setting up your defines at a more global level may be more convenient. If you search through windows.h , you can find a bunch of other preprocessor symbols (e.g., NOOPENFILE , NOKANJI , NOKERNEL and many others) that can often be useful.
