How can I estimate the delay between two non-periodic time series?

I'm wondering what the best way to estimate the delay and confidence between two non-periodic time series would be. Specifically, I thought it would be interesting to look at the different economic indicators, say the price of oil and a stock price, and determine whether one predicts the other, with how much confidence and by how far in advance. Most of the answers I've been able to find so far have described periodic time series and phase difference in radians. It is not clear to me how this type of analysis would convert to non-periodic data and difference in time instead of angle. It may be possible to glean some information from treating the data as periodic, so that's not completely out. Any reading recommendations? Thanks!
