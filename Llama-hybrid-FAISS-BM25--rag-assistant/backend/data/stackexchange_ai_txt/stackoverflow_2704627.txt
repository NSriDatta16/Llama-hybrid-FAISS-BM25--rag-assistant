Sure - ASP.Net MVC 2 Areas is a nice way to organize your site into functional areas. Suppose you have a site which needs the following sections: Admin - manages the web site Blog - a place to put in a blog Account - a place for registered users to manage their own account ... You can then consider each of those sections as "areas" of your application & organize them accordingly... HTH.
