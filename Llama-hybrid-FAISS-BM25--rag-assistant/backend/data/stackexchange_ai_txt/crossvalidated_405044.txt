A threshold isn't trained with the model because logistic regression isn't a classifier (cf., Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? ). It is a model to estimate the parameter, $p$ , that governs the behavior of the Bernoulli distribution. That is, you are assuming that the response distribution, conditional on the covariates, is Bernoulli, and so you want to estimate how the parameter that controls that variable changes as a function of the covariates. It is a direct probability model only . Of course, it can be used as a classifier subsequently, and sometimes is in certain contexts, but it is still a probability model.
