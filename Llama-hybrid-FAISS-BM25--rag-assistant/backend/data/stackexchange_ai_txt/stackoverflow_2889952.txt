A consistent and simple group of IDE and tools for embedded code and unit test in C++?

I’m starting a new firmware project in C++ for Texas Instrument C283xx and C6xxx targets . The unit tests will not run on the target , but will be compiled with gcc/gcov on a PC with windows (and run as well on PC) with simple metrics for tested code coverage. The whole project will be part of Cruise Control.NET for continuous integrations. My question is: what are the consistent IDE / framework / tools to work together? A/ One of the developers says CodeComposerStudio V3.1 for application and CodeBlocks + CxxUnit for the Unit tests. B/ I’m more attracted with CodeComposerStudio V4 for application, Eclipse CDT (well, as CCS V4) and CppUnit for unit test + MockCpp for mocks. I don’t want the best in class tools for each process , but a global, consistent and easy solution (or group of tools if you prefer).
