You also have to specify the size with CHAR . With CHAR , column values are padded with spaces to fill the size you specified, whereas with VARCHAR , only the actual value you specified is stored. For example: CREATE TABLE test ( char_value CHAR(10), varchar_value VARCHAR(10) ); INSERT INTO test VALUES ('a', 'b'); SELECT * FROM test; The above will select "a " for char_value and "b" for varchar_value If all your values are about the same size, the CHAR is possibly a better choice because it will often require less storage space than VARCHAR . This is because VARCHAR stores both the length of the value and the value itself, whereas CHAR can just store the (fixed-size) value.
