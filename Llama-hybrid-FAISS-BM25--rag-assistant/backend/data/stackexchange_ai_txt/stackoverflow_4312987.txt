What kind of WPF control to use?

I want to create a 2D control that looks like a can. One color on the bottom and another color on the side. I will place many instances of this control on a canvas, and the canvas inside av viewbox. I need support for tooltip, rightclick and drag&drop. It also has to support databinding and resizing. What is the best way to create this control? Any advise is welcome. Thanks!
