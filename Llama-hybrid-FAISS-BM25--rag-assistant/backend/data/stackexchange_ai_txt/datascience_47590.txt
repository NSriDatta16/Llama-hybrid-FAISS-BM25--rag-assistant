How to detect different brands of milk

I'm trying to create a object detection model to detect different type of milk. What is the best approach to achieve the result in the picture below? As you can see in the picture, this model did pretty well on locating and detecting different brand of milks. I've tried Faster R-CNN but they mix up products with similar shape really bad(not only on the classifier but also on the religion proposal net). I labeled my training images in the same way as in the picture below. Any help will be appreciated!
