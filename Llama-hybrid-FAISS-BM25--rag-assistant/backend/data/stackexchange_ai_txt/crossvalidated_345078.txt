Decreasing accuracy of neural network after long training

I trained a MLP network in Tensorflow which reached at some point 98.66 % accuracy. I used the MNIST data set and five hidden layers of the following size: 4096, 2048, 4096, 2048, 4096. In Tensorflow I used the Adam Optimizer to minimize the cost. After a while the accuracy started to decrease until it reached about 11 % where the network got stuck. What could be a possible reason for this behavior?
