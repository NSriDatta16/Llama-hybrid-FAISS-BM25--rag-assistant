What is the best VCS Solution for Windows?

My code base is getting quite big and it's difficult to organize all the different branches using just directories, I was wondering what would be a decent version control system for my own personal use that works (with little hassle) on Windows? PS: I'm not looking for hosted VCS like GitHub, SourceForge or Google Code.
