By GLS do you mean GLM? The GLM is a method of iteratively reweighted least squares which takes the mean-variance relationship into account when estimating the model parameters. Generalized Least Squares will still either suffer from an overfitting issue (infinite weights), or overprediction (fitted probabilities greater than 1 or less than 0). The logistic regression model is commonly used to test for associations with binary outcomes. It's possible to go further and use Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), conditional logistic regression, or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for certain correlation structures in the data. The nlme package has the mixed models, survival has clogit, and the geese package for GEEs.
