F test to test equality of variance

I have a single time series which will be divided on the date of the change before and after. I want to compare the variances between the two time sections and I am told to do an F test of residual sum of squares. How do I construct the F stat? Do I run ARMA and get the residual sum of squares of the two time sections and get an F stat of the ratio of the two residual sum of squares or a ratio of two error variances? Or do I do simple F test of the equality of variance of data in each of the two time sections? Thanks a lot.
