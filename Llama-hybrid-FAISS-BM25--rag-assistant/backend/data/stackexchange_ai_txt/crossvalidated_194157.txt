Diagonal linear discriminant analysis

On p110 of Murphy's machine learning book, he derives the discriminant function for the diagonal LDA model by simplifying the full linear discriminant analysis equation (4.33): It seems that he's discarded the normalization constants to get the expression for $\delta_c {\bf{x}}$. Why? I haven't come across the notation $\delta_c {\bf{x}}$ before - what does this mean?
