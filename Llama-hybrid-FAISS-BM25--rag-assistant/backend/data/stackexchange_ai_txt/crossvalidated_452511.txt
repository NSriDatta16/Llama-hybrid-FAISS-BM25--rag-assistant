Consequences of applying PCA before logistic regression

I am doing a machine learning assignment and I have been asked a question that I have no idea about. I have read my notes and also some posts online, but I can not find anything related. Any idea about how to deal with this? Having a dataset with labels, where we apply PCA to 2D and 3D as feature transformation, will it improve, reduce or have no effect on performance if we use Logistic Regression to classify the data?
