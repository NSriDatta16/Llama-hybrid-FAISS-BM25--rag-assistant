I do not know the packages you are using or their internal working but perhaps the choice of priors matter? Perhaps, you should consider using different prior structures to see how sensitive the mcmc marginal likelihoods are to your choice of priors. In particular, I suspect that the mcmc and the traditional likelihoods are likely to converge better as the priors become more diffuse. Note that in mcmc the marginal likelihoods are computed by integrating out the likelihood function with respect to the priors. Thus, I have a feeling that the 'diffuseness' of the priors may matter (could be wrong on this issue but worth checking out).
