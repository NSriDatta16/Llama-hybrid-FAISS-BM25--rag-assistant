What happens when you add a varying term to the thresholds in ordered logistic regression?

Specifically, I would like to know what ologit in STATA estimates because I tried a simulation and I had really weird outputs. So I'd like to know how exactly adding a varying term to each threshold e.g. 2*x affects the outcome of the ordered logistic model.
