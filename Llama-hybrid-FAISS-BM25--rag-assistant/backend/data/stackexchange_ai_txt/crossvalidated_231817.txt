How is missing data calculated on Likert Scale?

I have the following scales: 1 (Strongly Disagree); 2 (Disagree); 3 (Not Applicable) ; 4 (Agree); 5 (Strongly Agree); Questionnaire responses: Question Item1: 2; Question Item2: 3 ; Question Item3: 1; Question Item4: 1; Question Item5: 4; If I need to average the above responses into the Excel Sheet, while treating Question Item2: zero (since it is considered missing data), do I need to divide by 5 or 4 items to obtain the average? $$\text{Average} = \frac{2 + \mathbf 0 + 1 + 1+ 4}{5}\quad\text{or}\quad\text{Average} = \frac{2 + \mathbf{\_} + 1 + 1+ 4}{4}$$ Kindly advise.
