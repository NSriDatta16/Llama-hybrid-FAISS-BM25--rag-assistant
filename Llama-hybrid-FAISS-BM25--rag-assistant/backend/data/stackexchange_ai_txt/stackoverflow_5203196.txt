PHP Json Encoding an array

Im a newbie in PHP (also JSON for that matter) but I am not sure/confident of the format of the json data i have. I am converting a mysql into json for use in another application, and the format i am getting is as follows: [ { "category": { "catId":"1", "categoryName":"BABY FOOD", "categoryNotes":"ONLY baby food varieties which have been listed below should be used. However if your doctor or pediatrician requires a specific diet please contact your Rabbi for further advice." } }, { "category": { "catId":"2", "categoryName":"BAKING INGREDIENTS", "categoryNotes":"" } }, { "category": { "catId":"131", "categoryName":"BEER", "categoryNotes":"See Alcoholic Drinks" } }, { "category": { "catId":"4", "categoryName":"BEVERAGES - Powdered", "categoryNotes":"" } }, { "category": { "catId":"5", "categoryName":"BISCUITS", "categoryNotes":"Locally produced biscuits usually contain fats, oils or improvers of non-kosher origin. There is a very large range of Israeli, South African and American kosher biscuits available locally. Even these imported biscuits and crackers (including Israeli produced goods) should only be used if marked with a reliable Rabbinic Hechsher. A 'K' on the packet alone is insufficient. Please note which products are dairy or pareve." } }, { "category": { "catId":"6", "categoryName":"BREAD AND BAKERY GOODS", "categoryNotes":"Bread usually contains or comes in contact with Non-Kosher oils, fats or improvers and cannot be accepted as kosher without thorough investigation and subsequent authorisation" } }, { "category": { "catId":"7", "categoryName":"BREAD\/CORN\/RICE CRUMBS", "categoryNotes":"" } }, { "category": { "catId":"8", "categoryName":"BUTTER AND DAIRY BLENDS", "categoryNotes":"Soft butters, butter spreads & dairy blends are NOT ACCEPTABLE unless specifically listed. Butter made from whey cream is NOT ACCEPTABLE unless produced under Rabbinic supervision" } }, { "category": { "catId":"9", "categoryName":"BUTTERMILK and LEBEN ", "categoryNotes":"" } }, { "category": { "catId":"10", "categoryName":"CAKES & CAKE SHOPS", "categoryNotes":"Cakes and cake mixes usually contain Non-Kosher ingredients, and must only be used if they are produced under supervision Cakes bought in a Non-Kosher cake shop, even if containing only kosher ingredients are NOT ACCEPTABLE because of the Non-Kosher utensils used in their preparation" } }, { "category": { "catId":"11", "categoryName":"CEREALS ", "categoryNotes":"" } }, ... ] and so forth. Now I am not sure if this is the right format, but my code to generate this is as follows: $category); } } header('Content-type: application/json'); echo json_encode($categories); ?> Based on my code, am i doing this right? Is the array converted correctly into JSON?
