Bayesian uninformative priors vs. frequentist null hypotheses: what's the relationship?

I came across this image in a blog post here . I was disappointed that reading the statement did not elicit the same facial expression for me as it did for this guy. So, what is meant by the statement that the null hypothesis is how frequentists express an uninformative prior? Is it really true? Edit: I'm hoping someone can offer a charitable interpretation that makes the statement true, even in some loose sense.
