How to interpret ACF/PACF plots with no recent lag correlations?

I have a time-series data that looks like this: There is obviously an upward trend in this data, so I do differencing with lag of 1, i.e., Series = Y(t) - Y(t-1) The differenced series looks as follows: When I compute and plot the ACF and PACF for the obtained time series above, I get the following plots: In the PACF, no recent lags show significant correlation, however, at lag 9 there is a very high correlation - what does this mean? Can somebody please help me understand how to interpret these plots and what conclusion should I arrive to about the p, d, q parameters of an ARIMA model for this data? Thanks in advance. I'm a novice. EDIT: Below are the ACF/PACF plots for the original time-series:
