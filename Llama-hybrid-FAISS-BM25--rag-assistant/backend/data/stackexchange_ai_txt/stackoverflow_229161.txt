I usually use YourKit which is an excellent application (license needed). In your webservers startup/shutdown script (catalina.sh for tomcat) put in: JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -agentlib:yjpagent -Xrunyjpagent:sessionname=Tomcat" You'll need YourKit already downloaded and added to your library path (I do this in catalina.sh as well): LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/yourkit/yjp-6.0.16/bin/linux-x86-32 You can then launch the YourKit client on your local desktop and remotely connect.
