Limit yourself to evaluate the traits that you can legitimately, well, evaluate. Ask another, knowledgeable individual to judge what you cannot. Also, you can ask the candidate to explain you about iPhone development, explain that you are not familiar with it, and judge the response: candidate is arrogant about it? Candidate gets excited about it? Candidate can clearly explain train of thought? Candidate "makes sense"? All this are traits that you can legitimately judge and they do matter for any position. Again, don't try to evaluate what you yourself don't know.
