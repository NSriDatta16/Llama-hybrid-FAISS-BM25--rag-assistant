I think that you have to train your model first. To do that in sagemaker, you can do the following. I assume that you want to train a machine learning model without using a python script as an entry point. First, define your hyper-parameters : test_model.set_hyperparameters( max_depth = 5, eta = 0.2, gamma = 4, min_child_weight = 6, subsample = 0.7, objective = "binary:logistic", num_round = 1000 ) Then you have to define your train and validation inputs. for example : train_input = TrainingInput( "s3://{}/{}/{}".format(bucket, prefix, "data/train.csv"), content_type="csv" ) validation_input = TrainingInput( "s3://{}/{}/{}".format(bucket, prefix, "data/validation.csv"), content_type="csv" ) Finally, you have to call the .fit() method to train your model : test_model.fit({"train": train_input, "validation": validation_input}, wait=True) In case that you want to train a model through a python script (an entry point), you can refer to this example : https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-script-mode/tree/master/tf-sentiment-script-mode
