bootstrap p value

Using our baseline bootstrap, for each fund i, we draw a sample with replacement from the fund residuals that are saved in the first step above, creating a pseudo–time series of resampled residuals, {ˆb i,tε , tε = sb Ti0 , ... , sb Ti1 }, where b is an index for the bootstrap number (so b = 1 for bootstrap resample number 1), and where each of the time indices sb Ti0 , ... , sb Ti1 are drawn randomly from [Ti0,...,Ti1] in such a way that reorders the original sample of Ti1 − Ti0 + 1 residuals for fund i. Conversely, the original chronological ordering of the factor returns is unaltered; we relax this restriction in a different version of our bootstrap below. Next, we construct a time series of pseudo–monthly excess returns for this fund, imposing the null hypothesis of zero true performance (αi = 0, or, equivalently, tˆ αˆi = 0), rb i,t = βˆiRMRFt + sˆiSMBt + hˆ iHMLt + pˆiPR1YRt + ˆ b i,tε , (4) for t = Ti0, ... , Ti1 and tε = sb Ti0 , ... , sb Ti1 . As equation (4) indicates, this sequence of artificial returns has a true alpha (and t-statistic of alpha) that is zero by construction. However, when we next regress the returns for a given bootstrap sample, b, on the Carhart factors, a positive estimated alpha (and t-statistic) may result, since that bootstrap may have drawn an abnormally high number of positive residuals, or, conversely, a negative alpha (and t-statistic) may result if an abnormally high number of negative residuals are drawn. Repeating the above steps across all funds i = 1, ... , N, we arrive at a draw from the cross section of bootstrapped alphas. Repeating this for all bootstrap iterations, b = 1, ... , 1,000, we then build the distribution of these cross-sectional draws of alphas, {αˆ b i , i = 1, ... , N}, or their t-statistics, {tˆb αˆi , i = 1, ... , N}, that result purely from sampling variation while imposing the null of a true alpha that is equal to zero. For example, the distribution of alphas (or t-statistics) for the top fund is constructed as the distribution of the maximum alpha (or, maximum t-statistic) generated across all bootstraps. This iteration was suggested by Kosowski et al (2006) https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.01015.x the last step of their iteration confuse me. How exactly can we compute the cross-sectional bootstrap values and rank the funds on its basis?
