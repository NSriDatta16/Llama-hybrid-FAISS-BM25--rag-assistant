Agreed with Jim Li, I also prefer readable code over micro-optimisation or smart but ugly one-liner code. The only trouble I had with your first example is that it uses procedural oriented functions, I would be better rewritten OOP (functions calls like this could be chained and stay easy to read). PHP hasn't a strong OOP aim, as it uses mainly procedural statements in its API. But I prefer writing my code in OO way, well decoupled and organisated, rather than having a whole lot of functions with plenty of arguments to get them work together.
