The p tag is meant to represent a paragraph which is a block of text, thus the display mode is block. You could set the display to inline as others have suggested but this would still be semantically incorrect. Judging by the name of the css class of the object you're inserting them into, fieldChoices, it would suggest that you're adding a list of choices and should therefore be using an unordered list to contain your items.
