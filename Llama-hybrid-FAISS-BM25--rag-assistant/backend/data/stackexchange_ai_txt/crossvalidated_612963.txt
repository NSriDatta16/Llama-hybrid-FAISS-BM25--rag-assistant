Box-Cox parameter confidence interval clarification

In their original publication , Box and Cox state ...we can obtain an approximate $100(1 - \alpha)$ per cent confidence region [around $\hat{\lambda}$ ] from $$ L_\text{max} (\hat{\lambda}) - L_\text{max}(\lambda) where $\nu_\lambda$ is the number of independent components in $\lambda$ . They unfortunately do not explain their notation: does $\chi^2(\cdot)$ refer to the CDF, the PDF or something else? Further, what exactly is $\nu_\lambda$ ? Concretely, if I am applying a Box-Cox transform to a time series of length $N$ , is $\nu_\lambda= N-1$ , for instance? For reference, the scipy Python package lists the following formula for the confidence interval of their Box-Cox implementation: $$ L_\text{max} (\hat{\lambda}) - L_\text{max}(\lambda) digging into the source code , it appears that the compute the PPF of $1- \alpha$ , and always assume $1$ df for the $\chi^2$ ; is this correct? Any insight is appreciated.
