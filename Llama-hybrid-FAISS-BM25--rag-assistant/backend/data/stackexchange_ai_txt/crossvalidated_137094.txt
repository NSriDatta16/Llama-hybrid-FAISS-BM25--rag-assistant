Algorithms for Time Series Anomaly Detection

I'm currently using Twitter's AnomalyDetection in R: https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection . This algorithm provides time series anomaly detection for data with seasonality. Question: are there any other algorithms similar to this (controlling for seasonality doesn't matter)? I'm trying to score as many time series algorithms as possible on my data so that I can pick the best one / ensemble.
