how to debug "deep" crashes in Android?

I've been trying to debug an android crash that is occurring without a Java Stack Trace... Java Stack Trace bugs are very easy for me to fix... but this bug I'm getting seems to be crashing inside the "NDK" or whatever it is the deep internals of Android are called... I've made no modifications to the NDK btw... I just dunno what else to call that layer hehe. Anyway I'm mainly looking for advice on deep-debug methods, rather than help with this specific problem... because I doubt I can post all the source code involved... so really I just need to know how to set breakpoints at the deep layers or whatever other methods there are to trace deep-crashes to their source... so I will briefly describe the bug and then post a LogCat. I have an app with 7 Activities Activity_INTRO Activity_EULA Activity_MAIN Activity_Contact Activity_News Activity_Library Activity_More INTRO is the initiating one... it fades in some company logos... after displaying them for a set time it jumps to the EULA activity... after the user accepts the EULA, it jumps to MAIN... MAIN then creates a TabHost and populates it with the 4 remaining activities now heres the thing... when I click on say, the More tab of the TabHost, the app pauses for a few seconds and then hard-crashes... no java stack trace, but an actual ASM level trace with the registers and IP and stack... the same thing occurs no matter which tab I select, Contact, News, Library, More... all of them crash with the same hard-crash if however I set the manifest to start the app at Activity_MAIN, bypassing the INTRO and EULA, then these crashes do not occur... so something is lingering from those opening activities that is somehow hosing the TabHost'ed Activities... and I'm wondering what the hell that could be... because I'm using finish() on those activites when they need to jump... in fact here is how I'm doing it let me know if you see any bugs: when jumping from INTRO to EULA I do: //Display the EULA Intent newIntent = new Intent (avi, Activity_EULA.class); startActivity (newIntent); finish(); and EULA to MAIN: Intent newIntent = new Intent (this, Activity_Main.class); startActivity (newIntent); finish(); anyway, here is the hard crash log... please let me know if there is some way I can reverse engineer either /system/lib/libcutils.so or /system/lib/libandroid_runtime.so , because I think the crash is happening in one of them... i think its happening in the libandroid_runtime in fact.... anyway on to the log: 12-25 00:56:07.322: INFO/DEBUG(551): *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** 12-25 00:56:07.332: INFO/DEBUG(551): Build fingerprint: 'generic/sdk/generic/:1.5/CUPCAKE/150240:eng/test-keys' 12-25 00:56:07.362: INFO/DEBUG(551): pid: 722, tid: 723 >>> com.killerapps.chokes
