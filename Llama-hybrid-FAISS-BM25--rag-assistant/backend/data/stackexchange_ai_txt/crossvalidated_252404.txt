Given knowledge of $B(X,X')$, the problem of predicting the distribution of $X$ given observed information $X'$ is referred to as deconvolution or "unfolding." If you are willing to give up a parametric model for the kernel $B(X,X')$, known as the "response matrix" in the deconvolution literature, your problem can be approached through popular unfolding/deconvolution tools. For example, the popular RooUnfold tool can take the distributions of $X$ and $X'$ and estimate $B(X,X')$ (using one of several methods, such as matrix inversion, SVD decomposition , or Bayesian methods ). These non-parametric approaches generally require binning the data $X$ and $X'$. The resulting estimate can be applied to new data.
