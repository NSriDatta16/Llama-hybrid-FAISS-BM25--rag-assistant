When should I do train test split?

I'm new to Machine Learning. I'm basically confused about when to perform train test split. Is the order given below correct? Split entire data into training and test set Extract Features from training data Fit the classification model to the features extracted from training data Extract the same features, which were computed in step 2, from test data Apply the fitted model in step 3 to the features extracted from test data in step 4 to evaluate the model
