How to analyze personal time series

I have a time series data of multiple subjects' performance over the time as well as time series metric of their mouse movement. In other words, for every subject, there are two graphs: Performance and Metric, both over the same time. I'm interested to reveal general pattern of similarity between the two graphs (i.e., metric vs. performance). Do I need to average the Metric and Performance graphs over multiple subjects or there any more intelligent way to reveal the significantly general similarity given the noise between different subjects? Can you please suggest ways to analyse the correlation between two graphs. Thank you
