validation accuracy and loss increase

I am training a generic LSTM based autoencoder to get the sentence embeddings, the bleu score is the accuracy metric. The model is coded to output the same number of tokens as the length of labels, hence the losses are calculated using cross-entropy loss between the output of token and the corresponding label token and added to a total loss to be backpropagated The embeddings size is 1000 throughout. Here are the logs:- Training Epoch: 1/20, Training Loss: 78.32446559076034, Training Accuracy: 0.23442341868755373 Validation Epoch: 1/20, Validation Loss: 75.11487170562003, Validation Accuracy: 0.28851715943634565 Training Epoch: 2/20, Training Loss: 60.702940691499734, Training Accuracy: 0.3043263558919579 Validation Epoch: 2/20, Validation Loss: 68.58432596068359, Validation Accuracy: 0.337459858582381 Training Epoch: 3/20, Training Loss: 51.62519727157313, Training Accuracy: 0.35618672202599283 Validation Epoch: 3/20, Validation Loss: 64.17064862141332, Validation Accuracy: 0.37158793060235135 Training Epoch: 4/20, Training Loss: 44.40417488866389, Training Accuracy: 0.4094415453046547 Validation Epoch: 4/20, Validation Loss: 61.230048799977716, Validation Accuracy: 0.3955376494828317 Training Epoch: 5/20, Training Loss: 38.78325418571326, Training Accuracy: 0.46050421873328257 Validation Epoch: 5/20, Validation Loss: 59.78918521062842, Validation Accuracy: 0.4063787247291398 Training Epoch: 6/20, Training Loss: 33.65953556655257, Training Accuracy: 0.5193937894102788 Validation Epoch: 6/20, Validation Loss: 58.64455007580877, Validation Accuracy: 0.41980867690343776 Training Epoch: 7/20, Training Loss: 29.35849161540994, Training Accuracy: 0.5831378755700898 Validation Epoch: 7/20, Validation Loss: 58.26881152131025, Validation Accuracy: 0.4261582422867802 Training Epoch: 8/20, Training Loss: 25.244888168760856, Training Accuracy: 0.6488748581642462 Validation Epoch: 8/20, Validation Loss: 57.62903963564669, Validation Accuracy: 0.43286079887479756 Training Epoch: 9/20, Training Loss: 22.05663261861035, Training Accuracy: 0.7039174093261202 Validation Epoch: 9/20, Validation Loss: 58.09752491926684, Validation Accuracy: 0.4399501875046306 Training Epoch: 10/20, Training Loss: 19.248559526880282, Training Accuracy: 0.7486352249548112 Validation Epoch: 10/20, Validation Loss: 58.613073462421454, Validation Accuracy: 0.4470900014647744 Training Epoch: 11/20, Training Loss: 16.95602631587501, Training Accuracy: 0.7857343322245365 Validation Epoch: 11/20, Validation Loss: 58.38435334806304, Validation Accuracy: 0.44778823347334884 Training Epoch: 12/20, Training Loss: 14.74661236426599, Training Accuracy: 0.8136944976817879 Validation Epoch: 12/20, Validation Loss: 59.63633590068632, Validation Accuracy: 0.45206057264928495 Training Epoch: 13/20, Training Loss: 13.507415059699248, Training Accuracy: 0.8299945959036563 Validation Epoch: 13/20, Validation Loss: 60.149887264208886, Validation Accuracy: 0.4512303133278385 Training Epoch: 14/20, Training Loss: 12.026118357521792, Training Accuracy: 0.8491757446561087 Validation Epoch: 14/20, Validation Loss: 59.89944394497038, Validation Accuracy: 0.45497359431776685 Training Epoch: 15/20, Training Loss: 10.785567499923806, Training Accuracy: 0.8628473173326144 Validation Epoch: 15/20, Validation Loss: 61.482036528946125, Validation Accuracy: 0.45541000266481596 Training Epoch: 16/20, Training Loss: 9.373574649788727, Training Accuracy: 0.8767987081840235 Validation Epoch: 16/20, Validation Loss: 62.18386231796834, Validation Accuracy: 0.4580630794998584 Training Epoch: 17/20, Training Loss: 8.5658748998932, Training Accuracy: 0.8878869616990712 Validation Epoch: 17/20, Validation Loss: 63.56435154233743, Validation Accuracy: 0.4606744393166781 Training Epoch: 18/20, Training Loss: 7.807730126944895, Training Accuracy: 0.8960175152587504 Validation Epoch: 18/20, Validation Loss: 63.88373188037895, Validation Accuracy: 0.4606897915210869 Training Epoch: 19/20, Training Loss: 6.829077819740428, Training Accuracy: 0.9038927070366026 Validation Epoch: 19/20, Validation Loss: 65.59262917371629, Validation Accuracy: 0.4639800374912485 Training Epoch: 20/20, Training Loss: 6.152266260986982, Training Accuracy: 0.9090036335609419 Validation Epoch: 20/20, Validation Loss: 66.84154795008956, Validation Accuracy: 0.4672414105594907 Here is are the accuracy and loss vs epoch graphs : I want to know why it is that the validation loss and accuracy is increasing.
