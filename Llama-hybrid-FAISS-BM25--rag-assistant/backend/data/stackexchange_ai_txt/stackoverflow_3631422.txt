Organic Groups - types of nodes allowed to create

Wondered if someone can shed some light on OG groups in Drupal. I know you can restrict what types of NODES that can be created within groups, but what if yuo have two types of groups. Can you restrict the creation of a certain type of node to only one group ? Example: I allow users to create groups called Sports I allow uses to create groups called Movies I have two types of nodes: Food & Shoes Can I set that the Food node, can only be created inside the movie group And set that the Shoes node can only be created inside the Sports group ? thanks :)
