You need to configure CDN URLs using WebResource attribute. For example: There can be multiple entries and can be put in any code file (as this being an assembly level attribute) but recommended place for keeping these entries would be global.asax. EDIT : additional info requested by OP In .NET 4.0, if you want to use Microsoft provided scripts from CDN then you don't need to make WebResource entries. EnableCdn=True should do the trick but make sure that you are using AJAX Toolkit that supports .NET 4.0 (i.e. Toolkit version 40412). Visit http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/cdn.ashx to get more information and list of files on Microsoft CDN. For .NET 3.5, you have make CDN entries - you can get the script file list from above link and/or actual page source. Folks also uses script combining and then host the combined script on their own CDN for better performance.
