Please be skeptical of the following, as it is just something I thought up just now. One way could be to create a simpler model for all the data, excluding the regions of missing data. The predictions from this model could be ensembled with a more complex model for the 90% of the data for which all attributes are present. Another way, would be to create a model that could learn whether extra attributes were available or not by including an extra boolean attribute that would denote this--I'm not sure if it would work in practice, but a neural network would at least theoretically be able to approximate such a model. For other models, eg. models based on decision trees, missing data can potentially be handled intrinsically (by setting the missing data to NA or some other value than can be thresholded to signify missing). A third way, would be creating meta data, by eg. predicting the missing values in a two step classifier. If the problem arises from you trying to do multiclass classification, perhaps consider simplifying the problem to several binary classifications. Also, consider whether the fact that data is missing is potentially useful information. For example, maybe the missing data is due to different data gathering techniques that could perturb the results, in which case it might be important information to know if the data is missing or not.
