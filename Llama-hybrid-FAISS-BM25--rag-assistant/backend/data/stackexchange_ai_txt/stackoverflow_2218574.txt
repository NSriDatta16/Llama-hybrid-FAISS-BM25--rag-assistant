symfony module management

I have way too many modules in my application. Currently my modules are namespaced, but what I'd like to do is have a directory structure so I can get rid of this redundant and annoying namespacing. For instance, for modules named "xModule1, xModule2, xModule3", I'd like to have a directory structure like this: -x -module1 -actions and templates -module2 -actions and templates -module3 - actions and templates Surely the developers at symfony know that people would like to use their framework to develop large applications. So how is module organization like this done? I've done a lot of work in Java/Spring, and because source is component scanned, you can arrange your controllers and jsp files in nicely organized hierarchies. Is this somehow possible with Symfony?
