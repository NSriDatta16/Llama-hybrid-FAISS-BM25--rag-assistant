Sure, that's probably the way I would do it. You can use the following code: graph/scatter [x] with [y] by [categorical]. Then use the menu or the toolbar button to draw regression lines by subgroup; it'll default to linear fitlines, and RSQ for each group will show up automatically. Just watch out for one thing: if you have SPSS 17 or earlier, at least, the 1st group shown in the legend will match up with the 2nd RSQ listed, and vice versa. You can change the placement of the RSQ boxes by dragging them.
