Probability that interval arithmetic estimate of mean covers the true mean of a normal variable?

Background Suppose there exists a normal variable $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$ where $\mu, \sigma$ are known. Also suppose that you only observe rounded instances $Y = \operatorname{round}(X, d)$ to some fixed number of decimals $d$ to the right of the decimal point. Knowing $d$ allows us to infer that $x_i \in I_i = [y_i - 10^{-d}, y_i + 10^{-d}]$ , and compute an estimate of the interval that the mean falls within using interval arithmetic . $$\bar I = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n I_i$$ Examples Take for example that $\mu=0$ , $\sigma=1$ , and $n=200$ . We can plot the cumulative mean (CM) of the interval arithmetic estimate of the mean ( CM:IA ), the cumulative rounded (to one decimal place) mean ( CM:round(x,1) ), the cumulative (sample) mean of the variable $X$ ( CM:x ), and the true population mean $\mu$ ( TM ). Here is an identical example except for changing $\sigma \leftarrow 10$ . The above are fairly representative of a few dozen such plots I have generated and examined. These plots agree with an intuition that the larger the standard deviation $\sigma$ , the less likely the estimated interval covering the sample mean will also cover the population mean. Question Given that the mean $\mu$ , $\sigma$ , sample size $n$ , and $d$ are known, as described in the first paragraph, what is the probability that the estimated interval containing the sample mean will also cover the population mean?
