Groovy DSL: handling labels

I'm implementing in Groovy a DSL for some existing file format. In this format we have a construct like group basic_test { test vplan_testing { dir: global_storage; }; }; And here I have problem with this dir: global_storage - groovy considers "dir:" as a label, so I can't handle it. Do you have an idea how I can receive some callback (getProperty, invokeMissingMethod) for this construct? Thank you!
