I asked a very related question here . Eventhough I say there that the main aim was not accessibility but ease of use, it might be an interesting read for you. I was one of the developers for my university websites and our lead was of the opinion that all websites in domains like education, non-profit organizations, govt organizations etc should be 100% accessible. Ideally you would want the pages to "work" without your CSS and client side code (JS/VBScript). We analyzed our pages using this and/or this to check our sites for accessibility.
