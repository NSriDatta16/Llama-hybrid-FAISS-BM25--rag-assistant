Sorting an array of names in assembly

I have to write a procedure in assembly that sort an array of upto 20 Names, max 11 characters. My programs accepts 3 records but keeps crashing at everything else and I can't get it to sort. I'm using bubble sort. BTW, I can't change anything in C++ since this is an assignment. These first 3 lines are from the C++ code. extern "C" void Sort (char [] [11], char [], double [], long); char Names [20] [11]; Sort (Names, LetterGrades, Averages, NumStudents - 1); _Sort proc mov ecx, [esp +16] dec ecx L1: push ecx mov esi, [esp + 4] L2: mov eax, [esi] cmp [esi + 11], eax jg L3 xchg eax,[esi + 11] mov [esi],eax L3: add esi,11 loop L2 pop ecx loop L1 L4: ret _Sort endp
