Spark's documentation refers to internal names of Spark's procedures and objects, not to theoretical concepts. In statistics estimator is basically a procedure that estimates something given the data and returns an estimate . It is hard to answer your question without knowing what you mean by model . Statistical model describes the phenomenon of interest in terms of probability theory (notice that there are also other models, e.g. mechanistic models ). It is not yet an estimator of anything, but just an abstract description of the problem. You need an estimator to estimate the parameters of your model (also in case of so-called non-parametric models). In machine learning people often call algorithms used to estimate something as models, but in general: model is a theoretical description of the problem and estimator is a procedure that generates the estimates of its parameters. Estimator is a general procedure, not its implementation, so function foo() in software XYZ is not an estimator, but rather it's an implementation of some estimator.
