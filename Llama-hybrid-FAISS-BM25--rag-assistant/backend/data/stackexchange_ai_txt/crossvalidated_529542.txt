are there possible benefits for embedding into a space of larger or same dimension? In Vector Symbolic Architectures (also known as Hyperdimensional Computing) this is essential. VSAs use algebraic operations (sum, product, permutation) on vectors to encode information in their directions. VSAs can be used to represent discrete data structures such as graphs as well as continuous properties (like brightness) as attributes of the discrete structure. They rely on the properties of high-dimensional spaces to work. You're unlikely to come across a VSA working in a less than 500-d space. 10,000-d is typical. Low dimensional input values are projected up to the VSA dimensionality choosing a method that preserves the input properties of interest. Note that although individual component (like a pixel brightness) are being massively expanded in dimensionality, the dimensionality of the entire structure being encoded (say a 500 x 500 x RGB image) may be being reduced in dimensionality to a single VSA encoding (i.e. one vector represents the entire image). For an introduction, see http://www.rctn.org/vs265/kanerva09-hyperdimensional.pdf they have examples that is embedding a 5 dimensional space into 24 dimensions In such low dimensional spaces they are very unlikely to be using VSA. But the point remains, also stated in other answers, expanding the basis might be useful - it depends what you are trying to do.
