When do we require to calculate the confidence Interval?

I am using various machine learning algorithms for last 7 years. To validate the model in classification algorithm we use precision, recall, f1 score. For regression methods we use R^2,RMSE kind of metrics. But I never used or anyone asked me to show confidence interval. Recently I published research paper where I do comparative study of 10 ML regression algorithms. We have validated the model performance comparing Variance, RMSE and R^2 for each algo. But reviewer asked me to use Confidence Interval. Does it really required for ML algorithm? In sklearn do we have any method which calculates CI?
