I realize this is quite belated, but for the record, you can also use CSS selectors to do this (eliminating the need for inline styles.) This CSS applies padding to the first column of every row: table > tr > td:first-child { padding-right:10px } And this would be your HTML, sans CSS!: data more data This allows for much more elegant markup, especially in cases where you need to do lots of specific formatting with CSS.
