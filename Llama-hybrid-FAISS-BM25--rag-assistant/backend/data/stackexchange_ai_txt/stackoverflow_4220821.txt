In CSS, why vertically centered text shows up lower and lower inside of or ?

A usual way to vertically center some inline text or image is #one-div { font: 16px/16px Verdana, Arial, sans-serif } #one-div * { vertical-align: middle } with the HTML of hello world try more see see sample at: http://jsfiddle.net/934Zu/2/ It can be compared to: http://jsfiddle.net/934Zu/1/ This is an example how they are vertically centered: http://jsfiddle.net/934Zu/6/ Why do elements inside of or get displayed lower and lower? The doesn't have padding or margin or border, so no vertical space should be there. What might be a way to fix it so that the line of text (and images, if inside and/or ) can be vertically aligned perfectly? (other than putting everything in the same level of nested or , which might not be a totally elegant fix) (and more importantly, why did it get lower and lower in the first place?)
