Images in a List in WPF MVVM

I have a question regarding how to best accomplish something in WPF MVVM. I have in my ViewModel a series of integers. For the sake of example, lets call them: public int Yellow { get;set; } public int Red { get;set; } public int Green { get;set; } I also have some small images that are very simple: A Red circle, a Yellow circle, and a Green circle. The idea is to have an area on the view with a number of these images, based on the above properties. So if this instance of the view model has 3 Yellow, 2 Red, and 1 Green, I want 6 images in my ListBox, 3 of the yellow circle, 2 of the red, and 1 of the green. Right now, I have it working, but using some very clumsy code where I build the image list in the ViewModel using an ugly for-loop. Is there some more elegant way to accomplish this task in WPF? Ideally, I wouldn't want to have to reference the image in the ViewModel at all...
