Opengl: GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24 not defined

Good afternoon, The setup: I've never done any gl programming. I'm attempting to compile some opengl driver code that compiles in other environments. I'm using mingw on windows in the hope that using gcc on both linux and Windows would make my life easier... The problem: The second parameter of the following isn't defined anywhere: glRenderbufferStorageEXT(GL_RENDERBUFFER_EXT, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24, tex->getWidth(), tex->getHeight()); I'm guessing this code is old and it's deprecated? What should I do about the above issue? Is there a good reference on the opengl API? Thanks
