If this is used for a web site then you have to consider that between requests for pages, even from the same browser, your server state will be torn down (in general terms) so there's nothing really to be gained from trying to maintain your SQL connection between pages. That's the first thing. If each page is the result of a single database connection then you are probably as optimised as you really need to be, if you are making several connections over the generation of a page then you may want to look at keeping a connection alive until you have finished retrieving data; either by maintaining the connection or optimising your data retrieval to limit the back and forth between your app and the db.
