I thank @Bernd for pointing me in the right direction. Here are some notes on the references he mentioned in his answer, as well as some of the references mentioned in these articles. Sutton et al (2008) Sutton et al use within a health context the terms individual patient data versus aggregate data . They note that analysis of individual patient data is often considered to be the gold standard for meta-analysis, citing Stewart and Clark (1995). It is particularly useful for assessing data quality and performing analyses on values not reported in existing reports (e.g., particular subgroup analyses). Naturally, they note problems, such as the impossibility in some cases of obtaining all individual patient data and the additional costs in processing such data. They also observe that for simple models where the summary statistics are available results will often be similar or the same. They also observe the infrequency of individual patient meta-analysis citing a review by Simmonds et al (2005). They also mention the the review article of meta-analysis combining individual patient data with aggregate data by Riley RD, Simmonds, et al (2008) Riley Lambert Abo-Zaid (2010) In this article Riley et al describe more about meta-analysis of individual participant data. They outline advantages of meta-analysis of individual participant data (e.g., consistent data processing, modelling of missing data, verification of original reported results, more analysis options, etc.) Stewart & Tierney (2002) Stewart and Tierney review the pros and cons of individual patient data meta-analysis focusing particularly on practical issues. Riley Lambert et al (2007) They describe methods of combining individual patient data with aggregate data in terms of one-step and two-step approaches. Cooper & Patall (2009) Cooper and Patall wrote an article as part of a special issue on meta-analysis of individual-level data in Psychological Methods (see Shrout, 2009 for a summary). Cooper and Patall describe research synthesis as one in a second stage of transition: The ﬁrst transition is from the narrative research review—in which opaque rules of cognitive algebra are used to synthesize the results of studies—to meta-analysis of [aggregated data]. The second stage involves the transition from meta-analysis of [aggregated data] to the accumulation of [individual participant-level data]. to be continued... References Cooper, H., & Patall, E. A.
