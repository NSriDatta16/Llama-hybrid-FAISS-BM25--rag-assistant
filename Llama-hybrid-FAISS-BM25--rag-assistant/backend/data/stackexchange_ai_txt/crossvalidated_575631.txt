When there are many more controls than cases, can I take only part of the controls?

I've tried to build a predictive logistic regression model. However, there are only 500 observations with disease (+) and over 60,000 observations with disease (-). Can I take a random sample (e.g., 10,000) of 60,000 observations with disease (-) to build the predictive model?
