How to effectively select the predictors for Bayesian linear regression model?

I have around 20 independent (or not strongly correlated) predictor variables. And there are about 20 observations for each variable and the outcome. I want to build a Bayesian linear regression model using these data. How to effectively select the predictors, since 20 predictors are too many? Maybe can use information criteria (AIC, WAIC)? Do I have to try each possible combination of the model predictors?
