JPQL inconsitency between hibernate and eclipselink

I have the following query that works under Hibernate but not under eclipse: select o from Organisation o where o.code=:code and o.type=:type It is not clear to me why this is the case, I was hoping someone else could elaborate for us. The error being returned is: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: An exception occurred while creating a query in EntityManager: Exception Description: Error compiling the query [select o from Organisation o where o.code=:code and o.type=:type]. Unknown entity type [Organisation]. We have made no other changes apart from switching the provider class in the persistence.xml file to indicate we are now using eclipselink.
