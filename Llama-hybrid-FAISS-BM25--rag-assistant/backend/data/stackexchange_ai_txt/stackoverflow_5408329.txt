Xcode 4 - Documentation: How to show the Table of Contents?

simple question, but after jumping over to the new XCode 4 IDE and open the organizer and select the "Documentation", i canÂ´t find a way how to display the "table of contents" of a visible class.. I think about a way how to display it before and the current web-documentation: Hope someone can answer it.. Thanks
