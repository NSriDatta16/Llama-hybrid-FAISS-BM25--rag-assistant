varbinary(MAX) would be the most efficient storage medium (raw bytes are smaller than b64 encoded), but you'd have to convert from b64 to raw bytes. If you want to store the b64 as you get it, just use varchar(max). Really depends- if you're going to splat it right back into XML, it'd be less processing to leave the b64 alone.
