Setting position of UIView using IF statement

In the application I am creating, I have a UIView named AdvancedView1. The user can drag the view around the screen. The user needs to drag the view to a certain position on the screen. If the view is dropped into a certain area, then the view would "snap" into a defined location. When trying to use IF AND statements, I am getting an error. Any suggestions? Also "origin" is a CGPoint declared in the .h file. - (void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *) gesture { if (gesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { CGPoint origin = [gesture locationInView:[self superview]]; [self bringSubviewToFront:[self superview]]; [self setCenter:origin]; } if (gesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) { if (origin.x >= 574.0 && origin.x I am getting the following error for "origin.x >= ...." "Request for member "x" in something not a structure or union"
