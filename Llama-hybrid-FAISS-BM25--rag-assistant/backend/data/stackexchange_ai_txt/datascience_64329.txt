Based on the context provided this is what I assume you have done: Cat boost: Predicted the probability on 1 using all your x variables and bucket the probabilities and calculate the percentage of 1s in each bucket. Logistic Regression: You have used 1 of the x variables which was continuous and divided into the bands mentioned and calculated the incidence rate of 1 in each band. If both the above statements are true then Your catboost model most likely is either underfit or did not learn anything from the model. This inference is because the logistic Regression variables indicates that at least 1 variable has some prediction power on y. It would be better to provide some additional details regarding the type of data and classes to analyze this further.
