Can I use a paired t-test on data that are averages?

I am comparing 15 pairs of averages paired by two categories with a paired t test. The samples used to determine the averages in each pair are not equal within any single pair of data. For example, if pair 1 consists of 95.5 in category A and 83.6 in category B, the 95.5 average was from a sample of 120 while the 83.6 average was from a sample of 90. Is this still an acceptable use of the paired t test?
