How to dynamically choose two fields from a Linq query as a result

If you have a simple Linq query like: var result = from record in db.Customer select new { Text = record.Name, Value = record.ID.ToString() }; which is returning an object that can be mapped to a Drop Down List, is it possible to dynamically specify which fields map to Text and Value? Of course, you could do a big case (switch) statement, then code each Linq query separately but this isn't very elegant. What would be nice would be something like: (pseudo code) var myTextField = db.Customer["Name"]; // Could be an enumeration?? var myValueField = db.Customer["ID"]; // Idea: choose the field outside the query var result = from record in db.Customer select new { Text = myTextField, Value = myValueField };
