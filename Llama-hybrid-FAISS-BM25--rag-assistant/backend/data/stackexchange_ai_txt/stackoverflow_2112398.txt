The pointers themselves will be copied, but that means that both "from" and "to" will be the same in the two sprites. You'll also need to manually allocate and copy the things pointed to by the pointers, but that implies that you also need to know how big the arrays are that are referenced by the pointers. Note that instead of memcpy up there, you can also do '*pSpriteToReturn = *copyFromMe;' This'll copy all of the members, although if you're going to make new arrays, the only part of the tSprites that you want to actually copy is the size. Another note would be that if your sprites always have a fixed number of vertices and vert indices, you can make those arrays inside the sprite rather than pointers. If you did this, then they would be copied correctly with both the memcpy method and the assignment that I mention in the above paragraph.
