One factor with two levels with random group effect

I'm testing the hypothesis: prey exposed to the chemical cues of a predator will have lower feeding rates than prey feeding without predator chemical cues. In this simple food chain the top predator is a crab, which feeds on a snail, which feeds on mussels. To test my hypothesis I will have a (+)crab treatment where snails forage on mussels in the presence of crab chemical cues, and a (-)crab treatment, where snails forage on mussels without crab chemical cues. Additionally, I will have a control treatment to measure the background mortality of mussels without snail predation. At the beginning of the experiment, all replicates will have the same number of mussels. At the end of the experiment, I will count how many mussels are still alive in order to determine snail feeding rates for each treatment. Here is my issue: in order to have a sufficient amount of experimental replicates, I have to use two large tanks. So the design really looks like this: Tank (+)crab (-)crab control 1 n = 6 n = 6 n = 6 2 n = 6 n = 6 n = 6 The replicates within each tank are not exchanging water with one another. The tanks are really just acting as a container that holds the replicates. What I'm trying to figure out is how to analyze this data. Theoretically, there shouldn't be any differences in each respective treatment between tanks. For example, there should be no difference in the mean feeding rate of the (+)crab treatment between tanks 1 and 2. It's not really a blocked design because the replicates are not blocked by nuisance factors, the nuisance factors are the tanks themselves. What type of statistical analysis should I use?
