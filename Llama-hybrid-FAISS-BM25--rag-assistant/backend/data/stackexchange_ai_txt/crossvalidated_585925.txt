You've answered your own question. I'd like to add a few comments. As you point out, in this case there are only group-level predictors: Each subject is a group characterized by XS_1 and XS_2 ; each item is a group characterized by XI . There are no observation-level predictors. If you take two observations for the same subject, they share the XS_i values. If you take two observations for the same item, they share the XI value. (Brauer & Curtin, 2017) says this in a more sophisticated (but harder to understand?) way: Party affiliation varies within-subjects but between-items. This means that two evaluations (observations) by the same study participant of two different politicians have the same "openness" but (possibly) different party affiliation. Openness to experience varies between-subjects but within items. This means that two evaluations (observations) of the same politician by different participants have the same party affiliation but different openness. I also suggest a different way to write the model. It's less mathematically rigorous but easier to read. I introduce notation first. Let $j[i]$ and $k[i]$ denote the subject and the item of observation $Y_i$ , respectively. Since there are no observation-level predictors, the model for $Y_i$ is determined by $j[i]$ and $k[i]$ . For simplicity, I assume there is one predictor for subjects, $x_1$ , and one predictor for items, $x_2$ , with an interaction. It's straightforward to add more group predictors. $$ \begin{aligned} Y_i &= \left[\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_1x_2\right] \\ &+ \left[\color{blue}{u_{0,j[i]}} + \color{blue}{u_{1,j[i]}}x_1\right] \\ &+ \left[\color{blue}{v_{0,k[i]}} + \color{blue}{v_{1,k[i]}}x_2\right] \\ &+ \epsilon \end{aligned} $$ where (in blue) the $u_0$ s and $v_0$ s are random intercepts for subjects and items, respectively; and the $u_1$ s and $v_1$ s are random slopes. The notation is a bit unwieldy but indexing is important in a multilevel model. To recap, $u_{0,k[i]}$ is the random intercept of the $k$ th subject who produced the $i$ th observation. This formula can be re-written to add the fixed main effects to the random components. The result is an equivalent re-parameterized specification of the same model. $$ \begin{aligned} Y_i &= \left[\beta_0 + \beta_3x_1x_2\right] \\ &+ \left[\color{blue}{u_{0,j[i]}} + \color{blue}{\left(\beta_1 + u_{1,j[i]}\right)}x_1\right] \\ &+ \left[\color{blue}{v_{0,k[i]}} + \color{blue}{\left(\beta_2 + v_{1,k[i]}\right)}x_2\right] \\ &+ \epsilon \\ &= \left[\beta_0 + \beta_3x_1x_2\right] \\ &+ \left[\color{blue}{u_{0,j[i]}} + \color{blue}{u^*_{1,j[i]}}x_1\right] \\ &+ \left[\color{blue}{v_{0,k[i]}} + \color{blue}{v^*_{1,k[i]}}x_2\right] \\ &+ \epsilon \end{aligned} $$ The second formulation highlights that the model allows the main effects of $x_1$ and $x_2$ to vary by subject and by item but the subject-item interaction is fixed (it has no random component). This is perhaps not a very natural assumption, though a random interaction effect can only be estimated if there are repeated observations for each subject-item pair; in that case, add (1 | Subject:Item) . You may want to consider Bayesian hierarchical modeling as well. The following introduction describes how to use the brms package to analyze phonetic data. L. Nalborczyk, C. Batailler, H.
