Classification on highly skewed dataset

I have two classes A and B. 98% of the data belongs to class A and 2% of it belongs to class B. Size of the entire dataset is about 2000. I am interested in correctly classifying all the data points that belong to class B. I want to perform classification on the aforementioned dataset but I am not sure whether the classification techniques such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression will work on my dataset. Could you suggest me some technique through which I can perform the classification on the aforementioned dataset?
