After much head-scratching and feet-stamping I have finally solved this problem. Woohoo! The cause of this issue actually turned out to be an instance of NSNumberFormatter I had buried in one of my table views. I should have paid more attention to a console message I was getting from Interface Builder. 23/06/2009 15:05:08 ibtool[2324] -[NSConcreteAttributedString initWithString:] called with nil string argument. This has undefined behavior and will raise an exception in post- Leopard linked apps. This warning is displayed only once. What this actually turned out to mean was that my NSNumberFormatter didn't have it's Zero Symbol and Nil Symbol set (The default configuration). Setting these both to zero removed the above error and then as if by magic I was once again KVO compliant. I worked out that this may be causing the above console message from the following post: http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2009/5/28/237646 The message did worry me, but as it didn't seem to affect my application and was generated by 'ibtool' (i.e. not my application), I chose to ignore it initially. Mainly because I had no idea of where I would find the culprit that raised the warning. It wasn't until I googled the console message I was able to solve it. I guess I still have much to learn in the world of Cocoa debugging! What I still find bizarre is that it only affected re-opened documents with exactly one item in a category...
