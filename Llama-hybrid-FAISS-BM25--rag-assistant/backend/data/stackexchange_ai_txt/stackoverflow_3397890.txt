Update : Check out the accepted answer in this question . It's pure mySQL and even deals with even distribution. The problem with id = rand() or anything comparable in PHP is that you can't be sure whether that particular ID still exists. Therefore, you need to work with LIMIT , and that can become slow for large amounts of data. As an alternative to that, you could try using a loop in PHP. What the loop does is Create a random integer number using rand() , with a scope between 0 and the number of records in the database Query the database whether a record with that ID exists If it exists, add the number to an array If it doesn't, go back to step 1 End the loop when the array of random numbers contains the desired number of elements this method could cause a lot of queries in a fragmented table, but they should be pretty fast to execute. It may be faster than LIMIT rand() in certain situations. The LIMIT method, as outlined by @Luther, is certainly the simplest code-wise.
