The problem of measuring the average of an Euclidian distance $d_n$ between two random points in a n-dimensional hypercube is called a hyper cube line picking , and has no analytical solution for high dimensions. At first, I thought that there could be a recurrent solution like the one for volumes, but it turns out that it's not as easy. The average was obtained for low dimensions, for instance: n=1, it's $E[d_1]=1/3$ n=2, it's a nonintuitive fraction $E[d_2]=\frac{2 + \sqrt 2 + 5\mathrm{arcsinh}(1)} {15}\approx 0.52$. Here's a plot from Wolfram web site with mean distance as a function of $n$: For higher dimensions, the lower and upper bounds were found in Anderssen, R.S. & Brent, R.P. & Daley, D & Moran, P.A.P.. (1976). Concerning ∫ 0 1 ⋯∫ 0 1 (χ 1 2 +⋯+χ k 2 ) 1/2 dχ 1 ⋯dχ k and a Taylor series method. SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics. 30. 10.1137/0130003. They used Taylor series expansion in this paper. Your book refers to this asymptotic upper bound: $E[d_n]\le\sqrt{n/6}$, when $n\to\infty$. This is not the mean distance itself. Square distance Note, that the average square distance is a very different animal. Consider this: $$d_n^2=\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2$$ If you want to take the expectation of this square distance, then it separates into a sum of simple integrals as follows: $$E[d_n^2]=\int_0^1da_1\int_0^1db_1\int_0^1da_2\int_0^1db_2 \dots \int_0^1da_n\int_0^1db_nf(a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2\dots,a_n,b_n)d_n^2= \\ \sum_{i=1}^n \int_0^1da_i\int_0^1db_i f(a_i,b_i)(a_i-b_i)^2$$ This separation of one volume integral into a sum of dimension integrals for the distance itself is prevented by the square root operation which binds all the coordinate squares into one expression (nonlinearly):$\int_{V}dV\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}$ For n dimensions the average square distance is $n/3$ Power of absolute sequence Your sequence for power of a difference of two random numbers has nothing to do with any of the above. Here's how you calculate it: $$E[|a_1-b_1|^n]=2\int_0^1 (1-x) x^n dx=2\int_0^1 (x^n-x^{n+1}) dx=\\ 2/(n+1)x^{n+1}-2/(n+2)x^{n+2}\mid_0^1=2(n+2-(n+1)/(n+1)/(n+2))=\\ \frac 2 {(n+1)(n+2)}$$ This is also the reciprocal of the binomial coefficient : $\frac 1 {C(n+2,n)}$, where $C(n,k)=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ You can plug $n=12$ to see that it's $\frac 1 {78}$ as you obtained from simulation. It's very difficult to be in this field armed only with computers. You need a little bit of mathematics if you don't want to feel lost all the time.
