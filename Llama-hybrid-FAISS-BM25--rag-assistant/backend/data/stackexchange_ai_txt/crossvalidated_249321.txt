How to cleanly, computationally efficiently compare offsetted short time series?

I have a large number of short time series (assume 10 points). There are two subsets of them: One subset is sampled at t = 0,10,20,30,40,50, the other is sampled at t = 3,13,23,33,43,53. (This is just an example. The shift could be 1..9 in this case, i.e. 0, 10, 20 to 1,11,21 or 8,18,28) Sampling frequency is the same, but they are offset. Of course in a first approximation I can ignore the time shift since x[t] and x[t+1] are relatively similar; or I could interpolate both to get a series 0,3,10,13 etc. Is there any better way? Actually I am mostly interested in the similarity of one "master" time series (sampled at 0,10,20) to 2x100 series (100 being sampled at 0,10,20 and the other 100 at 3,13,23). (As you might have guessed, the application is chromatographic peaks.)
