Stationary Time Series with Low Autocorrelation

I am starting to work with time series and am a bit lost with this specific time series. I am working with the following time series. The Y variable is the total subscribers from a YouTube channel over time. The first thing that I did was to perform the Dickey-Fuller test to see if the time series was stationary or not. # Aplying Augmented Dickey-Fuller Contrast for Subscribers sts.adfuller(ts['total_subscribers']) There results were the following ones: (-5.6570813525983965, 9.56618099517806e-07, 7, 654, {'1%': -3.440388459298194, '5%': -2.8659694611921034, '10%': -2.569128861019929}, 2366.473282410291) Where the p-value is 9.56e-07. As 9.56e-07 I also created this plot to see how mean and variance were fluctuating over time, just to double-check: Finally, I plot the ACF and PACF plots to see if it was possible to apply an AR model: From the very first lag, the autocorrelation drops to around 0.30, which is pretty low. Something similar happens for the partial correlations: I don't know if a stationary time series can have such a low correlation. Am I interpreting something wrong? Of course, I tried to create an Autoregressive model with order 2, but I am not sure even the autocorrelation has a geometric decay... This is what I get on the test data: Thanks a lot!
