How to stop Rounding Values in SQL Server Integration Services?

I'm using the SSIS package, there is nothing being changed from source to destination. However, the column which I'm paying attention right now has a slightly different datatype (which I hope doesn't matter) in the source and destination; the source has numeric (15,2) and the destination has numeric (16,2) and the data in the source is 4.75 and it changes to 5. The 1 digit reduction in the decimal places, which I'm sure, should not matter because I tested with the case. Why is the value rounded?
