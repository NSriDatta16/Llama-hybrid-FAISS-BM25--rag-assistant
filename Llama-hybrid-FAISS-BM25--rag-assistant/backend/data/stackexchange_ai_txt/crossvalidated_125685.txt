Analysis of the differences between beetle communities in four different forest types

I'm working on my thesis but I have a problem making the last analysis. I have 4 different kind of forest: a, b, c and d. Each kind of forest has been analyzed in 15 different places (so we have a1, a2 ... a15, b1, b2,...). Now in each of these plots I have collected all the beetles and identified them. I obtain a community matrix with 28 beetle species and 60 plots going from a1 to d15. I want to analyze the differences among those communities, and identify if the beetle populations in a, b, c and d are the same or not. I wanted to use a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) but I can't seem to find a good explanation on how to do it with this kind of data.
