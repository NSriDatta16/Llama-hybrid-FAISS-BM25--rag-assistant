What sort of volumes of data are we talking about here? A few KB? A MB? A hundred GB? If anything but the latter, rather than reinvent the wheel, use one of the existing cache services. Based on the C# tag and the mention of IIS, I assume you are running a Windows. As such I would suggest that you have a look at Memcached From the Memcached page: Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering. I have used Memcached myself in environments similar to the one you describe (using MS SQL rather than nosql for data storage). After an initial round of cache tuning we have not encountered any problems whatsoever. Without knowing specifics of your requirements it is difficult to say if Memcached is the solution that is right but it is certainly something worth looking into.
