Selecting columns from a LINQ query

I want to be able to select the columns that are displayed in my DataGridView. I.e., I have a linq query that returns an IEnumerable but I don't want to display all the properties of Policy - I want to allow the user to choose what to display. So I thought something like this might work to create a "narrower" object with only the columns I want. IEnumerable policies = repository.GetPolicies(); var results = from p in policies select new { if (userPicked("PropertyOne")) PropertyOne = p.PropertyOne, if (userPicked("PropertyTwo")) PropertyTwo = p.PropertyTwo, ... }; dataGridView1.DataSource = results; Is there an elegant way to do this? Part 2: Why does this work: IEnumerable policies = repository.GetPolicies(); dataGridView1.DataSource = policies; but this doesn't: IEnumerable policies = repository.GetPolicies(); var results = from p in policies select p; dataGridView1.DataSource = results; In the second case nothing is displayed in the grid.
