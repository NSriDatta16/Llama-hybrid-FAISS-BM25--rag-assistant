Putting string constants into a separate class is a best practice in many situations, however, this is a poor example. A better way would be to create a StringConstants namespace and then organize the strings so that related string constants are organized into separate classes. This is just a poor implementation of a good idea. If globalization is a concern, then (as others have pointed out), strings should be kept in resource files.
