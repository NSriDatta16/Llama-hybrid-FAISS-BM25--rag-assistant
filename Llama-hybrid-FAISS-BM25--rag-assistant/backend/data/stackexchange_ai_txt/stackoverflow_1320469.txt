I have to second everyone else who says its a BAD idea. Namespaces are an organizational tool, on many levels. Not only do they allow you to reuse identifiers for your own purposes without conflicting with other companies, they also allow different companies to isolate their product from your's or anyone else's. Putting code into the System namespace can be very confusing for the people who use your types. Additionally, people know that anything in a System namespace is good, solid, tested, community vetted, thoroughly documented code that came from Microsoft. Thats a pretty important set of factors to live up to...by sticking your code in the same namespace, not only are you claiming your code is that good, but you have to live up to it.
