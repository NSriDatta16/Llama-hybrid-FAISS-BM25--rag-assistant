css + html: relative percentages? (mediaqueries)

hey guys, weird situation where I don't have a clue how to solve this. I'm trying to to a responsive website with mediaqueries. Embedded YouTube videos shouls also respond to the layout, therefore I'm trying to set the with of each video to 100% and calculate its height in ratio! The outcome looks like this: So originally this video was 500px by 306px when embedding it from youtube. The problem is this thing might actually work but I don't know where the percentages refer to. Where 100% in width is totally correct and dependant od my layout 61% in height is not correct. 61% is the correct number, however it looks wrong because it's probably 61% of some outer container or something. Any idea how I could solve this problem. I simply want my videos to be 100% in with (which is correct right now - even when resizing) and the proportional height depending on the original values of the video?
