what's the difference between hypothesis function outputed by algorithm A and polynomial function in the book,"foundations of machine learning"

I am on the 28 page of the book called "foundations of machine learning" by M.Mohri which contains this(in the iamge below) defination of the PAC learning framework.I am a bit coufused about what exactly is the polynomial function and why are they passing those parameters(size(c),inverse of delta etc), and how different it is from the hypothesis function outputed by the algorithm A(as specified in the book). Thank You
