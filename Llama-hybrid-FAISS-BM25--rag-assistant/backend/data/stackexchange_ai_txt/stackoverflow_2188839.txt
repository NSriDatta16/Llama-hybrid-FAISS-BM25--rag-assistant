If Vim's :make command is changing the current working directory, and autochdir is not set, a plugin may have added an autocommand to the QuickFixCmdPre set. One plugin that does this is eclim, which calls the QuickFixLocalChangeDirectory() function if g:EclimMakeLCD is set to 1. Use :au to find all the autocommands in your current configuration, paying particular attention to entries for QuickFixCmdPre and make.
