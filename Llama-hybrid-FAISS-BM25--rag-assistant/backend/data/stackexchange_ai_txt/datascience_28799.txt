Are the raw probabilities obtained from XGBoost, representative of the true underlying probabilties?

1) Is it feasible to use the raw probabilities obtained from XGBoost, e.g. probabilities obtained within the range of 0.4-0.5, as a true representation of approximately 40%-50% chance of an event occurring? (assuming we have an accurate model) 2) The same question as in 1), but for other models that can output raw probabilities.
