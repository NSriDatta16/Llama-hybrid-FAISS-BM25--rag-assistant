Yes that's absolutely possible. You could do something like {{#myarray}} {{! loop through array}} {{#src}} {{! if you have src it must be an img}} {{/src}} {{#text}} {{! if you have text is must be a paragraph}} {{text}}{{/p}} {{/text}} {{#href}}} {{! if you have an href is must be an anchor}} {{label}} {{/href}} {{/myarray}} No reason to extend the json at all, as long as the fields are unique to a certain type of output. You can just check if the field exists, and then if it does it must be output in a certain way. The other thing you can do instead of having a 'type' field is have the json set with various flags to base you're template on (e.g. 'is_image: true', 'is_anchor: true', etc).
