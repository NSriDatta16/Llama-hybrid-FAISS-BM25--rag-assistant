How can i create a shortcut file to a sharepoint document library so that i can email it to people

I need to create a shortcut file that links to a sharepoint document library and then send that in an email (don't worry about outlook blocking lnk files). I have had a look at how to how to create a standard shortcut file in C# but this fails when you give it a server address (\servername\site\documentlibrary) Does anyone have an idea on how to do this. Also would be super to know how i can convert the link into and SPFile object so that i can also attached it to a list item once i have created it. To try and add some more context. I cannot just send the user an html link in an email as the end functionality is that the user will be able to dragfile onto the shortcut and have them imediatly uploaded to the document library.
