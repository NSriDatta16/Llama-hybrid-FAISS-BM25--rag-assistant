All browsers I know of select all the text content in the source between the elements under the cursor positions you start to drag and stop dragging. Also they appear in the clipboard as the same order as the source regardless of display position. Take note, right floated content never display before the content that comes before in the source also to give a clue to users. You need to order your text content logically and not nest in order to select it separately. If you put your floated span at the start of a paragraph selecting the paragraph text will work as you want. You cannot select more than one paragraphs without a note in between without using approximate CSS tricks or using js coupled with structural hacks described in this answer which I do not recommend at all.
