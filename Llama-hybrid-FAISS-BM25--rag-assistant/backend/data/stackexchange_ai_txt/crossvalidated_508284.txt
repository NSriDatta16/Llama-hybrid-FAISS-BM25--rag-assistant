Why is Cauchy the default prior for both testing and estimation?

Assume that a data set follows a normal distribution and the prior and posterior both have a normal-gamma distribution. When we are performing Bayesian analysis but don't want any subjective choice of prior to affect the posterior we are recommended to choose the NormalGamma(0, 0, 0, -1) which is a special case of the reference prior, independent Jeffreys prior. It's said that it is because the prior is invariant to the units of the data. But when we are considering a non-conjugate prior, the Cauchy distribution is said to be prefered both for testing and estimation. I learned that Cauchy distribution is a special case of a student t distribution with $v_0$ as 1. But I wonder why Cauchy distribution was recommended by Sir Harold Jefferys as a default objective prior for both estimation and testing?
