My view is that the data for an HMM should be stacked up by time and hierarchical cross-section to produce a sensible model. Consider a simple example from an educational HMM study: a single variable for time which can be very granular, e.g., daily hours and seconds a variable representing the smallest unit of analysis, e.g., this could be the student various higher order variables as appropriate, e.g., class or teacher, school, district, etc. The variable for time can be aggregated into new variables such as hour of day, day of week, month, quarter, year, and so on, as appropriate to capture temporal seasonalities . Here is a spreadsheet-type representation of the structure of this information: This data structure enables the HMM to capture changes in the various aspects of the cross-sectional and temporal information. Note that this structure is completely different from the structures associated with many machine learning algorithms which all too frequently destroy structure and variance, e.g., image-mining analyses which transform a digitized image into a single record of pixel-level information.
