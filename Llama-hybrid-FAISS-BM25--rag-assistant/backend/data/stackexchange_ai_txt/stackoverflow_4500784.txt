This is what I used to make something draggable, maybe it will help you... // make items draggable... $("#CmsDynamicToolbarItems").find("ul li") .draggable({ containment: "#CanvasAreaCoverPage", snap: true, scroll: false, helper: "clone", revert: "invalid", opacity: 1.0, cursor: "move" }); There could be various reasons, but things like cloning the item, containing the element can help, but they are not really needed. I would select the id of the html element first, then add draggable to it, then start to use classes for draggable.
