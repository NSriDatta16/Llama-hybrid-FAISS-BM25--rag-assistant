Creating SWT Forms using Eclipse similar to Visual Studio C#/VB, possible?

Please forgive if this question has been asked numerous times. I recently installed Eclipse Classic v3.6.0 which I need to create a little utility using Java. In Visual Studio I can create a new form then from the Toolbar I can drag and drop components (Button, TextBox, ListBox, etc) onto the Form. Is this possible using Eclipse? I have tried various (see below for a few examples) combination using both Stack Overflow and Google, but nothing that I have seen that discusses this topic. I have read that there are plug-ins for Eclipse and was thinking there might be a plug-in for this type of behavior? I am not sure if this feature is supported out of the box. Any help is greatly appreciated. "eclipse form drag drop" "using eclipse drag and drop form creation" I have also found the following links that show examples for creating Form using SWT, but these are more of snippets. These are great if I want to generate the file myself, but I would like the IDE to most of that work (since I am lazy).
