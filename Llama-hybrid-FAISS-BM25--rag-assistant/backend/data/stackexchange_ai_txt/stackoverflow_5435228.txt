Sort an array with arrays in it by string

I have an array that contains several arrays and I would like to order the arrays based on a certain string within those arrays. var myArray = [ [1, 'alfred', '...'], [23, 'berta', '...'], [2, 'zimmermann', '...'], [4, 'albert', '...'], ]; How can I sort it by the name so that albert comes first and zimmermann comes last? I know how I would do it if I could use the integer for sorting but the string leaves me clueless. Thank for your help! :)
