The specification says: Language information specified via the lang attribute may be used by a user agent to control rendering in a variety of ways. Some situations where author-supplied language information may be helpful include: Assisting search engines Assisting speech synthesizers Helping a user agent select glyph variants for high quality typography Helping a user agent choose a set of quotation marks Helping a user agent make decisions about hyphenation, ligatures, and spacing Assisting spell checkers and grammar checkers Aside from that, I wouldn't imagine it would affect layout or the document mode (quirks mode vs standards mode). PPK's Quirksmode is pretty much the standard reference when it comes to things like this, and searching that site shows no mention of the lang attribute.
