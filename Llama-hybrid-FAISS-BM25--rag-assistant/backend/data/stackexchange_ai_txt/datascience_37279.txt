Depends on what the Colour means in your data. Example temperature can be colour from blue and red, in which case 1-hot won't work. But looks like colour is categorical in your data. In that case it depends on what you are using to classify the data, are you using a decision tree, or SVM etc. Cos in case of decision tree you don't have to do anything as it can take care of categorical data ( again depends on which implementation you use ). in case of other methods they have their own ways in which categorical data has to be handled.
