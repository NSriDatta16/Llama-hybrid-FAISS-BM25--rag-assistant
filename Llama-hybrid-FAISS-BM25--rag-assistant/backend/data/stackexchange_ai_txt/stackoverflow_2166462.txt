UITableViewController and detecting touches

I have a UITableViewController and want to detect touches. Basically, I want the user to be able to hold down a touch for 3 seconds, when they let go I want to pop up a small view with a few options for the table. I've tried this... - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { self.lastTouch = [event timestamp]; NSLog(@"TLC.touchesBegan:touchBeginEndInterval %f", self.lastTouch); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSTimeInterval touchBeginEndInterval = [event timestamp] - self.lastTouch NSLog(@"TLC.touchesEnded:touchBeginEndInterval %f %f", self.lastTouch, touchBeginEndInterval); } And it isn't picking up my touches at all... Any ideas about the best way to implement this?
