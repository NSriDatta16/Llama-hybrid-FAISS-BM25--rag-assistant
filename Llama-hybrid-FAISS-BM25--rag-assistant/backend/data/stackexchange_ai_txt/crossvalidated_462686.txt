Strange digit in binary logistic regression analysis exp (b), how can i understand and/or solve this?

I have a question. I want to conduct a binary logistic regression analysis, with a dependent categorical variable of "20 or higher score on an addiction severity questionnaire" and predictors. But, i want to understand the following that I have included as an image as well in this posting. 1) when I include 4 predictor variables, I do understand that I get different data and exp (b) per predictor than when I use 6 predictors. But, what i do not understand is, when i use extra predictors, that a predictor that earlier revealed a lower predictive value, somehow shows a higher predictor value suddenly. And 2) in the picture you can see the "Drinker + me association score using all blocks", which shows a strange exp (b) value when I use it in the analysis with 6 predictors. >>>>>>>> i would like to understand how this is possible, what i am doing wrong, and if i can prevent this from occurring or solve it.
