You can fit a multiple logistic regression. But your larger goal is to make a claim about causality , which is rarely easy to do with observational data. In surveys/questionnaires, for example, you need to worry about nonresponse bias, reverse causation, and human biases associated with people's perceptions of themselves (I'm sure there are others too, this is not an exhaustive list). Logistic regression is a tool that will not fix any of these problems for you - it will merely identify patterns within the data that you have. You may be interested in some of the threads in our causality tag, especially Under what conditions does correlation imply causation?
