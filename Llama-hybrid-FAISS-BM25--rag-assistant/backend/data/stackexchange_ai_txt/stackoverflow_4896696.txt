That's a question in AI. If you think about it, the reason you know it's a ball and not a moon, is because you've seen a lot of balls and moons in your life. So, you need to teach the program what a ball is, and what a moon is. Give it some kind of dictionary or something. The problem with a dictionary of course would be that to match the object with all the objects in the dictionary would take time. So the best solution would probably using Neural networks . I don't know what programming language you're using, but there are Neural network implementations to most languages i've encountered. You'll have to read a bit about it, decide what kind of neural network, and its architecture. After you have it implemented it gets easy. You just give it a lot of pictures to learn (neural networks get a vector as input, so you can give it the whole picture). For each picture you give it, you tell it what it is. So you give it like 20 different moon pictures, 20 different ball pictures. After that you tell it to learn (built in function usually). The neural network will go over the data you gave it, and learn how to differentiate the 2 objects. Later you can use that network you taught, give it a picture, and it a mark of what it thinks it is, like 30% ball, 85% moon.
