Maybe one of the Org-mode clones for VIM (e.g. VimOrganizer ) is the right tool for you: It is designed for task managment It uses only text files => git can track everything It's integrated in VIM Emacs Org-mode has a powerful note taking system (called capture ). I don't know about the VIM clones. But at least you can write your notes directly into the plain text files. There is no real CLI, but maybe VIM is all you want/need?
