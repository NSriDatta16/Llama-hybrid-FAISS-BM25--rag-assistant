Multiclass classification and imbalanced data

My data has 20k instances of class A and 5 instances of class B. If I am using Cost Sensitive models (Cost-sensitive Logistic Regression, Cost-sensitive Decision Trees etc) for imbalanced datasets, do I then need to perform SMOTE and any other techniques? Also some models are robust to imbalance like random forest, XGBoost. So if I am using these models, do I need to perform SMOTE? Thanks in advance!
