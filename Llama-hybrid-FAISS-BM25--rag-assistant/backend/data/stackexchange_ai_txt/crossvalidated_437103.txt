As Tim showed you can test more parameter values with random search than with grid search. This is especially efficient if some of the parameters you test end up not being impactful for your problem, like the 'Unimportant parameter' on Fig 1 from the article. I did a post about hyperparameters tuning where I explain the differences between grid search, random search and Bayesian Optimization. You can check it out (and let me know if it was useful, feedback is appreciated!)
