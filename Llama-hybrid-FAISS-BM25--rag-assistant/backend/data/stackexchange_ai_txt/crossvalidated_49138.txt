If I understand your problem, you performed PCA on scores derived from a validated survey. In your PCA, respondents’ scores for the terms "pleasant", "comfortable", "relaxing", and "welcoming" are highly correlated with a single PC, which you have called "positive perception". Now, you want to be able to ask fewer questions (shorter survey, less time-consuming for respondents). I am afraid you would indeed have to perform a validation study to ensure “positive perception” was a good replacement for all those other terms. I am also afraid “positive perception” would make a poor replacement: “pleasant”, “relaxing”, etc are much easier to relate to, and this is very important in a survey. If you want to reduce the number of questions in your survey, look at the correlation between, say, a respondent’s scores for “pleasant”, “comfortable”, etc. If these are highly correlated with one another, you could keep only one of them and drop the others.
