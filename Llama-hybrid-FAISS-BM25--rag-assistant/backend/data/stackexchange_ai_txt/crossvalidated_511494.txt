Likelihood of a human name being last name given two first and last name sets that intersect

We have two lists, one being human first M and the other last N names all unique. Let's consider these lists exhaustive with unknown name frequencies. The lists overlap (meaning that some last names can be first as well) and this intersection has K names. We observe a name which is in the intersection. What is the the likelihood that this will be e.g. a last name? Will Bayesian inference apply or I'm overcomplicating?
