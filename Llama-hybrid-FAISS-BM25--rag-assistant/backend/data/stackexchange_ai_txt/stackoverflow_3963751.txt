If you have a one to one hash on the set of integers from 0 to (N/n) + 1 then you can solve it by N iterations + N/n iterations with N memory useage. However there isn't a one to one mapping If there is no constraint on memory it just must be constant you can define an array the size of the domain of longs that then you can solve the problem in 2N with constant gargantuan memory usage. For every x in N you simply Add to BIGARRY[x] then loop though BIGARRY looking for m. Its terrible and non implementable but meets the requirements and most interview questions are thought experiments any way.
