Active Directory - how to retrieve all schema entries for a user

I am wanting to develop a staff directory application, listing all people in the organization, including name, email address, phone number, office location - all of that information. We currently have that in Active Directory, and I'm wanting to develop a simple .Net application to allow people to search and retrieve it. Getting the information appeared simple - there are many examples around using the DirectorySearcher class. I start with Dim objADAM As DirectoryEntry ' Binding object. Dim objGroupEntry As DirectoryEntry ' Group Results. Dim objSearchADAM As DirectorySearcher ' Search object. Dim objSearchResults As SearchResultCollection ' Results collection. Dim strPath As String ' Binding path. objADAM = New DirectoryEntry(strPath) objADAM.RefreshCache() objSearchADAM = New DirectorySearcher(objADAM) objSearchADAM.Filter = "((&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person)))" objSearchADAM.SearchScope = SearchScope.Subtree objSearchResults = objSearchADAM.FindAll() I then have a for each loop for each SearchResult Object in the objSearchResults set. If objSearchResults.Count <> 0 Then Dim objResult As SearchResult For Each objResult In objSearchResults objGroupEntry = objResult.GetDirectoryEntry I also looked at all of the directory entry properties - the core properties are there, but if I use Active Directory Explorer to browser an actual user object, there are many more attributes listed. Is there some more complex structure to Active Directory that means I need to do more that just the simple FindAll method of a DirectorySearcher? Thanks...
