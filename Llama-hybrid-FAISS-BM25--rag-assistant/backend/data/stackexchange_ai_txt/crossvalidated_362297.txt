Forecasting non-stationary time series using MLP

I noticed that in many tutorials with neural networks people difference their time series prior to training/forecasting. Suppose that we have a window model with many autoregressive terms (say 365 days) that theoretically covers all possible cycles and many samples contain trends, is it really necessary to difference the time series before passing it into MLP training? As far as I understand, with sufficiently long sample vectors, MLP can understand long seasonalities, as well as trends, and MLP has no assumptions on stationarity. So, is differencing necessary/advisable/herd mentality when doing time series forecasting using neural networks?
