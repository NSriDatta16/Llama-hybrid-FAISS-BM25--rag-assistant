Google Maps Flash API disables bubbling of MouseEvent over their Markers

By default Google Maps Flash API cancels bubbling of all MouseEvents that occur over their Markers (dragable at least). However in MapMouseEvent constructor I see that it has a parameter "bubbles?" so I guess they can be made to bubble mouse events? Is there a way to turn bubbling of mouse events on? var __marker = new Marker(new LatLng(20, 20), new MarkerOptions({ draggable: true, tooltip:'Drag me' })); __map.addOverlay(__marker);
