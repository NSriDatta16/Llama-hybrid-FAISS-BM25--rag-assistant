To figure out which one it is you need to do two things: One. In code, add IBOutlet to the @interface . For example if you have a UIButton for "pause", you might do @interface blabla { ... IBOutlet UIButton btnPause; } Two. In Interface Builder, ctrl-drag from "File's Owner" to the button and select "btnPause". In the place where you get (id)sender , you can then do e.g. if (sender == btnPause) { ... }
