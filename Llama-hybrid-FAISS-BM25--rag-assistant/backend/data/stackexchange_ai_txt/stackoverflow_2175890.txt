I see that the majority of the responses came out prior to MVC 1.0. Since we are now in 2.0 Preview, I thought it might nice to revisit. I was a ASP.NET developer for about five years before I made the move to MVC last March. I haven't regretted it for a second. I realize now that the stronger I got in ASP.NET WebForms, the more difficult it became to learn other technologies, such as JavaScript and the non-Microsoft implementation of AJAX. Microsoft leveraged their ASP.NET development approach from their WinForms development approach, which helped with the learning curve if you were coming from WebForms development, but it's not a good way to develop web applications if you understand the differences between the two approaches. The latest project I'm working required me to learn ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS 2, and AJAX (non-Microsoft). After only nine months, I feel much better prepared to approach web development projects than I did after five years of ASP.NET development. The ASP.NET implementation makes things so much more difficult to maintain long-term. MVC makes things so much easier, because you're less dependent on shortcuts. It takes a while to learn the framework, but the more you learn about the framework, the less dependent on the framework you become and the more you start to learn and understand the established standards, like JavaScript and AJAX. For me, it is a clear-cut choice. I will never go back to ASP.NET. If I can't use ASP.NET MVC, I'll learn Ruby or PHP. I want the progress and advancement of my web development tools to be motivated by the needs of the developer community, not by profit.
