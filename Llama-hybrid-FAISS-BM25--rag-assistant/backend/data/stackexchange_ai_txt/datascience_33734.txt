deep learning output data in keras fit method

if I have following data set and I want to predict all three feature How should I prepare the output data ? a b c 2265.0 8 21.3515625 2264.5 8 21.3515625 2268.0 8 21.3046875 2266.5 8 21.328125 2260.5 8 21.328125 2259.0 8 21.328125 I know Keras takes 3d input. Therefore the input needs to be reshape. There is a timestamps as well.So the output/label would be all except the time stamp in the dataset ?
