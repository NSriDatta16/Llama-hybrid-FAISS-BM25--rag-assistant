Is it possible to embed a neural network layer into decision tree/random forest?

I want to do a classification task. I designed a customed layer for it. I also want to try decision tree/random forest, but as far as I know there is no way to embed my layer into a decsion tree/random forest and use backpropagation to train it. I can only use either decision tree/random forest or a neural network, am I right?
