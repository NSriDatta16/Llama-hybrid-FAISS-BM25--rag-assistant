I think the answer to your question can be found in the following Stack Overflow question: How to get the cpu usage per thread on windows (win32) . However, I would advise you to endeavour to understand why your program is behaving as it does and attack the root of the problem rather than killing any threads that you take a dislike to. Of course, if the program in question is purely for your own private use then your approach may be perfectly expedient and pragmatic. But if you are writing professional software then I can't see a situation where killing busy threads sounds like a reasonable approach.
