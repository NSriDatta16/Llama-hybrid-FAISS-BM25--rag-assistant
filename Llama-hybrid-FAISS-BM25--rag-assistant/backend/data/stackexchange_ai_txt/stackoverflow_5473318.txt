JQuery and ASP:RadioButton and .change() not working

Found a similar question but it didn't solve my issue. I am trying to call a .change() event to display some hidden text when a user selects a RadioButton. I tried this in JSFiddle and it works with normal forms but can't seem to get it to work with my ASP.NET form. Original code -- http://jsfiddle.net/pJgyu/8226/ (when you click the Yes or No it displays or hides the paragraph). My ASP code -- testing 1...2...3... When I fire off my JQuery code - $("input:radio").change(function () $("p").toggle("slow"); }); and change the "input:radio" to #RadioButton1 (or 2) or even nothing happens. So, what am I doing wrong? I'm a JQuery overall ASP.NET noob. :) Thanks for any direction/pointers/tips.
