I don't mean to be a heretic, but there's a simple rule for cases like this: premature optimization is the root of all evil. 60*4 is only 240 booleans. Even if you somehow manage to store them in the worst possible way and take 1k per boolean, that's still only 240k. As long as that's storage rather than RAM, who cares? Why not start with the simplest possible way and fix it when something comes to you later? SQLite would be perfectly fine for this. If you're close to shipping and have identified this as a problem, by all means ignore this answer. :)
