You're not too specific about what doesn't work, but here's a guess or two at some things that could be causing trouble... One thing that can be easy to forget as a new Cocoa user is that IBOutlets have to be actually hooked up in Interface Builder. Control-drag from each text field to File's Owner in your Document.xib, and make sure that they are assigned to the correct outlet. Another item that seems strange (though I don't know for sure it would cause a problem) is your use of a for loop to set the stringValue of the text fields. If there is more than one item in each element's array, you will need to concatenate the strings yourself before setting the text field's value. Repeatedly setting the value will simply get rid of the previous value. If there is only one item in each array, why not simply do: NSArray *dateElement = [root nodesForXPath:@"//Report/ReportCreationDate" error:nil]; [dateField setStringValue: [[dateElement objectAtIndex:0] stringValue]]; Finally, you might want to try making sure there are no errors when you're querying the NSXMLDocument: NSError *dateErr; NSArray *dateElement = [root nodesForXPath:@"//Report/ReportCreationDate" error:&dateErr]; if( dateElement ){ // set the stringValue } else { // inspect the error }
