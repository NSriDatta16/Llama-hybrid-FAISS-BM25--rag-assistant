Scrolling an editable spark TextArea from Flex Hero Mobile on a touch device

I am having a hard time figuring this out... How do you scroll an editable TextArea (Flex Hero) on a touch device? I am referring to the situation where the text does not fit in the TextArea height. When I try to tap and drag the text gets selected and not scrolled... Am I missing a something here? I am using verticalScrollPolicy = on (also tried auto). I am testing the code in the Blackberry Playbook simulator (my targeted device for my app). If you have any hints or suggestions please let me know. Thanks,
