User Fast Switching Ideas Needed

I'm looking for ideas on how to implement some type of fast login scenario for an application that will allow employees to quickly login. I work with an organization that has employees rotate every 30 minutes to a different location. If there are 3 employees, then the first employee won't come back to the checkout station for an hour. The checkout station is a higher traffic area where different things are borrowed by customers. Right now they have a generic login, but the organization wants to track which employee checked out/in a borrowed item. The problem is when they rotate there are customers there many times and having them logoff and login either via a workstation login or an application login is too slow for customer service. Any suggestions?
