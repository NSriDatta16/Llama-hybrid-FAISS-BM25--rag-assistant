How to form conclusion with logistic regression on leaf infection dataset?

I am working on a leaf infection dataset with three groups; wildtype, transgene line 1 and transgene line 2. The infection data i am looking at is coded as a binary variable (1 if the infection was successful, 0 if the infection failed). For every group there are 24 binary datapoints. head(data) infection groups 1 0 group1 2 0 group1 3 0 group1 4 0 group1 5 0 group1 6 1 group1 I am now looking to detect a difference between the groups through hypothesis testing. I made a logistic regression model in R in which I take wildtype as the reference group. glm(formula = infection ~ groups, family = binomial(link = logit), data = zphyto) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.6835 -0.6835 -0.2918 -0.2918 2.5211 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.3350 0.5026 -2.656 0.00791 ** groupsgroup2 -1.8005 1.1383 -1.582 0.11370 groupsgroup3 -1.8005 1.1383 -1.582 0.11370 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 I get the interpretation of the coefficients, but I would now like to formulate my answer e.g. the chance of being infected is bigger in wildtype than in group 3. Is this possible? Because there seems to be an indication, but the coefficients of group2 and group3 are not significant at the 0.05 level.
