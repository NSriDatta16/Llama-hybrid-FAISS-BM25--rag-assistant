I used to ponder and desire the same feature. But over time, I noticed it really isn't needed. When you stash, it's OK to leave the new files. Nothing "bad" can happen to them (when you check out something else, git will error and not overwrite the existing untracked file) And since usually the time frame between the git stash and the git stash pop is rather small, you'll be needing the untracked file quickly again. So I would say the inconvenience of the file showing up in git status while you're working on something else (between the git stash and the git stash pop ) is smaller then the inconvenience caused by the work and needed attention it would otherwise cost to try to add the untracked file to your stash.
