Try to dig deeper in a specific topic. Ngs course only scratches the surface, but other more specific courses are more theoretical/mathematical. Bayesian networks/ Markov networks: Probability graphical models is a theoretical advanced coursera course on Bayesian networks/Markov networks. The book is even more theoretical. It is full of proofs. Neural Networks: Neural Networks for Machine Learning is also a rather theoretical course as it is really profound. Nonetheless it is not as mathematical as the PGM course I mentioned above. However if you want to understand the theory of Machine Learning itself and not the algorithms you can go for a textbook. In this case go for what @digio proposed.
