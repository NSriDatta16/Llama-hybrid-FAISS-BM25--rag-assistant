Regular expression with RedirectMatch does anything

I use .htaccess to perform redirection. Here the line RedirectMatch permanent .*\?langue=([\w]{2}).*id_([\w]+)=([1-9]+) ***[protocol]***://myserver/rootContext/action?pagename=dir1/dir2/dir3/Redirect&type=$2&id=$3&lang=$1 Here my inital url: ***[protocol]***://localhost/adir/anotherDir/anotherDirAgian/oneMore/apage.php?langue=fr&id_dossier=261 This regular expression is correct, but at least, no redirection is done. With silmple regular expression and simple url it works correctly. Does somebody can help? Thanks David Hoareau
