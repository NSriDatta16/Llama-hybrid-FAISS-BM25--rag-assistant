Just for fun, here's a bit different solution that leaves NULL handling to avg() function: SELECT avg(colValue) from ( SELECT col1 as colValue from tbl UNION ALL SELECT col2 as colValue from tbl UNION ALL SELECT col3 as colValue from tbl ) Values from co1l, col2 and col3 are put in one virtual column and then database calculates average. You don't have to worry about NULL values - database and avg() function will do it for you. Note: This could be slower than other solutions since it can cause 3 full table scans to create virtual table. Check execution plan.
