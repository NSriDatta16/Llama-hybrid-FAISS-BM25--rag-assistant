Looking for a PersistJS type plugin for jQuery

Looking for a plugin that functions like PersistJS. The popular plugins I've found so far are "jStore" by Eric Garside and jStorage by Andris Reinman. What those two are missing is a fallback for a browser that does not support any local db which PersistJS does using cookies. I could just refactor PersistJS for jQuery but wanted to check to see if anyone knows of one that already exists. Looking for the plugin to include... Local storage google gears whatwg global storage flash ie userdata cookie if all else fails Thanks
