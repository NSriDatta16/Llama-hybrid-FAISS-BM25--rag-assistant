You must try John K. Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis . In section "7.1.1 A politician stumbles upon the Metropolis algorithm" it explains in very straightforward manner, using the analogy of the salesman trying to visit each customer who lives on different island, how exactly both Metropolis works. By using this island-hopping analogy he explains with many examples and illustrations in R, how does the Gibbs sampler works as well. It is a best book I've read about this problem so far.
