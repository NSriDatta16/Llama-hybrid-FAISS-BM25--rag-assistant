It's hard to say what's the "best" way to write it elegantly without having a grander scheme of things, but at least you can shorten it as follows: Alternately, if you don't like the && style, you can use a ternary operator: Or another conditional. Coarsely, if "most" elegant way would be to take a closer look at what $box1 and $box2 represent and then create a view helper (in the MVC methodology) along the lines of: class SomeModel { int $box1; int $box2; function make_suffix() { $suffix = ''; if(!empty($this->box1)) { if(!empty($this->box2)) { $suffix .= ' | '; } $suffix .= 'content here'; } return $suffix; } }
