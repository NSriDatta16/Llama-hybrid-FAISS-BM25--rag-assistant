Making dynamic images have static filenames

My website currently has various links to a php script that generates the images dynamically. For example, the link may say "img source="/dynamic_images.php?type=pie-chart&color=red" Obviously, this is not great for SEO. I'd like to somehow make the filenames of these links appear to be static, and use a solution (like Mod-Rewrite) to ensure that the images can still be dynamically created. I suppose I could have something like "img src="average-profits-in-scuba-diving-industry.png?type=pie-chart&color=red" (and use Mod-Rewrite to take care of changing the filename prefix to dynamic_images.php), but I'm afraid that the search engines would shy away from the querystring on the end of the image filename. Any solutions? Thanks in advance.
