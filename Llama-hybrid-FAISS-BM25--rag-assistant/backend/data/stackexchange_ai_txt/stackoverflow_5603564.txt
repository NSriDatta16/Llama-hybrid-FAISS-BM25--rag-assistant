How allocation is done depends entirely on the file system type (e.g. FAT32, NTFS, jfs, reiser, etc. etc.) and the driver software. Your assumption that the file will be stored contiguously is not necessarily true - it may be more performant to store it in a different pattern, depending on hardware. For example, let's say you have a disk with 16 cylinder heads and a blocksize of 512 bytes, then it could be most efficient to store an amount of 8k data on 16 different cylinders. OTOH, with recent hardware that does not involve rotating mechanical parts, the story changes dramatically - a concept like "fragmentation" becomes suddenly meaningless, because the access time to each block is the same - no matter in which order it is done.
