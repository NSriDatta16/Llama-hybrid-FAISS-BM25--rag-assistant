Saving for "always" information in Android phone

Hello I'm creating application for android no mater what kind but I need to store some information that information are so important because it's kind of result of registration and future settings for application, and now in managing application there is a button which can clear data, is there any way to disable it? I found some threads in internet where people writing that no it's impossible. Or maybe if I'll use internal storage to save that information if the user will press "clear data" it'll also delete files in internal storage or not? I can also use IMEI to identify phone user but what if the IMEI number will be unavailable? I really need help any idea how I can do it?
