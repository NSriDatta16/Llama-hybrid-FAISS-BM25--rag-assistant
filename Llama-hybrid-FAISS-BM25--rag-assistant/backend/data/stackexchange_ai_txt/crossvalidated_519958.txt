With multiple imputed data, how do you probe a categorical-by-categorical interaction in logistic regression?

I am working with 10 multiple imputed datasets in SAS. I used the command PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC to fit a multivariate model with 6 predictors (3 dichotomous and 3 categorical) and their interaction terms, controlling for a numbers of relevant covariates. The predictor variables are as follow: CVD (0 = No; 1 =Yes) HCA (0 = Low; 1= High) EDU (1=High School Dropout; 2=Graduated High School; 3=Some College; 4=Graduated College) POV (1=Low; 2=Medium; 3=High) LAN (1=Spanish; 2=English) STA (0=Old, 1=New, 2=None) My outcome variable is diabetes medication use and is coded as 0 = no use and 1 = current use I found the following: One of the levels of the interaction of EDU*STA is marginally significant. Only one of the levels of the interaction of POV*STA is marginally significant. My questions are: When working with multiple imputed data, how do you probe a categorical-by-categorical interaction in logistic regression? What would be the appropriate approach to graphically represent the interaction?
