Can I create a dataset XSD without using the designer?

I want to be able to create the XSD file for my typed dataset without using the visual studio dataset designer. Is there a way to do this using for instance a command-line tool? There is some magic happening when a table is dragged from the server explorer to the design surface, but where does that magic come from? To add some flavour to the mix, I am using DB2 LUW 9.1, but I am guessing that the process is similar using other database vendors. Once I have the XSD I can use XSD.exe to create my .CS class, no problem. Thanks for any help or suggestion! /Per
