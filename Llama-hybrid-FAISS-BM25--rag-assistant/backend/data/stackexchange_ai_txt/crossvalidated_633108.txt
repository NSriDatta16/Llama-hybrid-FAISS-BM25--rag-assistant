Combining several comments and adding some of my thoughts. Unless there is some reason to use multiple models, I would go with one model. Ordinal logistic regression is the place to start. In R, you can check the proportional odds assumption using nominal_test . Something like: install.packages("ordinal") library(ordinal) m1 If you find violations then one option is multinomial logistic, but there is also the partial proportional odds model, in case the violations are all around one variable.
