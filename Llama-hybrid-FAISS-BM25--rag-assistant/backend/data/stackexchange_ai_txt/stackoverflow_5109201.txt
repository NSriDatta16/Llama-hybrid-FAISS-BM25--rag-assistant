Refs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190806.aspx http://www.dba-oracle.com/t_garmany_easysql_btree_index.htm This answer is here to point out that SQL Server Included columns do not store the INCLUDED columns at the key levels, only at the leaf level. If you include 4 columns, they get stored as data in a block on the leaf level. Creating them as additional parts of a composite index breaks the index into more levels instead. As composite index (A,B,C) Level1 Level2 Leaf (Branch) A1 B1 C1 B2 C3 B3 C6 C7 A2 As index (A) include (B,C) Level1 Leaf A1 B1,C1 | B2,C3 | B3,C6 | B3,C7 A2 null,null The difference in storage structure (which affects performance) is the reason why they are introduced as INCLUDED columns, otherwise there would be no reason to introduce this new feature.
