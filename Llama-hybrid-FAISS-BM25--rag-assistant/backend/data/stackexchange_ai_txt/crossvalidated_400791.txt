How to visualize movie trailer views pre and post movie release?

I want to visualize how view counts on movie trailers (e.g. on Youtube) evolve over time. Specifically, I want to see whether the rate of views increases or decreases following the release of the actual film. For a single movie this would be simple - I would make a line plot of views on the y-axis, time on the x-axis starting at the time that the trailer was released, and denote the point in time that the movie was released. I could then look at the trends in views before and after the movie release fairly easily. But what about when I want to scale this to include 1000 movies, all released at different points in time, with different lengths of time between the release of the trailer and the movie. I cannot just stack them due to these time constraints. What might be an elegant way to display this?
