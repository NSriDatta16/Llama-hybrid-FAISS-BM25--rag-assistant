We can view the time series as a realization of a sequence of random variables $Y_t$, where $Y_t$ has expected value $X_t$ (the level) and, in the case you describe, standard deviation proportional to $X_t$ - let's say it is $c X_t$ for some constant $c$. So for a fixed value of $t$, we can view $X_t$ as a constant and $Y_t$ as a random variable. If the distribution of $Y_t$ is normal, and we take logarithms, then we get data $\ln Y_t$. We typically do this only if the standard deviation of $Y_t$ is small, relative to its mean - in particular, we don't want to have negative values $Y_t$. If we assume $Y_t$ is normally distributed and its standard deviation is much smaller than its mean (i.e., $c \ll 1$), then $\ln Y_t$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $\ln X_t$. The deviations from the mean are then approximately equal to $\ln Y_t - \ln X_t = \ln \frac{Y_t}{X_t}$. Since $Y_t$ was normally distributed with mean $X_t$ and standard deviation $c X_t$, the quotient $\frac{Y_t}{X_t}$ is normally distributed with mean 1 and standard deviation $c$. Using $c \ll 1$, we can approximate the distribution of its logarithm as having mean 0 and standard deviation $c$. Now we can let $t$ vary again, and we see that $\ln Y_t$ has a standard deviation that doesn't depend on $t$ - in other words, it's constant.
