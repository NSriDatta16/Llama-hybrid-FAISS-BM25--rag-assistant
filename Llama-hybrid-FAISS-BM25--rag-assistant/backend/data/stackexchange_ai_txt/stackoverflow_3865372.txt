If you can map this to a udf you can drag the udf into the data-contex. When accessed via the data-context LINQ-to-SQL can do the translation. If you are just filtering an iqueryable, you can write a method that just uses Where (returning a new iqueryable) which can work well. If you need mug more, you might have to mess with expression trees manually.
