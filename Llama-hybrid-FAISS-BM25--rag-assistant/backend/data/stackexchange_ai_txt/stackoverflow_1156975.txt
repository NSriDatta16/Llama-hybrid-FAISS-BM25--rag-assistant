copy/paste event listener in C#

I'm new to C# (I'm used to Java) and am trying to implement a listener that can run in the background of a Windows XP computer and be able to see when a user does a copy, cut, or paste operation. I found this page and have attempted to implement that listener, but I keep having problems. My question is two fold: one, will the listener on this page solve my problem? and if so, any tips on implementing it? I'm getting: The type or namespace name 'DragDropOrCopyPasteEventArgs' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) I've tried attaching the necessary assembly reference, but I don't seem to have the correct dll. Thanks a ton in advance. (before anyone asks, I am not writing a virus, its a writing analyzer)
