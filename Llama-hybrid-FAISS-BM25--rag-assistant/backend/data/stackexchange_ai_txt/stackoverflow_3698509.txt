If you're set on writing your own parser, I'd take the Zed Shaw approach: use the Ragel state machine compiler and build your parser based on that. Ragel can handle input arriving in chunks, if you're careful. Honestly, though, I'd just use something like this . Your go-to resource should be RFC 2616 , which describes HTTP 1.1, which you can use to construct a parser. Good luck!
