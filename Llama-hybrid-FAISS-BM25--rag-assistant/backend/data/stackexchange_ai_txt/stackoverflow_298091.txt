You can see filemon or procmon (sysinternals.com) to see the OS writing to the pagefile - so it must use the appropriate filesystem semantics. If you're swapping because of memory pressure, you've already lost the performance battle and the overheads aren't going to significantly add to the loss (but they will mean your filesystem remains uncorrupted). If the swapping isn't performance critical, who cares about a marginal performance hit for journalling? Cluster size is unlikely to be an issue because that just maps from index->storage on the disk. The pagefile only very rarely changes size so the index will hardly ever change.
