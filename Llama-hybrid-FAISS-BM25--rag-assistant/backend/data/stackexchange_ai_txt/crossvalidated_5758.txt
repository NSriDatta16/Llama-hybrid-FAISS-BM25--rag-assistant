It seems that you can go about this in two ways, depending on what model assumptions you are happy to make. Generative Approach Assuming a generative model for the data, you also need to know the prior probabilities of each class for an analytic statement of the classification error. Look up Discriminant Analysis to get the optimal decision boundary in closed form, then compute the areas on the wrong sides of it for each class to get the error rates. I assume this is the approach intended by your invocation of the Bayes classifier, which is defined only when everything about the data generating process is specified. Since this is seldom possible it is always also worth considering the Discrimination Approach If you don't want to or cannot specify the prior class probabilities, you can take advantage of the fact that the discriminant function can under many circumstances (roughly, exponential family class conditional distributions) be modelled directly by a logistic regression model. The error rate calculation is then the one for the relevant logistic regression model. For a comparison of approaches and a discussion of error rates, Jordan 1995 and Jordan 2001 and references may be of interest.
