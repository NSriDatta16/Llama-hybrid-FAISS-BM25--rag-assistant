Duplicate set of columns from one table to another table

My requirement is to read some set of columns from a table. The source table has many - around 20-30 numeric columns and I would like to read only a set of those columns from the source table and keep appending the values of those columns to the destination table. My DB is on Oracle and the programming language is JDBC/Java. The source table is very dynamic - there are frequent inserts and deletes happen on it. Whereas at the destination table, I would like to keep the data for at least 30 days. My Setup is described as below - Database is Oracle. Number of rows in the source table = 20 Million rows with 30 columns Number of rows in destinationt table = 300 Million rows with 2-3 columns The columns are all Numeric. I am thinking of not doing a vanilla JDBC connection open and transfer the data, which might be pretty slow looking at the size of the tables. I am trying to take the dump of the selected columns of the source table using some sql like - SQL> spool on SQL> select c1,c5,c6 from SRC_Table; SQL> spool off And later use SQLLoader to load the data into the destination database. The source table is storing time series data and the data gets purged/deleted from source table within 2 days. Its part of OLTP environment. The destination table has larger retention period - 30days of data can be stored here and it is a part of OLAP environment. So, the view on source table where view selects only set of columns from the source table, does not work in this environment. Any suggestion or review comments on this approach is welcome. EDIT My tables are partitioned. The easiest way to copy data is to exchange partition netween tables *ALTER TABLE EXCHANGE PARTITION WITH TABLE INDEXES VALIDATION EXCEPTIONS INTO ;* but since my source and destination tables have different columns so I think exchange partition will not work.
