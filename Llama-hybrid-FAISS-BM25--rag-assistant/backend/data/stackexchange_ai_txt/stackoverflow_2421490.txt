Thanks Pablo, just what I was looking for! However, if I can take the liberty of improving your script slightly, I suggest replacing your ^V macro with the following: ; Use backslash instead of backtick (yes, I am a C++ programmer). #EscapeChar \ ; Paste in command window. ^V:: StringReplace clipboard2, clipboard, \r\n, \n, All SendInput {Raw}%clipboard2% return The advantage of using SendInput is that it doesn't rely on the command prompt system menu having an "Alt+Space E P" menu item to do the pasting (works for English and Spanish, but not for all languages). it avoids that nasty flicker you get as the menu is created and destroyed. Note, it's important to include the "{Raw}" in the SendInput command, in case the clipboard happens to contain "!", "+", "^" or "#". Note, it uses StringReplace to remove excess Windows carriage return characters. Thanks hugov for that suggestion!
