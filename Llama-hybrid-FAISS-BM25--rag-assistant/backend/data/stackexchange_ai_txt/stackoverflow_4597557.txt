The ideal clustered index key is: Sequential Selective (no dupes, unique for each record) Narrow Used in Queries In general it is a very bad idea to use a GUID as a clustered index key, since it leads to mucho fragmentation as rows are added. EDIT FOR CLARITY: PK and Clustered key are indeed separate concepts . Your PK does not need to be your clustered index key. In practical applications in my own experience, the same field that is your PK should/would be your clustered key since it meets the same criteria listed above.
