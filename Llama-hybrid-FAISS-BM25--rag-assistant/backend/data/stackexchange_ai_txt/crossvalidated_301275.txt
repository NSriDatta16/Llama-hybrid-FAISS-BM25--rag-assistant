The best place to add non-image/non-spatial/non-temporal features can be at the feature vector level i.e. just after CNN's flatten layer, just before the FC layers. Use Merge layer in Concat mode Let's say you have an image and also some text attached to it. You can use a 2D CNN for the image as usual. For the text you can use another CNN or an RNN. Then flatten it's feature vector and use Merge layer as mention above
