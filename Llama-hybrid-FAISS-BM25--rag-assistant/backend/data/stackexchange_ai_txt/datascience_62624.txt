How to represent a dataset as a linked list-like graph?

I would like to visualize this data set using Python and probably a visualization tool like Matplotlib. The data set contains three columns: a user id with a question, a user id with an answer, and time. I would like to visualize this data set as a linked list style graph. That is a tree-like structure which would show relationships based on the connections between questions and answers. I've tried different sets of keywords in an attempt to find out how to visualize a data set in this way, but to no avail. [I'm new to data science or analysis]. So I would appreciate some help with this.
