Check out swfobject , and particularly you might want to check out this method: swfobject.hasFlashPlayerVersion(versionStr) API docs here . Of course, if swfobject is too big you could just check the sources to see how they do it. I'm not sure if it's possible that you could get a proper return value from that method even if the Flash player is somehow disabled but in that case I suppose you could simply try and embed a swf with swfobject and see if it worked, there's a callback that tell's you wether the embedding was successful or not, check the api docs for more info.
