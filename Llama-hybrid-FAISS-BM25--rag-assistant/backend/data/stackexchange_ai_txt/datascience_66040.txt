Machine learning model bundled with a library vs. an API

I am thinking to "deploy" a machine learning model (in pickle it is sized 3 megabytes) and after discussing with my developer colleagues, they said it would be better if the model is packed as a python library instead of a microservice (like a rest API). I wanted to ask what's your view on this: Pickled model packed in a library specifically meant for it vs. a rest API, pros and cons? I was thinking that having it as a library could possibly be easier to use and wouldn't require to have to worry about deployment, web address etc.
