Troubleshooting an SSL flood

Users connect to our webserver via https, and stay on a secured connection throughout their use of our service. A typical user session will establish a small handful of connections to the server (one or two). There are a very small number of exceptions we are trying to track down. Particular users will intermittently have handfuls of hundreds of connections established. When we happen to catch the problem in the act, we can see the exchange of the SSL handshake, and from the perspective of the server, all appears to be in order. Yet we never observe a payload - the client instead connects on a new port and initiates a new handshake. We do not have access to the client, and cannot observe the behavior from that side of the connection. Nor do we have a local scenario that can reproduce the problem. It is our belief (though not confirmed) that the user agent is connecting to our server directly, and not through a proxy. Does anybody recognize these symptoms? Can anyone suggest steps to further identify the problem?
