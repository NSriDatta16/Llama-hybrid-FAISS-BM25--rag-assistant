You can't rely on all email clients to insert "\r\n" when wrapping text. The difference in line ending characters usually depends on the operating system conventions. People usually have to press return twice to make a real paragraph break in email, so it is probably best to remove single line endings, but leave multiple line endings. I.e. "\r\n" or "\n" gets stripped, but "\r\n\r\n" and "\n\n" are left.
