IE6 renders spacing even when margin and padding are zero

I've created this contrived example to illustrate my problem. There are two paragraphs with a div in between. The div's height and line-height have been set to 0 and all margins are also 0. I would expect for the two paragraphs to be right next to each other without any spacing from the div at all, however this is not the case in IE6. It seems to work fine in all other browsers. Here is the HTML with all styles inlined: Test Some text &nbsp; Should be right below "Some text" I've added in a few borders just so you can more easily see what's going on. Here's a screenshot of what's happening in IE6: Any ideas on how I can get rid of that little space between the bottom of the div (red) and the top of the paragraph (green)?
