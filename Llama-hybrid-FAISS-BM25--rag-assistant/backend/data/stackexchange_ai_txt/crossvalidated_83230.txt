It has just been pointed out to me that I made a mistake in my simulation. So my theoretically based assumption was sound: under the exponential AFT model coxph() and survreg(,dist="exponential") should provide on average the same answer. However my implementation of the exponential AFT model in the R simulation was incorrect. I simulated: logT However, under my assumptions, it is not logT that is exponentially distributed, but T. So instead, I should have replaced the above two lines in my code with: T After this change, the code produced the results I expected.
