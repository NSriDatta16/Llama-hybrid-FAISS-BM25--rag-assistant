what's in a name: Bias?

I'm studying machine learning and one of the key points I make sure is to understand the origin and the reasoning why such a name or term is used. It could be a rich and insightful dive into the concept it is trying to convey. So, about bias-variance trade-off. Why use the word 'bias'? In the usual, everyday parlance, 'bias' means leaning towards one side. If in the case of explaining pros and cons of a certain ideology, to be 'biased' means to give an unbalanced view and lean towards something. Can we say the same for machine learning? Thanks
