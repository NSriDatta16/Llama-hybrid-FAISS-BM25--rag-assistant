Show that a zero mean, stationary process with correlation < 0.5 only at lag 1 is representable as an MA(1)

I am trying to solve an exercise from Time Series Analysis: with Applications in R by Cryer and Chan. Suppose that ${Y_t}$ is a zero mean, stationary process with $|\rho_1| 1$. Show that ${Y_t}$ must be representable as an MA(1) process. That is, show that there is a white noise sequence ${e_t}$ such that $Y_t=e_t-\theta e_{t-1}$ where $\rho_1$ is correct and $e_t$ is uncorrelated with $Y_{t-k}$ for $k>0$. (Hint: Choose $\theta$ such that $|\theta| I have begun to try to derive $Y_t = e_t - \theta e_{t-1}$ by, as in the hint, setting $$ \begin{align} e_t & = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \theta^j Y_{t-j}\quad \text{and expanding into} \\ & = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \theta^j Y_{t-j} + \theta^0 Y_{t-0} \\ & \iff \\ Y_t & = e_t - \sum_{j=1}^\infty \theta^j Y_{t-j} \end{align} $$ but I don't know how to proceed from here. I have also attempted to set $\theta$ to some value that satisfies the prerequisites, such as 0.4, but again: I'm not sure if that is helpful.
