Hidden-Markov Model for Markov-Chain with Sequential Bernoulli State Sampling

Consider a finite discrete-time Markov chain whose state is sampled at the times determined by the outcome of a Bernoulli process. That is, in each time period I flip a biased coin. If it comes up as "heads," I get to see the state of the Markov chain. If it comes up as "tails," I see nothing. My questions are: Suppose the Bernoulli process is independent of the chain's state. Can one describe this observation model using a hidden Markov model specification? If the answer to the above is "yes", is it possible to code this specification in depmixS4 or other HHM package to fit the parameters of the chain and the Bernoulli process? How are the answers to the above affected if the probability of success in the Bernoulli process is influenced by the state of the chain?
