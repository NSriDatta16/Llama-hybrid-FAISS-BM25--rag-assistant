Qt Installation Problems on Mac OS X

Over the past 2 years I've had to install Qt 4.5, 4.6 and now 4.7 from source on Mac OS X. Each install causes me no end of trouble. My 2 main issues are: I build Qt in /tmp/ as instructed to. This directory gets wiped clean on a reboot, and stops me from being able to step through Qt code. I've got round this by building in my Users area instead. Every time I blow on my monitor, I can no longer see the values of QStrings (or any other kind of string for that matter) when debugging my application. First I'd like to know what Qt files I should have on my machine and where, when correctly installed. My 'official' installs are in /usr/local/Trolltech , but everything's duplicated in my ~ directory so that I can step through Qt code. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, as the only other mention of this anywhere is a stackoverflow question that I raised myself. Also, how do I use Qt frameworks in my Xcode projects? I tried the following: Dragging the frameworks from my ~ directory, knowing this was probably wrong. Right clicking in Xcode and Add->Existing Frameworks... There used to be some Qt frameworks listed there, but I manually deleted them in Finder prior to installing 4.7 and they never came back. Adding -framework QtCore to Xcode's Other Linker Options and /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.7.1 to Xcode's Framework Search Path . The last bullet fixes my linking errors, but I'm assuming I should be able to see Qt frameworks in the list of available frameworks (both in Xcode and About This Mac->Software->Frameworks). A separate issue I guess, but having got that far, my data formatters in Xcode broke yet again. Where should my data formatter bundle be located in Xcode 3.2.3 and what should the function look like for QStrings? Any help much appreciated. Thanks.
