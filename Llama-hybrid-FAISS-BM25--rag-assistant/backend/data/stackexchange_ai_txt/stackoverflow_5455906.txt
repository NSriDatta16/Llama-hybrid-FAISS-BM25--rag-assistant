Having done that kind of migration: I simply re-installed CCRC server (like any other ClearCase installation, following the general pre-requisites from the manual ) I didn't have to declare any kind of user access (you just need to make sure the user logins are still valid on the new Unix server: ' id -a auser ' should works. Any CCRC client, windows or Linux, will be able to access the new CCRC server, provided they: change the connection address re-create their web views (I din't move the view storages: it was easier for them to recreate what they need)d. Note: a Unix CCRC server won't be able to access Vob servers on Windows, only Vob servers on Unix. If your current Windows CCRC was accessing Unix Vob server, then the migration will be easy. If not, that would mean migrating Vobs from Windows to Unix, and that is quite another task ;)
