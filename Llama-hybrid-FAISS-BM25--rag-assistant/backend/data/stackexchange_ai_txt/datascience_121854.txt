Text segmentation problem

I am new to ML and trying to solve problem of text segmentation. I have a transcript of news show and I want to split this transcript into parts by topic. I tried to google and asked chatgpt and found a lot of info, but I don't understand how to properly run this task. It looks like a classic problem and I cant find proper naming for it. I am looking for help to find proper names for this problem, and, how to approach it with existing tools. My initial thought was to use word embeddings -> sentence vectors with rolling average to detect changes in topics, but this approach does not work. What are other ways to solve this problem?
