Finding images with pure colours

I've read a number of questions on finding the colour palette of an image, but my problem is slightly different. I'm looking for images made up of pure colours: pictures of the open sky, colourful photo backgrounds, red brick walls etc. So far I've used the App Engine Image.histogram() function to produce a histogram, filter out values below a certain occurrence threshold, and average the remaining ones down. That still seems to leave in a lot of extraneous photographs where there are blobs of pure colour in a mixed bag of other photos. Any ideas much appreciated!
