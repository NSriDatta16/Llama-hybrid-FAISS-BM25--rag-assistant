How do I make my application display whatever drag graphic is used by the source?

When you drag a picture from Firefox to Windows Explorer, Explorer shows Firefox's drag graphic. How does he do it? Illustration: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rliNPuKh58 (The video capture is not entirely accurate - the mouse cursor is shown as an arrow at all times when it in fact changes between the default drag and drop cursor and the slashed circle.)
