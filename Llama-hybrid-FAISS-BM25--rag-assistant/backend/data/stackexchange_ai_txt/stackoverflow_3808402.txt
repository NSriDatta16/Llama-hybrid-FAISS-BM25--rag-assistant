Best way to implement Video IM on site

I'm developing what will be a high volume traffic site. To give you some background, its currently based in jQuery, PHP and mysql. Soon, I will be also be implementing NodeJS. I am looking for an open sourced video chat application that will allow: 1) For 2 people to video IM each other. 2) Allow groups of up to 4 people to video IM each other. On the server side: Can those in the know please fill me in. The last time I looked into this was in 2007/8 and it was Flash Comms server and using Flash for the client. Now its nearly 2011, are there any better solutions? Is there a way to leverage skype or facetime? Are there any solutions which are peer to peer, so I do not have high bandwidth costs. On the client side: Is there a way to build a plugin for chrome/firefox but then degrade to flash for IE ? I guess what I am asking is, whether Flash is still the primary solution or can I use something else for the browser? Thanks for any answers :)
