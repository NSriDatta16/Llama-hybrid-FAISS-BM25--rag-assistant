Attach file to blank email in Mail.app from my cocoa app

My requirement is simple. Launch Mail.app and create a blank email and attach a file/files. I've seen NSWorkspace to actually launch mail, but how can I effectively mimic the same functionality when you drag a file to the mail icon? Googled to death but always get Cocoa Touch results! Thanks for any guidance.
