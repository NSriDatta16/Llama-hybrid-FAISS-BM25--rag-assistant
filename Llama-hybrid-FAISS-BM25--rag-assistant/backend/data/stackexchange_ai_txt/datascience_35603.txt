It is helpful to normalize target variables for a regression neural network?

It is customary to normalize feature variables and this normally does increase the performance of a neural network in particular a CNN. I was wondering if normalizing the target could also help increase performance? I did not notice an increase in performance with the data set I am using at the moment but was curious if anyone has tried in the past. Of course the normalization happens only on the training data.
