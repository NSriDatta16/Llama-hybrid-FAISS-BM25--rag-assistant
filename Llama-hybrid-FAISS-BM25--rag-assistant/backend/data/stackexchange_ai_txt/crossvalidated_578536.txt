Which part of a car contributes more to its ability to transport people from point A to B? Is it the tires, engine, or transmission? With any of these, the car wouldn't move very well, so it doesn't make sense to compare their relative importances. Likewise, a neural network wouldn't function with the first few layers (how would you pass in the input?) nor the last few layers (how would you output predictions?).
