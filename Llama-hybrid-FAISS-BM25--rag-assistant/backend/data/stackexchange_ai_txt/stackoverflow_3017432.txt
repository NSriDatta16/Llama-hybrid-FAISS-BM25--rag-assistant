If you are using ASP.NET and the membership provider there are a bunch of different implementations. Here is a link to one: http://blog.dreamlabsolutions.com/post/2009/07/13/ASPNET-Membership-Show-list-of-users-online.aspx If you are not then you will need to be storing when users sign in to your system and keep track of everytime they are 'active' somewhere. I have done this using a the global cache but it really only works for single server solutions. You will need to move to DB storage if you want to use multiple servers but then that is pretty much what the ASP.NET membership will provide you out of the box with very little coding. You can choose how to write to your datastore (such as cache) and expire 'sessions' based on how ever you want such as a specific time period of inactivity, the Session_End event, a logout command, etc...
