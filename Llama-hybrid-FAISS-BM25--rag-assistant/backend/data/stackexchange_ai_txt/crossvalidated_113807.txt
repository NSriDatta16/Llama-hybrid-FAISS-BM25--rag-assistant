You left out the error term from your model. Looks like you're fitting an AR(1) model . If $|a| It's equivalent to fitting $(y(t)-\mu) = a(y(t-1)-\mu)+\epsilon_t$ The question is in terms of estimation of linear models using Maximum Likelihood estimation or any other estimation technique, where in most of the examples I have seen that the parameters are estimated and not the constant terms. The constant term is a parameter. It sounds like all the cases you have dealt with have mean $E(y)=0$. Time series don't usually do that (though if you've differenced the data first, then it's typical to omit constants).
