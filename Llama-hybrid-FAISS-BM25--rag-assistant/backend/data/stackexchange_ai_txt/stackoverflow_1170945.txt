I also have two pointing devices connected to the computer, but inside the c# code, there is no way to tell which one of them that produced the input. I can for instance use one of them for moving the mouse, while using the buttons of the other one and perform drag-drop operations. So you have no choice but to let your program believe in what it sees; that there is only one mouse.
