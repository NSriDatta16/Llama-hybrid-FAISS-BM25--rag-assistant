Recall that a GARCH(1,1) model is a model of the conditional distribution of $x_t$ . The model contains equations specifying the conditional mean, conditional variance by conditional standardized distribution: \begin{aligned} x_t &= \mu_t+\varepsilon_t, \\ \varepsilon_t &= \sigma_t z_t, \\ \sigma^2_t &= \omega + \alpha \varepsilon^2_{t-1} + \beta\sigma^2_{t-1}, \\ z_t &\sim D(0,1), \end{aligned} where $\mu_t$ is the conditional mean of $x_t$ (e.g. a constant or some autoregressive and/or moving-average terms) and $D$ is some distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$ . This can be extended to GARCH(p,q) or GJR-GARCH(p,q) without changing the essence of the argument that follows. So $x_t$ is the original time series, $\hat x_t$ are fitted values of $x_t$ and (if I understand your question correctly) $\text{MSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^n (x_t-\hat x_t)$ (or maybe $\text{MSE}=\frac{1}{n-p}\sum_{t=1}^n (x_t-\hat x_t)$ where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model). $\hat x_t$ are obtained from the fitted model, so calculating the $\text{MSE}$ is not a problem. As you can see, there is no realized variance anywhere, while daily conditional variances are part of the model and their fitted values can be obtained if needed. Does this exposition help answer your question?
