You will want to pay attention to the beginning of your ClientWorker class. In your fields declaration section, you declare some instance members like so: BufferedReader in = null; PrintWriter out; but then in your constructor, you try to use them without initializing them first: String line = in.readLine(); //will throw a NullPointerException LinkedList clients = SingletonClients.getClients(); for(int i = 0; i With regards to your SingletonWorker , if this is part of the project, you are probably being asked to make a singleton in Java. This is not a big deal, but there is obviously one thing that you need to ensure - only allowing one instance of your Singleton to be created during the life of your process. Take a look here for some ideas. If, on the other hand, the SingletonWorker is a helper that you have devised, you might be better off following @willcodejavaforfood's lead and making a type-safe LinkedList.
