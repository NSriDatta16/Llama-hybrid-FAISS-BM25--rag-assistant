At your shell prompt, do: > man wget scroll down to -U agent-string , which states: "Wget normally identifies as Wget/version, version being the current version number of Wget". So do: > wget --version which will give you the version, and thus your user-agent. Incidently, you may find that some sites block wget, so depending on what you're doing you may need to change this.
