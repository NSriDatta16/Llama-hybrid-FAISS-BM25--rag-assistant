I will answer this question from the Bayesian perspective. Consider Bayes' theorem: $$ P(H_0\mid S) = \frac{P(S \mid H_0)}{P(S)}P(H_0) $$ where $S$ is a significant result. We can write an analogous expression for $H_A$. Then, dividing the two expressions, we get $$ \frac{P(H_A\mid S)}{P(H_0\mid S)} = \frac{P(S\mid H_A)}{P(S\mid H_0)}\times\frac{P(H_A)}{P(H_0)} $$ or $$ \mbox{Posterior odds} = \frac{\mbox{Power}}{\mbox{Type I error rate}}\times\mbox{Prior odds}. $$ The term in the middle is called the Bayes factor, and represents the evidence in the data, or the effect on our belief. In particular, the effect of a significant result on our belief (in terms of relative odds of the alternative to the null) is exactly the power over the type I error rate, IF we only know that the result is significant (other facts, for instance the exact $p$ value, might change this assessment). This a significant result with $\alpha=0.05$ and power of 0.8 has an effect of .8/.05=16 on our relative beliefs. Now for a nonsignificant effect, $N$, $$ \frac{P(H_0\mid N)}{P(H_A\mid N)} = \frac{P(N\mid H_0)}{P(N\mid H_A)}\times\frac{P(H_0)}{P(H_A)} $$ which is $$ \mbox{Posterior odds} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\beta}\times\mbox{Prior odds}. $$ The Bayes factor is thus $(1-\alpha)/\beta$. Again, this is the effect that the nonsignificant result has on our (relative) beliefs, IF all we know is that the result is nonsignificant. Taking your example numbers, if $\alpha=.05$ and $1-\beta=.999$, then $$ \frac{1-\alpha}{\beta} = \frac{.95}{.001} = 950, $$ that is, the relative evidence in favor of the null hypothesis is enough to shift your odds by a factor of 950. This is extremely strong evidence. If the power is .5, then $$ \frac{1-\alpha}{\beta} = \frac{.95}{.5} = 1.9, $$ which is extremely weak evidence (keep in mind 1.0 is no evidence either way).
