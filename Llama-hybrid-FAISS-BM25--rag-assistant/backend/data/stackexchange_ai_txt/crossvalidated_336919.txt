Can count data be used as the independent variable in binomial logistic regression or poisson regression?

I have numerous independent variables (some binary, some count data) and am wondering if the count data variables can be used as the independent variable when running a binary log regression. I have read elsewhere that anything can be used as an independent variable, but have been getting unexpected odds ratio results. Is it because some of the count data variables have a lot of 0s? Is there any way to get around this (I was thinking maybe creating bins and creating dummy variables for each bin?).
