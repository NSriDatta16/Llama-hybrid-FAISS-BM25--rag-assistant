One would normally assume the data one intends to predict are generated by the same process that generated the sample data. As we train a model on the sample data, we fit some patterns. When forecasting, we extrapolate them into the future. Once we reverse the time, the patterns change. The model that had captured the proper-time patterns well might be quite bad for capturing reversed-time patterns. Therefore, the reversed time series need not be relevant in terms of model training and performance evaluation intended for the proper time flow. Take an example of an MA(1) process. $$ x_t = \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}. $$ Suppose we have a sample generated by this process. If we consider the class of ARMA models, we might hope to discover correctly that the data generating process is MA(1). We might further hope to estimate the model parameters ($\theta_1$ and the error variance $\sigma^2$) accurately enough and successfully use the estimated model for forecasting. The point forecast from the estimated MA(1) model would be $$ \hat{x}_{t|t-1} = \hat\theta_1 \hat\varepsilon_{t-1}. $$ Once we reverse the time, we have to express $x_t$ in terms of $x_{t+i}$ and $\varepsilon_{t+j}$ for $i,j>0$, estimate the model and use it for forecasting. The problem is, the true model in reversed time will not be an MA(1). Moreover, the MA(1) model might not even be a good approximation for the reversed series. In the class of ARMA models, there will exist numerous better approximations to the reversed process than the MA(1) model. For example, if you keep all your candidate models and test their performance on both the proper time series and the reversed one, you might see quite some changes in the ranking of performance. Therefore, reversing time need not be helpful when you want to test your model performance. It could be helpful in some special cases (e.g. when the data is generated by a linear time trend plus random noise), but not necessarily in general.
