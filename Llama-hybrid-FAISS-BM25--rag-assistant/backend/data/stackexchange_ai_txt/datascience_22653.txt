The main problem is that I do not have a complete "clean" list of company names that I know are present in the dataset. You have a garbage in, garbage out or business process problem. I would suggest: When users enter company information, they should be prompted first to select from a clean list and only type in a value if they say it is not present. After the name of the organization, enter some unique ID at the end in []. Hopefully the imported goods have that on the package. Then parse that unique number out and use that matching.
