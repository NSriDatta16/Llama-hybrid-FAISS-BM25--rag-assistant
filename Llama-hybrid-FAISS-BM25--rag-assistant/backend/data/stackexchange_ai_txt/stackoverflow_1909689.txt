I don't have much experience with macs, so not sure if this version is ok for your, but have a look at http://www.phil.uu.nl/~xges/ssh/ If this particular app doesn't work, that's what you're looking for anyways - ssh agent . On unix-like boxes, you'd want to start your whole window manager through that, to get the global effect, but it might not be possible in osx.
