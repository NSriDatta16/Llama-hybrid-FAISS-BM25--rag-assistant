The Bose-Einstein distribution is used when you are trying to describe a distribution of discrete states that can be populated without restriction. In your above example, each product and it's cost would be analogous to an energy state and it's energy value. This is assuming that you have a number of available products much greater than the total products sold. The total number of products, 275, would be the number of bosonic particles and your average cost would be the average energy of the system. The requirements to use this distribution are: There are no restrictions as to how many individual particles can populate any given state. Thus, if you only had 50 of product A, this would not work as you could not populate product A with 275 purchases (which must be allowed). For situations where these restriction crop up, you might be interested in reading about Fermi-Dirac statistics . The states must be non-interacting. For example, if you were selling bananas, IPhones, and Turpentine, there is probably little correlation between the products (although you have obviously made some questionable business decision, but this is neither here nor there). On the other hand, if you sell IPhones, IPhone cases and bananas, it is likely that people who buy an Iphone will also buy a case. Thus, these events are correlated.
