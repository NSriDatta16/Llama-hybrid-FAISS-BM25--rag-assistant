What does a Flash object know about the page it's in?

The organization I work for has created a small flash widget that we're encouraging supporters to place on their website. I'm trying to determine if there are ways to improve the statistics we get from those embedded widgets. Mostly I would like to get the domain of the site that loaded the widget. Right now I'm able to see the referrer in the server logs, but that includes the full URL, and I don't want to have to write my own log processing system just to pull out domains. I know very little ActionScript, but I've looked around the ActionScript documentation to see if I could find an obvious solution. I haven't found anything that allows the object to ask the browser for the page URL. The System.Capabilities class seems to provide a lot of information about the player's environment, but not where the player was called from (as far as I can tell, but maybe I'm missing something).
