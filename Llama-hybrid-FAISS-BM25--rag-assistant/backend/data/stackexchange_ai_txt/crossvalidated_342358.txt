Queuing Theory: Customers arrive at a fast-food restaurant at the rate of 120 customers per hour

During lunch hour, customers arrive at a fast-food restaurant at the rate of 120 customers per hour. The restaurant has one line, with three workers taking food orders at independent service stations. Each worker takes an exponentially distributed amount of time--on average 1 minute-- to service a customer. Let $X_t$ denote the number of customers in the restaurant (in line and being serviced) at time t . The process $(X_t)_{t \ge 0} $ is a continuous-time Markov chain. Exhibit the generator matrix. I can't for the life of me figure this out. I'm not sure if I can combine the three workers and say that they are servicing 3 customers per minute. Can anyone give some advice on how to start this? Thank you in advance.
