Easiest way is to read it fully, skip the lines which are supposed to be deleted and then write it fully back to the file, hereby overwriting the original one. But that's also the least efficient way. For best results, you need to organize your data more in a model. Why don't you use a (embedded) database instead so that you can just go ahead with a simple SQL DELETE statement?
