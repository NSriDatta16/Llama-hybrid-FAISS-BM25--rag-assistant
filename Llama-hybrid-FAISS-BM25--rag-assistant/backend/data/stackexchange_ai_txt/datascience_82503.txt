How to model a conditional demand forecast model as ex-ante forecast for a moving population?

Goal: I am trying to forecast demand from a specific population given a specific promotion on a certain period of time frame. The data is of the format: date | promotion % | sales in 1000s(y) 01-Jan | 20 | 10 02-Jan | 25 | 12 ... 01-Oct | 23 | 130 Now given that demand at any given point of time t depends on time t-1 , I tried to model this as time series model ,and to capture the impact of promotion, I would add an exogenous variable w/ promotion. So, this would typically be modelled as an ex-ante forecast. The problem starts when population to whom the promotion is offered has to bear a specific criteria(say # of transactions > 2 ). And there are new customers acquired daily, who might or might not bear that specific criteria. In summary, if I look back from 1st-OCT , I have 1000 customers with # of transactions > 2. The demand generated over time from these folks would look like: date | promotion % | # of customers causing demand | sales in 1000s(y) 01-Jan | 20 | 100 | 10 02-Jan | 25 | 150 | 12 ... 01-Oct | 23 | 1000 | 130 Now the forecast needs to be on these 1000 customers only for different promotion values in coming days (02-Oct, 03-Oct,...,07-Oct) i.e. Forecast for: date | promotion % | # of customers causing demand | sales in 1000s(y) 02-Oct | 20 | 1000 | ? 02-Oct | 30 | 1000 | ? 03- Oct| 20 | 1000 | ? 03- Oct| 30 | 1000 | ? Problem: Given, that I am tracking demand generated only due to the folks that I have information so far(1000 customers), in the validation period, the demand curve changes, and does not have the trend and seasonality components as before. This can be seen below: I went thru https://otexts.com/fpp2/forecasting-regression.html , and the solution that came to mind was to be able to predict the number of customers(prediction of predictors) and to translate this into pure ex-ante forecast problem. But the forecast of predictors(# of customers) is difficult and I would want to avoid a convoluted design as far as I can. Another way would be to model this as a regression problem, w/ addition of lag variables as features. I also researched a couple of research papers but so far there is no obvious way of modelling this, or I have limited terminology with me to be able to find this. The actual question: Is there a way to model time series for a growing population causing demand and do a conditional forecast?
