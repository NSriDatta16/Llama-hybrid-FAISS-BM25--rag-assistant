From the API docs , applications targeting DONUT or higher: ...must explicitly request the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to be able to modify the contents of the SD card. (Apps targeting earlier versions will always request the permission.) Hence, if you are building a 1.5 app, you automatically get WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE .
