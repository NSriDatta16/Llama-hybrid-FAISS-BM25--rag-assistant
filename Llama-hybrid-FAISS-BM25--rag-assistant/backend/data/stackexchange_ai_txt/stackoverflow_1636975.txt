Creating a GridView Based Week to View Control

I am trying to build a simple booking application for a school presented as a WebPart that pulls data from several SPLists for existing bookings, recurring (timetabled) bookings and a list of available rooms used as a filter. I admit from the outset that ASP.net isn't my strong point, I am more inclinded to use Console and WinForms projects, however I am willing to learn. The data access parts of the project are simple enough I can pull data and schema from the lists and spit it out. I am struggling with the interactive presentation component implemented with ASP.net and WebParts. The way it is meant to look is something similar to this. Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday Period 1 Book | Book | Book | Book | Book Period 2 Book | Book | Unavail. | Book | Book Period 3 Book | Book | Book | Unavail. | Book Period 4 Book | Book | Book | Book | Book Period 5 Book | Book | Book | Book | Book My plan so far has been to implement the above as a single System.Web.UI.UserControl that would DataBind to a data structure, then possibly trigger events on click to check that they item is still available and make the booking. I am struggling to get my head round the best way to do this there seem to be many ways to acheive the goal none of them seem particuarly elegant, I feel that I am missing something. I would gladly accept any pointers and suggestions as to a good way to attack this project.
