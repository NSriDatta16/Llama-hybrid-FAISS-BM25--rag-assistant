Update There is a new and very simple solution for this: It allows you to use any kind of input filter on a text , including various numeric filters. This will correctly handle Copy+Paste, Drag+Drop, keyboard shortcuts, context menu operations, non-typeable keys, and all keyboard layouts. See this answer or try it yourself on JSFiddle . jquery.numeric plugin I've successfully implemented many forms with the jquery.numeric plugin. $(document).ready(function(){ $(".numeric").numeric(); }); Moreover this works with textareas also! However, note that Ctrl+A, Copy+Paste (via context menu) and Drag+Drop will not work as expected. HTML 5 With wider support for the HTML 5 standard, we can use pattern attribute and number type for input elements to restrict number only input. In some browsers (notably Google Chrome), it works to restrict pasting non-numeric content as well. More information about number and other newer input types is available here .
