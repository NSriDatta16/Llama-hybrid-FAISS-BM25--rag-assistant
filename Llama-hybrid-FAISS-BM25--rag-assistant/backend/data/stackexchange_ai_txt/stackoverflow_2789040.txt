You are indeed drawing a textured quad that is not updating the color buffer and is still updating the depth buffer. However, the values you are writing are the actual depth values of the polygons, and not the values found in the texture! That's why everything ends up being z-culled. The easiest way to accomplish what you want is to use a custom shader and write a custom gl_FragDepth value reading it from your texture.
