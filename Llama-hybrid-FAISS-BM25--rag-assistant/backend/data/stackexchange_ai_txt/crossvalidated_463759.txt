Yes there is indeed, and this link is the basis of the very related dimensionality reduction technique known as Diffusion Maps . Effectively it is a generalization of Laplacian Eigenmaps/Spectral Clustering using the random-walk normalized Laplacian (as opposed to the standard graph Laplacian or symmetric Laplacian). The generalization comes from first normalizing the Laplacian according to $\alpha$ (i.e. generating a reversible Markov Chain on the data): $$L^{(\alpha)} = D^{-\alpha}LD^{-\alpha}$$ before constructing the random walk normalized Laplacian: $$M = (D^{(\alpha)})^{-1}L^{(\alpha)}$$ Where $D^{(\alpha)}$ is the degree matrix of $L^{(\alpha)}$ . The normalization step with $\alpha$ is introduced in order to "tune the influence of the data point density on the infinitesimal transition of the diffusion". Setting $\alpha = 1$ approximates the Neumann heat kernel (see [1] for full derivation). Setting $\alpha = 0$ recovers the Laplacian eigenmaps method. 1. Diffusion Maps (2006) - the original paper to propose the method. 2. Diffusion Maps, Spectral Clustering and Eigenfunctions of Fokker-Planck Operators
