jQuery easing functions without using a plugin

I'm looking for an online list of custom easing functions that I can use with jQuery. I'm not interested in using a plugin for this, nor am I using jQuery UI. I found one below that does a nice little bounce but I'm looking for a few others just so I can have some options. In lieu of of other functions, a brief explanation of how this one operates and might be modified would be awesome. Thank-you! Example: $.easing.custom = function (x, t, b, c, d) { var s = 1.70158; if ((t/=d/2) EDIT #1: Here's an online demo of all jQuery UI easing functions. Source functions from UI are posted below in correct answer by Jake. http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/ EDIT #2: It turns out that the example easing function I posted above is exactly the same as the "easeInOutBack" from jQuery UI. EDIT #3: Here are some more stand-alone easing equations free for downloading... http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/
