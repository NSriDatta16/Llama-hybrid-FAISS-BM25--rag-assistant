Here is one approach I came up with, but if there's a more elegant/accurate approach please let me know. Re-sample the 2D histogram to very small bins of wave height and period, and normalize so the sum of the resampled probability is 1. Smaller bins make the summation below more accurate. Loop through different probability values. For each probability value, plot the contour of that probability and identify enclosed bins of wave height and period (I am doing this in Matlab and used the approach in this answer). Sum the probability in the enclosed bins and store the value. After the loop is finished, interpolate to find the contour that would enclose 10%. If x=[summed probability from step 3] and y=[contoured probability value from step 2], interpolate on xi=[desired summed probability], here 10%, to find yi=[contour enclosing desired summed probability]. Delete all prior tested contours from the plot, then plot the final contour of yi which encloses the height/period combinations that happen 10% of the time.
