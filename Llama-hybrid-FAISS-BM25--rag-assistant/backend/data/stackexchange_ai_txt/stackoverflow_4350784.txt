Finding a substring token in a string in C++

OK suppose I'm parsing some XML (the problem exists while reading any "language" but XML is one many people are familar with). The XML looks like the following: Now I want to find the various tokens in that stream. The important tokens are as follows (Please excuse my crappy "token" names ;)). = Close CDATA Token = Close Open Token = Close Token The problem I have is that I have an array of the above and I am trying to correctly identify one of the above Token's as I read in the file character by character. So I read the first character, ' Equally when finishing a tag, e.g "/>". I read the first character and I get '/'. This matches the "Close Open Token". But its not complete so I should check for the next character, which in this case is '>' giving me "/>" which does match the Close Token. My issue is that when the numbers of these tokens increases significantly it becomes quite hard to track what the possible matches are. Is there an elegant way to do this? Or should I, simply when I meet the first character of one of the "token strings" push that token on to a vector and then ONLY check those tokens on subsequent reads? If the next character does not match then I can clear the list of tokens and then start over. Is this the correct way to approach the problem? Is there a better way? (Edit: Please don't point me towards Lexx, YACC etc ... I'm trying to learn some fundamentals here) Any help would be much appreciated :)
