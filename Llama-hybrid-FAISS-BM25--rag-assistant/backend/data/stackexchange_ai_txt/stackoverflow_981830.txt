Is it useful in C# to apply DeMorgan's theorem to manually optimize boolean expressions in conditional statements (e.g. if conditions)

Back in the day when I did most of my work in C and C++, as a matter of course, I would manually apply deMorgan's theorem to optimize any non-trivial boolean expressions. Is it useful to do this in C# or does the optimizer render this unnecessary?
