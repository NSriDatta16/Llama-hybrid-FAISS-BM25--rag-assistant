Understanding the example in ?prcomp (R)

I'm trying to understand, in simple terms, the following example copied from prcomp in R: C cov(Z) ~= C'C = S all.equal(cov(Z), S, tol = 0.08) pZ I gather from the included comment that the toeplitz matrix S is suitable as covariance matrix, and C is its root. The second line proves this. What I don't understand is why multiplying a matrix of random numbers X by C gives a "data set" that is (somehow more) desirable as a demonstration of prcomp . Why not simply use X to demonstrate prcomp ? Logically, it seems to me that Z must have some special "structure" that guarantees something about the PCA results. However, my matrix algebra is limited, and I don't understand what's going on here. Can someone explain in conceptual terms why in the example it is desirable to create Z ?
