What is the type A uncertainty from a DerSimonian Laird estimator?

When averaging independent results, the type A uncertainty can be estimated as the standard error of the mean, $$\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$ where $\sigma$ and $n$ are the standard deviation and the number of values being averaged. If each value corresponds to a mean and has its own variance, then a better estimate would be the DerSimonian Laird estimator, which I understand calculates a weighted mean of the means and provides a standard error. In that case, the type A uncertainty would also be the standard error divided by $\sqrt{n}$ ? Example: I have the following means and the sampling variances (code in R) means The mean of means and standard error would be mean(means); sd(means)/sqrt(length(means)) # > [1] 1003.027 # > [1] 0.5212864 while the DerSimonian estimator would be metafor::rma(yi = means, vi = samVar, method = 'DL') # > (trimmed) # > 1003.0785 0.5648 The concrete question here is if shall I divide that 0.5648 by $\sqrt{3}$ to get the type A uncertainty estimator.
