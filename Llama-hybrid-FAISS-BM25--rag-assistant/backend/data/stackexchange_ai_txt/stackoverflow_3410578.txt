Android: How to give focus to a background Activity belonging to a different task?

Say that the user has started my App and then switched off to use the Browser (so we have 2 sets of Tasks running). After a while, something happens to my app that requires the user's attention, so it posts a notification to notify the user. Is there a way to bring my App's task (and the Activity on top of the stack) out from the background when user clicks on my notification?
