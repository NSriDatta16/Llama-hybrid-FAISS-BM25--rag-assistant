It depends on your definition of concurrent usage. If you are thinking about serving 100 requests at any moment, and assume one request takes 1 second to finish on average, that is 260 million hits per month. In comparison, Stackoverflow.com has 95 million page views per month. I doubt it's hosted on one PC. It would still be an interesting question, why can't Stackoverflow.com be hosted on one PC? It doesn't seem impossible technically. But economically hosting cost is very tiny compared to the dev cost.
