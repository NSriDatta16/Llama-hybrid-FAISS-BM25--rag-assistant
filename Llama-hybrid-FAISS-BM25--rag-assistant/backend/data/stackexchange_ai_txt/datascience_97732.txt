Feature Importance Or Correlation is dependent on the approach used. It's like the model is saying, " When I used my approach I find the particular feature very important. " When another model uses the same approach or an approach that is a superset of that approach, then it will be able to find that Importance too. Few examples - If RF finds a Feature very important and able to achieve a good score. It means the feature is a good predictor for the scenario but LinearRegression might not able to exploit the predictor Neural Network can exploit that since it can learn any function DecisionTree may struggle to recognize a good feature but easily seen by LinearRegression .
