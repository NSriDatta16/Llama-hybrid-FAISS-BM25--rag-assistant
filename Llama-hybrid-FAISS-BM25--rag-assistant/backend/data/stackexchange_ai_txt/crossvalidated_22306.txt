Simulation can also be used to look at real processes under theoretical conditions, where those processes have nonlinear inputs. For example, a manufacturing firm may be interested in whether adding an extra production line is cost effective, a call centre may be interested in how to route calls around operators to reduce time-in-queue and balking rates for callers, an emergency department may be interested in how best to roster staff and transfer patients, or a shipping port may be interested in the most efficient way to layout its container operations. Discrete event simulation can be used to model these processes, and one can adjust the parameters to answer "what if" type questions. These types of simulation are important because in real life situations one often cannot implement the proposed change and then see what happens because of costs, time, complexity, etc. Another area of interest in simulation is complex systems. Particularly in social science, agent-based simulation is an interesting type of simulation that is starting to gather more proponents. In agent-based simulation, the agents (e.g. individual people) are given attributes such as personalities and interact with each other, so it models a chaotic system. Agent-based simulation looks at the effect of surrounding agents on each other, and effect-at-a-distance can be included. While I have not done any agent-based simulations myself, I have seen it used to model systems such as the geographical spread of population size in a prehistoric community over time.
