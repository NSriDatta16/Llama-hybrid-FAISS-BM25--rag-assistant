Regression with summary statistics

The following setting should already be familiar: Let $X$ be some space, $\mathbb R^d$ for simplicity, and let $Y\subseteq \mathbb R $ . An unknown distribution $\mu $ is defined over $X\times Y$ and some loss function $\mathcal l: Y\times Y\to\mathbb R$ are also given. We want to find a function $f$ from a family of function $\mathfrak F$ which minimizes the generalized error on $ \mu$ : $f^*=argmin_{f\in\mathfrak F} \mathbb E_{(x,y)\sim \mu}\mathcal l(f(x),y)$ Should we have a sample $S=\{(x_i,y_i ):1\le i \le n )\}$ , one approach could be to choose the one that minimizes the empirical error, i.e.: $\hat f=argmin_{f\in\mathfrak F} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathcal l(f(x_i),y_i)$ My question is as follows: Should we choose this approach, how one can learn $f$ if the sample is given in the form of summary statistics: $S=\{(Z_i,m_i,\bar y_i):1\le i \le n\}$ , where $Z_i$ denotes some region in $X $ , $m_i$ denotes the # of points sampled in that region & $\bar y_i $ denote the average of these points (not of the entire region). Think of it as putting a grid on $X$ , where each d-dimensional square is some $Z_i$ . Is there anything in the literature discussing this kind of setting? Thanks.
