R squared formula for Generalized Linear Models with GAMMA distribution

I am running a generalized linear model with Gamma distribution in R (glm, family=gamma) for my data (gene expression as response variable and few predictors). I want to calculate r-squared for this model. I have been reading about it online and found there are multiple formulas for calculating $R^2$ (psuedo) for glm (in R) with Gaussian (r2 from linear model), logistic regression (1-deviance/null deviance), Poisson distribution (using pR2 in the pscl package, D-squared value from the modEvA R package). But I could not find anything specific to Gamma distributions. Can pscl and modEVA packages be used for the Gamma distribution as well, or is there any other formula for doing the same?
