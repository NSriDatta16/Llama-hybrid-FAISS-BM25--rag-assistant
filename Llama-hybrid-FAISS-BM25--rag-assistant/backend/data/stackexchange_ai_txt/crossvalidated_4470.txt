In SPSS you can have the GUI write the syntax for you via the paste button. If you go through the regression command in the window there is an option to include weights. Here is some sample code it just had the program output for me: REGRESSION /MISSING LISTWISE /REGWGT=VAR3 /STATISTICS COEFF OUTS R ANOVA /CRITERIA=PIN(.05) POUT(.10) /NOORIGIN /DEPENDENT VAR1 /METHOD=ENTER VAR2. As with any program, I would suggest you check the documentation on how SPSS implements weights in OLS (I personally have no idea). A comment by Wolfgang below points out that R and SPSS implement weights in the same manner (although I would still suggest checking out the documentation of how they implement weights.)
