A positive definite symmetric matrix $A$ can be written as: $$A=\sum_{k=1}^n\lambda_k e_ke^T_k,$$ where $Ae_k=\lambda_ke_k$ and $e_k$ are the normalized eigenvectors of $A$. This is completely equivalent to the eigendecomposition form: $A=U\Sigma U^T$, where $U$ is the unitary matrix whose columns are $e_j$. In particular, $A$ can also be thought of as a function function from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$: $$[A]_{ij}:=A(i,j)=\sum_{k=1}^n\lambda_ke_{ki}e_{kj}=\phi^T(i)\phi(j),$$ where $e_{kj}:=[e_k]_j$, i.e. the j'th component of eigenvector $e_k$, and $\phi^T(i):=(\sqrt{\lambda_1}e_{1i},\sqrt{\lambda_2}e_{2i},\cdots,\sqrt{\lambda_n}e_{ni})$. Finally, when we act $A$ on a vector $x$, we write $$[Ax]_{i}=(Ax)(i):=\sum_{k=1}^nA(i,k)x_k.$$ A positive definite, symmetric kernel $\kappa(s,s')$ is a function from $\mathcal{X}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$. You can think of it as an infinite matrix where indices are continuous instead of just discrete. Thus kernels act on vectors which are now functions. Thus instead of a vector $x=x(i)$ with components $x_i$ ($i=1,2,\cdots,n$), we write $x(s)$, where $s$ is continuous, and therefore $x$ is a function of $s$. There are technical restrictions on what kind of function $x$ can be, which you can learn about if you lookup $L^2$ spaces, specifically: $\int_{-\infty}^\infty |x(s)|^2ds A natural definition for defining the action of $\kappa$ on $x$ is through an integral over the continuum of indices, as opposed to the usual discrete sum for matrices: $$\kappa x=(\kappa x)(s):=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \kappa(s,s')x(s')ds'.$$ Also just like in the discrete case, $\kappa$ has eigen functions $e_j=e_j(s)$: $$(\kappa e_j)(s)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \kappa(s,s')e(s')ds'=\lambda_j e_j(s).$$ The fact that there are infinitely many eigenfunctions for $\kappa$ comes from the fact that the space of functions on which $\kappa$ acts on is infinite dimensional. Again, a very low brown way of seeing this is to realize that $x=x(s)$ can be thought of as a vector with a continuum of indices. Through the abstract nonsense of Hilbert Schmidt operator theory, one can show (somewhat nontrivially) that if $\kappa$ is analogous to a positive definite matrix, then it possesses a discrete , possibly infinite set of eigenvectors and non-negative eigenvalues, which allows us to write the analog: $$\kappa(s,s')=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \lambda_j e_j(s)e_j(s')=\phi(s)^T\phi(s'),$$ where $\phi^T(s):=(\sqrt{\lambda_1}e_1(s),\sqrt{\lambda_2}e_2(s),\cdots)$. Notice the dots signify this could potentially be an infinitely long vector.
