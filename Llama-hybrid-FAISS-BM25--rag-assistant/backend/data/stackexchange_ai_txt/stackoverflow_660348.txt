Best way to cache persistent data (e.g. code books) in Spring?

I have a series of code books in my database, and I am using plain JDBC calls to fetch them and store them in a collection. I would like to put these in some kind of a cache at application startup time in order to save time later. I don't need any fancy stuff like automatic object invalidation, TTL etc - the code books change rarely, so I'll trigger the update myself and just reload the whole cache when the need arises. The project where I need this uses Spring, and this is my first project using it. Is there a standard/elegant way to do this in Spring? Thanks.
