From WinRunner times I very extensively used Test Driver scripts with great success due to the following benefits: non-programming testers can easily create/maintain batches as their stored in XML format test input files are externally configurable through mapping a variety of customization parameters supported, from login credentials to prefixes and switches test dependencies could be established so that if critical test cases is failed the whole branch of dependant test cases is skipped. Now I continue using Test Drivers and introducing them to clients. And Test Driver approach was integrated not only by the client companies that do not use Quality Center. Some others followed it because it gives much more flexibility and robustness in automated test plan execution. Thank you, Albert Gareev http://automationbeyond.wordpress.com
