Start with one of the contests on Kaggle. You don't have to win, but it will give you some data to work with and some room to experiment. @ACD is right that having a problem that needs solving involving data will give you context for the math. As for the math itself, start with linear regression. Virtually regardless of the problem you're looking at, you can apply linear regression. It may be a wholly unsuitable approach, but you can do it and see the results and learn better ways as you go. You will have to keep referring back to the math as you are implementing the regression so you'll pick that up as you go along. As long as you know how to multiply matrices, you should be ok to start. There are other nuances like knowing what full-rank means, but that's one of those things you'll learn when you get an error message about aliasing. And as for learning materials, I would recommend Andrew Ng's machine learning course on iTunesU. The problem with textbooks is that you'll spend all your time reading and not enough time actually doing. Once you get your feet wet, then textbooks are a good reference for learning new methods and getting more depth on methods you have learned.
