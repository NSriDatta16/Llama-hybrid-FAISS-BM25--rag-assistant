From the point of sampling theory, I agree getting tested represents a self-selection issue. Hence, statistics derived therefrom can describe the parent population but usually without explicit statistical means to assert margins of error. However, all is not lost, as there are advanced paths to use the data together with associated covariants to create a random sample subset. This is based on an exchangeability principle and basically one employs models (like a logit classification scheme) to assign self-selection volunteers to a class that is in accord (via covariants) with classification to the general population. Here is a work Sampling bias and logistic models that may outline the principles. The paper can also be found in J. R. Statist. Soc. B (2008), 70, Part 4, pp. 643â€“677. Also, a related work Propensity score adjustment using machine learning classification algorithms to control selection bias in online surveys .
