Multiple under-sampling for imbalanced data

Consider a binary outcome data set with severe class imbalance, modeled with logistic regression. To solve the issue - one of the strategies is to play around with sampling. It occurred to me that when randomly under-sampling data, we at the same time increase the variance, since we discard whole lot of the data. Is it a reasonable strategy to run same model multiple times by doing random under-sampling (keep drawing independent samples from "large" class) to build some sort of distribution for the variable coefficients? It might as well be that I'm simply not aware of the name for this strategy, so a good pointer at relevant paper would be much appreciated.
