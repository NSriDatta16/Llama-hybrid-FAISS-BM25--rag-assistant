It depends. In the worst case scenario, when all the values for a feature are missing, XGBoost will simply ignore the feature as it will be completely uninformative. I do not see much harm in keeping the features in. If you want, you can evaluate in cross-validation whether removing features with N% missing values improves the generalization of the model or not, treating N as just another hyperparameter to tune.
