Automatable : no manual intervention should be required to run the tests ( CI ). Complete : they must cover as much code they can ( Code Coverage ). Reusable : no need to create tests that will only be executed once. Independent : Independent execution of a test should not affect the performance of another. Professional : tests should be considered with the same value as the code, the same professionalism, documentation, etc.
