Minimal number of phone connections to ensure a sufficient number of direct lines

A set of telephone connections should be installed in order to connect the cities $A$ and $B$. City $A$ has $2000$ phones. Assuming that each user in city $A$ needs a telephone connection to city $B$ for $2$ minutes on average during the $10$ working hours and that these calls are completely random, what is the minimal number $M$ of telephone connections to city $B$ in order to ensure, that not more than $1$% of the calls from city $A$ to city $B$ do not get a direct line? I am supposed to assume a Gaussian distribution. All I found is, that the mean of the Gaussian should be $2000\times\frac{2}{60}=6.6667$ connections, based on the given time intervals. - $6\frac{2}{3}$ people are expected to have a call at any given moment in the specified time interval. How do I proceed from here? - How do I obtain a variance in order to get the 99% confidence interval, necessary to solve the problem. Furthermore, how do I deal with the, in reality, impossible situations where I have less than 0 or more than 2000 calls at any given moment? Do I just renormalize the clamped section so the integral over it gives 1 or do I ignore those technically impossible cases, or how to deal with them?
