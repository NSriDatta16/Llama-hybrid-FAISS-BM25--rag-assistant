Machine learning analysis for data set

I have a data set that contains houses, different features, and its prices. I'm trying to do an advanced analysis for this data set, I already did house price prediction analysis using different regression techniques like ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net regression. Furthermore, I would like to do machine learning analysis with the data set. what kind of prediction can I do with the above data set? Someone has any ideas please tell me??
