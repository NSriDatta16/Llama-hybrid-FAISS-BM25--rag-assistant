Logistic regression models the log odds of a "1" or "success" response as a linear function of the regression coefficients (i.e. the parameters), but there's no need to insist that the log odds be a linear function of predictors. [This model is linear in parameters & the predictor: $$\operatorname{logit}\pi_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$$ This one is linear in only the parameters: $$\operatorname{logit}\pi_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2$$ ] Just as with ordinary least-squares regression, polynomial predictor terms can be used if required by theory or simply to allow for curvature in empirical models.
