I'm pretty sure I found the answer. and it was on this web page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb728190(v=BTS.20).aspx And in the second paragraph it says: However, if you use AS2EdiReceive, you cannot route the MDN into the MessageBox by setting the "Process inbound MDN into MessageBox for routing/delivery options" property (for the party as AS2 message receiver). Trying to do so will result in an EDI error because the MSN will be passed to the EDI Decoder, which cannot process an MDN. If the MDN is not sent to the MessageBox, the AS2Decoder will consume the MDN, so it will not be passed to the EDI Decoder. I'm monitoring it now, but it seems to have done the job.
