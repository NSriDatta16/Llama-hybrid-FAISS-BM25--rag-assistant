Ruby nicely obviates one issue in the discussion. The standard for a one-liner is: do_something if (a == b) and for a multi-line: if (a == b) do_something do_something_else end This allows concise one-line statements, but it forces you to reorganize the statement if you go from single- to multi-line. This is not (yet) available in Java, nor in many other languages, AFAIK.
