Crash while in CALayer -hitTest:

This issue really has me stumped... I have an iPad project that I use UIPanGestureRecognizer and I am using the following method call within my handlePanGesture: - (AIEnemyUnit *) hitTestForEnemyUnit:(CGPoint)where { CALayer * layer = [self hitTest:where]; while (layer) { if ([layer isKindOfClass:[AIEnemyUnit class]]) { return (AIEnemyUnit *)layer; } else { layer = layer.superlayer; } } return nil; } Once I "find" an AIEnemyUnit layer, I continue with the drag and everything works fine. Except about around the 6th to 10th "drag" I get a crash with the debugger deep within only the CALayer -hitTest: modifying layer that is being finalized - 0x124530 *** -[NSCFSet hitTest:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x124530 *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSCFSet hitTest:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x124530'
