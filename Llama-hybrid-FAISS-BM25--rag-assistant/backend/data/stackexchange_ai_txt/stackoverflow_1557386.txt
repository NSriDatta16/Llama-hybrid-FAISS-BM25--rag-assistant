Prototypal vs Functional OOP in JavaScript

What are the pros and cons of each type/approach in writing Object Oriented scripts? Personally, I have found closures (functional? approach) as a way to encapsulate state more natural and perhaps more elegant. I, however, have heard that this use of closures is slower in JavaScript implementations. I would at least like to know where a prototypal approach would be most appropriate.
