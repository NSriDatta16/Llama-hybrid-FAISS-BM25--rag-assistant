thats not true there is overhead however its neglect able overhead. Even though probably they will end up at same place on stack It still assigns it. It will assign memory location on stack for that int and then free it at the end of }. Not in heap free sense in sense it will move sp (stack pointer) by 1. And in your case considering it only has one local variable it will just simply equate fp(frame pointer) and sp Short answer would be: DONT CARE EITHER WAY WORKS ALMOST THE SAME. But try reading more on how stack is organized. My undergrad school had pretty good lectures on that If you wanna read more check here http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler1/lecture.html
