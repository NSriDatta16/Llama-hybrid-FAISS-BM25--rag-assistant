How can I speed up CURL tasks?

I'm using CURL to fetch some data from user accounts. First it logs in and then redirect to another URL where the data resides. My stats showed that it took an average of 14 seconds to fetch some data spread over 5 pages. I would like to speed things up, my questions are: Is it possible to see how much each step takes? Do you know how could I speed up/enhance CURL? Thanks
