Your likelihoods should be maximized. Assuming you have a list $\left\{ n_i \right\}$ of passengers each day, for the null hypothesis, taking $\lambda_0=1300$ , you calculate $\hat{\cal L_0} = \prod \frac{e^{-{\lambda_0}} \lambda_O^{n_i}}{n_i!}$ . For the alternate hypothesis, ${\cal L_1} = \prod \frac{e^{-{\lambda}} \lambda^{n_i}}{n_i!}$ . Maximizing this leads to the estimator $\hat{\mu}$ equal to the average of the $n_i$ ; you plug the estimator back into the likelihood to obtain $\hat{\cal L_1}$ . Using the logarithm makes things easier.
