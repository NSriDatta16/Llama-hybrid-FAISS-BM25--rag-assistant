Get the decimal part of a number and the number of places after the decimal point (C#)

Does anyone know of an elegant way to get the decimal part of a number only? In particular I am looking to get the exact number of places after the decimal point so that the number can be formatted appropriately. I was wondering if there is away to do this without any kind of string extraction using the culture specific decimal separator.... For example 98.0 would be formatted as 98 98.20 would be formatted as 98.2 98.2765 would be formatted as 98.2765 etc.
