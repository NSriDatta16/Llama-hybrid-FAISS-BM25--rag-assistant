The registry is just a normal table in a Lua state, therefore two unrelated Lua states can't access the same registry. As Kknd says, you'll have to provide your own mechanism. A common trick is creating an extra state that doesn't execute any code, it's used only as a storage. In your case, you'd use that extra state's registry from your C code. unfortunately, there's no available method to copy arbitrary values between two states, so you'll have to unroll any tables. copying functions is especially hard, if you're using the registry for that, you might want to keep track of which state you used to store it, and execute it on the original state, effectively turning it into a cross-state call, instead of moving the function.
