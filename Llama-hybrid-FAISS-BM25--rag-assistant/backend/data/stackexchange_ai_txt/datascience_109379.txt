How to improve the accuracy of support vector machine algorithms in machine learning?

I am working with a machine learning project named "Diabetes prediction using support vector machine". In this project I have used Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Using SVM I have got 78% training and 77% test accuracy. I want to improve the accuracy. Here is the followed code. How can I improve accuracy? Can anyone help me?
