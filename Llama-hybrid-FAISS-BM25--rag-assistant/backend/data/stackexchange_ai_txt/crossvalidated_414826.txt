logistic regression log odds to probability issue in R

I have the following issue in R. I perform logistic regression in R: logitMod Then, I run predict on the first record of the testdata set, to get the log odds: >predict(logitMod, testdata[1]) -44.81362 Then I calculate the probability from the log odds: > 1/(1+ exp(-predict(logitMod, testdata[1]))) 3.449006e-20 Then, I check with the predict function what the built-in probability-conversion would yield, and the result is very different: >predict(logitMod, testdata[1], type="response") 2.220446e-16 So my question is, what am I overlooking?
