Checking autocorrelation in non-parametric methods

I would like to forecast short-term electric load by using Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Regression. However, there's one question that sticks in my mind. In such forecasting with non-parametric methods, can one check the autocorrelation of the errors, which is actual values subtracted from predicted values? I have checked papers about load forecasting in the literature, but I have run into one and only paper by "Espinoza et al" that checks the autocorrelation of the NARX errors. ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/ida/reports/06-84.pdf Other papers do not check the distribution of the errors. I believe it's the correct move because you are already using non-parametric methods. I am, nevertheless, curious about your thoughts on this matter.
