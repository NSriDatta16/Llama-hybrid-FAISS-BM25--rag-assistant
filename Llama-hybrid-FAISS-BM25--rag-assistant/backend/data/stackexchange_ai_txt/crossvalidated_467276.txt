In section 2.1 of Sutton and Bardo's Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction , they say: [...] the k-armed bandit problem, so named by analogy to a slot machine, or “one-armed bandit,” except that it has k levers instead of one. Each action selection is like a play of one of the slot machine’s levers, and the rewards are the payout for hitting the jackpot.
