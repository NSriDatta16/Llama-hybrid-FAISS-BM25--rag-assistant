Part V of Bayesian Data Analysis is on non-linear and non-parametric methods, which as I recall has chapters on each of basis function methods, Gaussian processes, and Dirichlet processes. (Don't have my copy handy.) Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning is comprehensive, covering both theory and implementation, and is freely available online. If you're interested in resources outside of full books, the tutorials by Chris Fonnesbeck on Dirichlet and Gaussian processes were very valuable to me. (Sections 5.1 and 5.2 in the "Notebooks" folder.) Last, the Machine Learning Summer School 2009 lectures include two talks on non-parametric Bayesian methods. I haven't seen those two yet, but every other lecture I've watched in the series gave a top-notch introduction to its topic.
