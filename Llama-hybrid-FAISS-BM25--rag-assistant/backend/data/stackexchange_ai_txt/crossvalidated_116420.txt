It is very likely that the author used a Gaussian process to produce the interpolation. I think that is true because an exercise in the book describes a very similar problem to this one and requires a plot based on a Gaussian process. I tried it and I think the resulting plot shares features with the posterior median surface of the original question. This is the median of the posterior distribution of $w(s)$ as above (it is slightly different because I ran another MCMC simulation): And this is the interpolation based on a Gaussian process: As you can see, the method of interpolation makes a huge difference.
