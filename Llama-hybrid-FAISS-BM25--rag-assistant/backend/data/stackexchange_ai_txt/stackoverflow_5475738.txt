Over-engineering is an antipattern. If you don't need abstraction, don't use it. Abstraction and patterns are the most useful when your project is large or is supposed to grow. If it that isn't your situation, then Keep It Simple and Stupid. It's also a matter of taste. Personally, even if it is sometimes discouraged, I prefer using patterns and abstraction even in simple situations if I feel that it might be useful in the future, because I hate rewriting the same lines of code twice. In addition, design patterns also help you to avoid errors because they put order into your code and class relations.
