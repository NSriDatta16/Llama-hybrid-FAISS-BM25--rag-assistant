Why django has to use double underscore when making filter queries?

So in django we write Entry.objects.filter(blog__id=3) Which looks ugly because sometimes there are too many underscores Entry.objects.filter(blog_something_ underscore _too_ many _id=3) why django can't use syntax like [entry.objects if blog.id=3 ] ? I am not expert on this, but why must double underscore? Could there be a more elegant style in python's grammar to write this?
