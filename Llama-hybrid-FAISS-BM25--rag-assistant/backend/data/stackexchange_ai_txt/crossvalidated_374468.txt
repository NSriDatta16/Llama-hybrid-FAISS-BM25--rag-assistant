how to calculate loglikelihood for VAE/VQVAE

I asked this question on /r/MLQuestions aswell. Although similar questions have been asked a few times here on reddit and elsewhere, I'm still unclear on how one would calculate the log-likelihood of, say, the CIFAR10 test set, under VAE/VQVAE models, as presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937 and related papers. A "black-box" method using tensorflow's tf.distributions (although for binarized MINST) can be found here https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/vae.py and here https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/vq_vae.py , but I would love to understand how this value is calculated "manually". Would anyone care to elaborate on exactly how to estimate this reported value for CIFAR10? I mention this dataset specifically since it's used as benchmark in many recent papers, and since CIFAR10 isn't binary like binarized MNIST. I'm very thankful for any help! :) PS: I am aware of a previous explanation on how to convert the log-likelihood value to bits/dim here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/56m5o2/discussion_calculation_of_bitsdims/ but following this method requires that some loglikelihood (5371 in this case) has already been calculated (in the NICE code, this is done for the particular case)
