Not all tests of variance homogeneity across groups are equal: the Brown–Forsythe test would probably be better than Levene's test given your dependent variable's distribution. It sounds like your outcome is a zero-inflated count variable. I'm thinking the ideal choice is a zero-inflated negative binomial or quasi-Poisson regression with the experimental group as your reference group for dummy coding purposes (i.e., three dummy variables for your control groups), but there may be more robust options for coping with heteroskedasticity. When all assumptions are true, ANOVA works, but generalized linear models and nonparametric estimators are better for non-normal error distributions. Weighted least squares can help with heteroskedastic groups, but requires a lot of data. Diagonally weighted least squares is somewhat more forgiving. Zero-inflated models also require more power though – see the following references. The second discusses iteratively weighted least squares and compares negative binomial and quasi-Poisson regression. References · Williamson, J. M., Lin, H., Lyles, R. H., & Hightower, A. W. (2007).
