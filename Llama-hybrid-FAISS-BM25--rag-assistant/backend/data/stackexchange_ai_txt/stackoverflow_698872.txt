I would add that you also need to instantiate an instance of the Microsoft.WindowsCE.Forms.InputPanel class for your project (in addtion to adding a reference to the namespace as noted by TreeUK ). The easiest way to do this is to drag an InputPanel control onto your Windows Form in Design mode. Whatever you name your InputPanel instance would be what you reference in the event handlers for your form fields.
