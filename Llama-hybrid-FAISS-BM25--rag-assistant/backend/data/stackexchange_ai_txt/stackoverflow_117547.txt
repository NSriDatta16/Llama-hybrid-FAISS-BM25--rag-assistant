Scriptaculous Droppables onDrop callback, How to reference each element?

Documentation can be found here It says in the example: onDrop: Called whenever a Draggable is released over the Droppable and the Droppable is accepts it. The callback gets three parameters: the Draggable element, the Droppable element and the Event. You can extract additional information about the drop – like if the Ctrl or Shift keys were pressed – from the Event object. Then it gives some code Droppables.add('shopping_cart', { accept: 'products', onDrop: function(element) { $('shopping_cart_text').update('Dropped the ' + element.alt + ' on me.'); } }); It uses the ambiguous word 'element' in the code. My question is, does anyone have a good example on how to reference the draggable element and the droppable element in this callback javascript function?
