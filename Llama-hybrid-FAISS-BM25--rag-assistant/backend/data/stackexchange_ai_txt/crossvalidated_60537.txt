Neural network training - Features/variables have missing value

I have a binary outcome and my features are mostly continuous. However most of the features have missing data and are coded as missing. Missings are coded as 9999, 999999 etc. How do i scale my features if i have something like this ? When the model gets implemented and in real time we will have missing values. So i am advised to keep the missing's and build the model.
