Hibernate has a neat little feature that is heavily under-documented and unknown. You can execute an SQL script during the SessionFactory creation right after the database schema generation to import data in a fresh database. You just need to add a file named import.sql in your classpath root and set either create or create-drop as your hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto property. http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/RotterdamJBugAndHibernatesImportsql
