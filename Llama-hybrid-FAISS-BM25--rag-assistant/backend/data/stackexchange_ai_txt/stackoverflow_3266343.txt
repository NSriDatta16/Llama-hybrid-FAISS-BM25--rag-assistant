C++: Platform dependent types - best pattern

I'm looking for a pattern to organize header files for multiple platforms in C++. I have a wrapper .h file that should compile under both Linux and Win32. Is this the best I can do? // defs.h #if defined(WIN32) #include #elif defined(LINUX) #include #else #error "Unable to determine OS or current OS is not supported!" #endif // Common stuff below here... I really don't like preprocessor stuff in C++. Is there a clean (and sane) way to do this better?
