Hopefully you've found an answer to this elsewhere, although based on how difficult it is to find information about this online, it's probably unlikely ... An MSDN blog linked over to ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Modifying One-to-Many and Many-to-Many Relationships (there's a link to the previous in the series in the first paragraph). But Editing a variable length list, ASP.NET MVC 2-style seems a little better (and includes sample code).
