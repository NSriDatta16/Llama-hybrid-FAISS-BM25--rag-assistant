@Sean I did what you said and it works. But I have another concern, every time I extract the subset using this code if (_Ds.HasChanges()) { DataSet DsChanges = _Ds.GetChanges(DataRowState.Modified); } when I checked the data in my new dataset DsChanges the data that is extracted was still the original data upon loading of form? It should be the changes that I made in _Ds. I ended up using stored procedure and it was not the elegant way of solving my problem.
