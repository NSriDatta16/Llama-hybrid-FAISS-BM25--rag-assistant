If you want Google to allow legal access to driving directions via HTTP you might consider voting for the enhancement request: Issue 235 . Theoretically, the more people that vote for an enhancement request, the more attention Google give to it. However, I strongly suspect that there might be contractual issues with the organisations that supply the data. Organisations like TeleAtlas impose restrictions about how Google can use their data. TeleAtlas probably don't want Google to make it legal for people to use their data to create apps for free that directly compete with their own commercial apps and devices.
