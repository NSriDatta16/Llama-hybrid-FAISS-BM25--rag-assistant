using jquery to slide down to a hash position

My homepage has a series of links. When those links are clicked, I want the user to be brought to a certain area of the clicked page. Typically I would use the following HTML on the homepage: LINK Where #link1 is the div I want to scroll to. This time, I want to use jquery to give it a nice elegant scroll from the top of the page, versus loading directly at that div. So when the anchor is clicked on the homepage, the products page appears and scrolls down to the hashed div. Any help would be appreciated.
