How to have unlimited tab stops in a NSTextView with disabled text wrap

There are several places on the net ( including stackoverflow ) pointing out how to disable text wrapping on a NSTextView object. The method works but there is a problem with the tab stops. It seems that the default is 12 tab stops, using more than 12 will start wrapping. The obvious solution would be to change the default NSParagraphStyle so that it has more tab stops, but I dont think this is the proper way to do it. Ideally I would like to have "infinity" amount of tab stops, as for example xcode has. Is there any straight forward way to achieve this?
