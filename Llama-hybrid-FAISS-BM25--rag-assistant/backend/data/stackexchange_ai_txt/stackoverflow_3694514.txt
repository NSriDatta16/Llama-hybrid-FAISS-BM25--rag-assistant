I'm not sure what the cause of this is, but I can assure you it's not WTForms. We don't do anything funky with the classes, so if Django isn't invoking action properly, it's something in Django. Have you tried renaming the function, to see if it's a weird issue with the name "action"? Alternately, you could try turning action into a property using the @property decorator, or simply define the action as a string on the class. With that said, I would suggest not embedding URLs into the form on the python side. This is better solved by using URL reversing with the {% url %} templatetag.
