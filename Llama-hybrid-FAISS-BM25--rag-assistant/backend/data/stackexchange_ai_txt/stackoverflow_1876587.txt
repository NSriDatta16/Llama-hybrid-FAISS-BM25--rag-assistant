Optimal way to access a value from the last iteration in a loop

What's the best and fastest way to access a value from the previous iteration in a for loop, assuming that the object will be very large (example, a cursor object which has 100,000+ records) Using a simple example: tmp = [ ['xyz', 335], ['zzz', 338], ['yyy', 339], ['yyy', 442], ['abc', 443], ['efg', 444], ['ttt', 446], ['fff', 447] ] for x in tmp: if not prev: prev = x[1] print 'seq: ', x[1], 'prev seq:', prev, 'variance: ', x[1]-prev prev = x[1] Is this the most optimal way to handle this? Based on the responses below i did some testing: tmp was created with 500 lists, the average of running it 20 times is shown below. results: Mines: 0,623 Dave snippet1: 0,605 Dave snippet2: 0,586 Catchmeifyoutry (edited code): 0,707
