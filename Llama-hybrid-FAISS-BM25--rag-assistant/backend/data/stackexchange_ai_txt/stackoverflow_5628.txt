Is there a way to include a fragment identifier when using Asp.Net MVC ActionLink, RedirectToAction, etc.?

I want some links to include a fragment identifier. Like some of the URLs on this site: Debugging: IE6 + SSL + AJAX + post form = 404 error #5626 Is there a way to do this with any of the built-in methods in MVC? Or would I have to roll my own HTML helpers?
