Clustered data in logistic regression analysis

I am doing a logistic regression analysis, for an election setting. My dependent variable is voting for the incumbent candidate (Yes/No) and my independent variable is perceived economy (data from a survey) -- the model is controlling for gender, age etc.. I am working with data from two specific elections, which doesn't allow for a multilevel regression analysis. I have to now have to choose between a dummy variable for the elections (fixed effects) or clustered standard errors to account for the clustering at the two elections. I am a little confused now about setting up a dummy variable for the elections. What would you recommend and how would you go about doing that ?
