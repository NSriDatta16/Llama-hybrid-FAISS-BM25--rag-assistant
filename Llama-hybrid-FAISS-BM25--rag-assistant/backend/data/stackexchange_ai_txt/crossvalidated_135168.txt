First, there's no guarantee that a linear probability model will approximate a logit model very well; consequently the subset of variables selected for one may be less appropriate for the other. Second, the re-fitting applies no shrinkage at all, despite the variable selection that's taken place in the first step; risking serious mis-calibration & perhaps a little loss of discrimination. You may be able to validate the procedure on a particular data-set, but it doesn't seem safe in general, or to offer any advantage over a stepwise logistic regression. And of course it's unnecessary; LASSO's $L_1$-norm penalty can be used for shrinkage & selection in logistic regression.
