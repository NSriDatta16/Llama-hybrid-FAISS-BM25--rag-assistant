Is a linear regression possible here?

I would like to do a linear regression between my response "weed coverage [%]" and my predictor "soil moisture content[%]". Since the response was not normally distributed and had issues with heteroskedecity, I have decided to transform my response by applying the log. Now, I got diagnostic plots and normality-test results as seen below. My question: Can I do a simple linear regression now? Thanks for your help! EDIT: I forgot to mention that my observations were measured on different lakes and on different dates, e.g I measured soil moisture content at Lake A, Lake B and Lake C on Date A and later on Date B and so on. That means they are dependend.. What do I need to do now? ----------------------------------------------- Test Statistic pvalue ----------------------------------------------- Shapiro-Wilk 0.9917 0.0057 Kolmogorov-Smirnov 0.0425 0.3116 Cramer-von Mises 31.7515 0.0000 Anderson-Darling 0.9348 0.0177 -----------------------------------------------
