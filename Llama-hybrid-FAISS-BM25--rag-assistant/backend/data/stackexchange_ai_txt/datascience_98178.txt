What to do when the target variable does not correlate with any of the independent variable in a dataset?

I am quite new to data science. I am trying to use Logistic Regression to predict my target (either 1 or 0). But the problem is when I use a heatmap to find the correlation between the columns and the target variable, the highest value I get is around 0.17 (out of 1). So it appears to me that my target variable doesn't correlate with any of the columns in the dataset. My question is, is it normal to have a such target variable? And what can I do to increase correlation between the target variable and other columns?
