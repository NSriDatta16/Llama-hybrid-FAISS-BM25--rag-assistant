Actually you don't set the alignment of drawing directly. You place it in paragraph for example and set its property alignment. this is the code I'm using: public void AddImageParagraph(Drawing element, JustificationValues alignment = JustificationValues.Left) { Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(); ParagraphProperties paragraphProperties = new ParagraphProperties(); Justification justification = new Justification() { Val = alignment }; paragraphProperties.Append(justification); Run run = new Run(element); paragraph.Append(run); paragraph.Append(paragraphProperties); mBody.Append(paragraph); }
