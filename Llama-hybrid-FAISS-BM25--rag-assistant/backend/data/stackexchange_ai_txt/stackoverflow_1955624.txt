Look at Scapy . It allows you to fuzz at the network and transport layers. The fuzz function will fuzz anything you didn't explicitly specify in the IP or TCP layers (you can apply it separately to each). This gives you a range of abilities from just randomly generating ip addresses and port pairs to making and sending nonsense packets. You may also want to look at Fragroute . This will twist TCP/IP into using all sorts of evasions techniques, but could potentially unveil otherwise hidden bugs/vulnerabilities in your network stack. Furthermore, if your organization doesn't object, you could set up a Tor exit node and capture traffic from it. I've found it useful for testing correct TCP connection state tracking. Though your end of the connections is well-known and unchanging, there's a huge variety of servers as well as fun network congestion issues. It's basically an endless source of traffic. Be sure to check with your higher ups as your org may object to being a potential source of malicious traffic (even though there is a strong precedent of non-liability). I've gotten around that issue by running it/capturing at home, then bringing in the pcaps.
