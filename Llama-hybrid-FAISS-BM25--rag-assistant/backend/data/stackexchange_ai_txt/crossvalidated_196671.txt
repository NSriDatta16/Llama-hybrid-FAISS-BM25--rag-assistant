Parameter optimization in one-class SVM of LibSVM

I am new to machine learning and SVMs. I have a general question regarding the optimization of parameters in one-class SVM in libsvm in R. I found similar posts but yet not conclusive answer. Can someone tell me, do I need to optimize both c (cost) and nu parameters in one-class SVM? Actually my preliminary results using e1071 package (libsvm implementation in R) show that predictions (at least in terms of number of positive versus negative classifications) are dependent only from nu and not from c.
