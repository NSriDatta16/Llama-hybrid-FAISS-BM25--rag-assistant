Was this the appropriate regression model?

I was recently proof-reading a friend's thesis (for their writing, not stats usage) when I came across a usage of a regression model which I would regard as incorrect. However, I'm pretty new to the game so I wanted to see what other people thought. In short: They used a linear regression model for a percentage. I think they should have used a logistic regression. I'll explain below. They were testing the percentage of flowers which had grown from seedlings and whether there were observable differences depending on which soil mixtures were used i.e. did soil A result in a higher percentage of seeds which flowered compared with soil B. To me, this seems like a binary outcome i.e. yes, it did flower or no, it did not flower. Consequently, a logistic regression model would have been a more appropriate model to use as a percentage is not a quantitative variable in the way that blood pressure is a quantitative variable. Is this incorrect? I would be very interested in knowing, chiefly because it's bugging me. Thanks!
