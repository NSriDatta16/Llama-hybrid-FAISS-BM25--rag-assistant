C++ won't automatically translate to C# (not so you'd want to maintain it, anyway), and you're talking about using different frameworks. That means you're doing a total rewrite of 250K lines of code. This is effectively the same as a new 250K-line project, except that you've got the requirements nicely spec'd out to start with. Well, not "nicely"; there's doubtless some difficult-to-understand code in there, some likely because of important issues that made elegance difficult, and the overall structure will be somewhat obscured. That's a very large project. At the end, what you'll have is code that does the same thing, likely with more bugs, probably fairly badly structured (although you can refactor that over time), with more potential for future development. It won't have any of the new features people have been asking for during the project (unless you like living dangerously). I'm not saying not to do it. I'm saying that you should know what you're proposing, what the cost will be, and what the benefits would be. In most cases, this adds up to "Don't do that!"
