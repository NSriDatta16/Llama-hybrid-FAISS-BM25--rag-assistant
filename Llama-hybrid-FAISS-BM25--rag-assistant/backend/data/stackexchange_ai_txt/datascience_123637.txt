I think you need a deep learning model that can perform both image segmentation and image classification. Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into regions or pixels that share some common characteristics, such as color, intensity, or texture. Image classification is the process of assigning a label or class to each region or pixel, such as the type of matter. One possible deep learning model that can do both tasks is a modified U-Net. A U-Net is a type of convolutional neural network that consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts features from the input image, while the decoder reconstructs the output image with the desired labels. This tutorial focuses on the task of image segmentation, using a modified U-Net .
