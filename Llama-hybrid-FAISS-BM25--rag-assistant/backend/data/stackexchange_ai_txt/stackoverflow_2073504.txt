Neural Network Backpropagation?

Can anyone recommend a website or give me a brief of how backpropagation is implemented in a NN? I understand the basic concept, but I'm unsure of how to go about writing the code. Many of sources I've found simply show equations without giving any explanation of why they're doing it, and the variable names make it difficult to find out. Example: void bpnn_output_error(delta, target, output, nj, err) double *delta, *target, *output, *err; int nj; { int j; double o, t, errsum; errsum = 0.0; for (j = 1; j In that example, can someone explain the purpose of delta[j] = o * (1.0 - o) * (t - o); Thanks.
