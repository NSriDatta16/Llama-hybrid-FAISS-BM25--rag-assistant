Data observed with multiple but unpaired/unmatching observations

I have a dataset with repeated measures, in which for each unit $i$ , we observe multiple observations (for the same variable) $y_{ij}$ and multiple $x_{ik}$ , but we don't know which $y_{ij}$ observations correspond to which $x_{ik}$ observations, (i.e. we don't necessarily have $j=k$ ). In fact, I usually observe 3 $y_{ij}$ and 10 $x_{ik}$ for each $i=1 \ldots N, N \approx 1000$ . Written differently, my data is like $\{ \{y_{1a}, y_{1b}, y_{1c}; x_{1,1}, \ldots x_{1,10}\}, \ldots, \{y_{Na}, y_{Nb}, y_{Nc}; x_{N,1}, \ldots x_{N,10}\}\}$ The goal of the analysis is to run a regression of y on x. My assumption is that the true model is $y_{ij}=\alpha + \beta x_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}$ . I can't run this regression since I don't know the pairing of each j and k. For now I average observations for each unit, and regress $y_{i\cdot}\sim x_{i\cdot}$ . I believe this leads to an unbiased/consistent estimator only if $K\to \infty$ and $J\to \infty$ , which is not my case (for me $J=3$ ). My questions: Is there a more specific name for this kind of unpaired/unmatched data ? More importantly, is there a literature associated to this? Can I do better than averaging my $x_i$ and $y_i$ ? One idea could be to match quantiles (over i) of $y_{ij}$ to those of $x_{ik}$ , or run the regression for a lot of combinations of $y_{ij}$ and $x_{ik}$ ... Or do some clustering?
