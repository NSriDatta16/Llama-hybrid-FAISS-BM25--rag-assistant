Getting Started with Sharpen in Eclipse

I'm a .Net developer and recently I've become part of a project that is doing a port of some java software. I'm trying to get Sharpen up and running to convert. I have downloaded and installed Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (Version: Helios Service Release 1 Build id: 20100917-0705). I've been trying to follow this Guide . Following instructions on how to set up sharpen, I've tried then to grab a copy of the sharpen repo at https://source.db4o.com/db4o/trunk/sharpen/ from within eclipse. Host: source.db4o.com, Repository Path: source.db4o.com/db4o/trunk/sharpen. Using various connection types I get connection refused when using anony username (or using ext I get Cannot run program "ssh":CreateProcess error=2, the system cannot find the file specified"). Alternatively, I am able to use subversion/toritiseSVN to download the repo at the above mentioned url. I then import this into my workspace, but I get various errors such as org.eclipse cannot be resolved. I know what this means, but I am unsure how to go about solving that problem. Finally, the last step is to Export this as "Plug-in Development" -> "Deployable plugins and fragments". However, I don't see this as an export option. Any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks
