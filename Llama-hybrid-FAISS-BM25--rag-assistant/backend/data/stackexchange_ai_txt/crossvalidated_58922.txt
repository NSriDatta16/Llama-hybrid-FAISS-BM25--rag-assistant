A question regarding the central limit theorem

I would appreciate if you could please take a look at the following attempt. I am preparing for an upcoming exam, and this is taken from a past exam paper. I would like to know if it is correct. Thank you for your time. Consider the average $Y$ of $n$ independent random variables, each uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. Find $n$ so that the probability that $Y$ is smaller than $0.51$ is about $0.98$. Make use of the following values of the cumulative distribution function $\Phi$ of the standard normal distribution. $\Phi(0)=0.50000$, $\Phi(0.5)=0.6915$, $\Phi(1)=0.8413$, $\Phi(1.5)=0.9332$, $\Phi(2)=0.9772$. Attempt $Y= \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}}{n}$, where $Y_{i}$, $i=1, 2, ..., n$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. Then $\mu = E[Y_{i}]=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\sigma^{2}=Var(Y_{i})=\frac{1}{12}$. We have $$Z_{n}=\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i} - n\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}=\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i} - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)n}{\sqrt{\frac{n}{12}}}.$$ Then $$\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}}{n}=\dfrac{Z_{n}}{\sqrt{12n}} + \dfrac{1}{2}.$$ Now, by the central limit theorem we have $$P(Y \lt 0.51) = P\left(\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}}{n} \lt 0.51\right)=P\left(\dfrac{Z_{n}}{\sqrt{12n}} + \dfrac{1}{2} \lt 0.51 \right),$$ rearranging, we get $$P\left(Z_{n} \lt \sqrt{12n} \left(0.51 - \frac{1}{2} \right)\right).$$ we want $P(Y \lt 0.51) \approx 0.98$, then $$P\left(Z_{n} \lt \sqrt{12n} \left(0.51 - \frac{1}{2} \right)\right) \approx 0.98 \Rightarrow P\left(Z_{n} \lt \sqrt{12n} \left(0.51 - \frac{1}{2} \right)\right) \approx \Phi(2),$$ hence $$\sqrt{12n} \left(0.51 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \approx 2.$$ Solving, we get $n \approx 3333.33 $, which is not a whole number, therefore we take $n = 3334$.
