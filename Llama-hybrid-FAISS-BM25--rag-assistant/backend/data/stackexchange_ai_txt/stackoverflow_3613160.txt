Groovy is an object-oriented, agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine. It builds upon the strengths of java but has additional power features inspired by languages like python , ruby and smalltalk . It makes modern programming features available to java developers with almost zero learning curve. It can be used as a scripting language for the java Platform.
