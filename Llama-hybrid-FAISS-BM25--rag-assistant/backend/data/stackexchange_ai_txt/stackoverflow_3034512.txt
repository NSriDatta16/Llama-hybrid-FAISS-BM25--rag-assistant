JavaScript ofcourse :) Not only does that let you do the frontend magic, but you can also leverage serverside javascript such as Node.js and/or CouchDB to build yourself a full stack that uses only 1 language. It is certainly true that you should always look to the problem at hand for cues as to what is the best language to tackle it. Nonetheless, for a person in your situation seeking to learn a 'web development language' javascript is pretty much a must-have. If you are dead keen on having a separate backend language: I wouldn't worry too much about Ruby, PHP, Python; Ruby and Python are nice languages, especially Ruby - but they are generally understood to be too slow/expensive. If you want to learn something for the future, go with Haskell, Erlang, Scala, Clojure or even LISP. @LeonixSolutions: There are very few 'modern' websites which do not employ javascript, some may - to varying degree, allow functionality for those that have javascript off. Increasingly though we see that only landing pages are fully functional without JS - mainly as they have none. Regardless, JavaScript is a perfectly fine choice for a server side language. In fact - it has considerable benefits over other serverside languages precisely because of the desire to offer functionality to the JS challenged users. See fx http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/04/09/node-js-yui-3-dom-manipulation-oh-my/ and the example http://github.com/davglass/nodejs-yui3/blob/master/examples/tnt-calendar-serve.js which renders a JS RIA widget serverside and serves plain html + GET requests for interactions.
