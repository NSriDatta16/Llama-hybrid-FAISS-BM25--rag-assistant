This error occurs because the COM object you're calling will reject an external call if it's already handling another operation. There is no asynchronous handling of calls and the behavior can seem random. Depending on the operation you'll see either pythoncom.com_error or pywintypes.com_error. A simple (if inelegant) way to work around this is to wrap your calls into the COM object with try-except and, if you get one of these access errors, retry your call. For some background see the "Error Handling" section of the chapter 12 excerpt from Python Programming on Win32 by Mark Hammond & Andy Robinson (O'Reilly 2000). There's also some useful info specifically about Excel in Siew Kam Onn's blog post "Python programming with Excel, how to overcome COM_error from the makepy generated python file" .
