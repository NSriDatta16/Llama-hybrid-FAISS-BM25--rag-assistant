Conceptually, can a classification model give good results while a similar regression model gives poor results?

I built a really good Random Forest classifier model for predicting whether or not someone will lose weight using several biomarkers as predictors. When I try to build a Random Forest regression model for predicting how much weight someone will lose/gain using the same predictors, it's really really bad. I am using adjusted R2 to asses the regression model and AUROC to asses the classifier model. Is this disconnect conceptually possible or does this mean I must have messed up somewhere?
