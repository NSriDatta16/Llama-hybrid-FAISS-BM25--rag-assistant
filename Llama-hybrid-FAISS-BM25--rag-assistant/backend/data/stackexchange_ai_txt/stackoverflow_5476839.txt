Android NDK: Compiling errors using libpcap for Android - functions "not declared in this scope"

I'm trying to port Jnetpcap (a java wrapper for libpcap with JNI) to Android. I've managed to compile libpcap as a static library using the source code in this repository: https://github.com/android/platform_external_libpcap and I obtained libpcap.a When trying to compile Jnetpcap as a shared library (and linking with libpcap.a) I'm getting errors because some libpcap's functions "weren't declared in this scope". Those functions are: pcap_create(), pcap_activate(), pcap_can_set_rfmon(), pcap_set_buffer_size(), pcap_set_promisc(), pcap_set_snaplen() and pcap_set_timeout(). Those functions exist in the original version of libpcap (the one which the packet libpcap-dev provides) but seems that the android's version doesn't have them. The same source files of Jnetpcap can be compiled for intel x86 and x64 platforms without problems. Am I doing something wrong? Are those functions really missing? I hope any of you guys know how to fix this. Thanks.
