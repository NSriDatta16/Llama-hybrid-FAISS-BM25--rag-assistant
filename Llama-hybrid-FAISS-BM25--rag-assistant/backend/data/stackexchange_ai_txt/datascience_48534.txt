Classify sensor data (multivariate time series) with Python's scikit-learn decision tree

i'm trying to apply scikit learns decision tree on the following dataset with the goal of classifying the data: sensordata: multiple .csv files every .csv file has multiple sensors (see here ) each .csv file has one label (0 or 1) So far I've tried to train my model with Pandas Series. It worked, but the decision tree couldn't differate the features/sensors. Is pandas series the right approach for analyse data like this? Or does anyone have another solution for this problem?
