Basically to mitigate against brute force and dictionary attacks. From The Linux-PAM Application Developer's Guide : Planning for delays extern int pam_fail_delay(pam_handle_t *pamh, unsigned int micro_sec); This function is offered by Linux-PAM to facilitate time delays following a failed call to pam_authenticate() and before control is returned to the application. When using this function the application programmer should check if it is available with, #ifdef PAM_FAIL_DELAY .... #endif /* PAM_FAIL_DELAY */ Generally, an application requests that a user is authenticated by Linux-PAM through a call to pam_authenticate() or pam_chauthtok(). These functions call each of the stacked authentication modules listed in the relevant Linux-PAM configuration file. As directed by this file, one of more of the modules may fail causing the pam_...() call to return an error. It is desirable for there to also be a pause before the application continues. The principal reason for such a delay is security: a delay acts to discourage brute force dictionary attacks primarily, but also helps hinder timed (covert channel) attacks.
