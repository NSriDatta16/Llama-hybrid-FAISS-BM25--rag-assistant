Asymptotic equivalence between cross validation and bayesian information criteria

I heard that Bayesian information criteria and cross validation are asymptotically equivalent when the size of validation set is large enough similar to the relationship between Akaike information criteria and leave one out cross validation. But, I cannot find the paper or references about the connection between Bayesian information criteria and cross validation. So, I would be so thankful if you could give me references.
