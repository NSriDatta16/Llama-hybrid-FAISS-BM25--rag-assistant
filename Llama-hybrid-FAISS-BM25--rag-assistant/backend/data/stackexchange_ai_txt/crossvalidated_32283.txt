You'll also see the function you've described referred to as the log loss in the machine learning literature. It is a loss function, you do not want to maximize it, you want to minimize it. If you have a minimization problem, you can simply negate it to obtain a maximization problem. Since you need non-negative values just add the minimum value of your negated objective. You can find this minimum because your data is finite, i.e. the worst you can do is get everything wrong. edit: An alternative, still assuming your problem is binary prediction, would be to simply maximize $$\sum\mathbf{1}\{y = t\},$$ since you generally don't need a differentiable function for genetic algorithms anyway.
