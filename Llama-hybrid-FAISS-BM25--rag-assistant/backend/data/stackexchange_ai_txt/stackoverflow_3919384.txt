Truly supporting Azure means tackling the cloud storage challenge. As you mention, this means using native Azure storage (table, queue, blob) to persist data. To my knowledge, there isn't any CMS that has truly addressed Azure storage. It's easy for a CMS to claim Azure support by using SQL Azure. This isn't true Azure support though. SQL Azure databases get capped at 50GB...which means they aren't infinitely scalable. Any solution that is using SQL Azure isn't infinitely scalable. -- All this being said, I work for Telerik and we have an ASP.NET based CMS called Sitefinity . Version 4.0 of Sitefinity is coming soon and it runs using Azure & SQL Azure. If your database will never exceed 50GB, then this might work for you. We've discussed creating support for native Azure storage in future versions of Sitefinity. However, I can't give an ETA. -- Ultimately, I agree with others though; if you're happy with Wordpress, then use it.
