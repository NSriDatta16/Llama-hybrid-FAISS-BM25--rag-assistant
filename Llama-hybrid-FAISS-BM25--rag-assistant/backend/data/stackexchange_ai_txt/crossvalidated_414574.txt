Reconciling Langevin MC methods as one-step HMC versus as diffusion or brownian motion

I have a basic understanding of Hamiltonian monte carlo and why it works. I've read that Langevin MC is basically a special case of HMC when you only step the dynamics forward a single timestep before resampling the momentum -- and I see how this results in the "simplified" equations where you don't even need to explicitly write down the momentum -- you can just update by adding random noise to the gradient of the log unnormalized posterior. I've also read about the Langevin process as being some sort of diffusion or brownian motion model. While this makes sense to me on an intuitive level, and I see how one might derive a Langevin update from that physical process, I don't understand how it fits into the framework of MCMC. In particular: I trust HMC because one can prove (ignoring discretization error) the detailed balance criterion. By extension, LMC, framed as a special case of HMC, can also be trusted. However I don't understand how the concept of brownian motion or diffusion can be used to prove that LMC converges to the posterior. To summarize: is the idea of Langevin dynamics as brownian motion / diffusion merely an intuition pump, or can it be mathematically formalized to prove that LMC converges to the posterior? And if so, how?
