Dynamic Time Warping for irregular time series

I have been reading a lot about Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) lately. I am very surprised that there is no literature at all on the application of DTW to irregular time series, or at least I could not find it. Could anybody give me a reference to something related to that issue, or maybe even an implementation of it?
