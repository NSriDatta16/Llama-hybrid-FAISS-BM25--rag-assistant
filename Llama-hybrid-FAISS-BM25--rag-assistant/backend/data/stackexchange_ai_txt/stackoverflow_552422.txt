Just a few points: RESTFul doesn't depend on the framework you use. It depends on the architectural style it describes. If you don't follow the constraints, you're not RESTful. The constraints are defined in half a page of Chapter 5 of Roy Fielding's document, I encourage you to go and read it. The identifier is opaque and does not cary any information beyond the identification of a resource. It's a nmae, not input data, just names. as far as the client is concerned, it has no logic or value beyond knowing how to build querystrings from a form tag. If your client builds its own URIs using a schema you've decided up-front, you're not restful. The use or not use of all the http verbs is not really the constraint, and it's perfectly acceptable to design an architecture that only supports POST. Caching, high decoupling, lack of session state and layered architecture are the points few talk about but the most important to the success of a RESTful architecture. If you don't spend most of your time crafting your document format, you're probably not doing REST.
