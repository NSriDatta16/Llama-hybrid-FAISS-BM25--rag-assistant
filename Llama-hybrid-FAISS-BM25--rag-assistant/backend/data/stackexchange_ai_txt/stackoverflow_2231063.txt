It is not possible to do this with VBA code. I think the best you could hope to do it would be by making Win32 API calls to simulate all the needed steps to make this happen. It would be sloppy but you could make it work. Basically, you would have open the needed windows and applications leveraging shortcut keys on the keyboard and for selecting the correct certs. Some example code would be Public Declare Function SetFocus Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long) As Long Public Declare Function FindWindow Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowA" _ (ByVal lpClassName As String, ByVal lpWindowName As String) As Long Public Declare Function FindWindowEx Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowExA" _ (ByVal hWnd1 As Long, ByVal hWnd2 As Long, _ ByVal lpsz1 As String, ByVal lpsz2 As String) As Long Sub SetFocusFormulaBar() SetFocus FindWindowEx(FindWindow("XLMAIN", Application.Caption), _ 0&, "EXCEL http://www.cpearson.com/excel/FormulaBarShortcut.htm
