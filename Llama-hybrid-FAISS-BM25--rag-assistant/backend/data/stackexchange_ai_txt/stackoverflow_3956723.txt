First of all, try the stupid solution that works: increase your java heap space. ;in your clojure launch script java -Xmx2G ...other options... There is one part of the program which is not lazy in partition, but changing it so that it is lazy (by getting rid of a call to count ) still gives me an OutOfMemoryError for the default heap size. Replacing the cleverness of avg-damp-n with a reduce-calculated average on (take (integer-exponent 2 20) seq) still causes an OutOfMemoryError. Looking at the source of everything else I don't see any other things that look like they should be consuming heap.
