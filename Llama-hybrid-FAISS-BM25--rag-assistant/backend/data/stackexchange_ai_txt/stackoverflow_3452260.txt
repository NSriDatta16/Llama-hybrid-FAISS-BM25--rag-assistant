You can lookup the internet email address in the company Name and Addresss Book (NAB) database. I believe out-of-the-box, there is a view in the NAB named "Person / By Internet Email". From within a Notes agent, you can use formula language (use @DBLookup) or script (using notesView.getDocumentByKey). Or you can use COM to do the lookup. In script, this would look something like: ... dim s as new notesSession, db as notesDatabase, vw as notesView, doc as notesDocument set db = s.getDatabase (YOUR_SERVER, "names.nsf") set vw = db.getView ("People\By Internet Mail") set doc = vw.getDocumentByKey (EMAIL_ADDRESS_VALUE, true) if not (doc is nothing) then sName = doc.FullName(0) end if ....
