No. When you have a quadratic (or higher order) term or an interaction, there is no single overall measure of the effect size of a variable because the effect size will vary at different levels. So, you could find the OR at any particular level of the variable, but it will be different at different levels. The same is true for "regular" logistic regression. See this thread
