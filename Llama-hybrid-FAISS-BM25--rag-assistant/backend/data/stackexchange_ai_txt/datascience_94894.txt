How to find the related columns between column?

Suppose I have a data frame with columns car_id,number_car,bike_id,number_bike. df = Product_id Category order_id order customer_id customer Name pd01 car or01 service cus01 Jack pd02 bike or02 repair cus02 Swan pd03 car or3 repair cus03 Tom pd04 car or04 cleaning cus04 ram Where we can make out that Product_id has a relation with Category, order_id has a relation with order and customer_id has a relation with customer name. But I am just curious about finding this by using nltk or any other way. Is it possible to find the relation between the columns using nltk word2vec? Just like sending a sentence as a list can we send the column as a list? If not possible by nltk or is there any other way of doing this in data science, or any other method not related to data science. What is the best way to do it? Basically, I am trying to find the dimensional tables without any human interference
