I would advise that you start with Spring and use its JDBC templates and leave Hibernate out of it until you have it working. Spring will encourage you to use interfaces, which means you'll separate the implementation from the method signatures. You can get everything up and running with Spring and swap out the JDBC DAO for its Hibernate equivalent once you're ready for it. I can only handle one thing that I'm ignorant of at a time. If you're like that too, follow my advice and start with Spring alone.
