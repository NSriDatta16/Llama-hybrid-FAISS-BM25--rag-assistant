You should add the following line to the top of your code: use warnings; Or, if your already have it there, you should pay attention to the warning messages you receive. Others have correctly pointed out that your input line does not have any literal pipes. I think you really want something like this: use strict; use warnings; my @tmp_field_validation = (" 1 10 2009\n"); foreach my $line (@tmp_field_validation) { chomp $line; $line =~ s/^\s*//; my ($cycle_code,$cycle_month,$cycle_year)= split /\s+/, $line; print "$line\n"; print "$cycle_code|$cycle_month|$cycle_year"; } Outputs the following: 1 10 2009 1|10|2009
