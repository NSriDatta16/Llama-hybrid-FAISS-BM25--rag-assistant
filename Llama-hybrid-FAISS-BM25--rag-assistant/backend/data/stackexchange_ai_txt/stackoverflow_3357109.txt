What's the simplest most elegant way to utilize a custom attribute

So a little confession, I've never written an attribute class. I understand they serve the purpose of decorating classes with flags or extra functionality possibly. Can someone give me a quick example of not just creating and applying an attribute to a class, but rather utilizing the attribute from another block of code. The only code samples I've ever seen to utilize any form of attributes was doing so with reflection, though I've always hoped there's a way of using them without reflection.
