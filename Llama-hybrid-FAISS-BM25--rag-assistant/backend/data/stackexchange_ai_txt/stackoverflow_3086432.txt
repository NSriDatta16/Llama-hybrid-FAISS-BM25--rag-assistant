http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-index.html "A UNIQUE index creates a constraint such that all values in the index must be distinct. An error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key value that matches an existing row. This constraint does not apply to NULL values except for the BDB storage engine. For other engines, a UNIQUE index allows multiple NULL values for columns that can contain NULL." So, no, you can't get MySQL to treat NULL as a unique value. I guess you have a couple of choices: you could do what you suggested in your question and store a "special value" instead of null, or you could use the BDB engine for the table. I don't think this minor difference in behaviour warrants making an unusual choice of storage engine, though.
