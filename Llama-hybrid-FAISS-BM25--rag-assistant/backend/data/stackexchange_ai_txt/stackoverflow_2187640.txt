It is using binary manipultaors. (Assuming ints are 1 byte, and use Two's complement for storage, etc.) a = 1|2|4 means a = 00000001 or 00000010 or 00000100 , which is 00000111, or 7. b = 8 means b = 00001000 . c = 2 means c = 00000010 . b |= a means b = b | a which means b = 00001000 or 00000111 , which is 00001111, or 15. ~c means not c , which is 11111101. b &= ~c means b = b & ~c , which means b = 00001111 and 11111101 , which is 00001101, or 13.
