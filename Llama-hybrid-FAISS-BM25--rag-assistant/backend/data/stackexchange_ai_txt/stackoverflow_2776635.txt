I think I have an answer for you. It's not the most elegant but it works. Basically, you run the stylesheet against one of the XML files you are trying to merge and then you use the document function to gain access to the other XML file. Iterate through each record in the first XML file and find the matching point. Then iterate through the second document and find the matching record and pull the appropriate nodes in.
