Different paths on different computers

I use 3 computers regularly and a fourth one ocassionaly. I have used Dropbox to synchronize my .ahk script to all computers. However, the path names are different on the different computers. For instance at home there is C:\Users\Farrel\Documents\SyRRuP where as at work it is something such as C:\Users\fbuchins\Documents\SyRRuP and on an Windows XP computer it is somethinge else. Consequently a particular sequence of code that runs a particular file only works on one computer and bombs out on the others. What is the most elegant way to overcome the problem?
