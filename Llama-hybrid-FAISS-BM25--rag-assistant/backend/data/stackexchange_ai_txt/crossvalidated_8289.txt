You can use logistic regression to answer these questions. Disease is the outcome. Fitting a model with size and shape as covariates will allow you to test for a size effect and a shape effect, and adding an interaction between size and shape will allow you to test for a size*shape interaction. You can get p -value for each from likelihood ratio tests . It probably makes sense to treat shape as categorical, i.e. use indicator variables, but fit a linear effect of size, at least to start off with. To do that you could represent size by the midpoint of the two inner bounded intervals, i.e. 5 and 7, and for the outer two intervals either use the mean sizes if you know them or pick some reasonable values (you know more than me how small and large the smallest and largest values are so what are reasonable values).
