The Wold representation is an infinite weighted sum of the current and past innovations $\epsilon_t$ : $$ X_t = \psi_0 \epsilon_t + \psi_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \psi_1 \epsilon_{t-2} + ... = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \psi_i \epsilon_{t-i} $$ If you were interested in obtaining the values of the first weights, $\psi_i$ , for a given ARMA process, you can proceed as follows (more details are given in Brockwell and Davis (1991) Time Series: Theory and Methods ยง3.3): By definition, we have: $$ X_t = \psi(L) \epsilon_t \quad \hbox{ and } \quad \phi(L) X_t = \theta(L) \epsilon_t \rightarrow X_t = \frac{\theta(L)}{\phi(L)} \epsilon_t $$ where $\psi(L)$ is the infinite polynomial, $\phi(L)$ is the autoregressive polynomial and $\theta(L)$ is the moving average polynomial. Your question is about an AR process but for generality I would consider an ARMA process, which may also be of interest for this question . Thus, we can write: $$ \psi(L) \epsilon_t = X_t = \frac{\theta(L)}{\phi(L)} \epsilon_t \rightarrow \psi(L) \phi(L) \epsilon_t = \theta(L) \epsilon_t $$ The values of $\psi_i$ can be obtained equating the coefficients related to the same lags, $L^i$ , from both sides of the last equation, $\psi(L) \phi(L) = \theta(L)$ . Example: Let's take the following ARMA(2,2) process: $$ X_t = 0.4 X_{t-1} + 0.2 X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t + 0.3 \epsilon_{t-1} - 0.4 \epsilon_{t-2} $$ You can check that the values $\psi_i$ can be obtained recursively (normalizing $\psi_0=1$ , $\phi_0=0$ and $\theta_0=0$ ): \begin{eqnarray} \begin{array}{l} \psi_1 = \theta_1 + \phi_1 = 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7 \\ \psi_2 = \theta_2 + \phi_2 + \phi_1 \psi_1 = -0.4 + 0.2 + 0.7\times0.4 = 0.08 \\ \psi_3 = \phi_1 \psi_2 + \phi_2 \psi_1 = 0.4 \times 0.08 + 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.172 \\ \psi_4 = \phi_1 \psi_3 + \phi_2 \psi_2 = 0.4 \times 0.172 + 0.2 \times 0.08 = 0.0848 \\ \psi_5 = \phi_1 \psi4 + \phi_2 \psi_3 = 0.4 \times 0.0848 + 0.2 \times 0.172 = 0.0683 \\ \psi_6 = ... = 0.0443 \\ ... \end{array} \end{eqnarray} For an AR(2) process you can simply set $\theta_1 = \theta_2 = 0$ .
