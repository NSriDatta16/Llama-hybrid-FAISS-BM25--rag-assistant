Do you need to provide access to these data chunks directly to the users of your application? If not, then S3 and HTTP GET requests are an overkill. Having also in mind that S3 is a secured service, the overhead for every GET request (for just 1KB of data) will be considerably large. MySQL server cluster would be a better idea, but to run in EC2 you need to employ Elastic Block Storage. Finally, do not rule out SimpleDB. It is perhaps the best solution for your problem. Design your system carefully and you would be able to easily migrate in other database systems (distributed or relational) in the future.
