As said by the other answer, you must use the weights to account for the unequal sampling probabilities in this design. There might be cases in which each observation in your data are self-weighted, in this case one is often tempted to ignore the sampling design as your point estimates are exactly the same before and after accounting for it. However, standard errors change due to complex sample designs and you should take this into account to build confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. However, it will depend on your analysis whether or not to actually use the sampling weights. For regression analysis, it might not be necessary, as explained here . Maybe tells us more about what you're doing to give you some more guidance? The survey package on R is the best way to manage this. You must declare your sample design and then use svy commands to compute statistics and run models. There is one caveat regarding the use of survey and the calculation of average partial effects of a general linear model with the margins package, however. If you feel like you need to do this kinds of things, maybe tells us more to see what we can do to help.
