Let $\mu$ be the service rate, $\alpha$ the rate at which the workers take a break, and $\beta$ the rate at which the workers return from a break. Assume that the workers only take breaks when idle. Let $X(t)$ be the number of workers busy at time $t$ , then $\{X(t):t\geqslant0\}$ is a continuous-time Markov chain on $\{0,1,2\}$ with transition rates $$ q_{ij} = \begin{cases} 2\beta,& (i,j) = (0,1)\\ \beta,& (i,j) = (1,2)\\ \mu+\alpha,& (i,j) = (1,0)\\ 2\mu,& (i,j) = (2,1). \end{cases} $$ We have the detailed balance equations \begin{align} 2\beta\pi_0 &= (\alpha+\mu)\pi_1\\ \beta\pi_1 &= 2\mu\pi_2 \end{align} which give $$ \pi_1 = \frac{2\beta}{\alpha+\mu}\pi_0,\quad \pi_2 = \frac{\beta^2}{\mu(\alpha+\mu)}\pi_0, $$ so from the condition $\pi_0+\pi_1+\pi_2=1$ we find that \begin{align} \pi_0 &= \frac{\mu(\alpha+\mu)}{\mu(\alpha+\mu)+\beta(\beta+2\mu)}\\ \pi_1 &= \frac{2\beta\mu}{\mu(\alpha+\mu)+\beta(\beta+2\mu)}\\ \pi_2 &= \frac{\beta^2}{\mu(\alpha+\mu)+\beta(\beta+2\mu)}. \end{align} Substituting the given rates (in units of $\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$ ) $\mu=25/2$ , $\alpha=6/5$ , and $\beta=20$ we have $$\pi_0 = \frac{137}{857}, \quad \pi_1 = \frac{400}{857},\quad \pi_2 = \frac{320}{857} . $$ The expected output per day is $\mu(\pi_1 + 2\pi_2)$ , or $\frac{13000}{857}$ . This gives an approximate expected output in a $25$ -day work period of $379.2299$ .
