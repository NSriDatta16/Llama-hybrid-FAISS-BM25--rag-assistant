I believe the problem is that your view controllers that you've added to the tabbar controller are not encapsulated by navigation controllers. Although your UITabBarController has a navigation controller, this does not implicitly give all of its tabs navigation controllers (and without a nav controller, a view controller's navigationItem won't do anything.) To remedy this problem I'd suggest encapsulating your view controllers with navigation controller upon initialization: ex: UserSettingsController *settingsController = [[UserSettingsController alloc] init]; UINavigationController *navController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:settingsController]; [settingsController release]; // etc... NSArray *controllers = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:navController, ..., ..., nil]; tabBarController.viewControllers = controllers; // Release your nav controllers, other cleanup EDIT Okay, I think I have a better idea of your setup now. I was able to get the following to work: self.tabBarController.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = myButton; An important caveat of this is that the button will persist on all of your tabbarcontroller's views unless you explicitly remove it. This may prove annoying/inelegant to maintain, but I am not sure of another solution if the view you want to have the button is not directly associated to a nav controller itself.
