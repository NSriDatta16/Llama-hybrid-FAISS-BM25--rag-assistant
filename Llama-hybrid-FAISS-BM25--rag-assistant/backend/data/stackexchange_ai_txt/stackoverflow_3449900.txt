Given the specs of your hard-ware I can only assume you are running on a 64 bit OS. You can still crash even if memory gets paged out to the page file. It might mean memory is fragmented, or that your page file is still too small. If so, you should bump up your page file to something pretty big like 8 or 12 GB's or so.
