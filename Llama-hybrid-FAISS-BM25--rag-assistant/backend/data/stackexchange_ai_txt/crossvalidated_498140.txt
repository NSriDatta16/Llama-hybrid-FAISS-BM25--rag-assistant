Exponential distribution and gamma prior

I want to use Bayesian conjugate to update my prior. Let's say I model bus arrivals by Exponential distribution with lamba=0.5 . It means on average I will wait for 2h = 1/0.5 Prior is gamma with: alha=1, beta=2, E[gamma] = alha/beta = 1/2 I have observed: 'the bus arrived after 3 hours'. Posterior: alha += 1, beta +=3, E[gamma] = 2/5 My posterior expected waiting time will be longer 5/2=2.5 How should I update my prior in case I have observed the next event: 'I waited for 3h and went home'. There is no information when the 'bus has arrived' but that 'it did not arrive for 3h'
