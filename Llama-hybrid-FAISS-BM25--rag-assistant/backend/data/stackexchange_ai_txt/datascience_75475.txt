There are lots of works on text-to-SQL task. I strongly suggest you to check WikiSQL and Spider datasets. Studies start from seq2seq + attention mech. to BERT-based solutions. Also each study points out the importance of the input representaion where you can feed all the table schema or just a column name. It's a pretty deep topic and as @PyRsquared said there is no simple answer :)
