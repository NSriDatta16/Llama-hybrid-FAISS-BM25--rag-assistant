I can think of two ways of facing this problem. If the time series data is stationary you can calculate the auto correlation function to see if there is a statistically significant correlation for lag 30 (one month separation). If the data is not stationary there are plenty of ways to transform it, but which works best will depend on the dataset. The simplest solution might be to difference the data with lag 1. Perform a t-test where you compare the values at the end-of-month spikes to the mean of the entire data set. The t test would not show significance if there would be a difference in your data (remember what the null hypothesis for a t test is)
