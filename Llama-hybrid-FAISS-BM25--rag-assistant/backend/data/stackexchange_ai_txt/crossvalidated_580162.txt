What is the meaning of a quantile regression model that predicts the conditional mean?

What does that phrase "quantile regression model that predicts the conditional mean" mean? How to interpret that? I found it in Liu et al. (2020) . The authors have compared the results of linear regression, QRF conditional mean, QRF conditional median, QRF conditional first quantile, and QRF conditional third quantile. What confuses me is that for my little understanding, QRF predicting the conditional mean is exactly the same as Random forest, and the results for both should be identical, which is not the case in that paper! Note: the authors use R packages randomForest, and quantregForest.
