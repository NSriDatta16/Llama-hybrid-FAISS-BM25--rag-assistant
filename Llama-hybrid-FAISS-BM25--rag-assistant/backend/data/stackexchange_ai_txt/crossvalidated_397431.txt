The Average Time a CSA is taking to Reply to a Customer would be given by something like $$\frac{1}{n_{total}}\sum_{i\leq n_{total}}t_i,$$ where $t_i$ is the time the agent took to answer the $i$ -th message (including those from all customers) and $n_{total}$ the number of messages he got. If there were C customer calls, what you have is a list of averages like the following: $$\frac{1}{n_{customer 1}}\sum_{j\leq n_{customer1}}t_j\quad,...,\quad\frac{1}{n_{customer C}}\sum_{j\leq n_{customerC}}t_j,$$ where $n_{customer1}$ is the number of messages sent by customer 1, which I see you also have. What do you get when you multiply each of those contact averages by $n_{customerX}$ ? That should be enough of a hint!
