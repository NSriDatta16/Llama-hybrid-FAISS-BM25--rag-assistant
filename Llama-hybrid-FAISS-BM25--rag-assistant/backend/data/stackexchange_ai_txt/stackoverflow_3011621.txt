Change User Password in ASP.NET Forms Authentication

I code in C# (ASP.NET) and am using Forms authentication. I would like to know which is the best method to change a user password without using the asp:ChangePassword control. I dont want to use the reset password method. I just want to grab the password i have inside my textbox and replace it with my older password. Please note that the PasswordFormat I use is passwordFormat="Hashed" Some code snippets would be helpful Edit: In my web.config, I have set enablePasswordRetrieval="false" I used the following method var myUser = Membership.GetUser(userID); bool isChangeSuccess = myUser.ChangePassword( myUser.GetPassword(), ActivateUserPasswordText.Text.Trim()); It gives me the error, This Membership Provider has not been configured to support password retrieval. What could be done to solve these issues? I would really like my PasswordFormat to be hash itself. Regards, Naveen Jose
