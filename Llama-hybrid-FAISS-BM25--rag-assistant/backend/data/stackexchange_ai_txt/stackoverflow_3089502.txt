Image storage/search web application

I work for a multimedia department of the government and we have a lot of images that we would like to share with others departments. Here some information: We have around 20TB of images and photos to share. We already have a windows 2008 environment running .net mvc web applications. We already have a mssql cluster in place. We have plenty of storage space on our web servers farm. We have a 20mb/s connection available. I don't want to reinvent the wheel so i would like to know if someone know a web project that already exist that would meet ours needs. Since we always develop on .net mvc and use mssql I would prefer to stick with these technologies. Would it be better to start from scratch? If yes do you have some recommendation for: The storage(file vs database) The thumbnail creation (our original picture are often huge ie: several GB) The search in filename, metadata(photoshop/indesing),etc...
