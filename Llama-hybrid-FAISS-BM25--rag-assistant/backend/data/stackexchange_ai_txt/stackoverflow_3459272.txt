Have you set your admin config settings to "use secure" (I can't remember the exact wording) for the frontend? If so, have you set your secure URLs to be HTTPS? Magento generates image and link URLs via those secure/unsecure URLs you specify. If you haven't properly specified those as https://, you will have this problem. Otherwise, Magento is actually very good about outputting only secure content. I haven't tested this for skin URLs, but for regular URLs you can do the following to force secure URLs. This is from the deep bowels of the URL code: // Get the URL for another action on our current controller // and force it to https $path = "*/*/submit"; $url = Mage::getUrl($path, array('_forced_secure' => true)); There's probably some way to specify those extra arguments in getSkinUrl...
