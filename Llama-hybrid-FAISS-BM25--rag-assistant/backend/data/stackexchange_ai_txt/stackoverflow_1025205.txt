Did you mistype the question? There's no way for that to output the message you write, and I would expect that the proper command is something more like gcc -L. `net-snmp-config --cflags` -fPIC -shared -c -o matsu_object.o tsu_object.c Notice the -L uppercase, backticks instead of single quotes, and upper-case I in PIC . Also, you don't say what you're trying to do, but net-snmp-config should also take at least one of --libs or --agent-libs as well. Ah, I didn't read closely enough... -c means "compile", that is: generate from tsu_object.c , a compiled matsu_object.o . Without -c , the compiler actually links, that is: generate from *.o , a.out or other specified file. -shared (and linker flags like -l and -L ) are only meaningful when linking. They're meaningless when compiling, as you are doing here because of -c . Please correct the command-line in the question to accurately reflect what you're running, and give some more explanation as to what you're trying to do.
