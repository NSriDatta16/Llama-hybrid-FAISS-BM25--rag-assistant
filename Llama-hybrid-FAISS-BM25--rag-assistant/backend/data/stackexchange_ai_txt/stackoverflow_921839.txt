Actually, printing on Acid-free paper is probably a much better solution than any more advanced technological one. It is much more likely that the IT tech of +100 years will be able to high-speed scan and load print than any digital data storage based on 100 year-old media access HW, technology and standards, 100 year-old disk/file format standards and 100 year-old data encoding standards. Disagree? I've got a whole attic full of vinyl CD's, 8-tracks, cassette tapes, floppy disks (4 different densities!) that argue otherwise. And they are only 20 years old! (OK, the 8-tracks are closer to 30). The fact is that there is only one data storage & archiving technology that has ever withstood the test of time over 100 years or more and still been cost effectively retrievable, and thats writing/printing on physical media. My advice? Don't trust any archival strategy until it's been tested, and there's only one that has passed the 100-year test so far.
