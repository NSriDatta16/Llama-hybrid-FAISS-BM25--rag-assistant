Just to +1 Agile Web Development with Rails (though make sure you get the latest edition) - http://pragprog.com/ I develop on a Mac and this can soemtimes be beneficial - it's quite a popular platform with Rails developers so many of the blog posts you look at will be mac-orientated. Linux is great too though ;) Finally - and I have no connection with the company at all - when you do have something you want to put live, heroku is a good choice. Finding a cheap rails host isn't easy so this is a nice starting point. There are a lot of other great hosts out there too though! Heroku does kind of require git for version control (though you can use it on top of subversion). Best of luck!
