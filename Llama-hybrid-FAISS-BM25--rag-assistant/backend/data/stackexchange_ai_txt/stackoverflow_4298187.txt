Algorithm for 2D line segment morphing

Creating a puzzle game where I want the shapes to morph based on user input. A user clicks on a vertex and drags the point changing the shape. For example if a user clicks on A and drags downward (shortening segment AG), point B would would down an equal amount (shortening BC), point F would move to the left shortening both AF and FG, finally point E would also shift to the left to stay in line with point F. There is an array of line segments, each line segment is itself an array that contains the two end points. When shifting I have a loop search for all the equal points. None of this is set in stone willing to make any changes needed to get this to work. I've been working on this for two days and am completely stumped. A B-------------\ | | \ | | \ | | \ | | \ C------------------\F | G | | | | | D-------------------E
