Jython is a Python implementation running on the JVM. You can find information about embedding Python in an existing Java app in the user guide . I don't know the environment that you're working in, but be aware that mixing languages in the same app can quickly lead to a mess. I recommend creating Java interfaces to represent the operations that you plan to use, along with separately-packaged implementation classes that wrap the Python code.
