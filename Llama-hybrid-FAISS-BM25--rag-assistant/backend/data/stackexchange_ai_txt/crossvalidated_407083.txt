The MAXIMUM possible gradient would be $n$ if the $tanh(nx) = 0$ (for $x = 0$ ). But it doesn't tell you anything about what would be the gradient on average, and this is what it's all about - if you move from that zero just so slightly, then the gradient vanishes much faster than it had with a plain $tanh(x)$ , and you end up with much more severe gradient vanishing than before.
