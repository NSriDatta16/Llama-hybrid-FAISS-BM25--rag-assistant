Assessing differences in ratings between two groups

I'm trying to come up with an approach to determine if end-of-year performance ratings were given out fairly without bias. We have 3 ratings, below, meets, exceeds and these can be substituted to be just 1,2, or 3. The goal is to ensure that managers are not giving our more exceeds to males vs females. We don't have a force distribution so I can't compare the % of exceeds to some forced distribution. We'd like to do this per manager at the n-3 level, so 2 levels below the CEO. Typical sample sizes at this level can be a couple 100 to 20. Just depends on the department. In years past, I've used a simple t.test to determine if the average rating for males is different than females. While this isn't ideal, it was the best I could come up with in a short time. I know Kolmogorov-Smirnov is a possibility, but unsure of the assumptions needed to meet it's requirement and the interpretation of the output. My primary tools are R and Tableau for sharing the results.
