I ran strace netbeans-6.0 and watched for filenames appearing in the output around the time when the application threw an error. [pid 10593] stat64("/opt/sun-j2me-bin-2.2/bin/./../appdb/rms/run_by_class_storage_freqstops.db", 0xbfa475c0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) [pid 10593] open("/opt/sun-j2me-bin-2.2/bin/./../appdb/rms", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY|0x80000) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) [pid 10593] stat64("/opt/sun-j2me-bin-2.2/bin/./../appdb/rms", 0xbfa475d0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) [pid 10593] mkdir("/opt/sun-j2me-bin-2.2/bin/./../appdb/rms", 0777) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied) Manually creating the directory /opt/sun-j2me-bin-2.2/appdb/rms and chmod ding it to 0777 solved the problem.
