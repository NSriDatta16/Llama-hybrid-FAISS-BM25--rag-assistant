Looking at your ACF and PACF is useful in the full context of your analysis as well. Your Ljung-Box Q-statistic; p-value; confidence interval, ACF and PACF should be viewed together. For instance the Q test here: acf, ci, Q, pvalue = tsa.acf(res1.resid, nlags=4, confint=95, qstat=True, unbiased=True) Here - our Q test for autocorrelation is an overall gut check of our graphical interpretation.
