What are some prediction methods when you have missing covariate information?

Say, you have the following information for training and test data: Response: $y$ Covariates: $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_p)$ However, you know that your covariates, $X$, are not enough to predict $y$ well. You know for sure that there are other covariates, $Z = (z_1, z_2, ..., z_m)$, that including would predict $y$ better. But you just can't get the information for $Z$. What prediction methods are good for this scenario? The only method I've come across is Prediction with Missing Data via Bayesian Additive Regression Trees . I'm looking for more methods since this didn't work that much better than linear regression and random forest for my data. Also, it did not include any missing data.
