Coefficients from Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn

I was trying to implement a model to distinguish between low or high pass filters acting on a white noise signal by using Scikit Learn's logistic regression. It seems to be working fine but when I extract the parameters b=intercept_ , and m=coef_ and use them to plot 1/(1+np.exp(-m*x-b) , the plot differs from when I use the predict function of the logistic regression. I can get it to be exactly by multiplying everything in np.exp() by an arbitrarily large number but I am not sure what the exact value is. My aim was to use the intercept_ parameter as an estimate for the cut-off frequency that's why I need the exact value of the parameter, the other one is just for determining between high and low pass so all I need is the sign. Anyone by any chance know what it is? I looked everywhere but I still cannot seem to find the answer. Thank you for your time.
