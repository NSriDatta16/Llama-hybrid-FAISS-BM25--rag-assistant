How to sample/fit distribution from/for bi-modal data

The context is: I have a sequence of data, of which the histograms show a bi-modal pattern. My final goal is to sample from this sequence in a simulation project. Now we want to fit a parametric model (or two models) over the data. My question is Is fitting parametric distribution over bi-modal data a good choice if my final goal is to sample from the data? shall I sample directly from the data? If so is there anything I shall pay special attention due to the bi-modal nature If I want to fit parametric models, is there any python libraries doing such? Is there any way to automatically detect whether a sample is not uni-modal?
