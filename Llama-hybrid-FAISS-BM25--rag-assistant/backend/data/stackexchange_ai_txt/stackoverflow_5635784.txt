vertical centering of list items

I have read many articles about vertical centering but I’m afraid not many of them are intuitive, hence unable to apply it to my problem. Basically, I have a main div and in there, I’ve got unordered list which has an image and paragraph tag within it and are displayed using inline-block. This aspect of the work is fine. The problem or what I am trying to achieve is to have the list centered in the middle of the screen. So for instance, if I have got just one item in the list, it should be in the middle and then move upwards as more items are entered in the list. Lorem ipsum #main { margin: 60px auto; height: 400px; } #main ul li { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; margin: 0 13px 72px 22px; height: 100px; } #main ul { text-align: center; }
