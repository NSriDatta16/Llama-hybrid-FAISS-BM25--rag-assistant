WPF: ListBox click and drag selects other items

Simple question: 1) I click and hold the mouse on a ListBoxItem in a ListBox. 2) Now I drag the mouse cursor down over the next ListBoxItem in the list It now selects this new item. I would like to disable this. So the user has to click an item to select it. Not just drag over it. I have Single selection turned on. Any ideas are greatly appreciated :)
