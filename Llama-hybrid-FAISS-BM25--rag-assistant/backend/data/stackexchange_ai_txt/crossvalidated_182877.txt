I would frame your analysis question as: What is the causal effect of the campaign on orders in countries that were targeted by the campaign? In causal inference terms, this means asking about the causal effect of treatment on the treated. So your response variable should be all orders except for country A , and your predictor variable should be orders from country A. Using a model for counterfactual inference (e.g., CausalImpact ), you can then compute an estimate of the time series of orders in all targeted countries had they not been targeted . The difference between observed orders and counterfactual orders provides you with an estimate of the causal effect of the campaign. Note that it's probably useful to add further predictor variables, as long as these are not themselves affected by the campaign and as long as their association with the response variable is stable over time.
