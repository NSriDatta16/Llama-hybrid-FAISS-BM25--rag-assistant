The question seems have little thing to do with glmnet , but factor encoding and interpretation on coefficient in general. I would suggest to look at logistic regression that uses categorical variables as a start. R Library: Contrast Coding Systems for categorical variables a great resource to learn different types of encoding and interpretation. The key is "comparing to base level". For example, if we want to encode days of weeks. We can use Sunday as a base level, and all other days will compare against it.
