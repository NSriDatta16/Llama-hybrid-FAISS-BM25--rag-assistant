Quick question about MVC in Php

Currently, I am working on restructuring an existing code base. I'm new to php frameworks, but I do know in general how MVC works. Right now, there is one controller file, one model file, and thirty view files. Should every model correspond to a table? Should every view correspond to an html page? What about the controller? How can I break this thousand line monster into more organized code. Thanks.
