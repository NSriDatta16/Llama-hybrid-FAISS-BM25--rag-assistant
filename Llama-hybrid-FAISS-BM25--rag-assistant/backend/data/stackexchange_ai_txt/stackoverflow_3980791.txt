You can call render in your controller, but that will be a problem if you need to possibly render more than a few partials for subsequent dom insertion by the handler. I needed to set multiple html fragments into a hash, and I've been able to return erb which basically uses hash.to_json.html_safe as neutrino suggests above and allows me to render multiple partials in the process.
