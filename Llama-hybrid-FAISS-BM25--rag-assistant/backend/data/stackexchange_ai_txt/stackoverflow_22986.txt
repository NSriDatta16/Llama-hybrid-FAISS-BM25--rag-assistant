Stored procedures represent a software contract that encapsulates the actions taken against the database. The code in the procedures, and even the schema of the database itself can be changed without affecting compiled, deployed code, just so the inputs and outputs of the procedure remain the same. By embedding queries in your application, you are tightly coupling yourself to your data model. For the same reason, it is also not good practice to simply create stored procedures that are just CRUD queries against every table in your database, since this is still tight coupling. The procedures should instead be bulky, coarse grained operations. From a security perspective, it is good practice to disallow db_datareader and db_datawriter from your application and only allow access to stored procedures.
