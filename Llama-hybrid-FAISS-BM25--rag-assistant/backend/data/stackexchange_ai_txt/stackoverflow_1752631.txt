If there are no circular dependencies (table A references B and B references A) then organize them in dependency order and import them in that sequence. The first table would be the one that others depend on, but which has no dependencies on other tables. If you have circular dependencies you will have to have some way of temporarily disabling referential integrity checking in the database while you import all the data, then re-enable it. Oracle can do this, but I don't know about MSSQL and MySQL.
