Why do they do that? Because C++ exception are for, well, exceptional circumstances and performance under exceptional circumstances doesn't really matter. C++' exceptions were designed with that in mind, making sure compiler vendors could deliver near-optimal performance in the common case of no exceptions being thrown, at the cost of worse-than-possible performance in the odd case when exceptions are thrown. From the very beginning users were encouraged to use exceptions only under exceptional circumstances, and implementers were encouraged to optimize the no-exception case (destructor addresses must be stored somewhere in order to call destructors when an exception comes by) at the cost of the exceptional case. And while implementers could certainly spend resources at also optimizing the odd exceptional case, most users wouldn't like that, since there's always so much more important things that need improvment.
