Which data subset should be used for interpretable machine learning (IML)?

In a machine learning workflow, we need to split the dataset into training and test sets. We train several candidate models (typically tuned with hyperparameter optimization) on the training set and then select the model that performs best when evaluated on the test set. This way, the performance evaluation minimizes overfitting on the training subset. Ultimately, I want to interpret the model using interpretable machine learning (IML) techniques such as accumulated local effects (ALE) . Here is my question: when analyzing the data using IML, which model and data subset should we use? Here are the various candidate options that I am considering: the best model trained on the training set with IML analyzing only the training set the best model trained on the training set with IML analyzing only the test set the best model trained on the full dataset (training + test data) with IML analyzing only the training set the best model trained on the full dataset (training + test data) with IML analyzing only the test set the best model trained on the full dataset (training + test data) with IML analyzing the full dataset (training + test data) I would appreciate a justified answer explaining why which subset is appropriate for training and which subset is a appropriate for IML data analysis.
