There's plenty around if you have access to journals; a lot get put up on researchgate or arxiv anyway. Try and find some literature reviews , books or other work which talk about various strategies if you can. Vector embedding techniques are quite common and might be worth checking out. They can also be extended to sequence data , which you might find useful. Techniques from graph theory have the advantage of being fairly intuitive to interpret. GANs have been coming into play more recently. You might also want to look into community detection and social network analysis .
