Most effective SVM implementation for large classes and datasets?

What's the best SVM implementation of SVMs in MATLAB? Right now I'm looking at PEGASOS and SVM-Perf, which both claims to have good performance with large datasets and classes. But there are so many implementation out there, and I definitely missed some. Can I get some other recommendations? My application is in bags of word object recognition that uses the histogram of the words in classification.
