For a big application, you could take a look at Magento : it's a robust solution, with both a community and an entreprise version. Another idea (that might be lighter) might be PrestaShop . Some might suggest you osCommerce , but it's an old software -- and even if it had much success some years ago, it doesn't really anymore now (I've never used it myself, but some colleagues of mine have worked with it -- and have since switched to Magento) .
