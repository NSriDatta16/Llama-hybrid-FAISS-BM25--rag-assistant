Bartholomew estimate of variance of median for exponential distributed RVs

Suppose, $X_1, X_2, \ldots X_n \sim \text{iid Exponential}(\theta)$ . The median is given by $\log(2) \theta$ . The MLE of the median is given by: $$ \hat{M} = \log(2) \sum_{i=1}^n X_i / n $$ And the variance of the sample median is (according to Brookmeyer, Crowley 1982): $$ \text{var}(\hat{M}) = \hat{M} / \sum_{i=1}^n \left(1-\exp(-T_i \log (2) / \hat{M}) \right) $$ However I can't seem to confirm these results with simulation. For 1000 simulated datasets, I get inconsistent values for the variance of the sample median versus the average of the median variance estimates. set.seed(123) l gives > var(l[1,]) [1] 0.4873672 > mean(l[2, ]) [1] 7.476596 Is the Bartholomew expression in fact correct?
