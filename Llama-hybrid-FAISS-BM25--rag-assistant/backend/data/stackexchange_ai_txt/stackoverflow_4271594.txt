What you are doing is fine --- if perhaps a little inelegantly. With your ordered factor, you have something like: > foo foo [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Levels: 1 class(foo) [1] "ordered" "factor" Notice that it has two classes, indicating that it is an ordered factor and that is is a factor : > is.ordered(as.ordered(1:10)) [1] TRUE > is.factor(as.ordered(1:10)) [1] TRUE In some senses, you might like to think that foo is an ordered factor but also inherits from the factor class too. Alternatively, if there isn't a specific method that handles ordered factors, but there is a method for factors, R will use the factor method. As far as R is concerned, an ordered factor is an object with classes "ordered" and "factor" . This is what your function for Gower's distance will require.
