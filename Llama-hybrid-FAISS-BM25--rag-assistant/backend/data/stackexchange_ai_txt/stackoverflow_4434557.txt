Maybe this is more about embedding flash dynamically. I got stuck on exactly the same thing with mp3 flash player. The thing is that IE doesn't care about the special script tag with 'event' and 'for' attribute, if it is added AFTER the page has loaded. My IE wouldn't event eat jquery's .html() when the page loaded, only document.write worked. But document.write can't really be used after the page has loaded, unless it is targeted in an iframe or some other devil worship mechanism. What's good tho, is that IE doesn't distinguish between assigning an event handler in this bastard script tag or programatically. This means that: eval(args); in IE directly translates to: function foo(command, args){ eval(args); } var ie_sucks = document.getElementById('myFlash'); ie_sucks.attachEvent("FSCommand", foo);
