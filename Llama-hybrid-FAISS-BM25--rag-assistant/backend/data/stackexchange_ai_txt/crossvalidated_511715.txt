This is a kind of regression toward the mean applied, in this specific case, to the variance or standard deviation. Regression toward the mean is observed when selecting subjects based on a very high or very low value and observing that subsequent measurements will be closer to the average. Regression toward the mean can be observed, for instance, if you compare the best students in a class and check their trajectories over a period of time (there is many other scenarios possible!). At T1, you choose the best students based on a measure Y1 , like, for instance, indx 1 , then at T2 , we should see a trend toward the population parameters (in this example : $\mu = 0$ , $\sigma =\sqrt{1.25} $ ) set.seed(1) N 1 mean(Y1[indx]) #1.685 sd(Y1[indx]) #0.6007802 mean(Y2[indx]) #1.357769 # a decrease toward the population mean = 0 sd(Y2[indx]) #0.8145581 # an increase toward the population standard deviation = sqrt(1.25) As expected. To make the matter more obvious, we could use the best students at T1 and T2 for a third measure T3 , like Y3 1 mean(Y3[indx2]) #-0.02015669 sd(Y3[indx2]) #1.123317 which are even closer to the population parameters. I don't have a specific references for the regression toward the mean in the context of effect sizes, but this phenomenon is covered extensively in many ressources. I do not see why regression toward the mean would be different in the context of effect sizes. The Wikipedia page can be very helpful and has many references. Stigler (2002) has an interesting and very accessible to most readers chapter on the topic. Stigler, S. M. (2002). Statistics on the table. The theory of statistical concepts and methods.
