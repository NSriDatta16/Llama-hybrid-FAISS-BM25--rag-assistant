Methodologies for predicting missing data

I have the following problem: I'm searching for methods to predict randomly missing data in a given dataset. For example: I have a dataset which contains information about a person. This can be gender, weight, age, height etc. Let's assume there are information missing of age and height for a specific person. How can this information be predicted based on the information I have in my dataset? I have read about PCA-methods, but I would like to get an overview of pros and cons of methodologies and also an overview of recent research (good working algorithms for the given dataset/where to start reading for developing an algorithm and solving the given problem).
