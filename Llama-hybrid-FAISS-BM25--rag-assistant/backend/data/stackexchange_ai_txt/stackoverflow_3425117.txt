First of all, add a WITH COPY_ONLY clause to your backup so that it does not interfere with a ordinary maintenance backup chain (If this is your backup chain, then is wrong anyway and you need a proper maintenance plan in place). Next, you can either: Increase the CommandTimeout on your application so that it waits until the procedure finishes (default times out in 30 seconds). Make the button create/start an SQL Agent job right away instead of running the procedure. Use asynchronous procedure execution . Which one is the right choice, depends on many factors only you know. My bet would be that this should be a regular scheduled job and there should be no user interaction, but without understanding the business process driving this is impossible to guess.
