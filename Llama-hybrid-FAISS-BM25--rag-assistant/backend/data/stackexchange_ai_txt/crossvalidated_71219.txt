How do I get sentiment from a certain "perspective" or point-of-view?

Consider the following text The verdict is out, the jury has held MS guilty of infringements and levied penalties aggregating to $1.50Bn. It will be a massive blow to the reputation of MS. The defendants, NK, on the other hand were elated. It was an important verdict for them to win. The brokerage group has already upgraded their stock to BUY. How can I model the problem of inferring the sentiment from perspectives of both the parties, that is, (positive) NK and (negative) MS. I do not even know what to search for over the internet to, at least, get some start.
