Excellent question and one that has bothered me greatly. It appears that the benefits of RAII are perceived very differently. In my experience with .NET, the lack of deterministic (or at least reliable) resource collection is one of the major drawbacks. In fact, .NET has forced me several times to employ whole architectures to deal with unmanaged resources that might (but might not) require explicit collecting. Which, of course, is a huge drawback because it makes the overall architecture more difficult and directs the client's attention away from the more central aspects.
