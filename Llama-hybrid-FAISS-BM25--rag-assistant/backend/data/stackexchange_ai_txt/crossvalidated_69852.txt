PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. After projecting into fewer number of dimensions, you lose some variance (along the discarded eigen vectors). Hence it is impossible to recover the original signal. Consider the following example. Let the original dimensions be $\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}$ and a point be $(a_i\hat{i},a_j\hat{j},a_k\hat{k})$. Let us discard the last 2 eigen vectors and keep only the first one. Let the eigen vector be given by $(e_i\hat{i},e_j\hat{j},e_k\hat{k})$. Projecting the point on this eigen vector gives us the magnitude of the point along this direction which is $|P|=(a_i*e_i+a_j*e_j+a_j*e_j)$. Since the other two eigen vectors are discarded, we do not know its projections along those dimensions. If you want to project this point back to the original space, you would get $(|P|\hat{i},|P|\hat{j},|P|\hat{k})$. Notice how just the above is different from the original point. If you had the other eigen vectors as well, they might add to the above.
