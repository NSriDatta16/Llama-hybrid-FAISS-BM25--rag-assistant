What loss function should I use for binary detection in face/non-face detection in CNN?

I want to use deep learning to train a face/non-face binary detection, what loss should I use, I think it is SigmoidCrossEntropyLoss or Hinge-loss . Is that right, but I also wonder should I use softmax but with only two classes?
