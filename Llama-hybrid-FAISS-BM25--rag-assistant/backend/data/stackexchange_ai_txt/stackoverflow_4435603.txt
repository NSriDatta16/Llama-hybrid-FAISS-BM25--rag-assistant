I have just had an exciting three hours battling with this. I have just upgraded a project to 4.2 and for some reason it just wouldn't work. I eventually removed the Entitlements.plist file and then created a new one. File > New File > Code Signing > Entitlement Name the file Entitlements.plist Make sure it's in the Resources group in xCode. It didn't put in the get-task-allow BOOL type in the Entitlements.plist file. I added it, checked it, saved it, unchecked it, saved it. This made me feel better. I then removed the Adhoc and Release profiles I had created. Re-downloaded them from the Provisioning Portal and droped them back into the xCode organizer. I then went into Build Settings and made sure the correct profiles were assigned to the Debug and Release profiles. I then changed the to Release / Device. Hit the build button and it worked. I have no idea why.
