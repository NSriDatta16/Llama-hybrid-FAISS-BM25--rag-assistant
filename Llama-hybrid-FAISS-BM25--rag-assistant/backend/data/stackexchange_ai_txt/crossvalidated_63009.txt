If you are trying to predict downtime from attributes of messages, it sounds like you want some form of regression. If downtime is a binary variable (yes/no) then you probably want logistic regression. If downtime is continuous (e.g. in minutes or seconds) you probably want "regular" (ordinary least squares) regression. If downtime is in some other format, please tell us. Both these forms of regression (and others) are available in the R function glm .
