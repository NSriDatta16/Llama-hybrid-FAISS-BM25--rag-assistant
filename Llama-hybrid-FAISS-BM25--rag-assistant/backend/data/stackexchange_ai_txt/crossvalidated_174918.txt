Is it normal to have an upward sloping precision/recall curve?

I keep getting precision/recall curves that look like this when using scikit learns's precision_recall_curve function and using the result from classifier.predict_proba(X)[:,1] as the 'scores' parameter. (Note: I didn't include what classifier I am using because I keep seeing this upward curve again and again with different classifiers. This particular curve comes from a logistic regression model). Does it make sense to have an upward sloping precision recall curve as shown in the picture above? how am I to interpret such a curve? I've checked out this answer about horizontal curves , but this is a very different situation. That one deals with a horizontal, 100% precision curve, which makes more intuitive sense to me. But this? This does not.
