SQL Server has had exception support since 2005: BEGIN TRY BEGIN TRAN INSERT INTO ... COMMIT TRAN END TRY BEGIN CATCH EXECUTE usp_LogAndRethrowError END CATCH Your LogAndRethrowError can then roll back any doomed transactions, a la: -- Make sure we are not in a live or 'doomed' transaction IF XACT_STATE() <> 0 ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
