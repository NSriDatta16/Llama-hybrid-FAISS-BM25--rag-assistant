If I understand correctly, you will use the 30 samples to estimate the in-control (IC) mean, which in this case is a actually proportion on the interval (0, 1). When you start monitor, will you monitor each individual's scores or the average score of all the students? If it's the average of all students, you may be able to get away with using standard control charts that assumes Normality if the subgroups are big enough. One place you might want to look is the 1998 Hawkins and Olwell text. In section 5.7 they describe weighted binomial CUSUM charts. These are charts designed to monitor the probability parameter of binomial distributed data and don't require the same number of trials (test questions in your example) at each observation. It's fairly likely that there are more sophisticated methods available and I wouldn't be surprised if this was still an open research area. You may also want to see what Google Scholar says when you look for control charts for binomial distributed data.
