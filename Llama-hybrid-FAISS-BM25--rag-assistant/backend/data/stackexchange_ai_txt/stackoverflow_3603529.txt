Organizing Images and their thumnails

What's the best-practice method of storing a user's uploaded pictures and it's corresponding thumbnails. I noticed Flickr uses filename distinctions like: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/1234/789456123a_s.jpg where _s.jpg describes the size of the image (_s.jpg = small, _m.jpg = medium...). However, does storing images like the following make sense? /images/123456.jpg /images/small/123456.jpg /images/medium/123456.jpg ...therefore, it's easy to access different sizes by simply pre-pending the folder-size name
