How to run a dictionary search against a large text file?

We're in the final stages of shipping our console game. On the Wii we're having the most problems with memory of course, so we're busy hunting down sloppy coding, packing bits, and so on. I've done a dump of memory and used strings.exe (from sysinternals) to analyze it, but it's coming up with a lot of gunk like this: ''''$$$$ %%%% ''''$$$$%%%%####&&&& ''''$$$$((((!!!!$$$$''''((((####%%%%$$$$####(((( ''))++.-$$%&'')) '')*>BZf8 I'm more interested in strings like this: wood_wide_end.bmp restroom_stonewall.bmp ...which mean we're still embedding some kinds of strings that need to be converted to ID's. So my question is: what are some good ways of finding the stuff that's likely our debug data that we can eliminate? I can do some rx's to hack off symbols or just search for certain kinds of strings. But what I'd really like to do is get a hold of a standard dictionary file and search my strings file against that. Seems slow if I were to build a big rx with aardvaark|alimony|archetype etc. Or will that work well enough if I do a .NET compiled rx assembly for it? Looking for other ideas about how to find stuff we want to eliminate as well. Quick and dirty solutions, don't need elegant. Thanks!
