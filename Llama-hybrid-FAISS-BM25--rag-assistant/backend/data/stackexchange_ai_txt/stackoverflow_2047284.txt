I don't have experience in IBM Content Manager and Websphere Process Server. But SharePoint does provide a powerful content management feature and workflow system. For most business scenarios, you can use out-of-the-box SharePoint features and workflows. Power users can design their own content types within SharePoint UI, and can even create custom workflows with SharePoint designer. If you really need to extend SharePoint by writing custom codes, it should be quite since you already use C#. There are some Visual Studio extensions to help you create new SharePoint features. You can leverage Windows Workflow Foundation also to build custom and complicated workflows. If your company uses Microsoft Office product, then it will be even better. SharePoint can work seamlessly with products such as Outlook, Word, or Excel.
