Continuous variable for logistic regression

I'm new in machine learning and have a question regarding a continuous variable which I want to use in my logistic regression. On the first view the variable seems to increase the probability of the event (to be true) when it recedes from 0 in both direction. In other words: when the variable approximates 0, the probability for the event to be true decreases. Now to my question: how can I model this in my logistic regression? Should I use a dummy variable or is there a way to transform the variable? Is there a test with which I can prove this behaviour?
