How to make UITableView work within TTScrollView?

I'm solving a problem how to make tableviews work within three20's TTScrollView. I have a project which I want to rebuild using three20 library. There is one module which allows user to flip through set of "pages", which contains table showing some list of data. My problem is that when I rebuilt this module to use three20's TTScrollView, tableviews inside the scrollview do not work anymore. In particular, it cannot be scrolled and cannot select an item, because all touches are intercepted by the scrollview. I'm getting mad about this and cannot figure out how to make it work. I'm able to make work either tableview or scrollview but not both (means tableview intercepts vertical dragging, while scrollview horizontal). It worked fine with UIKit's UIScrollview, so there must be a way how to do this, but simply cannot figure out how. Please help, I'm struggling with it yet couple of days now, but cannot get over. thanks much for any hint.
