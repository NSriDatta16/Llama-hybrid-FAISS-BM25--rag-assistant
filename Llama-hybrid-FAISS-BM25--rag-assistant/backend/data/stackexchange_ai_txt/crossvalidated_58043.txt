More information would help a lot, but there is a simple tentative answer from what you have told us. In principle a ratio of lengths must be positive and is likely to be skew in distribution, but its logarithm will usually be (much?) more nearly symmetric in distribution. PCA is just a transformation procedure, but putting in data that are approximately symmetric in distribution will often make patterns (much?) easier to see. There is no difference statistically between log10 and ln. Go with what's easier to explain to your audience: do zoologists know about natural logarithms? Angular transformation applies only to bounded measurements. If it's necessarily true that a length ratio must be within (0,1) -- i.e. it is anatomically inevitable that one bone or whatever must be shorter than another -- then angular is possible, but it may be that logit is better.
