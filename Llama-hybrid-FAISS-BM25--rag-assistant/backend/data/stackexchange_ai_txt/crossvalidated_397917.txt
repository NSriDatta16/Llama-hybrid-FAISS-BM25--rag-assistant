Is it good practice to use Linear Least-Squares with SMA?

I have time-series (daily) data and I want to understand the general trend. My current approach is: Calculate the 7-day simple moving average. Add a line of best fit (linear least squares regression). Plot, then review metrics such as r, r^2, etc. Question: is it good practice to draw a line-of-best fit on a moving average? I'm not very experienced but my understanding is MA and linear trend lines are both trend lines , so I'm not sure if it's OK to combine them in this way. Raw data looks like this: day + count 2015-01-01 | 123 2015-01-02 | 290 2015-01-03 | 329 2015-01-04 | 276 Let me know if more detail would help- any direction on this is much appreciated.
