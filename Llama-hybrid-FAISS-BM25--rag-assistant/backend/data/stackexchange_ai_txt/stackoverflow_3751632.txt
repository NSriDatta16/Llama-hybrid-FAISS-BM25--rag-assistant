Listening for Multiple Events on Multiple Objects AS3

I currently have an over, out and click event for 8 different objects. The over and out events are identical for each (tween expands object and then shrinks it back for the out state). I have previously asked for an easy way to declare those events, and now I was looking for an easier way to handle them. Here's my code: //-----------GARAGE function growGarage(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_garage, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_garage, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); } function shrinkGarage(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_garage, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_garage, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); } function garageClick(e:MouseEvent):void{ trace("clicked"); } //-----------B&B function growBandb(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_bandb, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_bandb, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); } function shrinkBandb(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_bandb, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_bandb, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); } function bandbClick(e:MouseEvent):void{ trace("clicked"); } //-----------FACTORY function growFactory(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_factory, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_factory, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); } function shrinkFactory(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_factory, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_factory, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); } function factoryClick(e:MouseEvent):void{ trace("clicked"); } //-----------SCHOOL function growSchool(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_school, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_school, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 0.648, 1, 0.5, true); } function shrinkSchool(e:MouseEvent):void{ scaleTweenX = new Tween(map_school, "scaleX", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); scaleTweenY = new Tween(map_school, "scaleY", Elastic.easeOut, 1, 0.648, 0.5, true); } function schoolClick(e:MouseEvent):void{ trace("clicked"); } I've tried using a single function and then using "this" as the object of the tween but that expanded the entire stage. Is there a way to condense this code? Cheers, Dan
