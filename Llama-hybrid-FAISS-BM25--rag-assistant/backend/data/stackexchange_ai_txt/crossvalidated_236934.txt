You already got nice answer about point estimation and comparing your schools from Bayesian point of view, but your question: Using only the sample size of each school and the sample pass rate, is it possible to reject the null hypothesis? Can be given simple and straightforward answer from frequentist point of view. Given two proportions $p_1,p_2$ and sample sizes $n_1,n_2$ you can use $z$-test for two proportion to test your hypothesis. First you need to compute the "aggregate" proportion $\bar p$ $$ \bar p = \frac{p_1 n_1 + p_2 n_2}{ n_1 + n_2} $$ and then the test statistic is $$ z = \frac{p_1 - p_2}{\sqrt{\bar p (1-\bar p)(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} $$ where $z$ follows normal distribution (check here , or here for worked examples). As with Bayesian approach, in frequentist case you also can compute confidence intervals around the individual proportions so to compare them. There is a number of methods for that, for review you can check Wikipedia article and paper Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion by Brown, Cai and DasGupta (2001, Statistical Science, 16(2), pp. 101-117).
