Yes you can use a neural network, or any other regression-like algorithm for this task. There are lots of algorithms that you can use. A simple feed-forward network should suffice. Although, if you are not a machine learning expert (I'm assuming that you are not based on your question), I would suggest that you stick with something a little less exciting like OLS. It is easier to implement. Then you just need to spend some time doing a lot of feature engineering. So that you can feed not just raw variables but meaningful features to the model. For example the combination of features like size * complexity * material would give a lot of models to work with.
