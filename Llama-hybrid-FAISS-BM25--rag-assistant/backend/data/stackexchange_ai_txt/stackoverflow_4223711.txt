A more elegant way to use recv() and vector

So far, I have this code sample: ... int nbytes =0; vector buffer; buffer.resize(5000); nbytes = recv(socket, &buffer[0], buffer.size(),0); //since I want to use buffer.size() to know data length in buffer I do ... buffer.resize(nbytes); Is it some another way, to know data length in buffer without using resize() twice? Because it is not possible to receive data into vector that is not resized to proper size. I think reserve() method don't do allocation, according to the C++ STL documentation. And another question: is using this kind of technique is memory leak-safe ?
