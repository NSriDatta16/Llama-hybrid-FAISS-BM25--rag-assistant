Creating outlets and actions on object from Interface Builder

In the initial lecture "1. Introduction to Mac OS X, Cocoa touch, Objective-C and Tools" the students are instructed to drag an "Object" into interface builder and set the class actions and outlets. I do not seem to have this ability in my interface builder. Was it removed or disabled in more recent versions?
