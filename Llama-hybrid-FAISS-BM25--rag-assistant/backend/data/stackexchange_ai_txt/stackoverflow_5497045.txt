If you are using Netbeans, it say in the module file: "Do not define servlets here, use web.xml". http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideModuleXml say: : For RPC, this element loads a servlet class mounted at the specified URL path. The URL path should be absolute and have the form of a directory (for example, /calendar). Your client code then specifies this URL mapping by annotating the service interface with the @RemoteServiceRelativePath attribute. Any number of servlets may be loaded in this manner, including those from inherited modules. The element applies only to GWT's embedded server server-side debugging feature. NOTE: as of GWT 1.6, this tag does no longer loads servlets in development mode, instead you must configure a WEB-INF/web.xml in your war directory to load any servlets needed.
