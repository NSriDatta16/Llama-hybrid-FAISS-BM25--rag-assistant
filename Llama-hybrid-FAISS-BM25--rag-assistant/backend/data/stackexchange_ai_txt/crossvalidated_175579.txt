Hello and welcome to stack exchange. As whuber pointed out, the perception that observed data is random is not specific to frequentist statistics. If we are modeling some process using random variables and then sample from that process, the sample we get will surely be random. Similarly, any conclusions that you make from the data are random, whether these are model parameters that were estimated or hypothesis test conclusions. In frequentist statistics, the approach is to design experiments in such a way that making unacceptably wrong conclusions is acceptably improbable. Bayesians use probability distributions to model the uncertainty in their conclusions, and to incorporate prior beliefs rigorously into such a statistical approach.
