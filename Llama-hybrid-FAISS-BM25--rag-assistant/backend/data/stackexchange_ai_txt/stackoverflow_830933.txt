If you're talking about capturing gestures then here is the example they give in the docs . Though I could have sworn I heard Alan Cannistraro say in one of the first CS193P lectures that you don't have to do this, that you can just trap the swipe event but I can't find that. Could someone that actually knows what they are doing please correct me and I'll remove this post but for now I know this will work: #define HORIZ_SWIPE_DRAG_MIN 12 #define VERT_SWIPE_DRAG_MAX 4 - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; startTouchPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentTouchPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; // If the swipe tracks correctly. if (fabsf(startTouchPosition.x - currentTouchPosition.x) >= HORIZ_SWIPE_DRAG_MIN && fabsf(startTouchPosition.y - currentTouchPosition.y)
