Positive or negative effect of neural network inputs on output in binary classification (MATLAB)?

How we can find an input has positive or negative effects on output in a binary classification neural network in MATLAB R2015a ? (with softmax transfer function in output layer, transig for two hidden layers, 5 neurons in first hidden layer and 7 neurons in second hidden layer + 10 inputs). How we can know which inputs have higher weights on output in a trained neural network (MLP)? (most impotent inputs - ranking)?
