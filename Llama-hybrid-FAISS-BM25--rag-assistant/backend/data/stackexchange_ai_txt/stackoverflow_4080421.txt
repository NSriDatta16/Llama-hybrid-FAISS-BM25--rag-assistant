Retrieve child window reference after refresh

I have an HTML5 offline app (i.e. there's no server-side component/code). It basically has two windows (parent and child). However, in some instances I need to programmatically refresh the parent window. When this happens, it loses its reference to the child, and the child's reference to window.opener is no longer valid. So my thinking was that I'd serialize the child window and store that in localStorage. Then when the parent refreshed it could pick up the window reference from localStorage and still interact with the child. The problem is that this doesn't work (as per my previous question here Stringify DOMWindow object ). I can't serialize a DOM window like any other object. So how can I have my newly refreshed window pick up a reference to its predecessor's child? Edit : Stressed the fact that it's an offline app. There's no server-side component. I should also add that the reason I need to refresh the parent is to check for application updates (changes in the cache manifest). Since the parent is the first page in the application that loads, it basically manages the caching (in fact as an aside, in Safari if this window is closed during any of the caching process the entire browser crashes). So "parent" is essentially "first page that the user loads". This means that I can't have the "parent" in a frame, as the topmost window would then manage the caching, and require the refresh in order to look for updates. Actually, it appears that I can use the frame method, as refreshing any of the pages in the application will trigger the update check. Cumbersome though.
