The description of the private variable, like here: /** * the name of this object. */ private String name; ... should not contain descriptions of its getters and setters. It should contain properties of this variable, invariants (like should never be null ), and similar. Edit: Ah, I misread your question. You asked why the description of the getters/setters should contain a description of the variable, not the other way around. They should not - there even does not have to exist such a variable. The getters and setters should describe the effect they are having, which may include the modification (or retrieval) of some abstract property of this object. That this property is implemented by a private variable is not relevant.
