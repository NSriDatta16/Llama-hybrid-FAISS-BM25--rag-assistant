How to model user behavior with a time series of discrete locations in continuous time?

I have a dataset that contains the sequential locations a user has visited, with start and end times. A small sample: id, starttime, endtime, location 1, 29/06/2023 07:00, 29/06/2023 07:33, A 2, 29/06/2023 07:45, 29/06/2023 09:50, B 3, 29/06/2023 10:00, 29/06/2023 17:02, A 4, 29/06/2023 17:30, 29/06/2023 19:33, C 5, 29/06/2023 19:40, 30/06/2023 08:40, A 6, 29/06/2023 08:44, 29/06/2023 12:50, B where A=home, B=work, C=gym The dataset contains around 1000 records and ten different locations. I want to extract a behavior pattern that best captures the user's movements, so that I can 1) understand the user's behavior and 2) predict their location. I see two options: Markov chain models. The states are the locations. Then I can calculate the transition matrix and predict what the next location might be, given the current location. However, I'm not sure if this works out with the continuous time aspect of my dataset. Also, I don't know if this will allow me to predict the user's location more steps into the future. E.g., predict its location next week Wednesday at 10am. More advanced models such as RNNs or LSTMs. With these I can make more temporal features (such as day of the week, hour of the day) so that I can capture a more advanced pattern. I am looking for validation on my thoughts above, or other suggestions on how to extract user behavior patterns from this dataset. Thanks in advance!
