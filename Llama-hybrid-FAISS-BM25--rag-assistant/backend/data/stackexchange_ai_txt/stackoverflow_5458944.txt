Linq to XML join and add data?

Given XML like this: 1 2 3 And an IEnumerable with this data: [0] = { Id = 1, Data = 429 } [1] = { Id = 2, Data = 271 } [2] = { Id = 3, Data = 328 } Is there an elegant way using LINQ to XML to join the IEnumerable data with the XML based on the common Id without individually querying for each element to link the data with? So the result would look like this: 1 429 2 271 3 328 The only thing I can come up with is something like this, but I was hoping there was a cleaner method: foreach(var d in MyIEnumerable) { XElement element = (from x in MyXDoc.Elements("Element") where x.Element("Id").Value == d.Id select x).Single(); element.Add(new XElement("Data", d.Data)); }
