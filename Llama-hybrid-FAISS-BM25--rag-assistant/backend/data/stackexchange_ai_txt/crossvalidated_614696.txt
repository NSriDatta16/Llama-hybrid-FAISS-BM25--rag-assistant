ACF and PACF vs Ljung Box test

I have a time series with realized sales prices on monthly basis in a large European city which comes as an index and I would like to do 1 period ahead forecasting. I have run ADF and KPSS for unit root / stationarity as well as Ljung-box for white noise, I get the following results: Detrended series: ADF p-value: 0.826796 KPSS p-value: Ljung-box p-value: all 12 lags has p-value of basically 0 1st difference series: ADF p-value: 0.001352 KPSS p-value: > 0.1 Ljung-box p-value: all 12 lags has p-value of basically 0 ACF shows lags 1,2,3,4 being significant PACF shows lags 1,2,3,4 being significant 2nd difference series: ADF p-value: 0.003257 KPSS p-value: > 0.1 Ljung-box p-value: all 12 lags has p-value of basically 0 ACF shows lags 1,2,4,5,6 being significant. PACF shows lags 1,2,3,6 being significant From what I can tell, this is just a plain non-stationary process, since the Ljung-box test rejects the p-values of all 12 lags. Am i doing something wrong? As I understand it, it should be possible to forecast a housing market index to some extend, I therefore thought that at least the housing index would be difference stationary. I might do something wrong, can anyone help me understand?
