Rails, How to determine if a Nested Record Set Exists

I have the following two models: Project, has_many ProjectParticipants ProjectParticipants, belongs_to Project How can I request to determine given these 5 ProjectParticipants, do they belong to a Project? Also, it should be strictly those 5, not more or less. Any thoughts on how to elegantly solve for this type of count?
