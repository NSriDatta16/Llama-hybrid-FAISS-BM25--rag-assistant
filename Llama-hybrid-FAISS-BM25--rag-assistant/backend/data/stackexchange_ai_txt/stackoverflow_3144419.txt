How do I remove a file from the FileList

I'm building a drag-and-drop-to-upload web application using HTML5, and I'm dropping the files onto a div and of course fetching the dataTransfer object, which gives me the FileList . Now I want to remove some of the files, but I don't know how, or if it's even possible. Preferably I'd like to just delete them from the FileList; I've got no use for them. But if that's not possible, should I instead write in checks in code that interacts with the FileList? That seems cumbersome.
