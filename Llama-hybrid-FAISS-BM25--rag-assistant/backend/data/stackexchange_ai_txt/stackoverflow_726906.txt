If you had warnings enabled, you would have known what the problem was. Run this: use strict; use warnings; my $val = chr(someFunction()); if($val == " ") { #do something } elsif($val == 0) { #do something else } sub someFunction { return 1; } And you get: C:>test.pl Argument " " isn't numeric in numeric eq (==) at C:\test.pl line 6. Argument "^A" isn't numeric in numeric eq (==) at C:\test.pl line 6. Adding use diagnostics gives us this additional explanation: (W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the message will identify which operator was so unfortunate. So, since we don't want numeric eq, we want string eq: eq . If you didn't know that already, you could look in perldoc perlop to read about Equality Operators . This is a classic example of how using the warnings and strict pragmas saves time.
