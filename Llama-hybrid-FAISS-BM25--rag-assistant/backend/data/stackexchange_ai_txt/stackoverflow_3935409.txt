There is no real set format for whois information. You will have to parse through the data and make guesses. I suggest looking for OrgName: , Organisation: , Organization: , and there are probably plenty of others. If you are just doing this for your own sites, I recommend using an Analytics package to do this work for you. Google Analytics is great but does not analyze your web server's logs. You would have to use something like Web Trends.
