I can tell you that Apple's Mobile Safari on the iPhone renders Stack Overflow perfectly , which I find rather amazing. This is a site for programmers, not average users, so we accepted a lot of JavaScript dependencies. I do wish more mobile devices had browsers as powerful as Mobile Safari. I hear good things about Opera Mini as well.
