Does taking Ln of dependent variable improve assumptions of a multiple regression?

I have run two multiple regressions in R, one with average abundance as dependent variable, and one with log avg abundance as dependent variable. With the given plots, can we say one of the two regression meets assumptions better than the other? Log of Avg Abundance is on the right. Assumptions of concern include linear relationship, normal distribution, independence and Homoscedasticity.
