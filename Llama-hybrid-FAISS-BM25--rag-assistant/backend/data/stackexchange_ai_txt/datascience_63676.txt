Face dataset organized by folder

I'm looking for a quite little/medium dataset (from 50MB to 500MB) that contains photos of famous people organized by folder. The tree structure have to bee something like this: ├── bfegan └── ... ├── chris └── ... ├── dhawley └── ... ├── graeme └──... ├── heather └──... Do you know some dataset that have this tree structure? I want to understand how my very basic neural network is able to detect face in a 'real-world' situation. https://github.com/alessiosavi/PyRecognizer
