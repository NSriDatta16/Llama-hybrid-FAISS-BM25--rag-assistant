In statistics bias is often used to refer to a statistics inability to measure the true population value of the statistic. This is usually shown analytically by computing the expected value of the statistic. If it is equal to the true population parameter, it is 'unbiased'. This is sometimes hard to do, so you can sometimes use simulation to look at the resultants distribution to see if it looks biased or not. Small biases will usually not matter. This also translates to machine learning. If your sampling method is bad, your statistics (means, correlations, models) will always be bad because your sample may not reflect the population. If you choose different models, most likely it will favor certain groups over others. Sometimes this is by optimization, but often it can just occur randomly. If you omit an important variable from a model, it may be biased towards one group, and if you then include the important group it may eliminate the bias to the group, or it may increase the bias toward the other group. You never really know how bias will work. You just need to be aware if it. Bias in statistics is not inherently right or wrong. But ethics is a different matter. That usually includes a statement of fairness and equity.
