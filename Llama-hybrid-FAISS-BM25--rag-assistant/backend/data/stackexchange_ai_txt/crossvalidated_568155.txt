Why $A_{t-1}$ in reinforcement learning history $H_t = O_1, R_1, A_1, ..., A_{t-1}, O_t, R_t$?

I learn with David Silver's slides reinforcement learning. His definition of the history $H_t$ is: $H_t = O_1, R_1, A_1, ..., A_{t-1}, O_t, R_t$ $O =$ observations $R =$ rewards $A =$ actions Why do we have $A_{t-1}$ and not $A_t$ ?
