The real question here is whether strict license enforcement is really needed. There are some cases where it is, for sure, but there are many cases when the license code is overkill. In the end, it's a trade-off: Pros of activation: Guarantee that your user installs the app once Knowledge of exactly how many copies are in the wild Pros of minimal licensing (serial number and basic, non-internet validation) User can quickly start using the app, even with no internet access Minimally annoying to users Doesn't inconvinience users who reformat and want to reinstall (if they're recovering from a crashed computer, license aggravation is the last thing they want) Users wary of activation may skip on your app altogether, making a non-activating app more appealing Even if your server goes down (or if you close down operations in the future), users can still use and reinstall your software No support time spent dealing with activation hassles Time spent developing an activation scheme can instead be devoted to making the app better, resulting in more sales The activation scheme has pluses for you, the developer, and is a headache for users, whereas lightweight licensing is much more appealing to users, and offers only minimal drawbacks to users. On of my favorite articles that weighs the two choices is Eric Sink's "Tenets of Transparency (point 4) . Though you may think you need activation, I encourage you to consider whether you really do. Do the added sales from strict enforcement outweigh the lost sales from all the downsides?
