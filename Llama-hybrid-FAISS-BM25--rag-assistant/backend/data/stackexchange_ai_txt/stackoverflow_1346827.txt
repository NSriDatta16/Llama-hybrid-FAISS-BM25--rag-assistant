Ha, i finally nailed down this problem.. After painful debugging for several hours andi steped in the code where the problem originates.. In simple terms "IE 6 crashes on multiple re-arrangements (like during on resize) of ui elements on a page load" Please go through the below paragraph if you wanted to know more about this. Our page is composed of multiple views of grids and other complex controls and maintained within several iframes under single master page(not aspx master page). And this one is responsible for rearranging (like re-render the positions during the resizes) the UI elemnts in a master layout level if there is any change in other frame sets. And in particular page we just made a change to accomodate more than one grid views, and the size of the view is hardcoded in javascript (this is done in body onload of the form) based on the screen resolution (this is the real culprit). this triggers the chain of obresize events and routed to the matser page. First resize is working fine and any other sequence of this event led the IE to crash. I know this is weird but this works perfectly after removing that manual size setting code...
