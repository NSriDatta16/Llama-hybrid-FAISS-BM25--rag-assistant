How do I build a WPF application where I can drag and drop a user control between windows?

I'm building a simple Todo List application where I want to be able to have multiple lists floating around my desktop that I can label and manage tasks in. The relevant UIElements in my app are: Window1 (Window) TodoList (User Control) TodoStackCard (User Control) Window1 looks like this: TodoList looks like this: I have multiple instances of these windows, and I want to be able to drag any of the controls between the windows. I have tried using a Thumb control and, while this works, it only allows me to drag a control around the containing canvas. How do I mimic the behaviour of, say, Windows Explorer, where I can drag a file outside of the application and onto another application, all the while seeing a ghosted representation of the file under the cursor. Can I accomplish this purely in C# and WPF? If so/if not, how?
