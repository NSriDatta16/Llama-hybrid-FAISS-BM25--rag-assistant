A lot of sites make people register for an account to vote so that their votes can be associated with that id and limited. Another option is to track IP addresses. While this is not perfect (IP address could be spoofed, people's IP addresses change occasionally, only 1 vote per NAT), it's better than nothing. A third option is to combine IP address with the user agent string of the browser, which still has some vulnerabilities, but gets closer.
