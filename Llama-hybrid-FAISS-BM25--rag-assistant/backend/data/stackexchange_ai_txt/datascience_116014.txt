What is the fastest way to detect periodicity in a binary time series?

Example, T = array([0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1]) ( T is almost a repeat of the array([0,1,1,1,0,0,1]) six times ) I say almost because it is not perfect. I have hundreds of thousands of binary-valued time series with lengths in the 500-50,000 range. I'd like to know the fastest way to detect periodicities within in the data. The periodicities can be local, for example, consistent in the first quarter of the signal but not the rest.
