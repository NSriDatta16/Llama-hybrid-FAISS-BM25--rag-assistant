R: Predictive Analytics on Time series

I have a data frame as follows: pressure datetime 4.848374 2016-04-12 10:04:00 4.683901 2016-04-12 10:04:32 5.237860 2016-04-12 10:13:20 I would like to apply time series modeling to predict future pressure. However, is it possible to do just using one feature and how?
