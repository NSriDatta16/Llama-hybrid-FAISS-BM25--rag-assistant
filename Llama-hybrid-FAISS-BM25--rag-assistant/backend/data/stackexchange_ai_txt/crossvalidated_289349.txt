Why do we study the noise sequence in time series analysis?

I am studying time series analysis for the very first time and I cannot seem to get my head around the fact that the entire time series analysis is about studying and modelling the behaviour of the noise component of the time series model. But why is it that we are so concerned about the noise? From what I could gather is that it's the only component of the time series model (with reference to the classical decomposition model) which is random and thus we should care and try to understand its behaviour. Also, noise is not synonymous to error. But then what does this exactly imply and how exactly is it useful for understanding the time series at hand? Any help is much appreciated!
