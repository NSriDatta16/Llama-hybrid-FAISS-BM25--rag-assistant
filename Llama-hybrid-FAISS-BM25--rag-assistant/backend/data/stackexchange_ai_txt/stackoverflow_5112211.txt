How to produce a unique string from a php array

I need a unique string from an array so that I can tell when it changes without measuring the inputs of that array. I'm trying to work out if it is computationally efficient to calculate a value rather than add code to look out for changes in the array. The array itself can have a variety of values and for future proofing I don't want to try and measure whether new values have been added to the array, I'd much rather just create some string or hash that will change if the array itself changes. So for example: $a = Array( 'var1' => 1, 'var2' => 2, 'var3' => 3, ); If I was to use md5(http_build_query($a)) perhaps with an added ksort to confirm that the order of the keys haven't changed this might then produce a unique string that I can use to compare against another run of the application to evaluate whether the array has changed. I'm looking for an alternate, possibly faster or more elegant solutions to this.
