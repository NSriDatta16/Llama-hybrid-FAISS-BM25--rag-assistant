Posterior Predictive Distribution as Expectation of Likelihood

Say we have a posterior predictive density: $$p(\tilde{y}|\mathbf{y}) = \int p(\tilde{y}|\theta)p(\theta|\mathbf{y})d\theta$$ In Hoff's Bayesian Statistical Methods text, he suggests that to obtain an approximation of $p(\tilde{y}|\mathbf{y})$ by sampling from posterior distribution, and computing $\frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^Sp(\tilde{y}|\theta^{(s)})$ . He justifies this by stating $p(\tilde{y} | \mathbf{y})$ is the posterior expectation of $p(\tilde{y}|\theta)$ , but I actually can't see the equivalence. How does one derive $p(\tilde{y} | \mathbf{y})$ from $p(\tilde{y}|\theta)$ ?
