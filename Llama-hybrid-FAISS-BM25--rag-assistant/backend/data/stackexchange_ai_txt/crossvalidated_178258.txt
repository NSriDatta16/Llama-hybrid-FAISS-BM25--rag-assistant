I started out on a Ph.D. track. About halfway through I realized that I wanted to be out working in industry more than I wanted to be working towards a Ph.D. But that's me.. A PhD is a bit of a grind, and as with everything else that's hard in life, keeping one's motivation throughout is a function of the intrinsic value you derive from the pursuit. In other words, if you're going to a do a Ph.D., don't do it because of where you think it will get you (although that certainly is a factor in the equation). Do it because you have a passion for learning about a field, for exploring it to the very edge of what we know about it, and then contributing new knowledge to it. In the end, that was what I thought was most rewarding about graduate work: to know something that few people, possibly no one else in the world knew, and then to contribute that knowledge to make the world a slightly better place. But to take the pragmatic view, yes, I believe a PhD in Data Science can indeed translate to a good position. Will it translate to a better position, than if you go spend that 5 years working? Probably not.. My hunch is that, six years out, you'll be making more income if you just go to work. If that is your measure of success... But there are some advantages of doing the graduate work: if you choose a topic that is bleeding edge, and you happen to pick a topic that's getting traction in 5 years (hard to predict...), and/or you make significant connections in your chosen industry, then, yes, there is a chance you'd be a little better off.
