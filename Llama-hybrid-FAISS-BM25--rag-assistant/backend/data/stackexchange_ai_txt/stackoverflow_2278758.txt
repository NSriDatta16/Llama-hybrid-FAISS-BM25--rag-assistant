When you upload an image via WordPress, put the text you want to show up as 'alt text' both in the "Title" field and in the "Alternative Text" fields. Then click the "Insert Into Post" button. Here's a video about uploading an image via the WordPress interface. In this video the "alternative text" field is called "caption". In newer versions of WordPress, "caption" and "alternative text" are separated out into different fields. The "caption" field shows up as a caption underneath your image; the 'alternative text' (or 'title') field is what shows up on hover/mouseover. Experiment to see what works best for you. http://wordpress.tv/2009/01/05/embedding-photos-video-audio-into-your-posts/ Best of luck!
