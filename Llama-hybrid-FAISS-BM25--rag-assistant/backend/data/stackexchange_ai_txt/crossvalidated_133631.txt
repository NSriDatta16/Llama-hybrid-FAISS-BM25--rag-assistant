This question gets asked a lot on this forum, so I would like to supplement @January's excellent answer with a bit more general considerations. In both principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA), we use the original variables $x_1, x_2, ... x_d$ to estimate several latent components (or latent variables) $z_1, z_2, ... z_k$. These latent components are given by PCA or FA component scores. Each original variable is a linear combination of these components with some weights: for example the first original variable $x_1$ might be well approximated by twice $z_1$ plus three times $z_2$, so that $x_1 \approx 2z_1 + 3z_2$. If the scores are standardized, then these weights ($2$ and $3$) are known as loadings. So, informally, one can say that $$\mathrm{Original\: variables} \approx \mathrm{Scores} \cdot \mathrm{Loadings}.$$ From here we can see that if we take one latent component, e.g. $z_1$, and flip the sign of its scores and of its loadings, then this will have no influence on the outcome (or interpretation), because $$-1\cdot -1 = 1.$$ The conclusion is that for each PCA or FA component, the sign of its scores and of its loadings is arbitrary and meaningless. It can be flipped, but only if the sign of both scores and loadings is reversed at the same time.
