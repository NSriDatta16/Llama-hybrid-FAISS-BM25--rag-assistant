Good venue to find online tutor in mathematical statistics?

I've been having trouble finding a qualified online tutor to work with me on NHST vs. Bayesian concepts and experimental design. I'm sure there must be people around & available with real chops in mathematical statistics who are also excellent teachers. So far, I haven't found an online-tutor service whose tutors are advanced enough to assist. To give a flavor of what I'm looking for, here are a couple of papers that I would love to discuss in detail with someone who really gets the concepts and conclusions and can effectively handle deep Q&A on both.. Too Big to Fail: Large Samples and the p-Value Problem Calibration of p Values for Testing Precise Null Hypotheses The Stack Exchange job postings all seem to be programming-oriented. I'm definitely looking for someone who is very proficient in R and/or MATLAB. A lot of my self-study is focused on developing simulations to get an empirical understanding of whatever concepts I'm working on. However, I'm wondering if most of the Stack Exchange job seekers mainly identify as programmers first? In this case, I might be better off looking somewhere else. I don't see any job postings here on Cross Validated. I've talked to the American Statistical Association about their JobWeb site, but they don't recommend it for me (it's geared towards full-time positions). According to ASA, the hourly pay I'm offering is upper-bracket. I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions or references.
