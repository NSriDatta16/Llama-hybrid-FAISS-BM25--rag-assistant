Since you are reviewing a paper you might suggest that the authors discuss the issue of model hierarchy and justify their departure from it. Here are some references: Nelder JA. The selection of terms in response-surface models—how strong is the weak-heredity principle? The American Statistician. 1998;52:315–8. http://www.jstor.org/pss/2685433 . Accessed 10 June 2010. Peixoto JL. Hierarchical variable selection in polynomial regression models. The American Statistician. 1987;41:311–3. http://www.jstor.org/pss/2684752 . Accessed 10 June 2010. Peixoto JL. A property of well-formulated polynomial regression models. The American Statistician. 1990;44:26–30. http://www.jstor.org/pss/2684952 . Accessed 10 June 2010. I usually follow hierarchy but depart from it in some situations. For example, if you are testing tire wear versus mileage at several different speeds, your model might look like: tread depth = intercept + mileage + mileage*speed but it would not make physical sense to include a main effect of speed because the tire does not know what the speed will be at zero miles. (On the other hand, you might still want to test for a speed effect because it might indicate that "break-in" effects differ at different speeds. On the other other hand, an even better way to handle break-in would be to get data at zero and at very low mileage and then test for non-linearity. Note that removing the intercept term can be thought of as a special case of violating hierarchy.) I'll also reiterate what someone said above because it's very important: The authors need to make sure they know whether their software is centering the data. The tire model above becomes physically nonsensical if the software replaces mileage with (mileage - mean of mileage). The same sorts of things are relevant in pharmaceutical stability studies (mentioned tangentially in "Stability Models for Sequential Storage", Emil M. Friedman and Sam C. Shum, AAPS PharmSciTech, Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2011, DOI: 10.1208/s12249-010-9558-x).
