back propagation through time derivation issue

I read several posts about BPTT for RNN, but I am actually a bit confused about one step in the derivation. Given $$h_t=f(b+Wh_{t-1}+Ux_t)$$ when we compute $\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial W}$ , does anyone know why is it simply $$\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial W}=\frac{\partial h_{t}}{\partial h_{t-1}}\frac{\partial h_{t-1}}{\partial W}$$ not $$\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial W}=\frac{\partial h_{t}}{\partial h_{t-1}}\frac{\partial h_{t-1}}{\partial W}+\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial f}h_{t-1}$$ ? What I mean is, since both $W$ and $h_{t-1}$ depends on $W$ , why is the second term in the expression above missing? Thank you!
