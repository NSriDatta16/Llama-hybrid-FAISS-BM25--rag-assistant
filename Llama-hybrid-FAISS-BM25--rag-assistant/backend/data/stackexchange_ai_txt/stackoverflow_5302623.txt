What are the pros and cons of adding and elements using JavaScript?

Recently I saw some HTML with only a single element in its ... Example This script.js then adds any other necessary elements and elements to the document using document.write(...) : (or it could use document.createElement(...) etc) document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" ") document.write(" ") Note that there is a plain.css CSS file in the document and script.js just adds any and all CSS and JavaScript which would be used by a JS-enabled user agent. What are some of the pros and cons of this technique?
