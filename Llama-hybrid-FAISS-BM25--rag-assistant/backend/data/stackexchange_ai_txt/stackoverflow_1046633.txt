You can't do that the way you are trying. The compiler is allowed to pad any and all members of the struct. I do not believe it is allowed to reorder the fields. Most compilers have an attribute that can be applied to the struct to pack it (ie to turn it into a collection of tightly packed storage with no padding), but the downside is that this generally affects performance. The packed flag will probably allow you to use the struct the way you want, but it may not be portable across various platforms. Padding is designed to make field access as efficient as possible on the target architecture. It's best not to fight it unless you have to (ie, the struct goes to a disk or over a network.)
