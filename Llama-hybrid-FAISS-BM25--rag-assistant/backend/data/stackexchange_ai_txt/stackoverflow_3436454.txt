This is a classic example of a problem that is best solved using and overriding the identity rule : When this transformation is applied on this XML document (based on the provided XML document with added attributes and owner details): unknown unstructured xml John Smith XSLT programmer The wanted result is produced : unknown unstructured xml John Smith XSLT programmer Do note : The identity template copies every node in the document "as-is" in a recursive fashion. We only override the identity template for elements that we want to be processed in another way . Any template, whose match pattern is more specific than that of the identity template, overrides it -- the XSLT processor always chooses the most specific matching template for a node. Using and overriding the identity rule is the most fundamental , the most powerful, the most general and most elegant XSLT design pattern . It is used exclusively in almost all XSLT transformations: for deleting/renaming/modifying/adding specific nodes and keeping all other nodes intact. The OP has suggested in a comment that this solution doesn't allow parameters to be passed. This is not true . Any template (including the identity rule) can be written to have parameters -- when this is needed. In this particular case it is not necessary to pass parameters via templates. The template matching owner doesn't need to call another template -- all the owner - specific processing can be done here.
