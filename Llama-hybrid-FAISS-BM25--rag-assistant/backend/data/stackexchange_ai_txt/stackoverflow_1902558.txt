Practical limits of SQL-Server database

I am setting up a database that I anticipate will be quite large, used for calculations and data storage. It will be one table with maybe 10 fields, containing one primary key and two foreign keys to itself. I anticipate there will be about a billion records added daily. Each record should be quite small, and I will primarily be doing inserts. With each insert I will need to do a simple update on one or two fields of a connected record. All queries should be relatively simple. At what size will I start running into performance problems with sql-server? I've seen mention of vldb systems, but also heard they may be a real pain. Is there a threshold where I should start looking at that? Is there a better db than sql-server that is designed for this sort of thing?
