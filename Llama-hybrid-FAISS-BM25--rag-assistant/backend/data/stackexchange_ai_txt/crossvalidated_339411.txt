I appreciate all contributed discussions/comments on the subject of Time series vs Stochastic process. Here is my understanding of the difference: Time series is a phenomenon observed, recorded as a series of numbers that is indexed with the time at observation; it is most likely a series of observations of a real life phenomenon such as stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange. On the other hand, stochastic process is as always understood as a mathematical representation (not a production) of the time-series.
