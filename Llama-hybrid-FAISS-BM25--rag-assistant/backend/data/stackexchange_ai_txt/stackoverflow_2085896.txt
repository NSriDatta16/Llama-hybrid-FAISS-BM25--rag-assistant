sorting complex JSON object

Refering to earlier questions about referencing elements of and sorting a JSON (javascript) array. See refer to an element of JSON (Javascript) object Sorting an array of JavaScript objects Is it possible to sort one branch of a more complex javascript array, such as sorting by price in the example below? var homes = { "Agents" : [ { "name" : "Bob Barker" }, { "name" : "Mona Mayflower" } ] , "Listings" : [ { "h_id": "3", "city": "Dallas", "state": "TX", "zip": "75201", "price": "162500" }, { "h_id": "4", "city": "Bevery Hills", "state": "CA", "zip": "90210", "price": "319250" }, { "h_id": "5", "city": "New York", "state": "NY", "zip": "00010", "price": "962500" } ] } thanks you all your help!!! EDIT Sorry for the confusion. I meant Javascript as tag. (This should have been apparent by rest of question) I got the sort working, just having trouble iterating through the array. // before sort alert(homes.Listings[0].price); // sort homes.Listings.sort(sort_by('price', false, parseInt)); // after sort works: alert(homes.Listings[0].price); // iteration does not work "$ is not defined" $.each(homes.Listings, function(i, thisHome) { alert(thisHome.price); });
