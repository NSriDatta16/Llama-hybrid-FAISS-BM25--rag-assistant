Is there some way to speed up recursion by remembering child nodes?

For example, Look at the code that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number: fib(int n) { if(n==0 || n==1) return 1; return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); } The problem with this code is that it will generate stack overflow error for any number greater than 15 (in most computers). Assume that we are calculating fib(10). In this process, say fib(5) is calculated a lot of times. Is there some way to store this in memory for fast retrieval and thereby increase the speed of recursion? I am looking for a generic technique that can be used in almost all problems.
