shift/reduce conflict with SableCC

I'm at my first experience with SableCC and grammar definition. I have the following grammar (a part of it): query = {atop} attroperator | {query_par} l_par query r_par | {query_and} [q1]:query logic_and [q2]:query | {query_or} [q1]:query logic_or [q2]:query | {query_not} logic_not query ; I have the following errors: shift/reduce conflict in state [stack: PCommand TLogicNot PQuery *] on TRPar in { [ PQuery = PQuery * TRPar ] (shift), [ PQuery = TLogicNot PQuery * ] followed by TRPar (reduce) } shift/reduce conflict in state [stack: PCommand TLogicNot PQuery *] on TLogicAnd in { [ PQuery = PQuery * TLogicAnd PQuery ] (shift), [ PQuery = TLogicNot PQuery * ] followed by TLogicAnd (reduce) } shift/reduce conflict in state [stack: PCommand TLogicNot PQuery *] on TLogicOr in { [ PQuery = PQuery * TLogicOr PQuery ] (shift), [ PQuery = TLogicNot PQuery * ] followed by TLogicOr (reduce) } I solved them by adding l_par and r_par to all alternatives which, by the way, should increase readability but is there a way to do it in an elegant manner? Thanks.
