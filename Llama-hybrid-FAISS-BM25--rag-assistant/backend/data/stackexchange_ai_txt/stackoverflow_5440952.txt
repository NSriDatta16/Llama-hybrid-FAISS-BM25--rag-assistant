Python CGI Script Not Executing

Just doing a basic python project with HTML file, i came across a tutorial which gave an idea about how i can execute the code, here is the HTML code Admin Login Login Here Administration Login User Name Password &nbsp;__&nbsp; and the python code.. #!/usr/bin/python import cgi import cgitb; cgitb.enable() # get the info from the html form form = cgi.FieldStorage() #set up the html stuff reshtml = """Content-Type: text/html\n Security Precaution """ print reshtml User = form['UserName'].value Pass = form['PassWord'].value if User == 'Myusername' and Pass == 'MyPasword': print ' Welcome' print 'Hello ' print ' ' else: print 'Sorry, incorrect user name or password' print ' ' print ' ' The problem is, when i submit the username and password, it just shows the whole code back on the browser and not the required Welcome message :(. I use Fedora13 .. can anyone tell me what is going wrong? I even changed the permissions of the file(s).
