Usability: Where do users focus their initial attention on in new interfaces?

I know there was a study somewhere that showed which places users focused on initially when presented with new interfaces, but I can't remember that study, nor remember exactly what behaviors could be assumed for most users of your program. From what I do remember, it came down that users often shoot towards the corners of a software application, looking for context to help them make their decisions on how to use the interface, but I don't know that as a hard fact, and would like to find some resource that outlines some of these common usability rules. Does anyone know the study I'm talking about, or could cite any sources that describe something similar to the above?
