Newbie Question about Web Content Display and Templates

Im using Liferay Portal v5.2.3 Community Edition. I have the following two questions which i hope someone would be kind enough to answer. 1.) I want to add some content to the About Us Page of my intranet portal. I added Web Content Display portlet, and maximized the screen after adding content. But accessing the portal, it always appears minimized. Any way to solve this issue ? 2.) When i try to add a template after creating a structure, i have to select the script file to be used. I found some vm files for 7Cogs portal,but couldnt find any for the organization i created . Where are these vm or css files located and which one to use ? Please Help. Thank You.
