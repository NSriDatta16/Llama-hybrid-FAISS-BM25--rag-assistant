In-memory databases take millisecond database access time and turn them into microsecond access time. Is this an automated trading system or 911 dispatch or aviation traffic control system? If not you'd be hard pressed to show a requirement for microsecond access times. Walter has it correct when he said "how slow is too slow?" Define your requirements clearly, is this an internal or external SLA? Do you have requirements? or does this just 'feel' too slow. Learn to read an execution plan and examine the plan for your slow query. Is there a cardinality estimate that way off? Does it anticipate 1 row when you know there are 100k rows? Is it doing a full table scan on a table you expect 1 row from? If the query looks as efficient as it can be, trace it... see if you can identify if there are any time sinks that you're not expecting. Is it fine when done solo, but poor performing under load? Honestly, 10 tables with not a lot of data to begin with really shouldn't be super slow. I think Gilbert is overestimating your problem. With no more than 1M records, a full dimensional model seems overkill. For the tone of your question it sounds like you're really just trying to speed up a query or three - not creating the start of an entire BI platform. If that's the case, look back at the explain plan, see if you can identify major amounts of work that could be reduced via the pre-calculation of some joins (denormalization), build that new materialize view... try the query, if no improvement then drop that and try something else... do not keep building on unsuccessful attempts. Now I see the travel industry comment So you have 2 classes of room, 30 doubles and 20 singles, and you have 80 seats on the plane. But the doubles can add an extra bed so you might run out of seats before you run out of rooms. Rooms Remaining --------------- 5 Single Remain 10 Doubles Remain Seats Remaining --------------- 8 Plane seats Since there's one plane and 2 room types, you'll just Cartesian those together. Package Type Rooms Seats Packages Available ------------ ------ ----- ------------------ Single 5 8 5 Double 10 8 8 Notice the Packages available is a simple calculation LOWEST(Rooms, Seats) In your comment you said even if rooms are available, the package is officially sold out. Package Type Rooms Seats Packages Available ------------ ------ ----- ------------------ Single 5 0 0 Double 0 0 0 So here's that case... you've filled the double rooms and 5 of them are triples... so the plane is full and there are 5 extra single rooms. But our LOWEST calculation does the work to show there are no Single Packages available. am I close?
