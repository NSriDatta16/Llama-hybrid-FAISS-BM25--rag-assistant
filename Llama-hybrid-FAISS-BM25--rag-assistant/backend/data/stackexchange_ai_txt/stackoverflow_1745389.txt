Checking querystring values in PHP

http://localhost/?area=characters&name=Michal+Stroganof $result = mysql_query("SELECT * from players WHERE name = '$_GET[name]'"); while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { echo "Name: " .$row['name']. " "; echo "Level: " .$row['level']. " "; } This is all code of my characters.php If the get variable "name" is not included in the URL i want to show a search form that searches the table players. How would I do this?
