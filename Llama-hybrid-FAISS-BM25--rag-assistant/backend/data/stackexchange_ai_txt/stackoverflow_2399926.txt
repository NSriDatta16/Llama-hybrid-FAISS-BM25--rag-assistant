Yes, I have implemented several system with GSM modems. You are seeing typical transmit rates for a GSM modem. 10-15 per minute is a rule of thumb I use. Consider adding additional modems to the pool and overlapping. IF you can do SMS over GPRS you can get higher rates. But the implementations I've seen simply pool 3-5 modems in a single gateway. Any higher and you probably need to use an SMPP / SMSC link or a aggregator like Clickatel. The downside to the aggregators is coverage. You can't get delivery to some numbers, which is why I use GSM modems on ATT's network.
