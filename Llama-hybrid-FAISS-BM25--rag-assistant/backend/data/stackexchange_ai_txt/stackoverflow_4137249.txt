Better method to drill through array than nested loop?

I have a menu structure (Drupal) that contains elements representing a menu link. If the menu has a child menu (is the parent of a submenu) it has an array key 'below' with a menu item inside with the same structure. In theory this menu could be infinitely deep and the only way that I know how to go through each level is by create a new loop on the item if 'below' has anything in it. I know there has to be a more elegant and dynamic way to deal with this. I'm not really looking for a Drupal specific answer as this problem has come up before and I've just hacked it together. Thanks for reading!
