how can autoencoder reduce dimensionality?

I can't understand how is dimensionality reduction achieved in autoencoder since it learns to compress data from the input layer into a short code, and then uncompress that code into the original data I can' t see where is the reduction: the imput and the putput data have the same dimensionality?
