There is a property for the texture processor specifying the color for background transparency. Select your sprite in the solution explorer (it should be in your content project), then look up the property inspector. You should see 'Content Processor: Texture - XNA Framework'. Expand that section, change Color Key Color as needed. Default value is magenta/bright pink (0xFF00FF).
