Yes, but you will have to make sure that it's strong-named and can be placed into the server's Global Assembly Cache as that is where all web parts are deployed to. Additionally, if it's not a visual web part , you'll have to create it dynamically in code instead of having a drag and drop surface like a normal ASP.NET application. Generally speaking, it's not too much different than using a server control in a normal ASP.NET application. EDIT: To add a custom server control to your application, you can right click inside the toolbox and select "Choose Items...". You can then browse to your custom assembly containing the server control and click OK. After that, it will appear in your toolbox and you can just drag and drop it onto your visual ascx web part.
