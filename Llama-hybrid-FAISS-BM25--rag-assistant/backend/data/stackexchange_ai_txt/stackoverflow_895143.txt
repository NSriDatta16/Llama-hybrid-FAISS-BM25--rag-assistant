You should try to find a way to organize the alerts as a tree and be able to quickly decide what alerts can be triggered by an update. For example let's assume that the alert is the level of a certain indicator. Said indicator can have a range of 0, n. I would groups the clients who want to be notified of the level of the said indicator in a sort of a binary tree. That way you can scale it properly (you can actually implement a subtree as a process on a different machine) and the number of matches required to find the proper subset of clients will always be logarithmic.
