One thing you might want to consider: if you keep your test code package structure the same as your main code package structure---even using different physical directories as you are currently doing---your test classes will be in the same logical package as your main classes. This means they gain access to default/protected members in the tested classes, which is often helpful. You'd have to get rid of the ComplexClass package in the test code to make that happen. Another thing to consider: (I'll assuming you're testing with JUnit) Test classes are classes , so you can organize and structure them using inheritance. If you have 3 different points of view, maybe extract a base class which contains common functionality, this will make your tests easier to maintain in the long run, especially as more "points of view" are discovered. Separating the source and test code as you are already doing is a great idea, it gives you more options for building and maintains a logical grouping which makes maintenance more straightforward.
