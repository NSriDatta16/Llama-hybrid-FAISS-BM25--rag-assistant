Passing special chars to exe through command prompt

I want to pass mix of most of all special chars a one command line arguments to an exe. The exe is invoked by bat file. syntax is something like this: sample.bat file set arg1="newData!@#$%%^& ()( * )://///;> MyPath="D:\MyExeLocation" %MyPath%\MyExe.exe %arg1% Above one is working but it's not working if i add double quote (") in the arg1 string. would you please tell me how to escape it. I tried escaping it by ^, " and \ also. it's not working. if i do with \, string includes \ as well along with double quote. other two ^ and " are not working throwing some error Ultimately i want to pass any special chars in arg1. Would you please give me your suggestions??? Advance Thanks Robert.
