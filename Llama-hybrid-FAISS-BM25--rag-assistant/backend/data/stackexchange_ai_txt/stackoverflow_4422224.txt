I got an answer from Douglas on Apple's cocoa-dev mailing list: http://lists.apple.com/archives/Cocoa-dev/2010/Dec/msg00347.html I'll copy what he wrote here: Any of the standard paragraph separators can be used (\n, \r, \r\n, Unicode paragraph separator). Use the Unicode line separator character to start a new line without a paragraph break. It is best to apply a paragraph style to an entire paragraph; if that is not done, then the paragraph style attribute will be automatically fixed at attribute fixing time so that it is constant over each paragraph range, because that is needed at layout time.
