Is the stationary distribution in a Markov chain just an average or will this probability distribution actually be reached?

So I know that a connected Markov chain has a stationary distribution $\pi$ that satisfies $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} a_t = \pi,$$ where $a_t$ is the average probability distribution at time $t$ . So this average converges to our stationary distribution. However, does that mean that $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} p_t = \pi$ (where $p_t$ is the probability vector of where the Markov chain is after $t$ steps)? Just going off of the average definition, couldn't it be that the Markov chain bounces around two or more different probability distributions, so that the average is still $\pi$ , but $\pi$ itself is never a probability distribution for the states of the Markov chain? For example, say we have 3 states and $\pi = (0.2, 0.3, 0.5)$ , then $p_{(1)} = (0.1, 0.2, 0.7)$ and $p_{(2)} = (0.3, 0.4, 0.3)$ . Say for even $i$ , $p_i = p_{(1)}$ , and for uneven $i$ , $p_i = p_{(1)}$ , which means that the distribution of the process oscillates between $p_{(1)}$ and $p_{(2)}$ . So the average $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} a_t$ is indeed $\pi$ , but not $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} p_t = \pi$ , since $p_t$ always switches between $p_{(1)}$ and $p_{(2)}$ . This is obviously a simple example, but I hope you understand my general question.
