Could someone please offer me some guidance on some kind of particular, SPECIFIC project that I could attemp, to "get my feet wet, so to speak"

I am COMPLETELY new to the field of Data Science, mainly because every employer I have worked for, simply COULDN'T sell any customers anything that would use techniques learned in this field. Of particular interest to me is machine learning/Predictive Analysis. I have attempted many "test projects" myself, but I seem to NEED some sort of outside "catalyst" to tell me a specific goal, and a specific set of guidelines, when I am trying to learn something. Otherwise, I tend to lose focus, and jump from one interesting topic to the next, without ever gaining any experience. Thank you!!
