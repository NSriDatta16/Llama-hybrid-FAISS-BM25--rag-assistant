A credit card transaction benefits the merchant (seller) and the credit card provider. Credit card provider takes a fees which is close to 1% to 3% for each transaction generally (numbers are indicative, can vary across regions, type of merchants etc.). This feesh can be considered as profit in your case, considering you are modelling this for credit card providers. Let this fees be $r$ . Also assume that all fraud transactions are realized by credit card provider only. Expected Profit on a non-fraud transaction = $Amount * r -$ (average cost per transaction, but lets ignore this as of now) Expected loss for a fraud transaction = $Amount$ Net expected profit for any transaction = $P(non fraud) * r * Amount - P(fraud) * Amount$ . So ideally you should rank your transactions as per this equation. This will bring big amount transactions to top even if their probability of fraud is little lower, and will bring transactions with very high probability of fraud to top as well if transaction amount is not very low. Let us know if you want to model for the merchant (seller), and I will try to answer for that as well. Expected loss is just the negative of expected profit.
