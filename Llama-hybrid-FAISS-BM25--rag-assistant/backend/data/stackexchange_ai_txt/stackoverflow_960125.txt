Python App Engine projects with sophisticated user-role-permission structures

In followup to an earlier question , I'd be interested to know whether anyone can recommend some open-source Python-based Google App Engine projects with complex user-role-permission models to consult as a reference. A link to the code would be nice. In my own project, I'd like to add a layer of organizations in addition to the usual roles and permissions, e.g., users are members of one ore more organizations, and their roles are relative to the organizations. A lot like an issue tracker where there is a many-to-many relationship between users and projects.
