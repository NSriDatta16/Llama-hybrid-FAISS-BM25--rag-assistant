Are real analysis and measure theory essential to learn for data science?

Some people say data scientists don't necessarily need to know real analysis and measure theory, but for others, real analysis and measure theory are very important for the undersdanding of kernel methods, stochastic processes etc. Should I learn real analysis and measure theory? I don't want to be too academic
