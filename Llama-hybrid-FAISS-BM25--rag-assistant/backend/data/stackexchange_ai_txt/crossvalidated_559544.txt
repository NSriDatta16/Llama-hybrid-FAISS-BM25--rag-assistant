A few years late to the party, but some people might still find this useful: In short, you can define a pdf (or pmf) as follows: $$P(X=k) = (1-p)\cdot \mathbb{1}_{\{\infty\}}(k) + p\cdot \mathbb{1}_{\geq 0}(k)\cdot Q(k)$$ where $Q$ is a time-to-event-distribution (e.g. the exponential distribution for continuous time or the geometric distribution for discrete time) and $p$ is the conversion probability, i.e. the probability that the user converts at all (at any point in the future). The random variable $X$ define the time-lag to conversion with $X=\infty$ if there is no conversion. The slightly more tricky part is then the censoring aspect, which however is a standard problem in survival analysis as @Cam.Davidson.Pilon pointed out. To define a full Bayesian model (e.g. in Stan or PyMC) you need to write out the log-likelihood, which in this case also contains the complementary CDF (aka ccdf) of the variable $X$ . I wrote a blog post precisely about the question you are asking: here that also links to a Stan model I wrote for this. Hope this is helpful.
