Maybe I'm a little bit late with answer, but, anyway, maybe somebody will find it useful. OK, I have also spent a day trying to figure out why my custom class for scrollable view is working 3 times and refuse at the 4-th time... I found that the problem has quite the same attributes as yours: nested NSString objects unexpectedly disappear. Though pointers point to the same address in memory, memory is already filled with quite arbitrary objects instead my NSString s. And I paid attention that I created these NSString s using the following class method: + (id)stringWithContentsOfFile:(NSString *)path encoding:(NSStringEncoding)enc error:(NSError **)error So, I'm not the owner of these NSString s. And I assumed that to be the owner can be a solution, so I created my NSString s through alloc and - (id)initWithContentsOfFile:(NSString *)path encoding:(NSStringEncoding)enc error:(NSError **)error instance method. App was repaired!
