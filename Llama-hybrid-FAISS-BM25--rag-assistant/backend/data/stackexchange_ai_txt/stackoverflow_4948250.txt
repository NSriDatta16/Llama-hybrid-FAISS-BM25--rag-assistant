The answer really depends on your web host. And what they support. That probably depends on your transaction volume and so on. Since you are using Monotouch I'm going to assume you are comfortable in .net/c# world. I would look at a WCF web service written in c#. This in turn would use SQL server for storage. Of course you could just go straight to a SQL server stored procedure. sqlREST looks interesting but at a glance it looks like you need to be running the Appache + Tomcat stack for that to work. if you just want the lowest possible bar to get it working then I agree with the other poster... ASP.NET + SQL server would get it done too.
