SVN - Get all commit messages for a file?

Is there a way to get a nice list of all commit messages sorted by file? Something like this (as you can see, I don't want the messages specific to a certain file, just show messages for the entire commit if the file was part of the commit, repeats ok): -- index.php 2010-01-02 03:04:05 * added new paragraph 2010-01-01 03:04:05 * moved header out of index.php into header.php * header.php initial check-in 2009-12-31 03:04:05 * index.php initial check-in -- header.php 2010-01-03 03:04:05 * added new meta tags 2010-01-01 03:04:05 * moved header out of index.php into header.php * header.php initial check-in Additional information: svn log filename does something similar, but I want it to do this: get a list of files that have changed between yyyy-mm-dd (r2) and yyyy-mm-dd (r4) (i.e. svn log -q -v -r 2:4 > changedfiles.txt strip extraneous crap from changedfiles.txt svn log each file in that list, as in: svn log > combinedlog.txt (just pseudocode, i know svn log takes arguments not input, but can't be bothered to write it out)
