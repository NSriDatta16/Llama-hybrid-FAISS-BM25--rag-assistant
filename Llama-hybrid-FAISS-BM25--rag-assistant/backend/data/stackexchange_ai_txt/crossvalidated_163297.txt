How to get probability from the confidence score in SVM

In liblinear library we can get confidence score (the distance between decision hyperplane) in SVM solver for a binary classification problem, but if i want a probability value for membership in any class, which is not directly available in SVM in liblinear, is there any way to transform the confidence score into probability value? My question is just: Can we get a probability value in SVM rather than just 0-1 value? The platt scaling can do this in libsvm, but the platt scaling suffers theoretical issues, is there other way?because I want to calculate the AUC for measuring SVM's classifying performance.
