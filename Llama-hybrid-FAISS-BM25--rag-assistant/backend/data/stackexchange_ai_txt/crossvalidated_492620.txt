Interpretation of logistic regression parameters and use of deviance test for model comparison?

Question 1 How do I interpret regression parameters in a logistic regression model if all my explanatory variables are not binary? For example: I have two variables height (continuous) and color (takes on int values of 0, 1, and 2) where I use these 2 variables to model a binary response variable (ex. 1: at least one girlfriend and 0: no girlfriend). How would I interpret beta_height in terms of log-odds? Question 2 Say again I want to model something similar, but now I want to change the variable color into multiple binary values (ie. factor(color) in R code). Now I have 4 regression parameters (beta_0, beta_height, beta_color1, beta_color2). How could I now interpret beta_height? Question 3 How would I could I use a deviance test (residual deviance in R) to compare the model from question 1 and question 2 to see which model is "better"? Like how could I potentially set up the hypothesis testing here?
