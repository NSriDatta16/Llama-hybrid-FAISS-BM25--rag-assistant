Is that possible to estimate the VC dimension for GBM (or more specific XGBoost)?

Is there any simple way to estimate the VC dimension for GBM? Or, for more specific implementation XGBoost? XGBoost usually has large variability when training on a dataset with less than 500 samples more than 1000 features. Is there any way to estimate the model complexity of XGBoost with certain hyperparameters?
