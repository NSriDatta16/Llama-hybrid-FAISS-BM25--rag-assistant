In large projects you differentiate between static and dynamic files, that is, files, that are parsed and executed like PHP and files, that are sent to the client as they are. Many PHP frameworks suggest a variation of the following: index.php # single starting point admin.php # *or* admin/index.php # admin area, separated from frontend lib/ # contains executables, that are not directly called static/ # contains CSS, JS, images and so on, that come from developers assets/ # static content, that is uploaded by the user This approach has several benefits. First, you don't mix up user uploads with your stylesheets. Then, you can easily configure your web server to send appropriate expire and Caching headers with stuff found in static ans assets . The lib folder is forbidden for clients in some way, so you don't send code to the client, that is only for embedding. After all, however, it's a matter of what you like and what you need.
