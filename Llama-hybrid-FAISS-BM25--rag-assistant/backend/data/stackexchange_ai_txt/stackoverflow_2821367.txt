iPhone niche applications

we want to develop a small utility for the iPhone for a very small set of users... We're thinking about developing it with PhoneGap/html/javascript as we want to make it available under other mobile platforms. Given that it's only for a small number of users within a particular organisation, would we submit that to AppStore? Is App Store meant for general public applications? Any recommendations on how to approach this? thanks
