I'm not sure what value is added by Timeframe - it seems like an unnecessary complication, but that could be something I'm failing to understand ;-) Can a Timeframe have more than one OHLCV? If not, then I'd suggest they be merged. I would note also that stock tickers change from time to time for any number of reasons. It's not a frequent event, but it happens. If you're thinking about working with your data as time series, you should be aware of the issue so that you can handle it when it comes, if not before. If you're not tracking stocks (you may be working on a futures app, say) then this advice may be taken with the appropriate amount of salt. Again mostly relevant to stocks, splits have been mentioned elsewhere and you may want to consider dividends - a stock's price will typically fall by the dividend amount (or more accurately the present value thereof) on the ex-dividend date, which may be misinterpreted if you don't know a confirmed future cash flow was the reason. Rights issues can be fun, too. If you're planning on looking at series of data for a particular symbol, I'd suggest looking into what sort of performance you're going to get. At the very least, make sure you have an appropriate index in place.
