In order to construct the ROC curve, you need to have the target variables and a ranking of your predictions from least likely to be the target class to most likely. ROC does not need to cut base don probabilities, but it does need some ranking of the data. So for the logistic regression, this is the estimated probability, where you are changing the probability cutoffs to get the curve. For methods that do not produce probability, the ranking can be achieved based on other ways, for example, how close or far away from a decision boundary the specific data point is, where predictions closer to the boundary are considered less likely. In the case of a random forest, you can produce the ranking based on the proportion of trees that are predicting the target class. If a classifier cannot produce a ranking, for example, because the implementation can just return categorical prediction, then ROC curve cannot be meaningfully constructed, it will just be a point. And of course, if a method is not predicting the target class whatsoever, e.g., if it's an unsupervised method, then ROC curve is not a meaningful concept. For KNN, datapoints can be ranked for example by what proportion of the neighbors is of the target class, 10/10 is ranked higher than 6/10. But if you have a small k, the curve will not have many points. You can also try to calculate some average distance to create less discrete rankings and break ties, but maybe at this point, it might be better just to use some other method.
