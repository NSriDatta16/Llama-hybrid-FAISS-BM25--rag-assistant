Yes you can. .Net has support for named groups. So for (? group)(?'second'group) , the returned Match object will support named retrieval like this. You can build youself a dictionary from this object or directly pass the Match object var match = Regex.Match("subject", "regex"); var matchedText = match.Groups("first") See Named Groups in .Net and Regex support in .Net I think writing a Record Record.Parse(namedValueCollection) would be a way to do it You write code... You learn. I find the reverse direction a bit disorienting.. Moving from dynamic to static should be relatively easier... just that you might have to write relatively more code for some routine tasks like iteration or map or select etc.
