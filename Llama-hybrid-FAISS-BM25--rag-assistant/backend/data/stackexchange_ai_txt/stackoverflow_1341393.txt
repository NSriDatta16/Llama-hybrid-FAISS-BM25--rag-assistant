SQL Server heap v.s. clustered index

I am using SQL Server 2008. I know if a table has no clustered index, then it is called heap, or else the storage model is called clustered index (B-Tree). I want to learn more about what exactly means heap storage, what it looks like and whether it is organized as "heap" data structure (e.g. minimal heap, maximum heap). Any recommended readings? I want to more a bit more internals, but not too deep. :-) thanks in advance, George
