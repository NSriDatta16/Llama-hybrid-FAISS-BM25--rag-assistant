While I agree with @ocdecio, I would also observe that a database that is normalized will generally have fewer columns per table and more tables than one that is not, given the same data storage requirements. Similar to code smells a database smell would be relatively few tables given a reasonably large application. This would be a hint that perhaps your data is not in normal form. Applying normalization rules, where appropriate, would alleviate this "smell".
