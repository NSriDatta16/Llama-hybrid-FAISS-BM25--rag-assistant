Scores in logistic regression

I understand well that logistic regression is a well defined functions to fit the input variables to the probability bias of a Bernouili trial . However, I do not understand the origin of the linear assumption for modelling the log odd-ratio : $$ \ell = \log_b \frac{p}{1-p} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 $$ Are there any theoretical reasons behind the use of this heuristic to define the link function? Are there canonical ways to transform the input to justify that assumption?
