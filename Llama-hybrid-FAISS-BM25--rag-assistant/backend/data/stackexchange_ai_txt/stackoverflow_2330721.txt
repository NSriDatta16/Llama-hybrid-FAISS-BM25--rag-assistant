Jquery - Finding what element $(this) is

Possible Duplicate: Can jQuery provide the tag name? Hi! This question is so basic i am ashamed asking but i tried to find the answer for 30 minutes without any result. How do i find out what kind of element has been clicked in the code below. $('*').click(function (event) { var this_element = $(this).???; return false; }) What i am looking for is to have the this_element variable set to 'a' if it's a link, 'p' if it's a paragraph 'div' if... Thanks!
