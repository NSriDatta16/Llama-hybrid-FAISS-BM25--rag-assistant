The Droid X ships with USB mode set to "PC Mode" by default. It needs to be set to "USB Mass Storage" mode. To do this, touch the USB icon in the status bar and drag it down. Touch "USB Connection" and select "USB Mass Storage" mode. Thanks for this answer go to EricC (apparently a Motorola employee), found here .
