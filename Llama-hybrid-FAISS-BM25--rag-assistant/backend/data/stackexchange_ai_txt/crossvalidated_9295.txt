Monte-Carlo estimation of the mean chord length in a polygon

This is a more "statistical" version of my Math.SE problem . Question Let $\mathbf{P}$ be a convex polygon of $m$ sides. Pick two of its edges at random, and further pick a random point on each of these edges, and compute the length of the chord we get. If we repeat this process $n$ times,and average the chord lengths we thus obtained, we get an estimate $\hat{\ell}_n$ of the expected chord length $\ell$ of $\mathbf{P}$. Then,how large should $n$ be to ensure that $\hat{\ell}_n$ differs from $\ell$ by (say) at most 5%,with a confidence level of (say) 95%, and precisely how should we collect our samples? Note that determining the expected chord length analytically leads to intractable integrals as shown in my SE post. Also,note that there are multiple inequivalent ways to define the expected chord length of $\mathbf{P}$; the one we need here is $\ell = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \hat{\ell}_n$.
