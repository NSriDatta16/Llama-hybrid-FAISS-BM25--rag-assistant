If the DV is ordinal, as yours is, you should do ordinal logistic regression. However, ordinal logistic regression can also be hierarchical and multiple: Those terms refer to the number of independent variables and how they are entered into the regression. "Multiple" means there are more than one IV and "hierarchical" means they are entered into the equation in a "hierarchy" - that is, in a specific order.
