Is Business entities/objects about organizing or performance optimizing?

I don't know the difference between Business Entities and Business Objects But what I have is a class that has some properties and I'll add an IsValid method later. That's what Application Architecture Tutorials taught me But it just hit me, what's the difference between using this approach and just sending/receiving my data through my layers without storing them in objects .. and when I add an item to the database, instead of creating an object of the item's type then store it and send it to the BLL or the DAL, I would just send the information I just collected as it is, as an argument to my BLL methods! I'm sorry if my question is a bit confusing. But I hope that you'll excuse me as this question and the application architecture is a just a very big ocean ..And I'm LOST! =S P.S: I added the technologies I'm using, Hoping it will help you understand my environment
