The HotSpot JVM allows you to hook up an agentlib from a profiler (see Open Source Java Profilers or commercials like Your Kit ), in the profiler you can then inspect the memory/cpu/threads etc. If you want very specific stuff you might want to make your own agentlib that sends you information about the jvm that you need.
