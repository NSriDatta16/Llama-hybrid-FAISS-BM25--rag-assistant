Check to see if it's a namespace issue. I just fixed my problem by putting the Metadata "buddy" class into the same namespace as the Model L2S class, even though I thought I had everything referenced properly. I wanted to put the metadata classes into their own namespace for organizational purposes but it didn't seem to like that. FWIW, I'm running on .net 3.5, VS 2008, MVC 2 RC.
