I've put a lot of thought on the subject - we work in a Scrum environment, and we've ended up having difficulties to organize the documentation. What I'm heading to at the moment, though it's quite early so I don't know if it'll pass the long term test, is to use a wiki for the documentation. Basically, the workflow is the following : Stories come up in the backlog Story gets picked up by a programmer Programmer does the code, and in the DoD (Definition of Done), also has to write some tests against the new functionnality, and has to edit the wiki to add a page for the new functionnality. The wiki is organized with mediawiki templates, pretty much inspired from mediawiki extensions doc pages, with the name of the functionnality, the version it has been introduced into, anything that can be usefull. The template adds pictos to distinguish between different kinds of features (and of their status). At the end of the day, the wiki has the great advantage of letting you add the documentation page without being bothered about where or how to put it, but obviously regularly you need someone to come behind and organize the mess. The important thing to keep in mind, whatever tool you use, is that the developper should write some doc just after the development has taken place (including technical aspects) - and not before, and not months after...
