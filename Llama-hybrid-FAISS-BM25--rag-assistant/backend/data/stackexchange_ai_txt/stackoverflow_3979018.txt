Yes, this is a classpath issue. Log4j is looking for class com.lior.ibd.utils.logging.EclipseLoggingAppender. (probably appender that wrote someone in your organisation?) If you remove lines: and log4j should handle it. Or add EclipseLoggingAppender to classpath by locating a appropriate jar file and add it to the classpath. I.e. run java -cp appender.jar com.mypackage.MyClass
