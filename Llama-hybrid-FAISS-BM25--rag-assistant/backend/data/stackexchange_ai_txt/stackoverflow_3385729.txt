Is it possible to render a scene to multiple textures in a single pass with Xna?

I am wondering if it is possible to render a scene to multiple render targets in a single pass (or anything faster than drawing it several times through client code). I want to optimize some code that is being rendered to several textures of varying dimensions (512 by 512, 256 by 256, 128 by 128 and 64 by 64 for example). I realize I could use mip maps derived from the original target, but I don't want to blend colors. I suspect that mip mapping will take average from a few texels, but for my purposes I just want the unretouched rendering, as rendered by the graphics card. If there is any setting for mipmaps that allow this, then it's also considerable as a feasible solution. On a side note, does anyone know if mipmaps are generated on the CPU or GPU? Thanks for reading.
