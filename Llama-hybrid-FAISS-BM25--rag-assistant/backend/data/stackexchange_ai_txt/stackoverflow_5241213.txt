Rails session is blank when using HTTP put

I have a situation, where one particular link is resulting in an empty session hash. This is not good as I need to find a model by using the session_id. The link that is causing trouble is: {:preset_marker_url => image_url}), :method => :put, :remote => true ) %> and the code that finds the model from the session id (which is called using a before_filter): def get_organisation @organisation = Organisation.find_by_session_id(session[:session_id]) end In debugger mode, session == {} If I change the link_to to be a HTTP 'get' instead of 'put', the session is sent. However, this request isn't appropriate for a 'get' as it is modifying data. Why would 'get' include the session, but 'put' not?
