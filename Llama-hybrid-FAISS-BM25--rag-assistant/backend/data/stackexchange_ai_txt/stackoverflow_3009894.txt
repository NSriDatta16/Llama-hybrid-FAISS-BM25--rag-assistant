Javascript library/framework/widget to allow user to move and resize divs on page

I am looking at creating a page that the user can move around as they please...very similar to iGoogle . But in addition, ideally, I want the user to be able to resize the components. I've done quite a bit with jQuery in the past am not against the idea of using that, seeing as it already has the draggable and resizable options, though, there's still a fair amount of work involved. So, before I start - I've done some googling with no success - is there some kind of widget out there that already does this that's available for free commercial use? Thanks in advance.
