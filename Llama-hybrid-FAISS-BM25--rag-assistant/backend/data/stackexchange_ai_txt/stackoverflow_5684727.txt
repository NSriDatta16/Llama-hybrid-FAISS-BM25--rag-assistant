I am sure there are more elegant solutions to this, but this worked. I noticed that the event handler I was using was receiving the index only when the loop was over so I changed the marker to 'this' and added an 'content' value to the marker object. Define the content array before the marker: hikingBlurbs[i] = ' "> . '; Define your marker with the new content variable: // Set Post data hikingPositions[i] = new google.maps.LatLng( ); hikingMarkers[i] = new google.maps.Marker({ position: hikingPositions[i], map: map, icon: hikingIcon, title:" ", content: hikingBlurbs[i] }); Now add the event listener with some simple changes: // Assign data to map for(marker in hikingMarkers) { google.maps.event.addListener(hikingMarkers[marker], 'mouseover', function() { infowindow.setContent(this.content); infowindow.open(map,this); }); } Let me know if you see a better way of doing this or you have any questions.
