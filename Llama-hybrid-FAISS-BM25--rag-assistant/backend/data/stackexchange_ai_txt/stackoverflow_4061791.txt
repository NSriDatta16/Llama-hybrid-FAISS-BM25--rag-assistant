Image mapping like feature in Java swing, Points vs GeneralPath

My gaol is to draw several images using 2D graphics in a paintComponent() method. However, I'm not sure how I could add a MouseListener such that each image would know if it was selected. My solution thus far is too simply record the coordinates of the mouse click, and see if they are contained within the boundaries of each of the images. However this will be difficult with images that have more complex boundaries. Another option would be too create simple shapes and place them over the images, but again images with more complex boundaries will be difficult. In another discussion on SO found here , someone mentioned using GeneralPath to draw more complex shapes. I have never played with is, but this seems encouraging. Of these 2 options, what seems to be the best solution, or are there other recommendations
