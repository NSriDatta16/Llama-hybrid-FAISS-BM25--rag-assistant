Efficient data transfer from Java to C++ on windows

I'm looking to stream lots of data (up to ~1 Gbit) from Java to a C++ application (both on the same machine). I'm currently using a FIFO on Linux but need a Windows solution too. The most cross-platform method seems to be a local socket, but: a) won't I get huge overhead from TCP checksumming and copying to & from kernel space, and b) won't the average user's firewall try to inspect the and maybe block the connection? It seems like a safer solution may be to use JNI and the Named Pipe API (\.\pipe\blah), making a god-awful platform-specific mess of both sides of the connection. Are these really my 2 best options (and which would people recommend?) Thanks!
