When should you consider using time series in analysis?

I have a number of projects that I am working on where data is collected over time periods of months to years. My first question is when should time be considered as a factor in conducting analyses and tests on the data? E.g. I have a list of 100 individual products and track view and purchase events which occur infrequently over a period of 3 months. I wish to compare the ratio of views to purchases to see if one product is purchased more frequently than another based on its popularity (views) then should I consider time as a factor in this analysis? My second question is what is the best test to use to check for difference between ratio of views and purchases of these products? Many thanks in advance for any assistance.
