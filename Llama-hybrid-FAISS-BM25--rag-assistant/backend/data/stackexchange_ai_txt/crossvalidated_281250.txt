You should use marginal predictions. The way they work, is that they use the estimated equation to calculate the predicted value of the logit with the other variables held at some value (which is usually the mean or the observed value) for each observation. The logit is then converted into probabilities and that value is averaged for each category in your X variable. This way you get the average predicted probability for each category of X with all other variables held constant. The standard errors of the marginal predictions are calculated using the delta method. If the standard error of the predicted logit is: $$ s_{p_{j}} = \sqrt(x_{j}Vx'_{x})$$ Where $V$ is the estimated variance matrix for the model and $x_j$ is the observation for which you are getting the error. You can then get the standard errors for the predicted probabilities by: $$SE = p_j * (1-p_j) * s_{p_{j}}$$ Where $p_j$ is the predicted probability for case $j$.
