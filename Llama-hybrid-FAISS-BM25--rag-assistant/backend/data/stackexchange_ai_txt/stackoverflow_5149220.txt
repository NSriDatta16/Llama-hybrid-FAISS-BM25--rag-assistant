Windows Form Fonts Questions Part 2

Continue to my previous question ( link ) What if I want to assign the font of a new user control to its creator's font. Should I do this a): newControl = new MyControl(...); ... newControl.Font = this.Font; or this b)? newControl = new MyControl(...); ... newControl.Font = (Font)this.Font.Clone(); If answer is a), what will happen to the new user control's font if the creator's font get disposed (for example, a window closed by user)? Thanks, Gilbert
