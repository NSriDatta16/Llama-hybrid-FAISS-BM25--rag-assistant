$(document).ready() uses an assortment of different methods for different browsers. Not too many browsers agree on how to handle this event, so there are a number of ways of testing it. I'm pretty sure the jQuery implementation, at least the IE hack , depends on inserting a fragment and checking it for the doScroll("left") property that should only exist once the DOM is ready. It's an undocumented behavior that could change with newer versions of IE. The purpose of $(document).ready() is to allow you to run your DOM-dependent JavaScript before the page is finished loading, since window.onload doesn't fire until the entire page has been loaded. The varying implementations also have varying levels of reliability. It sounds like one of the browsers is firing the script before it finishes loading. Keep in mind that the order in which inline JavaScript is fired is not necessarily before ready . It sounds to me like you should consolidate your inline scripts into your $(document).ready() callback. jQuery does its best, but it's not perfect.
