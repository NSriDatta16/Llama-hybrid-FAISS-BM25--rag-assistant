Multiple databases or table naming conventions?

How do you split up your data for an application based on a database? A lot of software will have tables named something like Auth_Users, Auth_Whatever, Auth_Something, and then Admin_Something, Admin_Whatever, etc. Essentially the tables all exist in one database but they are organized by a naming convention. The other option would be to split some of this data into several databases. What are the pros and cons of doing one or the other?
