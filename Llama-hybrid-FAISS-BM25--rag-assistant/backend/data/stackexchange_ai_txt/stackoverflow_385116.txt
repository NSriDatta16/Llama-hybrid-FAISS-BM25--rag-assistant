@frankodwyer: Only trusted user agents won't work, consider especially IE user-agent string which gets modified by addons or .net version. There would be too many possibilities and it can be faked. variation on point 3. with notification to admin would probably work, but it would mean a non-determined delay if an admin isn't monitoring the logs constantly. @Greg Hewgill: The auto-logout would also disable the user account. At the least a new account would have to be created leaving more trails like email-address and other information. Randomly changing logout/disable-url for 3. would be interesting, but don't know how I would implement it yet :)
