The Real-world Functional Programming book that I wrote with Jon Skeet ( sorry for the advertisement! ) expects some existing knowledge of object-oriented languages (e.g. C#) but it briefly explains all more advanced features that C# has compared to, for example, Java. It has a few examples of GUI programming using WinForms (a more modern framework would be WPF, but some concepts are essentially the same). You can take a look at a few examples, because there is some free content related to GUI: Chapter 4 (coincidentally, available as a free sample :-)) shows how to implement an application for drawing simple graphs using basic features. Programming user interfaces using workflows (free excerpt) shows one advanced pattern that's very useful for writing reactive applications (as I know, this isn't described anywhere else in much details) As far as I know, Robert Pickering's Beginning F# also has some user interface examples and it also includes some WPF examples (although I don't have the book yet, so I don't know what exactly does it contain). However, none of the F# books will make you GUI Expert. You'll still need to spend some time learning about WinForms/Silverlight/WPF in more details. There are plenty of examples in C# on the internet and after reading one of the above, you should be able to translate them directly to F#, but buying a technology-specific book may be a good idea too.
