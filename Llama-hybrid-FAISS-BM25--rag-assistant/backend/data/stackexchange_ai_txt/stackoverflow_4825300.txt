If the view controller for FrontPage.xib is set properly by setting the File owner property via IB then you also need to set the view property. you can do this by control dragging from Fileowner to the view. From the error it appears that you have yet not set the view property for your view. Open the nib in Interface builder and and look for the View Connection in connection Inspector , this must be connected to file owner's view outlet. You don't need to declare it as a property anywhere.
