Is there something comprehensive like this available for xgboost as well? https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/ What I've tired (and what worked surprisingly well) was simply using the methods I was using with the scikit learn gradient boosting classifier. Can I do this? Yes. Is there something particularly that you're worried about? Several xgboost tutorials use a DMatrix (This iris classification, for instance). Why? The DMatrix is a specialized data type that's optimized for use in estimating an xgboost model. Specialized loaders exist to read data directly into the DMatrix format. You might find that it is more expedient than using numpy or pandas types if all of your use case is covered by the more limited DMatrix functionality.
