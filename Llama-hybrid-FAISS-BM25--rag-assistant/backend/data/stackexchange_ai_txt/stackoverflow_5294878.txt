Specifying Spring configuration file in JNLP

I have a java fx based UI which in turn calls a spring based library for its operation. I am launching this UI using the browser with a jnlp file. I am unable to find out how to specify the applicationContext.xml for the spring based library in the JNLP. I am using a ClassPathXmlApplicationContext to load my context. In my jnlp if I specify something like The loader says its not a valid jar file and quits. I am not sure how to do the bundling and specify the applicationContext such that spring library is able to pick it up. Any pointers or suggestions would be greatly helpful. Thanks, Abi
