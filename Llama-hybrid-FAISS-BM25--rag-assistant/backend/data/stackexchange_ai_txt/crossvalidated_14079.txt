Time series modeling in R on a weekly basis over multiple years featuring different number of weeks in each year

My problem is that I have weekly data from 2008, 2009 and 2010 but the number of weeks in each of these years are not the same since in we (in Denmark) code the last week in 2009 as 53. This means that I have 52 weeks in 2008 and 2010 but 53 weeks in 2009. Is there some way to make R understand this and treat the time series accordingly. Typically I want it to integrate well with ts, stl, etc. Any help or pointers on this subject would be greatly appreciated.
