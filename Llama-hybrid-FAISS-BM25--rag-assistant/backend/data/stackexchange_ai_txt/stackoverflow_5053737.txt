A simple hitTest between your dragged icon and the visual indicator would work just fine for that kind of thing. You could have something like this: function myHitTest(e:Event):void { if (myButton.hitTestObject(myVisualIndicator)) { myVisualIndicator.visible=true; } else { myVisualIndicator.visible=false; } } On mouse down you could set an enterframe event listener for that function and clear it on mouse release.
