jQuery ui dialog disappears on page refresh?

I've got a basic dialog which should be always shown until the user clicks a button. The problem is that after I refresh the page manually it disappears, but if I refresh it again it reappears. How should I fix that so that it wouldn't disappear after the 1st refresh? Sample: $(function() { $( "#tut" ).dialog( { draggable: false, resizable: false }); }); Example.
