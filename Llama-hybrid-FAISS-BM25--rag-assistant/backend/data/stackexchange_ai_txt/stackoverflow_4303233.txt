Yes you can. I assume that you have paperclip already set up for S3. So you have only edit the picture.rb and attachement_file.rb in you model directory (app/model/ckeditor/) and replace these lines has_attached_file :data, :url => "/ckeditor_assets/attachments/:id/:filename", :path => ":rails_root/public/ckeditor_assets/attachments/:id/:filename" with your papeclip version has_attached_file: has_attached_file :data, :styles => { :content => '575>', :thumb => '80x80#' }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/s3.yml", :path => ":attachment/:id/:style.:extension", :url => ":s3_domain_url" That's it. Btw: this is example from Rails 3.
