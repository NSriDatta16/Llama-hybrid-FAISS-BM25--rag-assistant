Headline problem when floating around image

I have a problem with headline tags when I float them around an image in compability-mode in explorer. Some headline The picture is like 100px high, and by default the text centers in middle, which it should, but with compability-mode on it aligns top. How can I fix so it vertically aligns center? /Molgan
