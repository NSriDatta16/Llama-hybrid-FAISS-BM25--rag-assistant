First, do you really need to persist the entire VM? This may be something you need for your app; but I would still ask that you consider persisting only the bits you absolutely require and re-instantiate your VM as needed. That said, Isolated Storage is where you can shove things for persistence. You could use the IsolatedStorageSettings class to store key-value pair type data. Also, please see here for a complete walkthrough of tombstoning. There is an IsolatedStorageHelper class in the training kit that you could use. It uses a Json serializer/deserializer and should work on most classes with standard type properties. There is also a Tombstone helper in Codeplex here that might work for you. Hope this helps!
