I have a View Controller with two ScrollViews. Images are added as subviews. ScrollViews are already in the front. I tried bringing scrollview to the front and also imageview of the scrollview to the front. But somehow when i drag, the center of the image goes over my other scrollview2 which i also tried sending back. But does not seem to work. Here is what i do, in TouchesMove (inside a ViewController) view= [[scrollView1 subviews] objectAtIndex:currentImageIndex]; [self.view bringSubviewToFront:scrollView1]; [scrollView1 bringSubviewToFront:view]; [self.view sendSubviewToBack:scrollView2]; scrollView1 and scrollView2 are two scrollviews that are part of the ViewController's view. Does this make sense ? thanks mohan
