Suggest another method of achieving this "word stack" which resolves the known issues my method is a victim of

I am trying to transform a set of two radio buttons in a stack of two labels, one blue and on gray representing, respectively, the selected radio and the unselected one. Clicking on this stack will change which of the labels is blue (and which of the radio buttons is checked). It works well but it breaks down in an ugly manner when the two labels aren't of the same width. The best way to see what I mean is to try the test page I made out on your own server or to navigate here to see the page in action. The comments in the source code and actual content explain pretty much what I am aiming for and what the problems are. Also, this is an attempt at accessibility and graceful degradation, so any remarks concerning those issues are most welcome. word stacks .stackContainer { line-height: 2em; /* Prevents the stackBottom from overlaping the second line of text found in the stack container, should there be a second line. */ } .stack { position: relative; /* Needed to give the absolutely positionned stackBottom a positionned reference. */ } .stackTop { vertical-align: .5em; /* Raise the stackTop half a line */ } .stackBottom { background: transparent; /* Needed so the background doesn't cover the stackTop nor the line below, if any. */ position: absolute; /* Positionned absolutely in reference to the stack */ left: 0; /* Bring the stackBottom directly under the stackTop */ top: 0; /* For some reason, this is needed to bring the stackBottom under the stackTop. */ } /* The following is extra */ .stackSelected /* Represents the chosen value */ { color: #009; } .stackUnselected /* Represents the other option */ { color: #777; } .stack { cursor: pointer; } p { margin: 3em; } " . $value1 . " " . $value2 . " "); } ?> // It is recommended to use this function only if stacks have been created with the php function createStack and if these stacks are contained in an element of class stackContainer function makeStacks() { var forms = document.getElementsByTagName("form"); // Find all forms var nb_forms = forms.length; for(var i = 0; i Word stacks How it works PHP transforms &lt;?php createWordStack("name","one","two"); ?&gt into &lt;span class="stack"&gt; &lt;label for="name"&gt; &lt;input type="radio" name="name" value="one" /&gt;one &lt;/label&gt; &lt;label for="name"&gt; &lt;input type="radio" name="name" value="two" checked="checked" /&gt;two &lt;/label&gt; &lt;/span&gt; javascript hides the radio buttons, applies class declarations to the labels and adds an onclick event listener to the &lt;span class="stack"&gt; Example " class="stackContainer" method="post"> Choose between options. print_r($_POST) Known issues This technique look good with two different sizes of `words`, in which order they appear. If looks better when the longer word is above the other though. Plus, the way it breaks makes it unreadable when the longer word is on the bottom if the remainder of the text needs to span many lines. Another problem is when the bottom word longer than the top word but actually consists of a single word. It cannot wrap and therefore interferes with the following text. .. and so, all in all, it is better to avoid long words altogether. Now, just to illustrate what I am saying above.. .. and so, all in all, it is better to avoid long words altogether. Notes At least, the next paragraph pushed down too far. when I put the stackBottom BEFORE the stackTop, so I could also call them stackChosen and stackAlternate and just change the className in order to choose one or the other. This is what the javascript used to do when you click on the stack: if the label is of class stackTop, it changes it to stackBottom, and vice-versa. Now, only the colour is changed.. So the question is: How would I go about resolving the known issues explained in the test page? I'm sorry, I know this is no way of asking a question, but I just don't know how else to phrase it. I did put much effort in making this test page as clear as possible. Thanks in advance
