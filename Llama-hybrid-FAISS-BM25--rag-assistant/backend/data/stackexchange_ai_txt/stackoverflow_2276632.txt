You should embed the buttons within a UIView, and set that UIView as the tableFooterView of the UITableView. You can do this in IB by dragging the view into the bottom of the UITableView. This way the buttons will always be below the last row of the tableview, though I should warn you that if there are more rows than fit on-screen, the buttons won't be visible until you scroll down. If this isn't what you want, then you'll need to do something more complicated (namely, run -layoutSubviews on the UITableView, then ask it for the rect of the last section, and use that to calculate where the buttons should go).
