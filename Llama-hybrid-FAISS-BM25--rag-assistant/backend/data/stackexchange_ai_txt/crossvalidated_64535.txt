Structuring a linear mixed model in R with nesting

My ecological question is: "What are the trends in percent coral cover by island and depth across the state of Hawaii from 1999 to 2012?" I am trying to analyze this hierarchical data set using R with 10 transects at each depth, 2 depths per site, and site nested in island. Data structure: Fixed effects: Island: Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Kahoolawe, Oahu, Kauai. DepthCat: S = Shallow, D = Deep. WYear: 0-13. It was suggested that I use this factor as a covariate for years. Random effects: Site: 34 sites across the 6 islands with 2 depths per site. Transect: 10 permanent transects at each depth. Year: 1999 â€“ 2012 (14 years) Dependent variable: PercentCover Currently, I am using the lmer function in the lmerTest package and this is the model that I've constructed. fit1 Unfortunately, the data are spotty (i.e., missing data in multiple years for a number of sites) so the model returns [1] "Asymptotic covariance matrix A is not positive!" , even using arcsin transformed data. I can still run the summary statistics to get results, but I don't feel comfortable with the error message. Perhaps I have not structured the model correctly in terms of organizing the nested factors, but the number of observations for each of the levels in the summary stats seems correct. I tried different and simpler iterations of the model such as: fit1 which works, but doesn't give me the interaction information and returns a larger AIC suggesting that the model does not fit the data as well. To deal with all of the missing data, I tried another approach by using the regression slope of percent cover over time as the dependent variable for each site X depth combination. Data structure: Fixed effects: Island: Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Kahoolawe, Oahu, Kauai. DepthCat: S = Shallow, D = Deep. Random effects: Site: 34 sites across the 6 islands with 2 depths per site. Transect: 10 permanent transects at each depth. Dependent variable: Trend I used the following model, but the summary results did not make much sense, even after transforming the data. fit1 Any suggestions on improving my analytical approach would be appreciated.
