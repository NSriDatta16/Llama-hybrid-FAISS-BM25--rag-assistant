In many machine learning packages dissimilarity , which is a distance matrix, is a parameter for clustering (sometimes semi-supervised models). However the real parameter is type of the distance . You need to tune distance type parameter like k in kmeans. (You need to optimize the distance type according to your business objective). Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance for distance types. Additionally in some cases, correlation is used for similarity.
