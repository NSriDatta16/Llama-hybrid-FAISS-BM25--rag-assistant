You can set a breakpoint within JavaScript in Visual Studio 2005, but in addition to debugging needing to be enabled in Internet Explorer, you can only set the breakpoint in a .js file. You cannot debug any inline JavaScript code. I also sometimes have problems when trying to debug my JavaScript code when using the attach process method to go into debugging. I will normally use the "Start debugging" green arrow. You will know that your code will stop at the breakpoint in your .js file if the breakpoint icon (Burgandy Circle by default) is filled in. If it's not filled in, you will never stop there. Finally, make sure you have debugging enabled in your ASP.NET configuration settings.
