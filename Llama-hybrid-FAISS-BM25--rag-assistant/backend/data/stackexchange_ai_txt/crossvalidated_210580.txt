taking average of several models and feature sets

just a quick question that i cant seem to find a definitive answer for. When im doing feature selection, i end up with a list of the top performing sets. Would it make sense to use the top 10 sets instead of just the top one, and then average the results when making predictions? Im assuming using 10 different models and averaging them would increase performance.
