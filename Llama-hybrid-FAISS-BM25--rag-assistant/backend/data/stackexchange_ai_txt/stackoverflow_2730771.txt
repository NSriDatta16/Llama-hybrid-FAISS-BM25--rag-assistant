It totally depends on what you are going to do with that data once you have it. By and large, if these seven factoids (weekdays that the store is opn) are one fact, will be treated as one fact, and you'll never need to parse out and individually process one of the "factoids" within the string, then it can and possibly should be stored as one piece of data. But, if you'll have to consider this infomation as seven distinct pieces of data, you'll be better off recording it as seven different pieces of data (i.e. seven different columns). Again, there's a whole lot of "it depends" behind this. Another way to think of it is, look ahead to how you will be using the data, and try and structure your storage to simplify your processes (i.e. do you want to always be parsing string "1010101" for the element(s) you want?)
