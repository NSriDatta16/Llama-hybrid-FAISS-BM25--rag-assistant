Of course you can have multiple project files in a single solution. All you have to do (and I am assuming you are using Visual Studio) is add one or more new projects to the existing solution. You need to decide which of the projects in the solution is your "Main" project and you do this by right-clicking on the project in Solution Explorer and choosing "Set as Startup project". Generally speaking, the startup project will be the one that contains the user interface for your application. You need to make sure that the main project references the other projects - as @driis has mentioned, you do this through the Add Reference dialog and click the "Projects" tab. To organize your project, you should think about the different functional areas of the application. Usually, an application is divided up into presentation, business logic and data access components, but this is not the only approach. You might have various methods and classes that you want to re-use in future projects, so you might create some "Utility" or "Helper" libraries. You can choose your namespaces along the same lines as the project names, or other different functional areas of the application. For general guidance, check out this MSDN article or this one . Good luck!
