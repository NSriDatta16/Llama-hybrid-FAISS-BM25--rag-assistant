Best way of determining how unique an inspector's ratings are compared to the average inspector

Noob question. I have a full population of every inspector rating for all items being rated. Each inspector has inspected a subset of the items and given them a rating, but different inspectors have inspected a different number of items. My goal is to measure how different the ratings are that a given inspector gives compared to the population of inspectors (i.e. who is the most out of line compared to the average inspector). I could do something like, for every inspector, compute the mean squared error for all the ratings an inspector has given (error as the distance between the average rating for an item and the rating the inspector has given), but the item rating distributions might have different stddevs. This also seems like it would have weird behavior for inspectors that have only inspected a small number of items. Are there any statistical measures that would be appropriate here?
