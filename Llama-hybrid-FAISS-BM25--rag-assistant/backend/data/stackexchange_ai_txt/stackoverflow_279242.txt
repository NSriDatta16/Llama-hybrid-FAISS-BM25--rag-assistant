I wanted to do exactly the same thing, except with currencies rather than straight decimal values. I ended up creating a custom view which contains a UITextField and a UILabel. The label covers the text field, but the text field still receives touches. I use the UITextFieldTextDidChange notification to observe changes in the text field (and I used a NSNumberFormatter to turn the resulting number into a formatted currency value) to update the label. To disable the loupe that allows the user to reposition the insertion point, you'll need to use a custom UITextField subclass and override touchesBegan:withEvent: and set it to do nothing. My solution might be different from what you need because the decimal point is always fixed -- I use the system's currency setting to determine how many there digits ought to be after the decimal point. However, the numeric keypad doesn't have a decimal point on it. And you can't add any buttons to the keyboard (which is especially aggravating because there's a blank button in the lower-left corner of the keyboard that would be perfect for a decimal point!) So I don't have a solution for that, unfortunately.
