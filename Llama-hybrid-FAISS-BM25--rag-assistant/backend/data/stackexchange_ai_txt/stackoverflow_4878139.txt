ST_Distance and 'as' in Postgis

I've written this query and it works, although it's a bit slow: SELECT name, (ST_Distance( ST_Transform( way,900913 ),ST_Transform( ST_GeomFromText('POINT (-6.2222 53.307)',4326),900913 ))) FROM ga_osm_latlong_polygon WHERE ( (ST_Distance( ST_Transform( way,900913 ),ST_Transform( ST_GeomFromText('POINT (-6.2222 53.307)',4326),900913 ))) I'm trying to rewrite it in a more elegant way, using 'as': SELECT name, (ST_Distance( ST_Transform( way,900913 ),ST_Transform( ST_GeomFromText('POINT (-6.2222 53.307)',4326),900913 ))) AS d FROM ga_osm_latlong_polygon WHERE ( d Unfortunately, I get: ERROR: column "d" does not exist Any idea about what I'm getting wrong here? Thanks!
