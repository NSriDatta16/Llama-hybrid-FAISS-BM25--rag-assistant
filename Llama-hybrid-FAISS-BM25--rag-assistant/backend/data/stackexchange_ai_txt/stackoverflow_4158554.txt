How to setup a Magento rewrite rule that keeps it's GET parameters

In our Magento shop we need a few rewrite rules that redirect to another domain. I know how to do that in the Magento Backend Rewrite URl Module, but cannot find a way to let the redirect keep it's parameters. Is there anyway to do this in Magento, or must this be done with Apache mod_rewrite?
