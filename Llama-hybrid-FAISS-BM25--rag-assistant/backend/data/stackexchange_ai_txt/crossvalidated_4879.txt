It seems the barplot() will be your friend in that case, e.g. x This will work for variables of type character or factor . Another option is to use Cleveland's dotplot , see dotchart() (or dotplot() in the lattice package). Update You could replace table(x) by table(x)/sum(table(x))*100 to express data as % rather than counts. I know there are more elegant solutions in additional packages, but I can't remember their names actually. The table() function will also work for two-way classification, and marginal totals can easily be computed in a similar way; e.g. apply(table(x, y), 1, sum) gives rows marginal frequencies.
