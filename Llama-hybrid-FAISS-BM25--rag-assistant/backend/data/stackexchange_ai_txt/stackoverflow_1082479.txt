The toolkit DataGridRow has no defined OnMouseDown override or similar method. The selection of a full row is handled trough this method: internal void HandleSelectionForCellInput(DataGridCell cell, bool startDragging, bool allowsExtendSelect, bool allowsMinimalSelect) { DataGridSelectionUnit selectionUnit = SelectionUnit; // If the mode is None, then no selection will occur if (selectionUnit == DataGridSelectionUnit.FullRow) { // In FullRow mode, items are selected MakeFullRowSelection(cell.RowDataItem, allowsExtendSelect, allowsMinimalSelect); } else { // In the other modes, cells can be individually selected MakeCellSelection(new DataGridCellInfo(cell), allowsExtendSelect, allowsMinimalSelect); } if (startDragging) { BeginDragging(); } } This method is called when input occurs on a cell . The MakeFullRowSelection method only selects all cells in a row, not the row itself. So, when you click on a DataGridRow (and not a DataGridCell), no mouse down or selection handling occurs. To accomplish what you desire, you should add some sort of mouse down handler to your rows' mouse down events where you would set the IsSelected property. Of course, note that you should specify the selected property for each cell in the row individually, since the row.IsSelected does not imply or set that.
