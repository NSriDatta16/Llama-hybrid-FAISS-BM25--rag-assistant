memory management guidelines on foundation functions

While memory management for the foundation classes are consistent and documented, i was surprised to find (via the friendly EXC_BAD_ACCESS ) that Foundation functions like e.g NSStringFromSelector() seem to return pointers to constant storage - which is at least not mentioned in the documentation for the function. Is that behaviour documented somewhere? Are there any consistent guidelines?
