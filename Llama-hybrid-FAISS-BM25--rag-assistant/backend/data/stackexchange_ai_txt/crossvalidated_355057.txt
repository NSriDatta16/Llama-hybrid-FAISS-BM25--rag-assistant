Bayesian optimization for non-Gaussian noise

A black box function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which is evaluated pointwise subject to Gaussian noise, i.e., $f(x) + \mathcal{N}(\mu(x),\sigma(x)^2)$, can be minimized using Bayesian optimization where a Gaussian Process is used as a noisy function model. How can Bayesian optimization be used for functions subject to non-Gaussian noise, e.g., skewed distributions? Are there any implementations that support this setting?
