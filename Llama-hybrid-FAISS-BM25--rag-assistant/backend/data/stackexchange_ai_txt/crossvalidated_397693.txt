The version of SVM that does not allow any positive point to be on negative side of boundary and vice versa, is called hard margin SVM . The version that allows but penalizes this violation is called soft margin SVM . In practice, always soft margin is used since it is unlikely that classes would be perfectly separated, they probably overlap in some regions.
