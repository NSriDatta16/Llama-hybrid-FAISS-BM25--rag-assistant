How to Autogenerate multiple getters/setters or accessors in Visual Studio

Before I start, I know there is this post and it doesn't answer my question: How to generate getters and setters in Visual Studio? In Visual Studio 2008 there is the ability to auto generate getters and setters (accessors) by right clicking on a private variable -> Refactor -> Encapsulate Field... This is great for a class that has 2 or 3 methods, but come on MS! When have you ever worked with a class that has a few accessors? I am looking for a way to generate ALL with a few clicks (Eclipse folks out there will know what I am talking about - you can right click a class and select 'generate accessors'. DONE.). I really don't like spending 20 minutes a class clicking through wizards. I used to have some .NET 1.0 code that would generate classes, but it is long gone and this feature should really be standard for the IDE. UPDATE: I might mention that I have found Linq to Entities and SQLMetal to be really cool ideas, and way beyond my simple request in the paragraph above.
