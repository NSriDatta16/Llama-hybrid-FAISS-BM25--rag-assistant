Why does there seem to be a drift in the Arima simulation of a time series with seasonality?

I'm trying to make sense of the basics of time series, and I ran into a block of code by Rob Hyndman. library(ggplot2) library(forecast) set.seed(0) model I was surprised that, upon plotting the output, it doesn't seem to be stationary discounting the waves of seasonality expected. There is probably a very simple explanation that I am overlooking, but I'd like to get some help getting unstuck. It may be that it's not a good model to begin with, or that the number of samples is not long enough. Perhaps I don't understand the frequency in seasonality. Or simply a misunderstood coding concept with the triple values in the Arima() , like order = c(1,1,1) .
