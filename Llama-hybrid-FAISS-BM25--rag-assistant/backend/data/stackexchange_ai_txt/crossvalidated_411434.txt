Since the authors use an MLP which does not exploit the spatial relationship between the pixels as a CNN might, it is no more easy or difficult for their model to learn MNIST versus permuted MNIST. the permutated images are very noisy which cannot be recognised even by a human. While the images look noisy, the amount of actual noise is close to 0, since again, they are just permuted versions of noise-free MNIST. Applying blur, rotation, or some distortion are understandable but why permuting the pixel? Blur, rotation, or distortion would actually not work as well in this setting, since that would test the ability of the model to generalize to blur/rotation/distortion, whereas the actual goal is to test continual learning.
