In a relational database you would create multiple tables, each one for a different aspect of the event. so you could have an organiser table a location table and an events table In the event table you would have the id of the organiser and the id of the location, and then data about the event. So the three tables describe the event more fully but you don't need to repeat data. An organiser may have multiple events, at multiple locations. each organiser and location only needs one entry (usually) in their respective tables. DC
