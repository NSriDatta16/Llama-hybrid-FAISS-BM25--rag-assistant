A simple version of ELO can be cast as a logistic regression: for players $i,j$ with ratings $R_i,R_j$, $$P(i\mbox{ beats }j)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(\beta(R_i-R_j))}.$$ So you could just as easily predict score instead by using a different link function, for example a lorentzian or gaussian: $$P(\mbox{Game score}=x)=a\exp(-\alpha|\beta(R_i-R_j)-x|^\gamma)$$, where the game score can be positive (in favor of $i$) or negative (in favor of $j$). So you don't need to calculate the probability of beating and just directly optimize the game score.
