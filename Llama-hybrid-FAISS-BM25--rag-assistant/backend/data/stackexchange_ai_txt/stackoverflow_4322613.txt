How to add draggable markers to a Google Map using jQuery

I'm playing with google Maps and I need some directions :-) I'd like a map with a draggable marker. If the user drags the marker some formfields need to be updated with the coordinates of the marker. Is there a jQuery-plugin that can do this using the v3 of the Google Maps API?
