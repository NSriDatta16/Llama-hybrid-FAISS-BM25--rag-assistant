What does the Argument "type" in VAR() - function do?

Right now I am working with vector autoregressive models in order to make 3 months forecasts for a commodity good (sawlogs) y. I have several time-series of "follow-up-products" of sawlogs that should work as "predictors" for saw-log prices from a logical point of view. I encountered within the VAR-function from package "vars" ( http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vars/vars.pdf ), that one attribute called "type" has the following expressions: "const", "both", "trend", "none". I really don't know what this means from a statistical point of view. Since neither the package-description nor other literature I've screened so far can give me an answer I actually understand I'd like to ask you guys the following: How should I interpret/understand and use the argument "type" in R's VAR() Function? What do those 4 different arguments really mean? "both", "none", "trend", "constant"? Could anyone explain this in a simple way and probably provide an example as well? Does this mean that I can directly use non-stationary time series for my VAR-model since I can consider trend/season afterwards by setting the "type-argument" to both, or am I wrong here?
