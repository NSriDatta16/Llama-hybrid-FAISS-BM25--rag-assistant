random forest imbalanced data-over, under, Smote Sampling

I am using random forest model for an imbalanced dataset. The dependent variable is Yes=73, No=7100. I have 65 independent variables both factor and numeric. I have tried to develop models for imbalanced, undersampling, oversampling and Smote sampling. However, the model performance is not showing any significant improvement or difference Here is the summary Using Unbalanced Data: precision: 1.000 recall: 1.000 F: 0.500, AUC: 1.000 Using Under-sampling precision: 0.615 recall: 1.000 F: 0.381 AUC: 1.000 Using Oversampling precision: 1.000, recall: 1.000 F: 0.500 AUC: 1.000 USing SMOTE: precision: 0.941 recall: 1.000 F: 0.485 AUC: 1.000 My code is here Did I do something terribly wrong? What does the result mean?
