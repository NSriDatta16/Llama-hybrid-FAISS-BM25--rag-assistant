I have found that Telerik's free Work Item Manager provides an elegant solution to this problem. Just define your queries as you usually would but leave out any filters relating to iterations (note that this also applies to areas). There is a treeview pane named 'Area/Iteration Filters' that will add extra, recursive filtering based on the iteration (or area) that you select there. Note that if the pane is not visible then you can enable it via the View menu.
