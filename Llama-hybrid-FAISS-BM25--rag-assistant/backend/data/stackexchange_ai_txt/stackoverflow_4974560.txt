wordpress - listing custom taxonomy

Right now I'm using the following code to list my 'Skills' taxonomy: I have three questions: Is that the correct (most elegant) way to write that? Also, is there a way to list the parent category first separated by a pipe with the children categories after that? Like this: Illustration | Charcoal, Watercolor, Pen Is there a way to have the categories NOT linked text? Update: ID, 'Skills', '', ', ', '' ) ; echo strip_tags($terms_as_text); ?>
