Storing French (decimal values) in database?

I have my form set in french as well, and it automatically changes the text format to use ','. However When I try to insert my values into the database it says cannot convert nvarchar to decimal? Worst case, Is there a way I can disable the numbers from changing to use ',' and just use '.' always regardless what language it is? My working language is vb.net Thanks, Robert
