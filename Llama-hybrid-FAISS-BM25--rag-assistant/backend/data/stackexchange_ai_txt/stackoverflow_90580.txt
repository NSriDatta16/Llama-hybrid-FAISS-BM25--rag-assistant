Word frequency algorithm for natural language processing

Without getting a degree in information retrieval, I'd like to know if there exists any algorithms for counting the frequency that words occur in a given body of text. The goal is to get a "general feel" of what people are saying over a set of textual comments. Along the lines of Wordle . What I'd like: ignore articles, pronouns, etc ('a', 'an', 'the', 'him', 'them' etc) preserve proper nouns ignore hyphenation, except for soft kind Reaching for the stars, these would be peachy: handling stemming & plurals (e.g. like, likes, liked, liking match the same result) grouping of adjectives (adverbs, etc) with their subjects ("great service" as opposed to "great", "service") I've attempted some basic stuff using Wordnet but I'm just tweaking things blindly and hoping it works for my specific data. Something more generic would be great.
