If you want to customize IKImageBrowserView's drag and drop behavior, you can implement the - (NSUInteger) imageBrowser:(IKImageBrowserView *) aBrowser writeItemsAtIndexes:(NSIndexSet *) itemIndexes toPasteboard:(NSPasteboard *)pasteboard method in your browser's data source object. That will let you define what types and data you want to put on the pasteboard when doing a drag. If you want to disable dragging entirely, you should be able to just return 0 (the number of items you want to be dragged).
