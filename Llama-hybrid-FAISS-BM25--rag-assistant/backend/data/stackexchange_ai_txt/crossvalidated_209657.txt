Clear explanation of Cronbach's Alpha

I have difficulty in understanding Cronbach's Alpha's formula. I searched for google and StackExchange able to understand it. Even there are some topics trying to explain it intuitively, I could not get the idea yet. I know, it is used to measure reliability and to determine presence of unidimensionality. In extreme cases, the results are obvious: If there is no correlation between items(variables) Cronbach's Alpha is 0 If there is perfect relationship, it's value is 1. That is okey. But why don't we just use average of inter correlation's of items. It seems to me more intuitive. That value will be 0 when all items are independent and will be 1 if there perfect linear relation. So what information gives Cronbach's Alpha beside the average of inter item correlations. I also wonder does Cronbach's Alpha used to determine multicollinerity. I will be very glad for any help. I need and very clear explanation. Thanks a lot.
