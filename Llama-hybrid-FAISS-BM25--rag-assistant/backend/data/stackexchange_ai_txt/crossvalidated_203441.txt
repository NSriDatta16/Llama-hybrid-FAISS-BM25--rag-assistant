There are several possibilities for handling missing data. A typical easy one is imputing the median for continuous and the modus for discrete predictors. Other more sophisticated methods are available (like e.g. imputation with random forest, see here for some possibilites with R-package mlr: http://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/devel/html/impute/index.html ) As most of the algorithms for predictive modeling cannot handle missing data, you should do imputation before building a model Random Forest (randomForest or ranger in R) and linear model (lm in R) are good first options for regression problems. Better results with a bit of parameter tuning can usually be obtained by boosting methods (e.g. with the xgboost package), but a bit more experience is needed for this.
