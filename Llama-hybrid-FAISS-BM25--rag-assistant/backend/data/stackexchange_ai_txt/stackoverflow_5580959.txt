Manipulating php generated xml elements with js!

Im trying to link a JS library into a php dynaimcally generated xml document. except it keeps returning an error in the header? and I am having a problem with the link due to the "", which is normally used for a string in php. Any thoughts? $id = '1232'; $name = 'Christopher'; // Send the headers header('Content-type: text/xml'); header('Pragma: public'); header('Cache-control: private'); header('Expires: -1'); echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; I'm trying to add in a link to a js however I am unsure how to generate the code with php?? The link would look like Is there a way to do this?
