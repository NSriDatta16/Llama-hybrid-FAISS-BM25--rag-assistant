BMA is "Bayesian Model Averaged". GNET is "Generalized Elastic Net". Have you tried reading the Ishwaran and Rao papers as mentioned in the documentation for spikeslab ? There's an article in the R Journal as well that might be worth reading too: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-2/RJournal_2010-2_Ishwaran~et~al.pdf - no sense duplicating it all here.
