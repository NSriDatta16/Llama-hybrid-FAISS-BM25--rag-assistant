First of all, this isn't legal syntax. List can only take a single generic type. Second, I would say that if you're worried about doing things at this low a level you aren't thinking abstractly enough. An array of arrays or a List of Lists is common enough. People who create matrix classes for linear algebra use them all the time. But you leverage objects and Java best when you hide those implementation details from clients of your class. Try it for your case and see if it helps.
