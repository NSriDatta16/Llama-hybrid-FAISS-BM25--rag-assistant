Oh gosh I may have mis-interpreted your original comment. The easiest way to do this in SQL would be to have three tables: 1) Tags ( tag_id, name ) 2) Objects (whatever that is) 3) Object_Tag( tag_id, object_id ) Then you can ask virtually any question you want of the data quickly, easily, and efficiently (provided you index appropriately). If you want to get fancy, you can allow multi-word tags, too (there's an elegant way, and a less elegant way, I can think of). I assume that's what you've got, so this SQL below will work: The literal way: SELECT obj FROM object WHERE EXISTS( SELECT * FROM tags WHERE tag = 'fruit' AND oid = object_id ) AND EXISTS( SELECT * FROM tags WHERE tag = 'Apple' AND oid = object_id ) There are also other ways you can do it, such as: SELECT oid FROM tags WHERE tag = 'Apple' INTERSECT SELECT oid FROM tags WHERE tag = 'Fruit'
