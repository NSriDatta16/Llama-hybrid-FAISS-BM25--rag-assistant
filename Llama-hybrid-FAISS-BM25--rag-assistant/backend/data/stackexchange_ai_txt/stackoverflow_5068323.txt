C++ advance user interface building

I'm working on a new application to perform certain steps on certain order defined by the user. My issue now is that I want to build a SSIS-like interface on Visual C++, something like this: The main idea is let the users to drag and drop elements on a blank section, and allow them also to rearrange them and create relations between them with arrows or lines. Obviously SSIS designer UI allows to do much more than that, but at least something basic will help me to start. I don't know how to make my search (I haven't found anything yet) or if anyone knows some tools or tutorials of this, I will really appreciate it. PS. I'm open to any suggestions, even if they are in other programming languages. This application is intended to be for Windows.
