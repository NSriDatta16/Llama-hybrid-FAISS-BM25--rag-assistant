Clustering 1-gram Strings

I have a big list of mail addresses (around one million) and I want to use/adapt/create an algorithm to find similarities between them (basically to cluster them). All the algorithms I've checked so far e.g. n-grams variants, bag of words etc. are only used for clustering strings that are part of a context but here is not the case. So far I've tried Levensthein , LCS . Both of them are pretty accurate but I'm interested in an algorithm that uses machine learning techniques, if such an algorithm exists for this task. Also they are pretty slow for my dataset.
