In part 1, as you mentioned, both options you gave are equivalent, so neither is more correct (semantic sidepoint: you're actually talking about distance metrics, not similarity metrics). Actually, I don't think your proposed distance would be a good fit for this problem because eigenvectors are only specified up to sign flips. This means that $v$ and $-v$ should be considered identical. But, they would be considered distant using the $\ell_2$ distance as you proposed. Regarding part 2: Yes, it's possible to use distance metrics where each dimension is weighted differently. Offhand, it's hard to say which distance metric you should use. More information about the problem would be needed. Keep in mind that standard k-means is defined using squared Euclidean distances, so you would need to modify it to use something else. In particular, centroids must be computed differently (you can't just take the average of within-cluster points anymore).
