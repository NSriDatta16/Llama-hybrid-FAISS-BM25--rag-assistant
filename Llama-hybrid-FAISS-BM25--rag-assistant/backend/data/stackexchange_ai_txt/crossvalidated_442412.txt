how to determine a priori probability distribution of sigama2 in montecarlo simulation?

1、the monte carlo simulation code in SAS： Example1: https://support.sas.com/rnd/app/stat/examples/BayesStd/new_example/index.html proc mcmc data=class outpost=classout nmc=10000 thin=2 seed=246810; parms beta0 0 beta1 0; parms sigma2 1; prior beta0 beta1 ~ normal(mean = 0, var = 1e6); prior sigma2 ~ igamma(shape = 3/10, scale = 10/3); mu = beta0 + beta1*height; model weight ~ n(mu, var = sigma2); run; What does the "parm sigma2 1"mean? Does it mean the sigma2's parameter begins from 1 in the simulation and why it begins from 1 but not 0.1、0.011、0.0001 or others? Just like Example2 below: https://www.phusewiki.org/docs/Conference%202017%20AS%20Papers/AS03.pdf the variable "a_Sex" begins from 0.1 and the sigma2 begins from 0.0011. So how to determine the variable's initial value? proc mcmc data=Orthodont_tr outpost=outpost nbi=5000 nmc=25000 thin=15 plots=ALL; array mean[4]; array a_age[3] a_age10 a_age12 a_age14; array a_sex_age[3] a_sex_age10 a_sex_age12 a_sex_age14; array dist[4] dist1 dist2 dist3 dist4; parms intercept 0.1 a_Sex 0.1 a_age: 0 a_sex_age: 0; parms S2 0.0011; parms Rho; prior intercept ~ normal(0,var=1e6); prior a_Sex ~ normal(0,var=1e6); prior a_age: ~ normal(0,var=1e6); prior a_sex_age: ~ normal(0,var=1e6); prior S2 ~ igamma(shape=0.01, scale=0.01); prior Rho ~ uniform(-1,1); mean[1] = intercept + a_Sex * (Sex=1) ;/*time = 8*/ mean[2] = intercept + a_Sex * (Sex=1)+ a_age10 + a_sex_age10 * (Sex=1);/*time = 10*/ mean[3] = intercept + a_Sex * (Sex=1)+ a_age12 + a_sex_age12 * (Sex=1);/*time = 12*/ mean[4] = intercept + a_Sex * (Sex=1)+ a_age14 + a_sex_age14 * (Sex=1);/*time = 14*/ model dist ~ mvnar(mean, var=S2, rho=Rho); run; 2、Why the sigma2's prior distribution in the 1st example is like this: prior sigma2 ~ igamma(shape = 3/10, scale = 10/3) But in the 2rd example: prior S2 ~ igamma(shape=0.01, scale=0.01) Why are they different? How to determine the sigma2's priori distribution and why the sigma2 has an igamma distribution? @merv Do you mean I need to use this formula below to calculate the igamma distribution's "shape(α)" and "scale(1/β)"? But obviously it is impossible to get the "α=0.01" in Example2 through the "α+n/2"……
