i would suggest allocating all your memory at program startup and using placement new to position your buffers. why this approach? well, you can manually keep track of fragmentation and such. there is no portable way of determining how much memory is able to be allocated for your process. i'm positive there's a linux specific system call that will get you that info (can't think of what it is). good luck.
