I think this homework question is a bit unclear. The experiment seems to be handing out the flyer to a population of $20$ people. You want to know what is the probability that $5$ to $20$ people attend as a result. Usually, experiments involve a control group that gets a placebo, but perhaps this is a new band that no one knows about, so the assumption that no one plans to attend in the absence of the treatment flyer is reasonable. Or maybe the organizers really liked this study . The second assumption is that the flyers cannot be shared, so treatment is not "contagious". This is less reasonable, but would complicate the problem too much to relax. In any case, if you think of an experiment as a procedure carried out to verify, refute, or validate a hypothesis, this fits the bill. The problem is that you don't know the take-up rate in the population. To learn it, you sample $8$ receivers at random from the population of $20$, and note that $2$ went. The rate seems to be $1/4$. You might even do a binomial test here and find that you cannot reject the null that $p=0.25$, as in @E L M's answer. The ultimate goal, however, is to to extrapolate from your sample to the population of 20, which is the experiment. The probability that $5$ or more people attend when you hand out $20$ flyers can be calculated by the binomial tail function, which gives your the probability of observing $k=5$ or more successes in $20$ trials when the probability of a success on one trial is $p=\frac{1}{4}$. In Stata, this would be: . display binomialtail(20,5,1/4) .5851585 You can even do this from first principles by subtracting $1 - Pr(k=0)-Pr(k=1)-Pr(k=2)-Pr(k=3)-Pr(k=4)$: di 1-[binomialp(20,0,1/4)+binomialp(20,1,1/4)+binomialp(20,2,1/4)+binomialp(20,3,1/4)+binomialp(20,4,1/4)] .5851585 You could also think of this as a one-sided binomial probability test: . bitesti 20 5 1/4 N Observed k Expected k Assumed p Observed p ------------------------------------------------------------ 20 5 5 0.25000 0.25000 Pr(k >= 5) = 0.585158 (one-sided test) Pr(k = 6) = 1.000000 (two-sided test) The first one-sided test gives you the same probability as the tail approach. It is also a p-value. Why? The p-value of a hypothesis test is the probability (calculated assuming $H_0$ is true) of observing any outcome as extreme or more extreme than the observed outcome $(k=5)$, with extreme meaning in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. You reject the null when the p-value is small, in favor of the alternative, because anything as extreme or more is unlikely if the null was true. You don't accept the null, however, the data can only be consistent with it. In R, this can be done with: > binom.test(5,20,1/4, alternative = "greater") Exact binomial test data: 5 and 20 number of successes = 5, number of trials = 20, p-value = 0.5852 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.25 95 percent confidence interval: 0.1040808 1.0000000 sample estimates: probability of success 0.25
