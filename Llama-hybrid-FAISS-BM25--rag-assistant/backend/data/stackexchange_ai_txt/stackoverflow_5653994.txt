Ruby equivalent of NumPy

I'd like to be able to get averages, medians, percentiles, etc. I've been looking all over and can't find anything like it. I realize that Ruby isn't used very much in the scientific world, but there has to exist at least a very basic library in Ruby that does math, right?
