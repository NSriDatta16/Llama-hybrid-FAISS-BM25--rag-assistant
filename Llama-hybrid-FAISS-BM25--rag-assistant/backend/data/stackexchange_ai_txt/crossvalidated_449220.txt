Probability cut-off value for Logistic Regression

I'm doing a project in predicting default risk for SBA loans using R. My data has 187,986 positives and only 17796 negatives (9.46%). Clearly this is an imbalanced dataset. That's why when I run accuracy rate checking for my model using probability cutoff value=0.5, the accuracy result is way too low as below, > mytestset $LoanStatus_PIF LoanStatus_PIF=="PIF",1,0) > pred y_pred_num 0.5,1,0) > mean(y_pred_num==mytestset$LoanStatus_PIF) Result: [1] 0.009682553 When I change the cutoff value to 0.998 and up, the result is way much impressive: > y_pred_num 0.5,1,0) > mean(y_pred_num==mytestset$LoanStatus_PIF) Result: [1] 0.9997752 Question: 1. Will my model be rejected because I manually choose the cut-off value? Does 0.999 make sense for a cutoff value? As common cut-off value is usually 0.5. Thanks !
