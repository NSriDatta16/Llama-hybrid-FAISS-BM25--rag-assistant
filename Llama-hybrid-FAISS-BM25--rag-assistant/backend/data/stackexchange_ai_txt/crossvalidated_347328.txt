Unsupervised Clustering of words from documents in 2 clusters

I'm new to these fields of Machine Learning, and I'll have to use unsupervised clustering of texts, that is make two clusters of words from a document, but without using the widely used K-Means Clustering. I understand there are lots of other algorithms, but what could be the best unsupervised algorithmic choice for such a task, apart from K-Means ? Thanks in advance ...
