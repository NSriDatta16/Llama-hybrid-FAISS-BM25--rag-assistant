If @Tyler's method doesn't work, try putting a view right over the UIScrollView, and handle any horizontal swipes in that view's touchesBegan, and pass vertical ones to the next responder. You can be a little fuzzy and handle anything that has more of a horizontal movement than vertical as a horizontal swipe, and pass the more pure vertical swipes to the UISCrollView (via nextResponder).
