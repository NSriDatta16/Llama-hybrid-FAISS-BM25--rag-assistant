The two parts of a (two-part) UNION must have the same number of columns, and the types need to be the same or treatable as if they were the same. Your second part doesn't even have a FROM clause. And the final line is a separate query that should be separated from the previous one by a semi-colon. What you want is, more or less: SELECT a.artist, a.title, a.imgurl, a.id, MAX(i.price), MIN(i.price) FROM albums AS a JOIN inventory AS i ON a.id = i.albumId --WHERE ...conditions on artist or album... GROUP BY a.artist, a.title, a.imgurl, a.id Note how using table aliases allows the the select-list to fit on one line. It won't always, of course, but using aliases can provide succinctness, and encourages tagging all columns with the origin table, which helps make it explicit where the data comes from (thereby improving readability and clarity and other fine qualities).
