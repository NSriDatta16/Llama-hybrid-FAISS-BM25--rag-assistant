Django Python Macports

I installed Django via Macports. I wasted a lot of time on making it work. It still does not work. I would like to COMPLETELY uninstall Django (Macports) and install with the easy install (DJANGO). I would like to keep Macports and not uninstall it, because I read it SHOULD be useful. How can I achieve this? Thank you for your attention.
