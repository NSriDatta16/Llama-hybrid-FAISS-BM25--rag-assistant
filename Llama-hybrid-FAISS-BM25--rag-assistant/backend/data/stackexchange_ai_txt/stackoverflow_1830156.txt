Getting dynamic HTML output from another page on a server (perhaps file_get_contents)

I'm using the MVC framework CodeIgniter for my work, if it's relevant. In one of my pages/controllers, I want to capture the HTML outputted by another page on the site as a string (to use as an email or newsletter). I tried: $string = file_get_contents('http://www.examplesite.com/path/to/page'); But $string just becomes false , which the documentation says means it failed. I must be missing something tragic...
