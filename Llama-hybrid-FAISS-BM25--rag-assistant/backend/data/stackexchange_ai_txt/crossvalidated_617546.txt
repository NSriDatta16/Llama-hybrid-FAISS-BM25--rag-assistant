Interaction effects that are significant when the main effect is not is always a bit challenging to unpack. In brief, this means that, on average, there is no overall difference between treatment groups. However, if you were to look at the time trend for each group (from pre to post to follow-up), the trend will not be consistent for the two treatment groups. One example might be where the groups start out the same, then one treatment condition does better at post and they flip at follow-up. This is just one possible example...but the idea is that something changes in the progression of time for each comparison via treatment. Now, the interesting part is that RM-ANOVA is higher powered than your basic t-test. So, this means that you might do a t-test comparison at each time (comparing treatments), and none of the tests come up statistically significant. But, the interaction might be significant in the RM-ANOVA. While it will be difficult to tease apart exactly where the group difference might be, the RM-ANOVA is probably the better result to report. My suggestion would be to generate a means-plot for each treatment group for the different time points. This may be more informative at revealing the trending change over time for the two groups.
