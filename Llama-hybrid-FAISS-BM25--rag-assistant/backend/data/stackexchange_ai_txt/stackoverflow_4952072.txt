Jim, I am Ken Chan the primary architect of the Quadrilateralized Spherical Cube (QLSC). You can look up Google for many references to the 1975 report "Feasilibilty Study of a Quadrilateralized Earth Data Base" which I co-authored with my colleague Mike O'Neill. I did all the formulation and mathematical analysis and Mike did all the software design and coding. I still have the report somewhere. I believe the code is in an appendix in the back, but I cannot testify to that. There was an earlier report "Organizational Structures for Constant Resolution Earth Data Bases" in 1973 which I co-authored with two other colleagues (Paul Beaudet and Leon Goldshlak) at Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). Leon was the project manager. Paul proposed one structure and I proposed four. The QLSC was one of my four conceptualizations and was subsequently chosen by the Navy for adoption. No code was developed for any of these models. I have been away from that area of work for more than 35 years but I was aware that NASA Goddard in Greenbelt, Maryland eventually used QLSC for its COBE mission. I also became aware that the QLSC (or some derivative of it) was used by astronomers and astrophysicists in the US and Europe for star-mapping because of its equal area properties as well as its heirarchical indexing scheme. Lately, I have also become aware that the basic organizational structure has been used in Hyperspectral Data Management and Compression. I just turned 70 years old a few days ago and nothing makes me feel more satisfied that I am leaving behind something that other people can use. The thought of patenting it never crossed my mind when I developed the approach. Also, the thought of naming it the "Chan Spherical Cube" (to be abbreviated CSC) was rejected by Computer Sciences Corporation and by me. I hope this gives you some idea of the history of the QLSC.
