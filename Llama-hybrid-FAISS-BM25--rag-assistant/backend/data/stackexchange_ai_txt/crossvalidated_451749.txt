xtmelogit vs. glmer different results

My dataset (long format) contains of data collected in 4 studies. Although the variables in the studies were identical, I want to account for the substantial heterogeneity of the populations between these studies and thus treat "study" as a random effect. In each study, participants were randomly presented with 25 binary choices (0/1). I want to test whether attitudes and trait self-control predict making choice 1. Thus, my logistic regression model should account for the fact that each subject made 25 decisions and that the subjects were nested within one study. To test this, I used R: model and I tried the same with stata. After having defined the panel with xtset, I tried: xtmelogit depvar attitude selfcontrol || study: The coefficients are extremely different (and thus also the plots differ)! Is one of the models wrongly defined? Even if I try to change things like laplace approximation, the results just does not even get close to similar.
