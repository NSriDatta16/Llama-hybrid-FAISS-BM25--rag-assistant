Repeated-measures anova and linear mixed effects models with nonrandomized data

I have data from 7 subjects ( id ) who performed 3 trials of each of 2 different kinds of movement ( Factor mov ) under 2 different medication states ( Factor med ) while EMGs were being recorded. Say the dependent variable is the average amplitude during movement of the rectified EMG averaged across the 3 trials, and let's call this amp . There was no randomisation, each subject performed each kind of movement under each medication state. I want to test the movement kind and medication effects on amplitude and I have the following 3 questions: (1) In this design, should id be called a factor? If so, is this a 2x2x7 factorial design? (2) Is this design what's called fully crossed? If so, i.e. there is no nesting, would this anova be invalid aov(amp ~ mov*med + Error(id/(mov*med)), data=myData) ? According to this blogpost , Error(id/(mov*med)) means that mov and med are crossed, but they are nested within id , which would be wrong in a nonrandomised design. Is this right? (3) Is it valid to use the model lmer(amp ~ mov*med + (1|id), myData) with a nonrandomised design?
