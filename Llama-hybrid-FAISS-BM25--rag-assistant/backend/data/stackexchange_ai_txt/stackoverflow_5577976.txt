I've been able to solve it by creating a subclass of the tableView. I have overwritten the touchesBegan, Ended methods where I set a global bool variable called gIsTouching, to YES at began and to NO at ended (important: you have to set this variable before calling [super touchesBegan...] and [super touchesEnded...]). Then in the custom cell's setSelected method I don't do anything if gIsTouching is YES, otherwise I make the selection. Hope this helps others with similar issues.
