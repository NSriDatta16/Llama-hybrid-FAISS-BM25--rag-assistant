Scree plot: $m$ vs $m-1$ components/factors

@ttnphns comments here that there exist two expositions of the Cattell scree-plot rule: If the "elbow" is the m-th eigenvalue, (1) choose to extract m components; or (2) choose to extract m-1 components. Nobody knows which's better - because the whole rule is so much heuristic. Even though it may well be the case that some 7 years later this question still remains not researched, I am curious about the matter. When I was in graduate school I was taught to take $m$ components, but it seemed intuitively strange to me since often we see plots like the following Since the fourth component is "with the rubble" this seems to support a 3-component solution, and the IBM website I took that plot from says "The scree plot confirms the choice of three components." However, the rule I've been taught would say the answer should be four. What are the arguments for $m$ vs $m-1$ , and vice-versa? Does the answer change if we are using scree plots in relation to factor analysis (as is commonly done, since criteria from PCA are often used to select the number of factors in factor analysis)? I am aware that other methods of selecting components/factors have a better reputation than scree plots. But still the question seems relevant since scree plots remain often used.
