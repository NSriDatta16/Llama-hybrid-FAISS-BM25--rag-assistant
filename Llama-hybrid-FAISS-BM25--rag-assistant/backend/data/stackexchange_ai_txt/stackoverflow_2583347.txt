C# HttpListener without using netsh to register a URI

My application uses a small webserver to server up some files and have a web interface for administration remotely. Right now the user has to use netsh to register the URI like so netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:1233/ user=Chris-PC\Chris Which is no fun for the average user. I'd like the program to be able to listen on any port specified by the user from my program without the end-user needing to using command prompt. Is there anyway to accomplish this short of just using Process.Start and running command prompt myself?
