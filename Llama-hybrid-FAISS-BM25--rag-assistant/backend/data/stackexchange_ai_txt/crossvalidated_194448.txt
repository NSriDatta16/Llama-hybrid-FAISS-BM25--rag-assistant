Do you have to adhere to the likelihood principle to be a Bayesian?

This question is spurred from the question: When (if ever) is a frequentist approach substantively better than a Bayesian? As I posted in my solution to that question, in my opinion, if you are a frequentist you do not have to believe/adhere to the likelihood principle since often time frequentists methods will violate it. However, and this is usually under the assumption of proper priors, Bayesian methods never violate the likelihood principle. So now, to say you are a Bayesian does that confirm one's belief or agreement in the likelihood principle, or is the argument that being a Bayesian just has the nice consequence that the likelihood principle does not get violated?
