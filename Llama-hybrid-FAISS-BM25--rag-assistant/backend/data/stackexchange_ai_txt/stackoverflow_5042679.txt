The main problem I was having is that I needed to create a EditorFor type mechanism in order to format the decimal like a currency (our system has multiple currencies so "C" would not have been appropriate), get a tab index working AND allow the system to maintain the standard validation. I've managed to achieve that using the following. By creating my own custom editor control. Create a file (mine is called decimal.ascx) within the Views/Shared/EditorTemplates directory of your project. " %> Essentially, this code just overrides what would normally be presented in a "decimal" EditorFor method with the; template. My calling code now reads; Model.MyItem, new { tabindex = 5 })%> The result is the following code on the page. Which is exactly what I required. Whilst this is only true for my particular circumstances, I would encourage anybody looking to solve this issue to attempt a custom control first for the task as it might save you a considerable amount of time. If would of course be possible in the code to create a specific type of control required and adjust the results around that. For example; we could simple add another item in the call to determine the text format. new {tabindex = 12, numberformat=2} Then simply create a handler for all the formats.
