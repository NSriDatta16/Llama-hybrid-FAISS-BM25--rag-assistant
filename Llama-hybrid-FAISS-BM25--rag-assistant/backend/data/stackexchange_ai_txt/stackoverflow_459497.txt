Go through the toolbox and for each custom control that you see that you want to hide, add the following attribute above the class: [ToolboxItem(false)] Of course, this is a compiled attribute and will affect everyone using the code, so I only recommend doing this for controls that don't make drag-drop sense. Otherwise, you will probably make someone that loves that control very very angry. :)
