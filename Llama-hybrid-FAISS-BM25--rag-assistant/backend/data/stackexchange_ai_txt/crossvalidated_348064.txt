What kinds of algorithms work well with hundreds of thousands of output classes?

I have a limited amount of data for each class (about 100 samples), but I have about 100000 such classes. What kind of classification algorithm would work on this? (Apart from a NN with hierarchical Softmax) Edit: I have about 100 data samples in the least frequent class. The final idea is to take a sample and assign a class to it. The actual data is textual and I am using glove 50d but with a PCA I can reduce them to about 10 (first component is about 30% of my info.). The situation is that I have a huge amount of data split into a large number of classes with each class having about 100 samples. Think of it as Authorship Attribution with 100k authors. Let me know if you have more questions.
