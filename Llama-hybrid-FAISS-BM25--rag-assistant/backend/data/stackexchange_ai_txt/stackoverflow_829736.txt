If it is an important feature for you that users have access to their preferences while offline, then it looks like isolated storage is the way to go for you. If it's more important that users be able to save preferences even if they have turned off isolated storage (is this really a problem? I'd be tempted to call YAGNI on this, but I'm not terribly experienced with the Silverlight platform...) then you need to host a database. If both are important, then you're probably looking at some kind of hybrid solution; using isolated storage if available, then falling back to a database. In other words, I think the needs of your application are more important than some abstract best practice.
