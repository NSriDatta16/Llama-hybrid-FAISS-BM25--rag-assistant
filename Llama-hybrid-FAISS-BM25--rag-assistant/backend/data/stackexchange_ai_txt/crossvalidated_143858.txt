The validations for both the convergence of the Gibbs Markov chain and of the empirical average based on this Markov chain are (both) called ergodic theorems . For a Harris positive chain $(X_n)$, with invariant distribution $\pi$, an atom $\alpha$ is ergodic if $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\; |K^n(\alpha,\alpha)-\pi(\alpha)|=0 \;. $$ In the countable case, the existence of an ergodic atom is, in fact, sufficient to establish convergence according to the total variation norm, $$ \|\mu_1-\mu_2\|_{TV} = \sup_A \; |\mu_1(A)-\mu_2(A)| . $$ Proposition 6.48: If $(X_n)$ is Harris positive on $\mathcal{X}$ and denumerable, and if there exists an ergodic atom $\alpha\subset \mathcal{X}$, then, for every $x \in \mathcal{X} $, $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \; \|K^n(x,\cdot)-\pi\|_{TV} = 0 \;. $$ (extract from Monte Carlo Statistical Methods (2004), p.231) and Proposition 6.63: If $(X_n)$ has a $\sigma$-finite invariant measure $\pi$, the following two statements are equivalent: If $f,g\in L^1(\pi)$ with $\int g(x) d\pi(x)\neq 0$, then$$\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \; \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N f(X_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^N g(X_i)} ={\int f(x) \text{d}\pi(x) \over \int g(x) \text{d}\pi(x)} \;.$$ The Markov chain $(X_n)$ is Harris recurrent. (extract from Monte Carlo Statistical Methods (2004), p.241) None of those results requires i.i.d. sampling.
