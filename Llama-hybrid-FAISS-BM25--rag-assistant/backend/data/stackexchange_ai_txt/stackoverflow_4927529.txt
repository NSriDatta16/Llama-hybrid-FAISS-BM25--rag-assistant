Testing for IE with PHP

I am developing a web page that will be used in several different contexts, and while I normally avoid browser sniffing and conditional statements at all costs, there is just no way around it this time. I'm trying a simple method, and I was hoping I could get some feedback on whether this is a good idea or not. I am testing for the user agent and then echoing a class on the element in the html (in my case, a div) if the user agent is IE. Then in my css, I am doing something along the lines of this; .classone { display: inline-block; } .classone.classforie { zoom: 1; display: inline; } Note, the CSS isn't the important part, I just made that up for the sake of example. I'm just wondering if doing things this way is a good practice or not?
