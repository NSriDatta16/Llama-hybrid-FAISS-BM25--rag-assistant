Proving a Markov Chain (Random Walk) is Time-Homogeneous

Let $Y_0, Y_1,Y_2,... $ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. Then we define $X_n = \displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^{n} Y_j $ , $n=0,1,2,...$ . This is a Random Walk process. I would like to get help to prove that this is Time-homogeneous. For the Markov property, I considered increments of this process and proved that they are independent and then used that to deduce the Markov property. But I am unable to prove that the transition probabilities do not depend on time. Could anyone help me with this please? Thank You
