Your second example can’t work because a browser has to ignore the complete rule: When a user agent cannot parse the selector (i.e., it is not valid CSS 2.1), it must ignore the selector and the following declaration block (if any) as well. Opera and Webkit can’t parse the Gecko proprietary selector and Gecko can’t parse the regular ::selection. So the rule will never be applied.
