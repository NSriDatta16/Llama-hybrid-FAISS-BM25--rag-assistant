run .net consolapp out of a cgi script

i have written a simple cgi python script which looks like this #!c:/Python25/python.exe -u import cgi import os def main(): print "Content-type: text/html\n" form = cgi.FieldStorage() print form["firstname"].value os.execvp("D:\\path\\to\\my\\consolapp.exe", [""]) main() As you can se i'd like to start a consoleapp which i have written in .net. But my consoleapp crashs when i call the cgi script. So i did a little debuging and write a text file after some actions i do in my .net program. The result was that my programm crash everytime i'd like to open a access mdb file. It told me that i need the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). But i cant belive this message because my .net consoleapp runs without errors if i start it from my own. So can anybody give me some advise how i can call my .net consol ab through a webscript. I'm happy for every advise So it don't have to be a solution using a cgi script. Regards, Nico
