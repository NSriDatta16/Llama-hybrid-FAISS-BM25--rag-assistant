Actual the previously proposed answer does not quite answer the question as to why one would more likely see aberrations in the estimated variances between the two sets. The precise answer is that the sample variance and its associated standard deviation is generally speaking a more noisy statistic for distributions with large kurtosis. That is, the sample variance, and the standard deviation derived therefrom, could have a relatively larger variance than the sample mean depending on the distribution. In particular, per Wikipedia on the variance of the sample variance: $$ {\rm Var}(s^2) = ({2/(n-1)+ kurtosis/n})* sigma^4 $$ and per an approximation formula to compute the variance of the standard deviation (also discussed in the same Wikipedia reference) implies a value that would exceed the variance of the sample mean, $sigma^2$/n, when, per my calculations, the kurtosis is greater than 2. This would confirm the usual observation for exponential data of an increased in noise for the sample variance and standard deviation relative to the sample mean (which has special meaning in the case of exponential distributed data, as in the latter the sample standard deviation is an alternative nonlinear estimator of the mean as well). [EDIT] A interesting thought would be to examine a combined estimator with each estimate receiving weights, adding to one, based on the reciprocal of their respective expected variances. Such a weighting scheme, while different in incorporating a nonlinear and linear estimators, is somewhat related to an estimator based on a weighted average of order statistics, where the respective covariances of the order statistics are also included in the calculation, and may offer some benefit. I have since constructed a simulation spreadsheet of 100 groups of 11, for a total of 1,100 exponential deviates generated. Here is a somewhat typical result: Expected Mean: 2.000 Observed mean: 2.046 Observed Variance/Expected Variance of the group means for 100 iterations: .344/.364 Average of all the groups Standard Deviations: 1.961 Expected: 2.000 Observed variance of all the group standard deviations: .684 My computed expected variance of the group standard deviation per the approximation formula: .746 (I did observe an evident suggested high bias on this statistic) Average of Group variances: 4.523 Expected 4.000 Observed variances of the group's variances: 15.46 (observed to be very noisy) and finally, the expected value for the variance of the group variances per formula above: 11.93.
