I agree with what everyone is saying about using StringBuilder if you are doing lots of string concatenation because String is an immutable type, but don't forget there's an overhead with creating the StringBuilder class too so you'll have to make a choice when to use which. In one of Bill Wagner's Effect C# books (or might be in all 3 of them..), he touched on this too. Broadly speaking, if all you need is to add a few string fragments together, string.Format is better but if you need to build up a large string value in a potentially large loop, use the StringBuilder.
