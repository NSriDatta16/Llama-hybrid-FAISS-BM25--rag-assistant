Given a regression model, is there a way to evaluate confidence of a prediction?

What are methods for evaluating the predictive probability or something equivalent in a regression problem? In classification problems a predictive probability will be outputted given an input. For example in a neural network or a logistic regression if the problem is to classify a cat or a dog given a flattened image as a vector input into the model, it would output 70% dog and 30% cat and that could be used as a way to know how "confident" the model is in it's prediction. What is the equivalent in a non-classification regression problem and how is it calculated?
