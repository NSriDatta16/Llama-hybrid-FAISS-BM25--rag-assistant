You need to think more about the data and provide more information so we can help: is the missing pattern consistent in different time slot? From the information you provided, each time slot has random missing pattern, I assume you mean the missingness of a certain slot will not correlate with other time slots. what is the fraction of missing? if this fraction is small enough, you may consider throw them out or just fill in the mean value. From your information, one way I can think of is to estimate Poisson/negative binomial parameters from completes observations. e.g. X_ij where i means sample and j means time points. You first select non-missing X_ij, then the mean of these non-missing X_ij can be thought as an estimator under the Poisson distribution. Note: this naive method assumes random missingness and independence between time slots. For violations of these assumptions, you will need advanced techniques (i.e. imputation + time series).
