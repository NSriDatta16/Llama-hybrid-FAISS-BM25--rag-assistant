Multiclass classification with Neural Networks

Letâ€™s suppose I wanted to classify some input as one of three categories using a simple neural network. The output of my network are three columns (one for each possible category I assume) with values between 0 and 1. Moreover, the single rows add up to precisely one when adding the three columns together. Is is possible to interpret the output as the probability of my input belonging to each single category?
