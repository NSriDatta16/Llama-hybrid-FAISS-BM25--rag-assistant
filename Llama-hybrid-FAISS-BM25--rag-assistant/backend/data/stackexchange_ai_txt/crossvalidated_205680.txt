Correlation between monthly and quarterly data

Does anybody know how to measure the correlation between monthly and quarterly data? I would like to calculate the correlation between ISM PMI (monthly) and Real GDP growth (quarterly). So, the 2 time series have different frequencies, and different number of datapoints. The correlation between PMI and US Real GDP Growth with a 12 month time lag, is supposedly around 85%. How can this be calculated? If your answer should include an example, then preferably in R or Excel. Source data can be viewed and downloaded here: PMI : https://www.quandl.com/data/FRED/NAPM-ISM-Manufacturing-PMI-Composite-Index GDP : https://www.quandl.com/data/FRED/A191RO1Q156NBEA-Real-Gross-Domestic-Product
