Starting a debugging session in Silverlight takes a very long time

In my SL4 LOB app, I’ve probably hit F5 1000x or more with no problems. Suddenly, now hitting F5 can take up to 90 seconds before the app’s Startup event is raised. I’ve tried clearing the IE browsers cache, no help there. I created a new Navigation app with no code whatsoever, hit F5, started up immediately, great. I then began adding the same assembly references from my SL4 LOB app to the newly created navigation app. After each reference added, I would hit F5 to ensure the app is able to startup immediately; so far so good. Alas, I finally came to the System.Windows.Controls.Data.Toolkit.dll that caused the same behavior with my original SL4 LOB app. I removed the reference from the navigation app, and again, it would start up immediately. It’s only 33kb, so I can’t argue that I’m having problems with my symbol cache. Has anyone else seen this strange behavior? Any insight will be greatly appreciated.
