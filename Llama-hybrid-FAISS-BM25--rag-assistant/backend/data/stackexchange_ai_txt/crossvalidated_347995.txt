Since prior etymologically signifies before : prior adjective existing or coming before in time, order, or importance. "he has a prior engagement this evening" synonyms: earlier, previous, preceding, foregoing, antecedent, advance, preparatory, preliminary, initial. using the data to build the prior is not correct within a Bayesian perspective. It is found however in the "empirical Bayes" methodology, initiated by Robbins (1955) and defended by Efron , which uses first the data to estimate the parameters in a prior, like your Normal example, and a second time to run a pseudo-Bayesian analysis as if the prior was a true prior. Some versions of this approach enjoy convergence properties, for instance in semi- and non-parametric settings. The question however seems to shy away from this solution by making a single use of the data and separating it into learning and inference parts. This is connected with the construction of intrinsic Bayes factors in the 1990's, by Jim Berger and co-authors, where a fraction of the data is used to make a flat (or otherwise improper) prior into a proper posterior, and use the remaining fraction to compute a Bayes factor (and run a test decision). In order to avoid the choice of the partition impacting the final result, all possible permutations are considered and one form of average (among arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, median) is computed. A much more elegant alternative is O'Hagan's (1995) fractional Bayes factor where the likelihood $L(\theta)$ is replaced with a fractional power $L^\alpha(\theta)$, which is used to create a posterior and this posterior is then used as a prior for the remainder of the likelihood $L^{1-\alpha}(\theta)$. The difficulty with these approaches is in determining the "right" amount of partitioning, e.g., the value of $\alpha$.
