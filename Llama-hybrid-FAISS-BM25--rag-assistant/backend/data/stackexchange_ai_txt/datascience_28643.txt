In clustering the outcome variable or the response is unknown, this is why it's called clustering. Irrespective, of the fact the data being labeled or unlabelled, clustering can be applied as a data preprocessing algorithm. Essentially, you must proceed by employing the initial data preprocessing tasks (like missing value treatment, collinearity, skewness etc). Once, the data is "statistically clean", then you can apply any clustering technique. However, remember clustering requires data to be "grouped" such that data points within a group are related to each other and unrelated to other data points belonging to another group. This can be achieved only if you have a "statistically clean" data. The next important point to consider is, "how to determine the possible number of clusters". Because any clustering algorithm will divide the data points into groups oblivious of the fact whether the groups exist or not. Therefore, you will have to prove mathematically/statistically the occurrence of groups in the dataset. In literature, there exist several methods like the "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)" or the "elbow method". Once, you have determined such groups, you can then label the groups and perform predictive analytics.
