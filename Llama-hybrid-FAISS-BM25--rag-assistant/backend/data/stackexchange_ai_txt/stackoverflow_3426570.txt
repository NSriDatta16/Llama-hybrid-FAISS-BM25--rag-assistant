Buy One Get One Free Scripting Strategy in Magento

My objective is to create a buy xyz get xyz free, where x, y, and z are separate products. When purchasing EITHER x, y, or z, the customer can one of x, y, or z products for free. I've tried to create this function within Magento's price rules, but I have not had any success whatsoever. I've read pretty much everything on the internet regarding these rules and have gotten nowhere. I'm thinking about creating a page that allows the user to select the products they would like to purchase in sequence, then using that information to add a bundled cart item to the user's cart. There may be a simpler way, though, and I'm wondering if anyone has any insight. Please note that the items in question are configurable items with two attribute sets, just to make it interesting.
