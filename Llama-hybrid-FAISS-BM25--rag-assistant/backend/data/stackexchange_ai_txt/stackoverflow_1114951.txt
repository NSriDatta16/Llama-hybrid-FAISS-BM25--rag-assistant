How do I properly store data relationships with Microsoft Azure Table Storage?

Coming from a Relational world things are obviously very different with the Azure Table storage. The first major thing I've run into is how to properly store Many-to-Many relationships. For example, I may have a system that keeps track of Users and Books that they own. I found one other post here on SO that suggested to have a String Property on the User that basically stored a list of the Book IDs that the User owned. While I understand that sometimes this is an accepted way to store data, the problem is that Azure only allows you to store 64KB of data in a String. That definitely puts a limit how many Books a User could potentially own. Another possible solution is to have duplicate data. I may have a table that stores all known Books in the system. But when a User needs to be associated with a Book I copy the Book data into a different table called OwnedBooks which essentially is exactly the same as the Book table except it has a OwnedByUserID Property too. Are there other possible solutions? Besides this issue, does anyone have any good suggestions for other patterns and practices when using Azure table storage?
