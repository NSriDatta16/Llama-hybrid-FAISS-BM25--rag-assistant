Cross validation of averaged binomial GLMs ("model.avg" from package MuMIn)

I am spatially predicting binomial probabilities (using proportional data; cbind in R) across a spatial domain. I use the functions get.models followed by model.avg in the R package MuMIn to get averaged coefficients of models with delta AIC less than 2. This returns an object of class model list showing the component models and averaged coefficients. I would now like to use the cross validation cv.glm function (or any similar methods) from the R package boot to obtain leave-one-out cross validation prediction accuracy of this averaged model. However, I get the following warning when doing cv.glm(data, model.avg output) : Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : could not find function model.avg.default. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide suggestions on how to obtain leave one out cross validation on averaged models from the MuMIn package. Thank you.
