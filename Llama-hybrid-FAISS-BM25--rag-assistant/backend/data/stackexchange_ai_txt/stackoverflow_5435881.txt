XSLT processing recursion depth

First of let me state that I have no clue of XSLT at all. I was given a task to investigate some JVM dumps of a Java OutOfMemory exception that occurred during XSLT processing. I have found that the OutOfMemory occurred during recursive XSLT processing (we use XALAN). What I found shocking was that the recursion was >100 000 calls deep. What are the circumstances under which can a recursion this deep during XSLT processing be acceptable? Note that the thread stack trace is about 300k lines long and filled with a variation of this until the moment the OutOfMemory occurs: at org/apache/xalan/transformer/TransformerImpl.executeChildTemplates(Bytecode PC:150(Compiled Code)) at org/apache/xalan/templates/ElemElement.execute(Bytecode PC:352(Compiled Code)) at org/apache/xalan/transformer/TransformerImpl.executeChildTemplates(Bytecode PC:150(Compiled Code))
