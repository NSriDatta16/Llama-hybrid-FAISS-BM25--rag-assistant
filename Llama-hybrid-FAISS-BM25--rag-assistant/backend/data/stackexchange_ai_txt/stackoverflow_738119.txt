Is your application internal or do you have an external customer? If a client is paying for your work on and support of the application, it may be difficult to get them to sign off on cards like the ones you suggest. Also, with your second card idea, it might be hard to say what "Done" is. A specific approach to your issue could be Defect Driven Testing - the idea is that when you get a bug report and estimate the card that says to fix it, see what test(s) you can add in at the same time that are similar but increase coverage. And you don't specifically ask for technical details about how to get your project under test, but this book is very helpful once you start actually doing it: Working Effectively with Legacy Code
