Rounding doubles - .5 - sprintf

I'm using the following code for rounding to 2dp: sprintf(temp,"%.2f",coef[i]); //coef[i] returns a double It successfully rounds 6.666 to 6.67, but it doesn't work properly when rounding 5.555. It returns 5.55, whereas it should (at least in my opinion) return 5.56. How can I get it to round up when the next digit is 5? i.e. return 5.56. edit: I now realise that this is happening because when I enter 5.555 with cin it gets saved as 5.554999997. I'm going to try rounding in two stages- first to 3dp and then to 2dp. any other (more elegant) ideas?
