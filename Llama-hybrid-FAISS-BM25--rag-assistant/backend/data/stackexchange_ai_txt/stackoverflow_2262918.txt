It may be impossible to get this right. However, it is possible to make the tags look like single line breaks, by removing the built-in margin around paragraph tags, using CSS: p { margin: 0; } There is a drawback to this approach: if the user needs to copy/paste text in the contentEditable element, the text may appear to be single-spaced inside the element but double-spaced outside the element. Worse, in at least some cases, IE will automatically detect double-line breaks during paste, replacing them with tags; this will mess up the formatting of the pasted text.
