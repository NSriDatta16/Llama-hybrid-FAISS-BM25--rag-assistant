Negative GVIF values in multinomial logistic regression in R

I'm trying to check the vif for a multinomial logistic regression with categorical as well as continuous variables as explanatory variables. I'm using the function vif() from car package in R. However the values of the GVIF are coming very large and negative, it also gives a warning "No Intercept: vifs may not be sensible". Please explain what is meant by a negative vif value here and also if there is any other way to check the VIF of a multinomial logistic regression.
