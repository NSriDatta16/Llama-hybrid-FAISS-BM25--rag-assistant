Don't. It is neither a clean nor a recommendable way to organize ActionScript code in your project. Use classes and packages the way they were intended: for object-oriented programming. In fact, you should use frame actions only if you have minor tasks to do, especially controlling the timeline ( stop(); and such), or to create or remove objects at a point in time. If you want your frames to spawn new behavior, create and/or remove class instances on the stage instead - they can be transparent or fill the entire stage, so they will not be noticed by users, but your program will have proper encapsulation. You can attach a Class to each MovieClip in your library, so you can put one in each frame of your timeline, and you can even edit the timeline of that MovieClip, if you want to. Whichever you decide, you should read up on object-oriented programming in ActionScript here .
