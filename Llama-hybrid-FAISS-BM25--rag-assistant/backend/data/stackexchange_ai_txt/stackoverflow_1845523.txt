No, you didn't miss a general purpose class. I have a Range type in MiscUtil which you may be interested in - and it certainly makes for simple DateTime manipulation. Referring to Marc's answer, I can't remember whether this is a struct or a class - you'd be welcome to change it of course. It's nice and easy to step through, due to Marc's generics shenanigans (assuming you're using .NET 3.5, at least - it's feasible with 2.0 but not supported at the moment); Range range = 19.June(1976).To(DateTime.Today); foreach (DateTime date in range.Step(1.Days()) { // I was alive in this day } (That's also using a bunch of extension methods - more useful for test than production.) To address the other point in Marc's answer, Noda Time will certainly be able to express the concept of a date more appropriately than the .NET API, but we don't have anything like a range at the moment... It's a nice idea though - I've added a feature request .
