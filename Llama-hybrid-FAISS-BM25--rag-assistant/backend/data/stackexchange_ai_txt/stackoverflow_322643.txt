These are some of the UI features that I often find are done badly, or are even missing: Restoring window state properly . Conforming to the average (non-beginner, non-expert) user's mental model. Restricting the number of choices that the user has to make. Restricting the amount that users have to read while using the app. Strong consistency with other apps of the same genre running on the same platform. A well-done Undo / Restore facility. As somebody else remarked, context-sensitive help. Allowing an app to be navigated without the aid of a mouse. Good multi-monitor support.
