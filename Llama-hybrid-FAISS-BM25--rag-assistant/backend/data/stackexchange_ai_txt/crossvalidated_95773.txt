20% of 147 months is 30 months, which means that at you have over 2 years of data. If the trend began in the middle of last year, then it exists within that 2 year time frame. If you feel that your forecast is not capturing your trend, then it is probably because you smoothed too much. If you used the average instead of the drift or seasonal method, then it unlikely went uncaptured. The problem isn't with your sample size but with your method of forecasting - and specifically how much smoothing you are doing.
