I thik that int will be very good for it. The range of INTEGER is - 2147483648 to 2147483647. also you can use UniqueIdentifier (GUID), but in this case table row size limit in MSSQL storage + memory. Imagine you have tables with 10000000 rows and growing flexibility: there are T-SQL operators available for INT like >, GUID is not optimized for ORDER BY/GROUP BY queries and for range queries in general
