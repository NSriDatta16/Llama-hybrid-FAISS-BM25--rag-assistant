I'm working on something like this and my solution was to run the script-ables inside an iFrame that points to a subdomain (http://bar.foo.com) instead of the main site (http://foo.com). Input is provided to the script via url #fragment#identifiers and output is provided through the URL fragment identifier of a nested, invisible iFrame pointing back at the original name. Remember, you can set a child frame's URL even if you can't see it, and you can always check a frame's specific URL if it's on the same domain.
