The do notation is basically a way of saying "transform to lambdas as needed and distribute >>= between the lines". When it's obvious what operator is being used to roll everything up, it's nice to omit and leverage the "newline" operator. Programmable newline would be nice way to approach makings list, applicative chains, &c. To make lists, you'd also need a "programmable outdent". Really, you could just take the three meaningful bits and make them all overloadable: Begin of do . In between do s. End of do . Then you probably shouldn't call it do anymore. Maybe it should just be a bracket.
