Unfortunately, this doesn't help. I need to know which handler inside the ui.draggable (or actually: ui.helper ) element is being used. Pseudo-Code: //return the id of the handler currently used to move the element $(":handler", ui.helper).attr("id"); However I have solved the problem by just adding another draggable element. It's too bad though.
