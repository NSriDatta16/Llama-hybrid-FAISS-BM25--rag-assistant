Rule of thumb for automatically determining if a signal has seasonality and its periodicity from ACF?

I have around 1000 different time series, where I want to detect if each time series has seasonality in it, so that I can perform seasonal decomposition. I want to try and automatically determine if seasonality is present based on the ACF of the signal. I only want to say that it is seasonality if there is a clear and distinct peak in the ACF, so that it is robust against noise and trend. I am then using the function find_peaks from scipy.signal which is meant to be able to automatically find the peaks of a signal, problem is that there are many parameters you can fine tune. I was hoping that there exists some rule of thumb for how to set these parameters in order to pick up seasonality even if there are some small level shifts or noisy data. So basically what I am wondering, those anyone have any experience or ideas on how to correctly set these parameters, and which would be the most important for the task at hand? The parameters I am able to tune are height . Required height of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required height. threshold Required threshold of peaks, the vertical distance to its neighboring samples. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required threshold. distance Required minimal horizontal distance (>= 1) in samples between neighbouring peaks. Smaller peaks are removed first until the condition is fulfilled for all remaining peaks. prominence Required prominence of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required prominence. width Required width of peaks in samples. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required width. wlen Used for calculation of the peaks prominences, thus it is only used if one of the arguments prominence or width is given. See argument wlen in peak_prominences for a full description of its effects. rel_height Used for calculation of the peaks width, thus it is only used if width is given. See argument rel_height in peak_widths for a full description of its effects. plateau_size Required size of the flat top of peaks in samples. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied as the maximal required plateau size.
