Your problem is that you're using a Block, that has no getStoreCategories() method. $this - is a reference to your manually created block. Magento has high level of abstraction so every problem here can be solved in different ways. Use: Mage::helper('catalog/category')->getStoreCategories() Instead of: $this->getStoreCategories() When it works - better create getStoreCategories() in your block and move this code to it - as supposed by Magento architecture.
