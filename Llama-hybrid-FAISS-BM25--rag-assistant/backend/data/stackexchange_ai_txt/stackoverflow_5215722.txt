One memory location in a computer stores how much data? It depends on the computer. A memory location means a part of memory that the CPU can address directly. Whats the basic unit of memory storage in a computer? It is the Bit , and then the Byte , but different CPUs are more comfortable addressing memory in words of particular sizes. For Example to a store a integer what will be the memory addresses required? If basic unit is BYTE the integer requires 4 bytes. In mathematics, the integer numbers are infinite, so infinite memory should be required to represent all/any of them. The choice made by a computer architecture about how much memory should be used to represent an integer is arbitrary. In the end, the logic about how integers are represented and manipulated is in software, even if it is embedded in the firmware. The programming language Python has an unbounded representation for integers (but please don't try a googol on it). In the end, all computer architectures somehow allow addressing down to the Byte or Bit level, but they work best with addresses at their word size, which generally matches the bit-size of the CPU registers. It is not about the amount of data, or the size of integers, but about the number of memory addresses the computer can use. There are 4GiB addresses (for bytes) in 32 bits. To manage a cluster of machines with more than 4GiB of RAM, each system must manage larger addresses. Again, it is all about the addressable memory space, and not about the size of integers. There were 64 bit integers even when CPUs preferred 8bit word addressing.
