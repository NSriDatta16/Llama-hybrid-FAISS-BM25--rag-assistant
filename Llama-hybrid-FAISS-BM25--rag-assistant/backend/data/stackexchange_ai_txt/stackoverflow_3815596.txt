A fairly quick and dirty demo shows a 1-5ms discrepancy between the two approaches, and is inconsistent between which is the faster. I imagine that the test could be much improved though. Anyway, over ten page-loads (all times are in milliseconds): page load | $('#foo td.one[title=baz]') | $('#foo td[title=baz].one') --------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------- 1 | 9 | 8 2 | 7 | 6 3 | 8 | 8 4 | 8 | 8 5 | 8 | 7 6 | 8 | 8 7 | 7 | 11 8 | 8 | 7 9 | 7 | 7 10 | 8 | 8 --------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------- total | 78 | 78 So...insofar as I can conclude anything from that, it appears that $('#foo td.one[title=baz]') is marginally faster, but, on average they come out about the same.
