There are many options. Here are several: Use NumPy, instead of pure Python. Make sure to compile NumPy with an optimized BLAS library. Use a framework like Dask to read only a part of the matrix at a time from disk. Choose a different method query expansion that does not require the inverse. Use the pseudoinverse. Choose a smaller embedding space. Reduce the precision of the numerical values.
