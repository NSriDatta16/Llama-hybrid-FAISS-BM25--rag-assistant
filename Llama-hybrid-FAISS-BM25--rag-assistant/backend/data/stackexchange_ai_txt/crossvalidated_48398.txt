Quick and dirty Monte Carlo estimate in R of the length of a game for 1 player: N = 1e5 sample_length = function(n) { # random game length x = numeric(0) while(length(unique(x)) Results: $\hat{\mu}=14.684$, $\hat{\sigma} = 6.24$, so a 95% confidence interval for the mean is $[14.645,14.722]$. To determine the length of a four-player game, we can group the samples into fours and take the average minimum length over each group (you asked about the maximum, but I assume you meant the minimum since, the way I read it, the game ends when someone succeeds at getting all the numbers): grouped_lengths = matrix(game_lengths, ncol=4) min_lengths = apply(grouped_lengths, 1, min) Results: $\hat{\mu}=9.44$, $\hat{\sigma} = 2.26$, so a 95% confidence interval for the mean is $[9.411,9.468]$.
