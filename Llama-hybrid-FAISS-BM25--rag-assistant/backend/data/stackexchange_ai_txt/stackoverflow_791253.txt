Fastest way to update namespaces with ReSharper?

I have been doing some refactoring and reorganization and I have moved a bunch of files around. I want to update each file so it has the "correct" namespace according to its new location. With ReSharper, I can go into each file and it shows me that the namespaces is incorrect but that way I have to do it each file at a time. Is there anyway to update namespaces across every file in a folder or a project?
