At first glance this looks like a multivariate linear regression type of problem - predict a variable based on the value of several other variables. Tensorflow/Keras has a good online tutorial here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression This is probably the simplest way to get started. IF this is actual time series data where there is a trend over time, possible seasonality, and the value at one point in time is dependent on previous values, then there are also a whole set of ARIMA/SARIMAX methods - https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_sarimax_stata.html Kaggle has a great introduction to time series methods here: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series
