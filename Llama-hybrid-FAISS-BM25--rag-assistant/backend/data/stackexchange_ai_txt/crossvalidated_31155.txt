Or does every simple tool have to fall into exactly one of those two categories? No. Simple (and not so simple tools) can be studied from many different viewpoints. The likelihood function by itself is a cornerstone in both Bayesian and frequentist statistics, and can be studied from both points of view! If you want, you can study the MLE as an approximate Bayes solution, or you can study its properties with asymptotic theory, in a frequentist way.
