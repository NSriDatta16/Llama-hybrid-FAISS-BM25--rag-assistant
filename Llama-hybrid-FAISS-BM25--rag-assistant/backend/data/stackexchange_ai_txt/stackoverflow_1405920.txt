Why does "enable-shared failed" happen on libjpeg build for os X?

I'm trying to install libjpeg on os X to fix a problem with the Python Imaging Library JPEG setup. I downloaded libjpeg from http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v7.tar.gz I then began to setup the config file cp /usr/share/libtool/config.sub . cp /usr/share/libtool/config.guess . ./configure –enable-shared However, the enable-shared flag didn't seem to work. $ ./configure –-enable-shared configure: WARNING: you should use --build, --host, --target configure: WARNING: invalid host type: –-enable-shared checking build system type... Invalid configuration `–-enable-shared': machine `–-enable' not recognized configure: error: /bin/sh ./config.sub –-enable-shared failed I've done lot's of google searches and I can't figure out where the error is or how to work around this error.
