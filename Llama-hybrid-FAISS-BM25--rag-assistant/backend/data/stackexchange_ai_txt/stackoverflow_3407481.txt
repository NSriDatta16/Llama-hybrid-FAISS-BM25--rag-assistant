Actually, you want to map a single conceptual property to a couple of storage columns. There is a code that will concatenate the values from columns into property, so far so good. But let's imagine the process of adding a new Entity to the context. So, we have set a value for the property. How should EF know the rule to write the value of this property to both columns? Not sure this scenario is possible to implement.
