If your data is stationary, then yes, based on the information you provided it seems OK to use $\text{lag}=1$. If your data is nonstationary, you should follow Toda-Yamamoto procedure described very explicitly and clearly in Dave Giles' blog post . There are certain important points to pay attention to with respect to lag order selection under cointegrated data (see especially basic steps 5. and 8. of the Toda-Yamamoto procedure in the above source).
