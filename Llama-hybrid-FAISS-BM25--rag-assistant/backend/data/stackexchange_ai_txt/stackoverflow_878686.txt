Don't mess with build settings. Instead, add a "Copy Files" build phase to the framework target. In the inspector for the copy files build phase, set the directory to "Resources". Add the plugin to this build phase by dragging the plugin product from the "Products" group in the "Groups & Files" tree in Xcode.
