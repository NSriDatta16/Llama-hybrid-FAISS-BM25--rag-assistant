Environment.getDataDirectory() should not be of interest to you. This is Android's private data directory, and there's really no reason for any app to access it. If anything, use Context.getFilesDir() . But keep in mind that even that is by default private to your app, so other applications (including the media store) will not be able to access it. That said, you always have the option to make files world read or writeable. EDIT: You can use Context.getDir() with Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE to write a directory that other apps can write into. But again, I question the need to store image data in local storage. Users won't appreciate that, unless users are expected to not have their SD card mounted while using your app (which is not common).
