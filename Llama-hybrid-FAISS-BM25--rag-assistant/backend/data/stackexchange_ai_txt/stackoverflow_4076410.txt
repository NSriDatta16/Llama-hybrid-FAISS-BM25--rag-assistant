if you're open to splitting twice: my @g = (split ' ', $test_str)[1..split(' ', $test_str)]; or more correctly (since split returns the number of fields found (one more than the last field's index since it is 0-based): my @g = (split ' ', $test_str)[1..split(' ', $test_str)-1]; unfortunately these throw a deprecated warning under 'warnings' pragma, and clobbers the contents of @_ (unless you're using 5.12, then you're good, otherwise go with a temporary variable, inline sub or a loop).
