NSTextView - drawing custom glyphs that can't be edited

I'm making an outliner using NSTextView. The outline: method on NSTextView doesn't quite capture what I need, so I've rolled my own using the typesetter/formatter. Now, I need to show the outline symbols next to each line fragment. How do you draw these symbols in such a way that the user cannot edit them? Any thoughts? Thank you for your time! EDIT I don't want the cursor to be able to even cross the outline symbols (symbols like â€¢, i, 1, etc). I'm thinking I will need to draw custom line fragments that can't be selected. Or perhaps overlay some other view that draws the symbols. I might even want symbols next to these outline symbols that can collapse outline elements. I'm looking more for architecture solutions than particular methods.
