I have never used pcapy before, but I do have used libpcap in C projects. As the pcapy page states it is not statically linked to libcap, so you can upgrade to a newer one with IPv6 support. According to libpcap changelog , version 1.0 released on October 27, 2008, has default IPv6 support (it is supposed to have IPv6 from much longer but it is now default compiled with that option), so you should be able to capture IPv6 traffic with this version. Latest pcapy release is from March 27, 2007, so at most it should include a 0.9.8 version of libcap released on September 10, 2007. I don't know if that would be enough for you to be able to capture IPv6 traffic since pcapy API would probably requiere some changes to support it, and that's on pcapy developer's roof. Update : Apparently pylibpcap , a python wrapper to libpcap, has newer releases than pcapy, so newer libpcap features should be better supported. More information about PCAP (libpcap) in general here .
