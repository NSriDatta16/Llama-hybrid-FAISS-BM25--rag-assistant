You can do it pretty easily if you use some GUI for SVN. Personally I love TortoiseSVN for when I'm working in Windows. You just open up the "Repository Browser", right-click on some folder, and choose "Move...". Or, you have the option of doing it straight from within Windows Explorer, drag the files/folders you want to move with the RIGHT mouse button, when you drop them in their new location you'll get a menu, one of the options is "Move in SVN".
