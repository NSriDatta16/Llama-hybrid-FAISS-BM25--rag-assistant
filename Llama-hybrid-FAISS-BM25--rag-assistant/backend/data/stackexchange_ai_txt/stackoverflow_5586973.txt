Image Sizes on a Custom View

I was just wondering how images size when drawn on a view using canvas.drawBitmap(), do they stay the same as the raw Bitmap in the relevant drawable folder(LDPI, MDPI, HDPI) or do they scale relative to the screen size? In order to be constant over different screen sizes, do I need to manually scale the image using createScaledBitmap?
