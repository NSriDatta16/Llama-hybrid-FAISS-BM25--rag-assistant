You can download a free as in beer software Qlikview that allows you to do interactive data discovery via graphical interface similar to Excel but also featuring a powerful scripting language for data load and transformation. Huge flat files is no problem at all. It is an in-memory technology so you'd need a computer with a lot of RAM. The advantage though is that it can load billions of records in a star schema but still allows you to do discovery ad hoc (second or sub-second time) without writing and rewriting SQL. I am always using it to screen the data and run descriptive statistics + visual exploration on it. From Data Science standpoint this is a very advanced column based data engine integrated with a powerful dictionary of descriptive stat functions and interactive graphics UI. You will be surprised what is possible with your data.
