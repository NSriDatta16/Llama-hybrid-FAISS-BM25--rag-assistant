I have an MBA, and teach data mining at a top grad school. The term project this year was to predict stock price movements automatically from news reports. One team had 70% accuracy, on a reasonably small sample, which ain't bad. Regarding your question, a lot of companies have made a lot of money on pair trading (find a pair of assets that normally correlate, and buy/sell pair when they diverge). See the writings of Ed Thorpe, of Beat the Dealer . He's accessible and kinda funny, if not curmudgeonly. He ran a good hedge fund for a long time. There is probably some room in using data mining to predict companies that will default (be unable to make debt payments) and shorting† them, and use the proceeds to buy shares in companies less likely to default. Look into survival analysis . Search Google Scholar for "predict distress" etc in finance journals. Also, predicting companies that will lose value after an IPO (and shorting them. edit: Facebook!). There are known biases, in academic literature, that can be exploited. Also, look into capital structure arbitrage . This is when the value of the stocks in a company suggest one valuation, but the value of the bonds or options suggest another value. Buy the cheap asset, short the expensive one. Techniques include survival analysis, sequence analysis (Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, Sequential Association Rules), and classification/regression. And for the love of God, please read Fooled By Randomness by Taleb. † shorting a stock usually involves calling your broker (that you have a good relationship with) and borrowing some shares of a company. Then you sell them to some poor bastard. Wait a while, hopefully the price has gone down, you buy some more of the shares and give them back to your broker.
