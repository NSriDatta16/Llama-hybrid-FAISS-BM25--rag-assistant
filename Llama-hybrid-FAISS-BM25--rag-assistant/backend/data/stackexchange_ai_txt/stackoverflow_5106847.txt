Access JMX agents from non-Java clients

For some integration projects I would like to query JMX agents from non-Java clients. I found two options so far, ws-jmx-connector (Soap based) and mx4j and its JMX HTTP adaptor which returns XML document responses. The JSR 262 based ws-jmx-connector seems to be no longer in active development. I have not tried MX4J so I do not know if it is possible to use the HTTP adaptor with the standard JMX implementation in the J2SE. Are there other software projects which can help to connect non-Java clients with JMX agents, using open standard protocols? Update: meanwhile I found this project , a "Restful JMX Adaptor". It is also described in the article RESTful Access to JMX Instrumentation, Via URI-fication of MBean Attributes
