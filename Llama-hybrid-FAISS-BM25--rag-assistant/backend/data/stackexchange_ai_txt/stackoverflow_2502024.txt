Azure, SLAs and CAP theorem

Azure itself is imo PaaS and not IaaS. Do you agree? MS gurantees an availability of 99% and a strong consistency. You can find MS SLAs here: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/sla (three SLAs Uptime: http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/4889/unbenanntqt.png ) I can't find anyhing about how they are going to archive that. Do they do backups? If Yes: How do they manage consistency? According to the Cap theorem ( http://camelcase.blogspot.com/2007/08/cap-theorem.html ) their claims are not realistic. 2.1 Do you know detailed technical stuff about the how they are going to realize the claims about consistency and availability? On the MS page you'll find three SLAs .docs, one for SQL Azure, the second for Azure AppFabric/.Net Services and the third for Azure Compute&Storage.(Screenshot in 1.) How can one track whether SLAs are violated? Do they offer some sort of monitor, so I don't have to measure the uptime by myself?
