While there are many ways to start testing, there is no "best" way so there's no point in looking for that as a starting point. Search the web for a good tutorial on junit and do it. That will be the absolute best way to get started IMO. Don't get sidetracked with code coverage or integrating with Hudson or any of the other tasks that are on the periphery to testing. Focus on writing a handful (or 10) if tests first. Once you understand the basics you can start looking at other tools to see if they meet your needs any better or worse than junit.
