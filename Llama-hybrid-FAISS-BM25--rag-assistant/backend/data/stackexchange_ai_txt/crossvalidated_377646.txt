If someone is looking for such tools (like I am now), here are some links. These are not for databases but general python tools for association rule mining with transaction data. For class association rule mining there is CARMine . While not strictly for class association rule, there is Apriori , which is a more popular library specifically for rule association mining. The MLXtend machine learning support library offers apriori frequent itemset creation and association rule generation modules.
