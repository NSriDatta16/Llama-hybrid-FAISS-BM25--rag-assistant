When a DialogFragment is shown as a Dialog it is not actually a real Fragment in a container view. It is a container-less Fragment which is basically a wrapper of a Dialog . So no, you can not show a Fragment inside a FragmentDialog . If you really want to do this I think the best way would to create a new Activity styled as a Dialog which you can then add Fragments too.
