Bayesian model averaging for beta estimation

I am trying to apply BMA to estimate the beta of a certain stock by combining different models. One, simple model to estimate beta is this $$\beta_{i,T} = \frac{{\rm cov}(r_{i,t},r_{M,t})}{{\rm var}(r_{M,t})}$$ with $r_{i,t}$: return of the stock $i$ at day $t$ $r_{i,M}$: return of an market index $M$ at day $t$ I obtained data for the last 13 years for both variables: Now, to estimate the beta factor for the next year $T$(251 days), I am using the above formula and use the past 251 days for the market return $r_M,t$ and the stock return $r_i,t$. This is to obtain a forecast for the beta which will be observed in 251 days . If I calculate them in a rolling windows approach (1 day step forward) I get this: It is not very surprising that the forecast looks just as a 251-day forward-shift because the Model is a very naive model which assumend that the 1-year forward beta will be as the actual observed. Now I want to compute the Posterior Model Probabilites (PMP): $$p(M_j|y_{1:T}) = \frac{\big(\int{p(y_{1:T}|\theta,M_j)p(\theta|M_j)d\theta}\big)p(M_j)}{\sum_{l=1}^2\big(\int{p(y_{1:T}|\theta,M_l)p(\theta|M_l)d\theta} \big) p(M_l)}$$ Assuming equal model priors it more or less reduces to computing: $$\int{p(y_{1:T}|\theta,M_j)p(\theta|M_j)d\theta}$$ And here I am confused about how to do it. My data $y_{1:T}$ seem to be the realized data? What exactly are my $\theta$? $r_{i,t}$ and $r_{i,M}$? If I want to use Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) here, how to compute the maximimum likelihood?
