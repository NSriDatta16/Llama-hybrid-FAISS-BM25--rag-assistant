There is no difference between the zero that an object with static storage duration is initialised with and a zero that your code has explicitly set. A zero is just a zero. All you can do is explicitly initialise it with a non-zero non-valid number (in the .c file that defines it): foo.h: extern double foo; foo.c: double foo = NAN; Or, alternatively, accompany it with a flag variable that indicates if it's been initialised: foo.h: extern double foo; extern int foo_initialised; foo.c: double foo; int foo_initialised;
