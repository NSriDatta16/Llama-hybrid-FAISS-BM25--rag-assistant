Data exchange standards

There are international standards, which define various high-level aspects of information exchange in distributed systems. By "high-level" I mean describing how information should be organized and presented, what interfaces must be provided, how to communicate metadata etc. For example, energy utilities use OPC (DAIS), CIM; simulations have IEEE 1516 (HLA). May be some other industry has a well-developed standard for similar interactions?
