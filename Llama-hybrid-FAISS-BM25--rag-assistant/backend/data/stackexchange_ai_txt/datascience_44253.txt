Pre-processing on MRI images

I have MRI images of brain tumors collected from a hospital (not a benchmark dataset). And I am planning to use them to predict/classify tumour types using a typical machine learning approach: texture analysis for feature extraction to build a classification module. My question is, how to decide whether these images needs pre-processing or not, such as noise removal by using median filter for example? In other words, how to determine if there is noise in this data?
