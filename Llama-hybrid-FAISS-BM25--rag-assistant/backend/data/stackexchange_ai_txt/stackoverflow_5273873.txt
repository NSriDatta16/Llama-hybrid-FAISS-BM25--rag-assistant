As I am currently working on the Exchange EDB format I might could answer some question. I use libesedb as a basic source of information, but otherwise chose to access the EDB via the Extensible Storage Engine API (aka JetBlue, aka Esent API). So, if you can form some particular question I can try to answer it for you. By the way as I see you using .net as a tag to this post I would like to point your attention to Laurion Burchall's Managed Esent API (open source). It reduces somewhat the cryptic complexity of the Windows API and might be useful for you to keep it "managed": http://managedesent.codeplex.com/
