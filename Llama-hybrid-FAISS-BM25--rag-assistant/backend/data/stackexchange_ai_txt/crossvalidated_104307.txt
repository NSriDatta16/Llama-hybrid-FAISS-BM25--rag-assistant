This paper has a thorough run-down of what you're looking for. It includes a Gibbs sampler for posterior computation of a finite approximation of stick-breaking priors (the only tractable way to do it). If you are going to use MCMC, I recommend using label-switching moves to offset the prior weight on earlier stick segments. Basically you randomly permute the stick labels at the end of every MCMC step. This will improve mixing dramatically.
