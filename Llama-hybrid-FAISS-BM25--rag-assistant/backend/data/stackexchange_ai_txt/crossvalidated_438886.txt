Categorization of continuous predictor in logistic regression

I have one continuous variable GENETIC SCORE and one binary variable HEALTH (case vs control i.e. 0/1). I want to fit a log regression model to this data to get the odds ratio for different percentile categories of GENETIC SCORE variable. One way to do this is to simply use a continuous variable. However I want to get the result in the form of Percentile (%) - OR 1-5 - 0.40 5-10 - 0.49 10-20 - 0.59 20-40 - 0.77 40-60 - 1.00 60-80 - 1.29 80-90 - 1.65 90-95 - 2.03 95-99 - 2.52 .>99 - 3.60 Notice the baseline category 40-60 with OR = 1. So, my first guess (after a long research) is that GENETIC SCORE is categorized in 11 percentile groups. I am aware of all disadvantages of binning. But still, I want to get the results in this form. My main question here is: how do I setup the model with the desired baseline group? In other words; how do I setup the model in the way that OR is 1 for the middle percentile group (either with continuous or with categorized variable).
