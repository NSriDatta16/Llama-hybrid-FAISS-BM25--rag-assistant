MongoDB GridFS for HA file storage

I am working on a project where I need to store many user uploaded files and provide redundancy. For file uploads, I was first considering to place user uploaded files in a NFS "uploads" directory and use Gearman to grab the file, move it to it's permanent storage locations, then update MySQL with the files info (filesize, date...etc). Now that I have learned of MongoDB's GridFS, I am thinking this may be a better approach than NFS & Gearman. With GridFS, I don't need NFS and the redundancy is built in - but I would be putting a lot of trust into MongoDB. With this all said, I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts? Does anyone know of a large deployment of GridFS? I know many people are using MongoDB for NoSQL, but I have not found many references to GridFS deployments. Thanks!
