Using Controllers without the entire MVC Framework

I'm in the process of trying out a few things with MVC whilst designing a system and wanted to try and see if I could use the concept of Controllers outside of the MVC framework. When I say outside, I mean within my own C# service as opposed to a web-site. I started a simple console application to test the theory and it was simple enough to change the profile to a non-client profile, add in System.Web.Mvc , create a controller and have it return a JsonResult. The ease of which this got set up pleased me as that is half the work done if I want a service to respond with JSON. The next step is to set up a Http Server class, and I would love it if I could leverage the other part of the framework which will map incoming requests to my controllers. Unfortunately, this is the part where I am lost and I have no idea what code goes on behind to arrive at a particular controller's function with the parameters all in place. Has anyone got an idea on how to accomplish this, or a resource to look at? In short: I'd like to leverage the use of Controllers in my own service, running it's own HTTP Server.
