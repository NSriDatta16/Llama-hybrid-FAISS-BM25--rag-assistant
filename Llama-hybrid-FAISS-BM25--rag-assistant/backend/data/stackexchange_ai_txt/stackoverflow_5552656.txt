You can use py2app to compile an NSBundle which can be loaded at runtime (you could add this loadable bundle to your app bundle's PlugIns/ folder). However, while initially quite easy to get working, there appears to be a bug in PyObjC or py2app that leads to significant memory leaks depending on the API of your plugin (see http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1982104&group_id=14534&atid=114534 ). The harder but safer approach is to link against the Python.framework. You can then keep your .py files in the app bundle's Resources/ directory and load them via the standard CPython embedding API. Don't include only the .pyc files. The pyc format is an implementation detail that you shouldn't rely upon for future Python versions.
