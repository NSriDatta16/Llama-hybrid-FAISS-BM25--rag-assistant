These doesn't exist an absolute solution for the your question, but I can suggest you some techniques which may help. If I'm not wrong, then you're basically trying to interpret the English language into human emotions. There are complete theories written on the subject, and after doing a little bit of research, I've come up with two things that might prove to be handy in your case. Affective Computing The main idea is, that you collect the verbal data (as much as you can), and you apply machine learning algorithms (classification) on the verbal data to figure out whether the verbal data is related to "happiness", or not. You can think of as many important features as you can. One feature can be, that you can assign a number to each word, like (happy=1, happier=3, happiest=10)...this is just an example. Another feature can be, that you try to figure out "nots" and "negations" in your sentence, because "not happy" will obviously get you to a negative value in your feature. You can think of as many similar linguistic features as you can. After having a reasonable number of calculated features, you can simply apply the algorithms mentioned, and you may eventually get to a point. Sentiment Analyzer I just found this research paper, and it works with Natural Language Processing, and after processing the language, it analyzes the emotions of the person, or the source. You can go through the study by yourself.
