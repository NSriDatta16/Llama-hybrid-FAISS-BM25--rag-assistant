learning rate in reinforcement learning

Does anyone know how to get the learning rate from participant data? I'm computing all the expected values for all trials (=200) $$V_t(S) = V_{t-1}(S)+ \alpha \cdot \text{error }_t $$ $$(\text{error }_t = R_t âˆ’ V_{t-1}(S))$$ and then computing alpha at each trial using $$\alpha= (V_t(S) - V_{t-1}(S) )/ \text{error }_t$$ but it seems not the right way! Suggestions?
