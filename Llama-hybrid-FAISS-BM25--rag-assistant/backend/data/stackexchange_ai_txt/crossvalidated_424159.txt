You are correct in saying $ATT$ is not necessarily equal to the $ATE$ in observational studies due to randomization. Consider a variable $M$ that I will call an effect measure modifier. Consider the following relationship, $M$ changes the effect as such $E[Y(1) - Y(0)|M=0] > E[Y(1) - Y(0)|M=1]$ . For randomized trials, $M$ is distributed evenly between the treated and the untreated in expectation . Therefore, the proportion with $M$ will not differ between the treated and untreated. Because of this, the $ATE$ and $ATT$ will be the same in expectation in randomized trials. In your particular trial, the $ATE$ and $ATT$ may not necessarily be equal. For observational studies, there is no general expectation that $M$ would be evenly distributed among groups (it may be a confounder in this setting). If it is unevenly distributed, the $ATE$ and $ATT$ won't be the same. Using the above relation, if the treated group has more $M=1$ individuals, then the $ATT$ will be less than the $ATE$ . However, the $ATE$ and $ATT$ can be equal in observational studies as long as all $M$ are evenly distributed between the treated and untreated (a strong assumption). However, the estimand is still a population parameter. Like the $ATE$ , the $ATT$ is similarly a average effect and not an individual causal effect. The population is only the population of treated individuals for the $ATT$ . Why the $ATT$ may be preferred: the identifiability requirements for the $ATT$ are slightly weaker than $ATE$ since we observe all the potential outcomes under $Y(1)$ for the population of treated individuals. Therefore, we can rewrite the $ATT$ as $E[Y - Y(0)|A=1]$ where $A$ is the treatment.
