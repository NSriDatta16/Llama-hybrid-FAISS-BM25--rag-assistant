The htaccess file is incidental. You have been hacked by one of the Russian malware gangs. If you don't close the hole that allowed the hack to happen, you will just get hacked again. It is entirely possible that the server itself is compromised and there is more stuff on it you don't know about, such as trojan software that might not only deface your sites, but also launch attacks on others, send spam, and so on. Assuming appropriate permissions on the directory containing the htaccess file, it should not have been possible to write a file there even if you have an insecure web application on there. Certainly if you are only dealing with static files the only way such a file could have got there is by your uploading account, or the server itself being compromised. If it's your server, as I'm guessing from the fact it responds to a direct query by IP address, you need to flatten it and reinstall from up-to-date software, use new passwords, and check your own client machines you're uploading from for infections.
