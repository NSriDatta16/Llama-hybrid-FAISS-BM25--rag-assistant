This is a VPC? Can you install apps? http://www.jungledisk.com/ That's what we use - make a sql job that pushes out a backup every day, then use that service to push a copy back to Amazons S3 service. If not maybe you could have a local app that pulls the backup to a machine then pushes it /w S3 webservice, or still using Jungledisk. This is important! If your app goes down it hurts! Also make sure you backup your deployed app and resources stored there... i.e. uploaded content to your apps storage directory.
