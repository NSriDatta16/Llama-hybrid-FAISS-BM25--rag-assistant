Centralized Authentication and Authorization for several Web Services

There are several different web services -- various technologies used, such as Java, .NET, Python, Perl, and possibly more in the future -- belonging to different organizations, and the access to those web services has to be restricted. The idea is to have a central authentication and authorization server, only responsible for granting access to each WS. I'm looking for a Single Sign On system in which the user authenticates once with the auth server and is granted access to the web services for a limited timespan. The security requirements are high, so a username/password set isn't enough. In a quick search I found many different solutions and approaches to the problem, but I don't know the best one for this case -- a technology independent, secure and reliable solution.
