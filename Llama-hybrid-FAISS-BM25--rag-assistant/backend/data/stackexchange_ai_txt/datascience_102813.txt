You are correct - one hot encoding, by definition, increases your dimensions and (most likely) also the sparsity. Your numerical mapping can be rather misleading since e.g a random forest would interpret adult>child which, in the case of age, makes sense. But say the mapping was {1:"dog",2:"cat",3:"horse"} and not the age of it then 2>1 does not makes sense. When to use what depends on what task you try to solve, and what algorithm you want to use
