Can JPG's be imported into MapPoint?

Can anyone tell me if it is possible to import .jpg files into MS Mappoint Europe 2006 ? If it is possible can this be done by an OCX control ? I would like to import some aerial photography of an area into MapPoint to enhance the coverage of a small area, Thanks for your time Ian
