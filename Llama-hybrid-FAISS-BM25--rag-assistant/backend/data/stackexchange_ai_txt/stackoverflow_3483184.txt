How to efficiently identify a binary file

What's the most efficient way to identify a binary file? I would like to extract some kind of signature from a binary file and use it to compare it with others. The brute-force approach would be to use the whole file as a signature, which would take too long and too much memory. I'm looking for a smarter approach to this problem, and I'm willing to sacrifice a little accuracy (but not too much, ey) for performance. (while Java code-examples are preferred, language-agnostic answers are encouraged) Edit : Scanning the whole file to create a hash has the disadvantage that the bigger the file, the longer it takes. Since the hash wouldn't be unique anyway, I was wondering if there was a more efficient approach (ie: a hash from an evenly distributed sampling of bytes).
