Classification and hypothesis testing are different and been used differently . In most cases, people use "Classification"" to perform the task of "classifying something according to shared qualities or characteristics". And use "hypothesis testing" to verify some "significant discoveries". Note that, in hypothesis testing, the "null hypothesis" is "common sense", but if we can reject null hypotheses then we have a break though. This is why we have a more strict criteria in hypothesis testing. Think example of developing new drags, we want to be very careful to say the is significant and effective.
