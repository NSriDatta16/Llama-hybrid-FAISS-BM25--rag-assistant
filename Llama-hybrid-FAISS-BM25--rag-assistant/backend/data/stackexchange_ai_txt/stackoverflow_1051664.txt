This seems like the sort of thing that could get messy pretty quickly. You’re either going to end up maintaining multiple streams of the same codebase targeting different frameworks (in which case you’ll definitely want to consider branches in your SCM) or you’ll be decomposing functionality into classes which perform discrete tasks for different frameworks. I think it will mostly come down to how you expect the codebase to grow in the future. If you’re expecting limited changes to the superseded versions I’d just go ahead and branch with most of the new functionality going into the latest generation .NET to leverage the new language features. Most of your new features arrived in 3.0 and 3.5 so my preference would be to try and move customers towards them if possible; they get the new language and you get to focus your attention on building to predominantly one framework.
