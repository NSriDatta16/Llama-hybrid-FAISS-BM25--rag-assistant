I spent a little while reading the first couple of chapters of Koller & Friedman, and I wasn't happy with it as an introductory text. On several occasions, the book gives a motivating example, but the example cannot be understood without background material later in the chapter. This kind of exposition works for me only if the example explicitly says what upcoming material will be relevant; otherwise, the examples are just incomprehensible magic. That said, it's a hefty tome, and probably an excellent reference for practitioners. A student might have better luck with Neapolitan, "Learning Bayesian Networks".
