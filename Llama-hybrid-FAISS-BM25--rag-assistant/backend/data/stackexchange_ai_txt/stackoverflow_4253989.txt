Save the generated pdf directly to the server directory folder without user prompt

A friend of mine gave me this task so I can learn advance programming a little bit easier. I am currently doing convertion of an html page to pdf using itext sharp and email the pdf as an attachement. My idea is to save the pdf first to the server machine in the folder name ToBeEmailedPDF folder before using it as an email attachment. The thing that bothers me is that this dialog as what you can see in the picture shows up using the code that I have below. StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); StringWriter tw = new StringWriter(sb); HtmlTextWriter hw = new HtmlTextWriter(tw); pnlPDF.RenderControl(hw); // pnlPDF contains the html contents to be converted to pdf string htmlDisplayText = sb.ToString(); Document document = new Document(); MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(); PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, ms); StringReader se = new StringReader(htmlDisplayText); HTMLWorker obj = new HTMLWorker(document); document.Open(); obj.Parse(se); // step 5: we close the document document.Close(); Response.Clear(); Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment; filename=report.pdf"); Response.ContentType = "application/pdf"; Response.Buffer = true; Response.OutputStream.Write(ms.GetBuffer(), 0, ms.GetBuffer().Length); Response.OutputStream.Flush(); Response.End(); I know many of you out there knows a better way or know how to solve my problem. Please help me. Thank you!
