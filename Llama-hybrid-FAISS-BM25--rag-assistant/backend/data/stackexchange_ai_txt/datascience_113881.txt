Given the relationship between temperature, pressure and volume, your theory about elevation differences might be valid. Altitude of course affects those measurements. Scaling Are you scaling your inputs to be between [0, 1] ? If you do so using the sklearn StandardScaler (or equivalent scale function), you will keep the distribution of your data, but at least the scale is then brought into the same range for all your data. You apply the transformation to the predictions to move them back into the target range (see linked documentation above). Simplification Perhaps you could first train a model only on ${\{Temp,Wind,Pressure\}}_{loc1}$ data first, to rule effects between the two locations. Visualisation If the above don't help, I would suggest plotting some of the input data to see if there are clear correlations or consistent differences that might affect your model. You can then try to account for these somehow (scaling, subtracting them, etc). I don't know which class of model you are using (not familiar with auto-sklearn model selection), but you might consider using a model such as a neural network that would likely learn to compensate for the bias you are seeing.
