In a GMM, $z$ is a latent variable, but the $\mu$ 's are a model parameter. You seem to be trying to draw an analogy between GMMs and VAEs -- it's true you can think of a VAE as an infinite mixture model, where each component has $\mu = f(z; \theta)$ where $f$ is the decoder. Here $\theta$ , not $\mu$ , are the model parameters. and the decoder is responsible for calculating the variational distribution of the $\mu$ No -- $\mu$ isn't a latent variable, so there's no need for any variational approximation for it. Yes, $x|z$ has distribution $\mathcal{N}(f(z;\theta))$ -- this is simply how the VAE model is defined.
