How to interpret random intercept "BLUP" from the sjPlot package?

I am using the sjPlot package to estimate my multilevel model and I am loving it. However, I am a bit confused by the output of the random intercept. Background: My dependent variable is on a scale from 0-100. I fitted a model with lmer with some individual level variables that are all group-mean centered and a random intercept on the country level (12 countries). When I visualize the random effects (just the intercept in my case) like this: sjp.lmer(mymodel3, type="re", sort.est = "sort.all", y.offset = .4) I get this plot: Question: This confuses me a bit. My dependent variable only has values from 0 to 100, so how are there negative values for some countries? What does that mean? And what do the numbers tell me exactly? I was under the impression that having group-mean centered my variables, the intercepts should give me values on the dependent variable scale for a respondent with average predictors (average income, average education etc.) but of course this doesn't make sense with negative values.
