About Markov Chains: First you will need an analytics to track clickstream data and store the users touch points across their journeys. Second, you will calculate the transition matrix, which is pretty simple to do with python The transition matrix will describe something like this: Where the states are the channels or campaigns. With that you will have a probability for a user walk from start to the end, or in a marketing explanation: from the first touch point to the conversion. Then you can calculate the contribution of each channel through the removal effect. To do this you need to remove the channel from the chain and measure the the change of the overall probability. This change will be exactly the weight of the contribution of the channel There is a paper that you can explore, although some things are not explained in a explicit way. Paper
