Very long sequence in neural networks

Beginner's question regarding sequences in neural networks: suppose I have classification problem that looks like: X = very long sequence of varying length. Y = class (assume for simplicity y=0/1). The class depends on the whole sequence - it is impossible to determine the class without seeing all of it. How NN handle this? I have read various methods, such as truncating the sequence (which is a problem - there is no class for truncated part of the sequence, so I cannot label it), using encoder/decoder lstm (again, couldn't completely understand how it solves the problem), etc.
