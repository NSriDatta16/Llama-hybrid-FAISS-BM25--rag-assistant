for FOBOS, the original formulation is basically an extension of SGD: http://stanford.edu/~jduchi/projects/DuchiSi09c_slides.pdf the FTRL paper tries to give a unified view by formulating the Duchi closed-form update in a similar fashion to FTRL. the term g*x (also mentioned in ihadanny's answer) is a bit weird, but if u work from the above pdf, it's pretty clear: on page 8 of the above pdf, if we ignore the regularization term R for now, $$ \begin{eqnarray} \mathbf{w}_{t+1} &= &argmin_{\mathbf{w}} \{\frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{w} - \mathbf{w}_{t+1/2} \|^2 \} \\ &=&argmin_{\mathbf{w}} \{\frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{w} - (\mathbf{w}_{t} - \eta \mathbf{g}_t) \|^2 \} \mbox{considering page 7 of the Duchi pdf}\\ & = & (\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{w}_t)^t(\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{w}_t) + 2\eta (\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{w}_t)^t\mathbf{g}_t + \eta^2 \mathbf{g}_t^t\mathbf{g}_t \end{eqnarray} $$ the $\mathbf{w}_t$ and $\mathbf{g}_t$ above are all constants for the argmin, so are ignored, then you have the form given by ihadanny the $\mathbf{w} \mathbf{g}_t$ form makes sense (after the above equivalence derivation from the Duchi form), but in this form it is very unintuitive, and even more so is the $\mathbf{g}_{1:t}\mathbf{w}$ form in the FTRL paper. to understand the FTRL formula in the more intuitive Duchi form, note that the major difference between FTRL and FOBOS is simply the $\mathbf{g}_{1:t}$ -> $\mathbf{g}_{t}$ (see https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/37013.pdf note there is actually a typo for FOBOS in the table on page 2, you should look at the equations in the paragraphs) then just change $\mathbf{g}_{t}$ to $\mathbf{g}_{1:t}$ in the above equivalence derivation, and you will find that FTRL is basically the closed-form FOBOS update with a more "conservative" for the value of $\mathbf{g}_{t}$ by using the average of $\mathbf{g}_{1:t}$
