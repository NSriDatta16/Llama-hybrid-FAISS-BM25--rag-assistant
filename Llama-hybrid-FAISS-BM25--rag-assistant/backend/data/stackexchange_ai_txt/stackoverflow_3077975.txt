C# When a managed thread ends its time-slice will it incur context switch?

In Russinovich book it says that thread (NOTE: this is about OS thread) will need dispatching (scheduling) if it a) became ready b) ended its timeslice, yields or blocks. I have a managed thread in my C# real-time app for which is very important to achieve as fewer context switches as possible. This thread has Highest priority and the process has RealTime priority which makes my thread OS priority 26 out of 31. What is going to happen to my thread when it ends its timeslice and there are no waiting threads with priority >= 26 ? Will be there a context switch to reschedule my thread to run again or context switch will be avoided and the thread will be running uninterrupted? If there will be context switch - can anyone tell how many CPU cycles it takes on average ? I'd appreciate simple and definitive answers! Thank you !
