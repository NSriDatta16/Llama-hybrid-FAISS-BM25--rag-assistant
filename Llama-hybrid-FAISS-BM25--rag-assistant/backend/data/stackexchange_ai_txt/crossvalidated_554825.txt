What are the different ESS (Effective Sample Size) methods in arviz?

I am running a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for phylogenetic inference. I used to track the progress of convergence by checking the Effective Sample Size in Tracer . Because the results started to look good, I have begun to implement some analytics in Python, and while at it I also added ArviZ ESS calculation . For most of my chains and most of my parameters, ArviZ and Tracer agree concerning the order of magnitude of the Effective Sample Size, but there are a few runs that have all parameters with ESS in the several hundreds according to Tracer, but very low ESS according to ArviZ. I noticed that ArviZ exposes several different methods of computing ESS, but I cannot find documentation what they mean. (The R package Rhat also provides ‘bulk’ and ‘tail’, so I get a vague idea what they do. What do the other options mean? Do you have any advice on which methods I should use for what purpose?
