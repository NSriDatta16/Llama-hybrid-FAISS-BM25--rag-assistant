I would recommend you to use std::vector . The elements in a std::vector are guaranteed by the C++ Standard to be contiguous, just like a C array would be. This allows std::vector to be the interface between C++ data structures and C functions. You can use std::vector ::resize to make sure there is space allocated before passing it to the OpenCV functions. Oh, to get a pointer to the internal storage of the vector you typically use this notation: &rectangleCollection[0] . Good luck!
