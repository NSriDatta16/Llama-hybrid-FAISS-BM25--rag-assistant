Why convolutions? First let's look at alternative, using standard (fully connected) layers. Drawbacks of using fully connected layers on image input FC layers don't exploit local structure FC layer is not equivariant under translation (translated pattern can correspond to completely different feature) For big images FC layers have huge number of parameters (for example for 1000 hidden units, 1000 x 1000 x 3 image such layer has ~3 billion weights) In contrast to that, CNN layers: Extract local features (conv layer outputs only depend on adjacent pixels of previous layer) Are equivariant to translation Have lot less parameters, since they share kernel over the patches of whole input image In addition to that, CNN networks use pooling layers, which provide (some) translation invariance (pooling makes each feature more and more invariant to translation). If you're unsure about equivariance/invariance, I'd recommmend reading these Hinton's slides . They have pictorial explanation of what it means for features to be equivariant (and also more details on the other points I mentioned).
