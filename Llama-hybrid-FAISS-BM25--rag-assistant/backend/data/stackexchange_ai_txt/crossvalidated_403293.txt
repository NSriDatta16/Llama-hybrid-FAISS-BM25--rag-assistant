In naive bayes models for classification problems we are learning the distribution $P(X|C)\propto P(C) P(X|C)$ or more directly $P(C)\prod_i P(X_i|C)$ , which is different from its counterpart in the generative discriminative pair: the logistic regression. The grey circles represent manifest/observed variables. If the $P(X|C)$ 's are binary variables the model is a binomial Naive Bayes, and multinomial Naive Bayes if multinomial distribution and Gaussian if continuous Gaussian distribution(parameters are only mean and variance). In case where x's are TF-IDF values I agree with the previous answer.
