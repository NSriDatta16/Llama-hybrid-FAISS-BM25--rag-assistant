You appear to want to know for which cases (perhaps as identified by their predictor variables) your model will be able to predict your outcome highly accurately. Don't assume that this is possible. You haven't told us anything about the actual data you are modelling (which might get you better answers), but I'm a social scientist and I deal with sets of outcomes and predictors which leave me unable to identify, a priori, which cases I will be able to predict outcomes with a high degree of accuracy. @whuber suggested you look into prediction intervals . This is a good idea. I'm guessing that what you will find is that you will consider the prediction intervals to be be moderately wide for most of your cases... I'm sure you can improve your model, include interactions and squared terms. Graph residuals against fitted values and against individual predictors, etc. But wait, you know your model is really accurate for some cases, why can't you just focus on those!? You know the saying, "even a stopped-clock is right twice a day"? Your model is the stopped clock. Don't pay extra attention to the stopped-clock when you notice that the current actual time is getting really close to what the stopped-clock says. Or, as John Tukey said: The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.
