Neither of your answers, actually, $P(S_{t_k}|S_t)$ is even more general. It is mathematically a function of two variables so it answers the question "What is the probability for each outcome (rain, fog, snow, sun) given that today's outcome can be (rain, fog, snow, sun)?". I don't really understand your question. The value of $P(S_{t+i}|S_{t+i-1})$ varies for each $t$ so what you suggest is incorrect. You can make the RHS more explicit by actually expanding the sum and the multiplication, and if it helps you use actual values of $t$ . It will become clear why it is written this way. You should find that the sum is an instance of marginalization , the process of summing over unobserved outcomes in order to "ignore" them in a principled way; and that the product comes from the fact that the model is a Markov chain where each outcome only depends on the previous one. Make sure you understand all the notations!
