You should avoid augmenting namespaces over which you do not have primary control as future changes can break your code (by introducing duplicates, for example). I tend to mimic the standard namespaces with a different root namespace that identifies all child namespaces as belonging to my work. The root namespace could be your name, your organisation's name, or something else that identifies the contents of that namespace as being yours. For example, if you want to extend System.Collections , you could use NickR.Collections or NickR.System.Collections .
