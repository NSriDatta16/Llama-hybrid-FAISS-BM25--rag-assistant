Post/Get/Response http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get Quoted: When a web form is submitted to a server through an HTTP POST request, a web user that attempts to refresh the server response in certain user agents can cause the contents of the original HTTP POST request to be resubmitted, possibly causing undesired results, such as a duplicate web purchase. To avoid this problem, many web developers use the PRG pattern â€” instead of returning a web page directly, the POST operation returns a redirection command (using the HTTP 303 response code [sometimes 302] together with the HTTP "Location" response header), instructing the browser to load a different page using an HTTP GET request. A web user can then safely refresh the server response without causing the initial HTTP POST request to be resubmitted.
