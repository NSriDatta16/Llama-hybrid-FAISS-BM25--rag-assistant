I also used a lot the PrettyPrinter embedded inside JRefactory ( http://jrefactory.sourceforge.net/ ). I discovered it through its plugin for JEdit. I appreciated it as it had the better javadoc coverage I ever saw. Unfortunately it seems dead (no evolution since 2004) and actually it does not support Java5. By the way I confirm that Triemax is a commercial suite based on dead open-source Jalopy.
