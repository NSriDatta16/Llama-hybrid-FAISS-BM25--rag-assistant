When to merge open source projects?

Example: 2 of our top 3 users are working in almost equivalent projects (I don't know them in depth, maybe I'm wrong): Marc Gravell 's Protobuf-Net Jon Skeet 's DotNet-Protobuf Jokes about Jon Skeet apart, and dreaming with an prideless ideal world (sorry guys, I am not accusing you of being arrogant, is a fact that every programmer must defend his own code), wouldn't it be a great opportunity to join efforts? I am not saying that the community should decide what an individual must do, I just want you to raise pro and cons of merging projects, and what projects must have to be subject of such analysis.
