If you don't have some kind of request class mapping you can extract the information with the DOM extension . The property textConent contains all the text of the context node and its descendants. $sr = ' Mary had a little lamb '; $doc = new DOMDocument; $doc->loadxml($sr); $xpath = new DOMXPath($doc); $ns = $xpath->query('//fragment'); if ( 0 length ) { echo $ns->item(0)->nodeValue; } prints Mary had a little lamb
