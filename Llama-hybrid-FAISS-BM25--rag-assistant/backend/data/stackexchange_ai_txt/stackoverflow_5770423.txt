html5 drag & drop problem (dataset)

Hi I'm just trying to implement some cool drag and drop stuff to my order form and I have problem with dataset js object. When I bind a function to an ondragstart event and then I try to read event.dataset.value, I get error TypeError: Result of expression 'event.target.dataset' [undefined] is not an object . When I log the event.target object into console, the dataset object is missing. The data attribute is only comprised in attributes object. I am using Safari 5.0.5..In google chrome is everything ok. So is this stuff so bad and incosistently implemented? I thought, at least webkit browser should this handle well, but oposite seems true:) jQueryUI should fix it, but I wanted to rely on a non-plugin solution..
