One approach is to use an artificial neural network to extract features representing the images. This can be done either by using a pre-configured network with pre-trained weights and extracting the output of one of the hidden layers, or by constructing and training your own network for this purpose. To use a pre-configured, pre-trained module can be accomplished easily with Keras and TensorFlow, where you can import InceptionV3 or MobileNet with weights pre-trained on ImageNet, which would net you 2048 or 1024 features per image, respectively. An article discussing such an approach can be found here . This could hopefully give you better performance than using something like PCA to conduct dimensionality reduction.
