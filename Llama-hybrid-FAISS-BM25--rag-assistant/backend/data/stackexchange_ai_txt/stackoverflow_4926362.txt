Easier way to populate a list with integers in .NET

Possible Duplicate: Populating a list of integers in .NET Is there a simpler or more elegant way of initializing a list of integers in C# other than this? List numberList = new List () { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }; or for(int i = 1; i It just doesn't seem very practical - especially if the list was to contain a large number of values. Would a loop be a more practical solution? Thanks, CC
