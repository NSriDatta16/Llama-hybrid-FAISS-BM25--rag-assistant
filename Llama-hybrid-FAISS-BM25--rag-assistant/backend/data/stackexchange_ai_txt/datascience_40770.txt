In addition to the already stated uses of machine learning, I.e. clustering, outleir analysis, etc , machine learning is also used to understand complex machine learning models. The point is that many complex machine learning models (like ensemble learning, deep neural networks,etc) often achieve better accuracy than simpler models (like logistic regression and other linear models) but are very hard to interpret. In some applications (especially fintech) it is very important to understand why a certain instance was classified as a certain class. Moreover, this approach may also help in debugging the model further. LIME and SHAP are among such algorithms.
