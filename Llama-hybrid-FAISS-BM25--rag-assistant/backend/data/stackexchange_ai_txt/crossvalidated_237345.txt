What is meant by a batch normalisation being bypassed is that it does not normalise the activations by batch statistics. In the newer versions (since beta-18 I believe), the population statistics are computed during training as another parameter and then used during test time (e.g. see documentation here and here ). What is meant by removing the batch-normalisation is to apply the additive and multiplicative constants to the closest convolution layer. You can see the way how it can be done in the cnn-imagenet-deploy script in examples for imagenet. Sorry for the misunderstanding. We will update the documentation to make it more clear.
