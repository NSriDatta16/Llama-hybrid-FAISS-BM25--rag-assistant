Hungarian algorithm - assign systematically

I'm implementing the Hungarian algorithm in a project. I managed to get it working until what is called step 4 on Wikipedia . I do manage to let the computer create enough zeroes so that the minimal amount of covering lines is the amount of rows/columns, but I'm stuck when it comes to actually assign the right agent to the right job. I see how I could assign myself, but that's more trial and error - i.e., I do not see the systematic method which is of course essential for the computer to get it work. Say we have this matrix in the end: a b c d 0 30 0 0 0 1 0 35 5 0 2 60 5 0 0 3 0 50 35 40 The zeroes we have to take to have each agent assigned to a job are (a, 3), (b, 0), (c,2) and (d,1). What is the system behind chosing these ones? My code now picks (b, 0) first, and ignores row 0 and column b from now on. However, it then picks (a, 1), but with this value picked there is no assignment possible for row 3 anymore. Any hints are appreciated.
