I think you wrote down the answer to your question in the first line when you said Let's assume there is a steady state distribution to which the chain converges, i.e., $X_t \to \pi$ when $t \to +\infty$. This is the Ergodic theorem that states that if the Markov chain is aperiodic, irreducible and Harris recurrent, then the chain converges to $\pi$ in total variation sense as $t \to \infty$. This result is irrespective of the starting value of the Markov chain. You can find more info in Meyn and Tweedie .
