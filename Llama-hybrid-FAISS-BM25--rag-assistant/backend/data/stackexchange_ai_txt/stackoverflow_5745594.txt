First of all, your sample is not a valid XML document , so XML::Simple takes a little jury-rigging in order to output it. It seems to expect to output documents , not so much fragments. But I was able to generate that output with this structure: my $xml = { Parameter => [ { key => 'ID1', content => 'Some Process a' } , { key => 'ID2', content => 'Some Process b' } , { key => 'ID3', content => 'Some Process c' } ] }; print XMLout( $xml, RootName => '' ); # Just keep in mind that XML::Simple will not be able to read that back in. Here's the output: Some Process a Some Process b Some Process c So if you can get your structure into the form I showed you, you would be able to print out your fragment with the RootName => '' parameter. So, given your format, something like this might work: $xml = { Parameter => [] }; push( @{ $xml->{Parameter} } , { key => $hash->{Key}, content => $hash->{Value} } );
