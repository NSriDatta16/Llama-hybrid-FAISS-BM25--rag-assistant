There are two major differences, related to each other. Running separate regressions for each subject takes up many more degrees of freedom , since you have an intercept and slope to estimate for every subject. Mixed models make use of partial pooling ; random effects are shrunk towards the mean. This basically means that the data from other subjects informs your best estimate of the parameters for any particular subject. If you fit your regressions separately (or via fixed effects for each subject), you will likely get more extreme values than if you make use of random effects. Note that the utility of this approach relies on the assumption that the random effects are drawn from a normal distribution, though I believe that it is robust to deviations from it. This is generally a reasonable assumption, but it could be useful to consider whether it is likely to be true in your case. If you have good reasonable to believe a different distribution would be better for your case, you could specify this in a Bayesian hierarchical model instead of a standard mixed model.
