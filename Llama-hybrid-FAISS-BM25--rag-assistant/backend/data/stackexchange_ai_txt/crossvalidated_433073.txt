What's the difference between Time Series Regression and Forecasting?

I often see the concepts Time Series Regression and Time Series Forecasting refering to something similar but I don't see clearly what's the difference among these two concepts. By now, the idea I have for each concpet is the next one: Time Series Forecasting: The action of predicting future values using previously observed values. Time Series Regression: This is more a method to infer a model to use it later for predicting values. But so many times, I see people use the second concept to refer to the first one. I don't know if this is correct or if I am missing something. If anyone can help me make myself clear I would appreciate it
