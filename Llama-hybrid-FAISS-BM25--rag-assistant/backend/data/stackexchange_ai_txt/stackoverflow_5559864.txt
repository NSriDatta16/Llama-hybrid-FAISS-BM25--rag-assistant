A bookmarklet is a browser bookmark for a URL using the javascript: protocol. The javascript: prefix is followed by a snippet of JavaScript code. When invoked, instead of navigating to a new page, the script is executed within the context of the current page. Bookmarklets can be created in almost any browser. In particular, in some browsers, particularly browsers for mobile devices, bookmarklets are the only method of executing custom code in the page context. For creating a bookmarklet, it's often convenient, and for some browsers necessary, to provide a link in a page, which the user can then drag into their bookmark list. It is, however, impossible to do this on Stack Overflow, outside of the context of a Stack Snippet, due to Stack Overflow stripping out all links with URLs that don't use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
