Masking pixels for a CNN

I'm trying to implement a CNN with RGB and depth images. But my depth images are a little sparse. So I would like to mask out those neighborhoods in the RGB image where the depth neighbors are empty. I would like to mask the input feature map, i.e. wherever the neighbor pixels are empty, multiply this with zeros. While I have not yet thought out the specifics of this operation, I have a broader question. Is masking a "safe" operation? Can I mask out random portions of my input? I believe that this is similar to dropout, but dropout has its own backprop operations. Does it make sense to mask out input feature map, without writing a custom backward operation? If so, what are some specifics I need to keep in mind? My ultimate goal is just to ignore the portions that have no corresponding depth value. Thanks Edit: Please do not suggest State of the work art on RGB+Depth fusion, that combine the two in a fancy way. I'm purely just interested in the effects of masking
