In standard SQL SELECT (SUM(q7)+SUM(q33)+SUM(q38)+SUM(q40)+..+SUM(q119))/ (COUNT(q7)+COUNT(q33)+COUNT(q38)+COUNT(q40)+..+COUNT(q119)) AS domain_score1 FROM survey would give you what you want SUM will coalesce to 0 if null and COUNT will not count NULLs. (hope SQLite3 conforms). EDIT: Checked the http://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html and SQLite conforms; if sum() is going to overflow you could use total() instead. Also I second the opinions re normalization, if you don't normalize your table design (and whenever you see columns with numbers in their names raise a red flag) you are not going to have elegant SQL.
