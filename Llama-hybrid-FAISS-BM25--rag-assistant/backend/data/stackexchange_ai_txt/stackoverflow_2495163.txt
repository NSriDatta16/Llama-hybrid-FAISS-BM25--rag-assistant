This is because the default behaviour for XML generation is PUBLIC_MEMBER ( http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlAccessorType.html ). Since you are putting the @XmlElement on the fields, it is grabbing both your public getter/setter methods AND any field w/ @XmlElement on it. What you're likely going to want to is set the XmlAccessorType to either FIELD or NONE.
