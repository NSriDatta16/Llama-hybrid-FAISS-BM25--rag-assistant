All journals published by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) -- and that includes The Annals of Statistics (one of the very top statistics journals), The Annals of Applied Statistics , etc. -- explicitly encourage authors to put preprints on arXiv and, moreover, take care of putting postprints on arXiv too. I am actually not aware of any math or physics journal that uploads papers to arXiv if the authors did not do it themselves! The IMS encourages all members to post their articles on arXiv. ( http://www.imstat.org/publications/arxiv.html ) All IMS articles 2004 and forward are freely available in a postprint format on arXiv, as well as those articles posted by authors. ArXiv is an open access, fully automated electronic archive and distribution server for research articles, now owned and operated by Cornell University, and partially funded by NSF. The main fields it covers are physics, mathematics, non-linear science, computer science, and quantitative biology. Recently, arXiv has cooperated with IMS and the Bernoulli Society to open up a new statistics category within mathematics. We expect this category to eventually grow into a top level archive comparable to e.g. mathematics and physics. ( http://www.imstat.org/publications/eaccess.htm )
