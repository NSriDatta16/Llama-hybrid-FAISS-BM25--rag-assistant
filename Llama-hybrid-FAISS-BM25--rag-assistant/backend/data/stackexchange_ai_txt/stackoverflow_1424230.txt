The ALTER TABLESPACE....RESIZE is only allowed beyond the HWM. So you might have many unused segmnets below it. Before this operation, issue an: ALTER TABLE .. .SHRINK SPACE on some tables of that tablespace/datafile in order to reorganize the contents of the datafiles. Might be a long task, but you can generate the commands with SQL.
