Any statistical model (e.g. t-test, ANOVA, regression) can theoretically be analyzed by either frequentist or Bayesian methods. (In practice, some models are prohibitive to analyze by one technique or the other). If you don't know whether you analyses are frequentist or Bayesian, they are most likely frequentist--most standard introductions to statistics are written from a frequentist perspective. In a nutshell, if you are calculating the long-term frequency of obtaining a result as extreme as yours under repeated data collection and analysis, assuming some null hypothesis is true, then you are practicing frequentist statistics. This is where p-values come from. If you are making inference about the probability that a parameter falls within some range, based on your prior information about the parameter as well as some data you've collected, then you are practicing Bayesian statistics.
