The simple idea is to make PCA and base distance of few first components (yet I don't like this technique because of assumptions it makes). The complex idea is to use machine learning; the resulting distances will expose the classifier structure, so will be about as good as the classification accuracy. The simplest approach here is just random forest object distance ( Breiman's example ), but you can also use the kernel justified by SVM, see for instance Winters-Hilt & Merat 2007 .
