Good News... resolved and tested, all working follow these steps... Open your project in xcode 4 from 3.2 click File -> Save As Workspace in project navigator on the left, collapse your Project if you see all the files below your collapsed project, in the empty space right click or control click -> Add Files to... select the project file you wish to link to, leave Copy items unchecked, click Add Now you will see 2 collapsed projects in your Project navigator, expand both Now what I didn't know I had to still do Drag the files or folders you want from the second project to your main, make sure your Main project target is selected in the options, and I also have group selected then click Finish You are good to go, you might have some warnings about your second project and its targeted SDK. Fix those by clicking the project name in the Project Navigator -> Build Settings -> Base SDK to 10.6, Deployment Target to 10.5
