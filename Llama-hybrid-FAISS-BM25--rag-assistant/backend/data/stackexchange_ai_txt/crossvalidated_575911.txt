Do the variables used in computing the mean and variance have to be i.i.d.?

For example if you have a theoretical server that processes incoming requests where in this case there are so many requests that the callback delays depend upon each other, can you just take the average and (sample) variance of the delays even though they are not i.i.d.? Are there specific assumptions that need to hold when calculating mean and variance? (I'm very well aware that it's a very stupid question, but I'm still uncertain about it and I wanted to know for sure)
