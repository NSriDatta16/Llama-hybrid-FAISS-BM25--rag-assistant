How can I exclude a package from the clover coverage report (running from Maven)?

I'm generating clover coverage reports (using Clover's maven plugin), and I'd like to exclude a certain package from the coverage reports (specifically, because it's UI code that intentionally isn't covered by my unit tests, but the reason doesn't really matter.) I can see how to exclude that package from being instrumented (using in the plugin configuration), but I can't see how to exclude it from the report. The intended solution appears to be to use a Context; however, there is no package-level context available (only block, method, and statement.)
