Standard error binomial - Various samples

I want to calculate the mean estimator and its variance (standard error) for the following example: Let's say I'm examining several patients per day and they are diagnosed with Cancer or No cancer. There were $n$ days in total: Day 1: 100 patients examined, 4 were positive (cancer) Day 2: 110 patients examined, 0 were positive ... Day n: 105 patients examined, 3 were positive I see two different ways of finding my estimator for mean (probability $p$) and standard error: Case 1 : I estimate a different probability for each day $p_x$ and then I average that: $\hat{p} = \frac{p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n}{n} = \frac{ \frac{4}{100} + \frac{0}{110} + ... + \frac{3}{105} }{n}$ Then the standard error (variance) is: $var(\hat{p}) = var(\frac{1}{n}(var_1+var_2+...+var_n)) = \\ \frac{1}{n^2}(var_1+var_2+...+var_n) $ Here the $var_x$ for each day is $p_x(1-p_x)/n_x$, where $n_x$ denotes the number of patients examined per day. So my standard error is : $var(\hat{p}) = \frac{1}{n^2}(\frac{\frac{4}{100}(1-\frac{4}{100})}{100}+...+\frac{\frac{3}{105}(1-\frac{3}{105})}{105}) $ Case 2: I merge all samples into one assuming that my probability $p$ is the same (series of Bernoulli experiments with same $p$). Then: $\hat{p} = \frac{4+0+...+3}{100+110+...+105}$ $var(\hat{p}) = \frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{100+110+...+105}$ The result is different using each case -- what's the right way of doing this?
