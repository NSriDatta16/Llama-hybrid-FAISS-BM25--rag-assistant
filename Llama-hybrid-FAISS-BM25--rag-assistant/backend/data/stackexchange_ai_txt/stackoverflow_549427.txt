Howto: PHP/Javascript communication

As I'm developing my WebIDE , I keep coming up with questions that I cannot answer myself. This is because the project is supposed to help others create what they would "normally" create, but faster (i.e. as automated as possible). In this light, my question is how to you implement a PHP backend? Here is what I do. I like to create "functions" that the client JavaScript can call. Usually, I send (via POST and JSON) a variable called "action" which holds the name of the "function" I am calling (as well as any arguments I wish to send it). The PHP code, then, looks something like this: if(issset($_POST['action'])) { //function foo(arg1,arg2) if($_POST['action'] == 'foo') { $arg1 = $_POST['arg1']; $arg2 = $_POST['arg2']; //do stuff } } I can still reference other real functions I create in PHP, but I find that this is a nice way to organize everything and easy to implement in both JavaScript and PHP. What do you do? Edit 1: Ok, based on the first two answers to this question, I do not think I am explaining myself well. I am asking how do you create a PHP back end. The idea is that you have your AJAX client written in JavaScript (or maybe something else, it doesn't matter ), and then it will call your backend PHP with POST or GET data. Based on this data, your backend will do what it needs to do (maybe it will simply update the database, and maybe even return information, again: it doesn't matter ). The question now is: how do you tell it what to do? What do you send via POST/GET and how do you interpret it in your backend?
