Few points: I think you want to use min instead of max I think you want to use 255 instead of 256 This will give: (r1, g1, b1) + (r2, g2, b2) = (min(r1+r2, 255), min(g1+g2, 255), min(b1+b2, 255)) However, The "natural" way of mixing colors is to use the average, and then you don't need the min: (r1, g1, b1) + (r2, g2, b2) = ((r1+r2)/2, (g1+g2)/2, (b1+b2)/2)
