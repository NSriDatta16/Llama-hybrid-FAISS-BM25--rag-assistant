There are a few ways that adjustments can be done but one of the most common ways when there are multiple variables to adjust for is to simply include, as independent variables into a model, the variables for which you want to adjust. So for example, let's say you wanted to compare the odds of death for hospital A and hospital B, adjusting for patient age (in years) and severity of illness measured (for simplification) as "minor" or "extreme." Then you could simply fit the following logistic regression model: $log[p/(1-p)]=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+\beta_3X_3$ where $p=P(Y=1|X_1, X_2, X_3)$, $y= 0, 1$ is the indicator variable for death and $X_1=1$ for hospital A or 0 for hospital B, $X_2$ is the patient's age in years, and $X_3=1$ for minor severity of illness, 0 otherwise. With this model you can calculate the odds of death in hospital A compared to hospital B, adjusted for the other variables included in the model by simply exponentiating the the estimated coefficient corresponding to the hospital indicator variable you obtain from your logistic regression model, in this case, $exp(\hat{\beta}_1)$. Edited to Address your follow-up question If you didn't want to use logistic regression for this, you can still use a tabular approach. The method for obtaining the adjusted odds ratio is called the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio. This is simply a weighted average of the individual odds ratios obtained in each of the tables obtained by stratifying on the confounder (in your linked example the odds ratios formed from the individual odds ratio from the good health table and poor health table). The weight for each table is equal to the inverse of the estimated variance of the odds ratio for the table. The general formula is given by: $\sum_i a_id_i/n_i\over{\sum_i b_ic_i/n_i}$ for each table $i$, where, in this example, $a_i$ is the number of deaths in hospital B, $d_i$ is the number of living in hospital A, $b_i$ is the number of deaths in hospital A and $c_i$ is the number living in hospital B. Taking the numbers from this example we have, letting table $i=1$ for those in good health and $i=2$ for poor health: $\sum_i^2 a_id_i/n_i\over{\sum_i^2 b_ic_i/n_i}$=$(8)(594)/1200+(8)(1433)/1700\over{(6)(592)/1200+(57)(192)/1700}$=$1.138958\approx1.14$
