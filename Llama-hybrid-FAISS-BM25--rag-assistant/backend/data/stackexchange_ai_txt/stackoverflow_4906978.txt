Android handles different screen resolutions automatically in that you specify sizes in "dip" (device independent pixels) and by providing different drawable folders (drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-ldpi) where drawables are fetched depending on the resolution capabilities of the device your app is running on. If you want to target tablets specifically, then I'd start coding for the Honeycomb system. Devices will be available soon ;) The SDK is already available on the developer.android.com site.
