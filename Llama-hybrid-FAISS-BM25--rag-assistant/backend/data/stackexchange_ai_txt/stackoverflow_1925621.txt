How to organize a PHP blog

So, currently I'm organizing my blog based on filename: To create a post I enter the name of the file. As opposed to storing the post in the database, I store them in PHP files. So each time I create a post, A new row in the table is created with the filename and a unique ID. To reference the post (e.g. for comments) I get the name of the current file, then search the entries table for a matching file name. The post ID of the comment matches the ID of that post. Obviously this isn't the standard way of organizing a blog, but I do it this way for a few reasons: Clean URL's (even cleaner than mod_rewrite can provide from what I've read) I always have a hard copy of the post on my machine Easier to remember the URL of a specific post (kind of a part of clean URL's) Now I know that the standard way would be storing each post in the database. I know how to do this, but the clean URL's is the main problem. So now to my questions: Is there anything WRONG with the way I'm doing it now, or could any problems arise from it in the future? Can the same level of clean URL's that I can get now be achieved with mod_rewrite? If so, links are appreciated I will be hosting this on a web host. Do only certain web-hosts provide access to the necessary files for mod_rewrite, or is it generally standard on all web-hosts? Thanks so much guys! P.S. To be clear, I don't plan on using a blogging engine.
