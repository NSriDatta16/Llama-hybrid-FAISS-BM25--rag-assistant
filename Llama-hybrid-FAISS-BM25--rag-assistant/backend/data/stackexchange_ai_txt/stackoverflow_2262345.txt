There was a difference for the first version of MonoDevelop. They used their own *.mds file format. You can take a look for details on it in the MonoDevelop source code. But as far as i know, this file format (as well as .mdp, .mdw) is not intended to use with MonoDevelop 2+. The default solution format for the newest version of MonoDevelop is identical (as far as i know) to VisualStudio. Will appreciate if somebody will correct me if i am wrong =)
