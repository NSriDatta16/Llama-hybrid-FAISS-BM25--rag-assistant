How to measure predictive performance of a machine learning model?

I have made a Random Forest model having RMSE of 0.189 and R2-Score of 0.734. How can I use statistics to measure the predictive performance of my model? In my use case, I have to answer these questions: How well does your model work? How do you know for sure thatâ€™s how well it works? What stats did you use to prove its predictive performance and why? Can anyone tell me how can I answer 2nd and 3rd questions?
