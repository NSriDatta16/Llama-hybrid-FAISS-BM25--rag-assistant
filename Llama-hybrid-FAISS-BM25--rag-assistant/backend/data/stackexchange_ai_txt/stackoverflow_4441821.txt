JQuery sortable and disappearing child elements [IE]

Code can be found here: http://www.myhorizon.ca/client_central/sortable_test.php Hello folks of Stackoverflow, I have a list of categories that are sortable. Each category has a list of sections that are also sortable but said sections can be dragged from category to category. My code works fine in Firefox and Chrome but in IE when I drag and drop my sortable items the children elements (like the toolbar icons) get all jarbbled (for lack of a better word). Sometimes the elements just disappear and sometimes they are in the strangest places. I have a feeling IE is having a problem redrawing all my stuff but I can't figure out how to fix it. Any help is appreciated :) $('.category').sortable({ 'handle' : '.cat-drag-and-drop', connectWith: '.category', start: function() { $('.category *').disableSelection(); }, stop: function() { $('.category *').enableSelection(); } }); $('.section').sortable({ 'handle' : '.section-drag-and-drop', connectWith: '.section', start: function() { $('.section *').disableSelection(); }, stop: function() { $('.section *').enableSelection(); } });
