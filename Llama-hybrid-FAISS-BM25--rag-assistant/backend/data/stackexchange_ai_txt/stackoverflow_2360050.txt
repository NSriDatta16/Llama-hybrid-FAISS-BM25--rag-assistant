How stack frames and such are organized. When to use registers vs. putting parameters on the stack, caller-save vs. callee-save, all of that. I'd have thought that this would be described along with the instruction set but so far I haven't seen this particular info anywhere. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here? In general, there are no right answers to these questions. You can use whatever calling conventions you want...unless you want to interoperate with other people's code. For interoperability, compilers standardize on Application Binary Interfaces. My understanding is that the Itanium C++ ABI has become a popular standard in recent years. Try starting there.
