First, I would make sure that you have Time as a factor (not just a quantitative variable) in your model. Second, I would suggest nailing down the issue of "potentially empty cells". Am I correct that you do at least have every subject measured at all 3 times? Or are there holes there? I'm hoping not, but if there are, that may not be a disaster. I suggest doing something like with(data, table(Sex, Age)) to see if there are missing combinations of Sex and Age . If so, you really can't do a sensible analysis of either factor in its own right, and you might as well combine them into one factor, say data Then I'd suggest fitting the model including all interactions, because you don't know which to reasonably omit. So that'd be Sex*Age*Time + (1|ID) or Group*Time + (1|ID) depending on the previous paragraph. It does seem that if each subject is measured at the three times, then (1|ID) is a reasonable thing to put in for the error term. For post hoc analysis, I don't see much validity to trying to pursue a small number of planned comparisons, because it all seems pretty exploratory at this point. Maybe save that for the next study that is more carefully designed and powered, and includes subjects in all age and sex combinations. By the time you finish mentioning what times you want to compare, you have covered all pairwise comparisons. So I suggest something like: EMM The second statement will do all three pairwise comparisons of Time for each combination of the other factors. It may be possible to do simpler comparisons if an anova (e.g., car::Anova(mod) ) suggests that Age or Sex does not interact with Time . If so, you can fit a simpler model that excludes those interactions, and exclude that factor in EMM and we will just average over the levels of that factor.
