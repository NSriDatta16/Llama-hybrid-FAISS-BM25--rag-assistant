Kernel logistic regression vs SVM

As is known to all, SVM can use kernel method to project data points in higher spaces so that points can be separated by a linear space. But we can also use logistic regression to choose this boundary in the kernel space, so what's the advantages of SVM? Since SVM uses a sparse model in which only those support vectors make contributions when predicting, does this make SVM faster in prediction?
