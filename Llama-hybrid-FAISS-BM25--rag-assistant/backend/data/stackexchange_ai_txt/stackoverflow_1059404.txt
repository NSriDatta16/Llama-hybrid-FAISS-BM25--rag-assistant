Embedding vector graphics in Word

I'm working on a calculation program which creates graphs from input data with ZedGraph . My client would like to embed those graphics into Microsoft Word and the publish the document as PDF. Both PNGs and enhanced metafiles produce badly rastered results in the PDF. I've tested this with Office 2007 and the "built-in" PDF publisher . Can you recommend any workflow that leads to not breaking the vectorized data on the way to PDF? Update Thanks for all answers. It turned out, that .net actually doesn't create metafiles when writing to disk. See the respective question . Once I started using P/Invoke to create real metafiles on disk (instead of the automatic PNG fallback) the quality of the generated PDFs and prints improved vastly.
