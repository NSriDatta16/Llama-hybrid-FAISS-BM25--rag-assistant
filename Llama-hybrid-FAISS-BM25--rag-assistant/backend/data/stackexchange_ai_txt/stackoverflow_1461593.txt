First, convert your ButtonField or CommandField to a TemplateField , then bind the Visible property of the button to a method that implements the business logic: ' CommandName="Select"/> Then, in the code behind, add in the method: protected Boolean IsOverAgeLimit(Decimal Age) { return Age > 35M; } The advantage here is you can test the IsOverAgeLimit method fairly easily.
