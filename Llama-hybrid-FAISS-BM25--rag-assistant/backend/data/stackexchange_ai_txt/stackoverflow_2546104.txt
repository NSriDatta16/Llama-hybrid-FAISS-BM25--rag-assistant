I found the solution. I have rewritten the whole code from scratch and found the problem. In my custom ArrayAdapter called ArtistAdapter (see 3. in question) if have a var to store the items: private List items; And in my overridden getView() when i want to get the current item i did: items.getItem(position) now i do a: getItems(position) (so the item is retrieved from the storage of the base class and not my own) and this seems to do the trick! This is my getView() as it is now (the version, that is working): @Override public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) { LinearLayout artistView; Artist art = getItem(position); if (convertView == null) { artistView = new LinearLayout(getContext()); String inflater = Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE; LayoutInflater vi; vi = (LayoutInflater)getContext().getSystemService(inflater); vi.inflate(resId, artistView, true); } else { artistView = (LinearLayout) convertView; } TextView nameView = (TextView)artistView.findViewById(R.id.txt_name); TextView uidView = (TextView)artistView.findViewById(R.id.txt_uid); nameView.setText(art.name); uidView.setText(art.uid); return artistView; } Pfu, this was a really annoying bug...
