I don't think Smoothing is the right term for what you want. I think you want each row to look a little more like the first row; so just make a new row N equal to the average of row N and row 1. You can use a weighted average if you want to tune how much similarity is required. Then, a third sheet to re-normalize each row into a total of 100%. This procedure will yield a new dataset that is partially the original, and partly 'smoothed' towards your expected value (row 1).
