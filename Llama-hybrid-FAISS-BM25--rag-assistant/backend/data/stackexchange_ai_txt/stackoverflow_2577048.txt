The order of display simply depends on your view code. If you do this in your controller: flash[:notice] = "Notice me" flash[:error] = "BAAAAADDDD" And this in your view: the :notice will always appear first. Try this for a more elegant approach. The order you define in the array is the order they'll appear in: #{flash[condition]} " if flash.has_key?(condition) %>
