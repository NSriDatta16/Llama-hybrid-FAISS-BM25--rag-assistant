What is the influence of C in SVMs with linear kernel?

I am currently using an SVM with a linear kernel to classify my data. There is no error on the training set. I tried several values for the parameter $C$ ($10^{-5}, \dots, 10^2$). This did not change the error on the test set. Now I wonder: is this an error caused by the ruby bindings for libsvm I am using ( rb-libsvm ) or is this theoretically explainable ? Should the parameter $C$ always change the performance of the classifier?
