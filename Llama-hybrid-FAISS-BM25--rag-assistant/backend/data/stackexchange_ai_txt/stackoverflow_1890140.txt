Russ, It sounds almost as if using a MySQL table with the storage engine set to MEMORY might be your way to go. A RAM based table gives you the flexibility of using SQL, and also prevents disk thrashing due to a large amount of reads/writes (like memcached). However, a RAM based table is very volatile. If anything is stored in the table and not flushed to a disk based table, and you lose power... well, you just lost your data. That being said, ensure you flush to a real disk-based table every once in a while. Also, another plus from using memory tables is you can store all the typical MySQL data types, so there is no 1MB size limit.
