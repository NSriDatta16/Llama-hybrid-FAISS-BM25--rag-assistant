Impractically long running time PCA command in R RStudio

I am using R in RStudio on OS X ver. 10.9.2 on 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7 with 8 GB RAM. I am trying to run a PCA command ( prcomp ) and plots on a dataset with approximately 200,000 rows and 8 columns. The prompt doesn't return, and most plots don't display (they do work on small ~300 rows datasets). Am I using the wrong tools for the job (R, hardware)? Am I doing something else wrong? Any good suggestions?
