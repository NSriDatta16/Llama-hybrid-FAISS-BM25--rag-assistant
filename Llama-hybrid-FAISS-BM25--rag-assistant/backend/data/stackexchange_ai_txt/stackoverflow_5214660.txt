Is it possible to pass an std::string via Microsoft RPC?

I tried passing an std::string via RPC, but I got the following error: MIDL2025: syntax error: expecting a type specification or a storage specifer or a type qualifier near "string" Extract from code: interface TestInterface { unsigned int HelloUser([in] const string user); } Is this possible?
