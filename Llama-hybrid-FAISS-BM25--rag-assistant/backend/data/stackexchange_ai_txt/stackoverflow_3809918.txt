inserting images into multiple tinyMCE editors in wordpress

I am using a plugin for wordpress called "CMS" its a plugin that makes wordpress more CMS like. http://plugins.trendwerk.nl In particular it adds multiple text "blocks" to a template, each can be edited in the post.php script using multiple tinymce editors. The problem I am having is that you can only place images into the main or default editor, according to the author of CMS the only fix is to place an image into the main content editor and dragging it to the editor in question. supposedly its impossible to put the image into one of the block editors. This does not always work, for some reason it uses a relative link when dragging and dropping from one editor to another, this breaks the site. What I would like to do is to add the ability to insert images into individual tinyMCE edit boxes. When an image is inserted it is inserted into the activeEditor. but the active editor always appears to be the main editor. When the page is created any textarea with the class theEditor is converted to a tinyMCE editor, one would assume clicking on an editor would then set that editor to the active editor, it does not appear to. or alternativally clicking on the "add an image" icon deactivates it (loses focus). Does anyone know how I can set the activeEditor? perhaps when the user click on the "add an image" icon I can update the active editor.
