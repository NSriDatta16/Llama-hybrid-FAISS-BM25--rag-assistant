Can you use the asp.net membership provider in a windows application?

The Asp.Net membership provider has some clear uses in a web app. I am thinking about trying to leverage some of the features in a windows application (more specifically WPF). Does anyone know if it is possible to use the core features in a windows app? I am mostly just looking for it to create my database tables, and maintain users, roles, and profiles. I obviously do not need to use the built-in web controls (e.g. Login).
