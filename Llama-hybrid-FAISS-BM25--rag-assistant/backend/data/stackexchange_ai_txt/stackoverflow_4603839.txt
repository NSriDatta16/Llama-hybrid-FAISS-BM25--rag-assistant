Once your document is loaded, you can determine the width with the width or offsetWidth properties for each image and resize your paragraph according to the result. If you don't want your images displayed until it's calculated I think it would work to give to your paragraph the style visibility:hidden until it's resized. However, and depending on what you're trying to achieve, I would advise you to use the style white-space:nowrap to your paragraph instead of giving it a specific width.
