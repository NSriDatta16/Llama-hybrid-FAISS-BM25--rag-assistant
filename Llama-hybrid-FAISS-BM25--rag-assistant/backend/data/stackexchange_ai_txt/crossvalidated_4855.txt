The first step is to define your research question. A few possible research questions given your data include: How can genres of video games be grouped into a smaller set? How are genres of video games or groups of genres related to self-identifying as a hard-core gamer? Then, you could present a table of frequencies and percentages of genre by hard-core gamer status. You could also divide the analysis into two steps: grouping types of video games; this could be done conceptually (e.g., based on prior knowledge of ways of grouping gaming genres) or using a data driven approach such as PCA, factor analysis (perhaps on tetrachoric correlations ) examine differences in endorsement of video gram types across hard-core gamer category. As mentioned by Brandon correspondence analysis would also be another nice option.
