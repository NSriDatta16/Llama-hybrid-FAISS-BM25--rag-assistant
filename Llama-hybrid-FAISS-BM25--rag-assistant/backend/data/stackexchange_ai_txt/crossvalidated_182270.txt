Yes, I believe you are missing something or it is not clear what "most books" are referring to when they say "Bayesian logistic regression". Logistic regression is $$ Y_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} Ber(\pi_i) $$ where $$ \log\left( \frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i} \right) = \beta_0+\beta_1 X_{i,1} + \cdots + \beta_P X_{i,P} $$ and $X_{i,1},\ldots,X_{i,p}$ are the independent variables for observation $i$. Bayesian logistic regression adds the additional assumption $\beta \sim p(\beta)$, e.g. $$ \beta_p \stackrel{ind}{\sim} N(0,v^2)\quad \mbox{for } p=1,\ldots,P.$$ There is no assumption here whatsoever on the distribution of the independent variables.
