How to set tax in price magento

I have 2 shops with same settings imo. My question is how do I get my prices including tax in my second shop? Both have settings like this My first shop includes tax (see picture) My second shop does not show this Any idea how i can get this done? The problem is that all my prices are being taxed on the homepage now. So if i say the amount must be €100 it makes it €119 now and i don't want that. Any help is realy appreaciated!
