Managing critical errors: logging & email

What's the best way to send quick one-liner e-mails to an administrative address in Rails? I am using the Rails Logger to keep track of nasty problems in my application. One of my controllers is doing mission-critical work and I need to know of any errors ASAP. When there is an error, I would like my app to send an email to myself, calling attention to the log containing more details. I'm envisioning something like the following pseudo-code: begin ... rescue logger.error("Found an error! Params hash is " + params.to_s) email("user@example.com","Critical error in log. Investigate line " + len(logger.error).to_s) end The obvious first place I looked at was ActionMailer . However, both the documentation and my literature talk about creating a mailer Model, View & Controller, which seems overly complex for what I want: A very short (one-line) e-mail to an email address where formatting & reply-to address doesn't matter at all. This brings me back to my question: What's the best way to send quick one-liner e-mails to an administrative e-mail address in Rails?
