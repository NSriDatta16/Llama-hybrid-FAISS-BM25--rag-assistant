Stationary distribution for the general ARMA model: The condition of strong stationarity is not sufficient to determine the distribution of the time-series process, even when restricted by the recursive ARMA equation. However, for practical purposes, when we want a strongly stationary ARMA process with normally distributed errors, we assume that the process has a multivariate normal distribution . For this process, any vector of observable values $\mathbf{X} = (X_1,...,X_T)$ has the distribution: $$\mathbf{X} \sim \text{N} ( \mu \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{\Sigma} ) \quad \quad \quad \mathbf{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma(0) & \gamma(1) & \cdots & \gamma(T-1) \\ \gamma(1) & \gamma(0) & \cdots & \gamma(T-2) \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \gamma(T-1) & \gamma(T-2) & \cdots & \gamma(0) \\ \end{bmatrix},$$ where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ is the mean of the process, and the auto-covariance function $\gamma (k) \equiv \mathbb{C}(X_t, X_{t+k})$ is found from the parameters of the ARMA process via standard methods . (Strict stationarity also requires restrictions on the parameters of the model, ensuring that the roots of the autoregressive characteristic polynomial are outside the unit circle.) This joint distribution corresponds to the case where we have an ARMA process with normally distributed error terms, and strict stationarity. Note that the auto-covariance function will be a function of the auto-regressive parameter $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and the moving-average parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ . Stationary distribution for the AR(1) model: In the special case of an $\text{AR}(1)$ process with auto-regression parameter $|\phi| , the auto-covariance function for the process is: $$\gamma (k) \equiv \mathbb{C}(X_t, X_{t+k}) = \frac{\phi^k}{1-\phi^2} \cdot \sigma^2.$$
