Correct Analysis for determining impact of input parameters on data

I work for a manufacturing company that collects times (man-hours) for tasks. The tasks are similar in concept from one product to another, but the characteristics of the product can vary (like size, voltage, etc). It has been something like ten years since I've had to do any heavy lifting in terms of data analysis... I'm trying to take our dataset (about four years' worth of data) coupled with some parameters about each of the products and use it to ultimately be able to input a product's characteristics and be able to predict the output in hours. Can anyone help me get started with this? I'm an EE by background and have worked with neural networks and linear regression in the past, but it's been something like 10 years, so I've forgotten it all. Thanks so very much, Timothy
