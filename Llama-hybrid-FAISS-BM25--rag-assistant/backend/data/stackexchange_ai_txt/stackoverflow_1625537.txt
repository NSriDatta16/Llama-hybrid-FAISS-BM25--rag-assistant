Create a Print Function

I'm learning Bison and at this time the only thing that I do was the rpcalc example, but now I want to implement a print function(like printf of C), but I don't know how to do this and I'm planning to have a syntax like this print ("Something here"); , but I don't know how to build the print function and I don't know how to create that ; as a end of line. Thanks for your help.
