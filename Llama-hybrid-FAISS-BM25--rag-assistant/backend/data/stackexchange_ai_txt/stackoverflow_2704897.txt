I was in your position as well long time ago when I learned Java and its Collection classes (or SWING, or AWT for that matter). Here are a few steps I did and the outcome of those steps: Didn't bother to take notes, keep on using it => only remember the most used class Take an unorganized notes => same result, remember the most used class Simple class diagrams => improvement, but incomplete Simple class diagrams but complete with sub-classes organized it per component (package in Java) => Jackpot! Few more advises: Eliminate deprecated classes Find a symbol to mark a class is thread-safe (put a TS or something) You could omit the least-used sub-classes (maybe) as you go along with your adventure An example of a simple class diagram: http://www.ged.fi/DesignPatterns/AWT.gif http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/images/IO-input-output-streams.png Compare to this (not-so-simple): http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~comp212/08-spring/lectures/30/reader.png Hope that helps.
