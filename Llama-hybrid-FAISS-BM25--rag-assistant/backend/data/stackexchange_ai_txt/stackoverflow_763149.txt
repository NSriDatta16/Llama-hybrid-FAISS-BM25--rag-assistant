Autostart a batch file on Windows

I want to create a script that will run whenever a server is turned on to do basic things like create a directory and copy a binary from an FTP server to it. I need it to run before a user logs in, as soon as the server is turned on. This will be deployed on my EC2 windows servers. Checking around ( http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial44.html ) I saw that only services can run before a user logs in. I saw that I can make my batch into a com (bat2exe) and set it as a service but that doesn't work with internal commands like ECHO, md, etc. I can also fake a service to be "cmd /k batch.cmd". Both seem cumbersome. Is there an elegant way to do this? Thanks, Miki
