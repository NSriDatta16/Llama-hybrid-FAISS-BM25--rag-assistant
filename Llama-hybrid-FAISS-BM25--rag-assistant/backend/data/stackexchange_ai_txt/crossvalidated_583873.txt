Why am I getting strange upper & lower limits on a gamma distribution?

I am working on a time series dataset. I understand it has a gamma distribution. I want to use a 99% probability threshold to establish upper & lower limits/cut-offs and find anomalies. However, I am getting strange results when I run the below code. What am I doing/understanding wrong? data = {'Synthetic': [984.172, 1144.21, 1304.24, 1464.27, 1624.31, 1784.34, 1944.38, 2104.41, 2264.45, 2424.48, 2584.51, 2744.55, 2904.58, 3064.62, 3224.65, 3384.68, 3544.72, 3704.75, 3864.79, 4024.82, 4184.85, 4344.89, 4504.92, 4664.96, 4824.99, 4985.03, 5145.06, 5305.09, 5465.13, 5625.16, 5785.2, 5945.23, 6105.26, 6265.3, 6425.33, 6585.37, 6745.4, 6905.44, 7065.47, 7225.5, 7385.54, 7545.57, 7705.61, 7865.64, 8025.67, 8185.71, 8345.74, 8505.78]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) Upper_Lim = gamma.ppf(0.99, df.mean(), df.std()) print(Upper_Lim) Lower_Lim = gamma.ppf(0.01, df.mean(), df.std()) print(Lower_Lim) Why am I getting an upper limit of 7147 and a lower limit of 6826? I had imagined that with a 99% threshold, I would be casting a wider net on the dataset.
