How do I update a Bayesian prior using weighted update results?

I have a prior belief about my distribution; I started with $N(10,1)$. Later I received three groups of samples, $X_1$ which is $N(10,2)$, $X_2$ is $N(10.1,3)$ and $X_3, N(9.5,4)$. I also know that the probability of getting samples from the group $X_1$ is 0.7, $X_2$ is 0.2 and $X_3$ is 0.1. How can I join all the information I have? I would like to obtain a credibility interval. Someone suggested that I use "just another Gibbs sampler" (JAGS) . Would someone point me in the right direction?
