extract coefficients from glm in R

I have performed a logistic regression with the following result: ssi.logit.single.age["coefficients"] # $coefficients # (Intercept) age # -3.425062382 0.009916508 I need to pick up the coefficient for age , and currently I use the following code: ssi.logit.single.age["coefficients"][[1]][2] It works, but I don't like the cryptic code here, can I use the name of the coefficient (i.e. (Intercept) or age )
