A database-centric option would be: Create a table that will contain a list (or queue) of long-running jobs to be performed. Have the application add an entry to the queue if, when, and as desired. That's all it does; once logged and entered, no web session or state data need be maintained. Have a SQL Agent job configured to check every 1, 2, 5, whatever minutes to see if there are any jobs to run. If there are as-yet unstarted items, mark the most recent one as started, and start it. When it's completed, mark it as completed, or just delete it Check if there are any other items to run. If there are, repeat; if not, exit the job. Depending on capacity, you could have several (differently named) copies of this job running, concurrently processing items from the list. (I've used this method for very long-running methods. It's more an admin-type trick, but it may be appropriate for your situation.)
