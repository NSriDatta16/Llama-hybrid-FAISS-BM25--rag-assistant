I have also recently become interested in data science as a career, and when I think of what I learnt about the data science job in comparison to the numerous statistics courses that I took (and enjoyed!), I started to think of data scientists as computer scientists who turned their attention to data. In particular, I noted the following main differences. Note though that the differences appear mood. The following just reflects my subjective impressions, and I do not claim generality. Just my impressions! In statistics, you care a lot about distributions, probabilities, and inferential procedures (how to do hypothesis tests, which are the underlying distributions, etc). From what I understand, data science is more often than not about prediction, and worries about inferential statements are to some extent absorbed by procedures from computer science, such as cross-validation. In statistical courses, I often just created my own data, or used some ready made data that is available in a rather clean format. That means it is in a nice rectangular format, some excel spreadsheet, or something like that that fits nicely into RAM. Data cleaning surely is involved, but I never had to deal with "extracting" data from the web, let alone from databases that had to be set up in order to hold an amount of data that does not fit into RAM anymore. My impression is that this computational aspect is much more dominant in data science. Maybe this reflects my ignorance about what statisticians do in typical statistical jobs, but before data science I never thought about building models into a larger product. There was an analysis to be done, a statistical problem to be solved, some parameter to be estimated, and that is it. In data science, it seems that often (though not always) predictive models are built into a larger something. For instance, you click somewhere, and within milliseconds, a predictive algorithm will have decided what is being shown as a result. So, while in statistics, I always wondered "what parameter can we estimate, and how do we do it elegantly", it seems that in data science the focus is more on "what can we predict that is potentially useful in a data product". Again, the above does not try to give a general definition. I am just pointing out the major differences that I have perceived myself. I am not in data science yet, but I hope to transition in the next year. In this sense take my two cents here with a grain of salt.
