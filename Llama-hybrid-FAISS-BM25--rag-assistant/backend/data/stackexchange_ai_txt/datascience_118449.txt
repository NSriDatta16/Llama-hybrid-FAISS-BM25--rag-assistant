How can I show data clustering after building a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder?

I am brand new to Machine Learning, and just followed Tensorflow Convolutional Variational Autoencoder Tutorial using my own dataset instead of the MNIST set. I was able to successfully display the 2D latent space, but now I want to more explicitly show the clustering of data. How can I use my CVAE to show that there are, for example, 10 distinct clusters for the MNIST data?
