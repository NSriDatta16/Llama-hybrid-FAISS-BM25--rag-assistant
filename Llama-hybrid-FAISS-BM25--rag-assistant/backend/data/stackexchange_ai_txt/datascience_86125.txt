I think you made a mistake here: i was able to achieve great results for my approach when i calculate the TFIDF and PCA first and then do the Test/Train split afterwards. This evaluation was flawed due to data leakage: both the TFIDF and the PCA should be calculated using only the training set. This is more or less the source of your issue with how to proceed in production: normally in production one should just apply the same process as with your test set, but here you were able to prepare your test set differently (and wrongly). For the TFIDF step, the IDF should be computed only using the training set. Note that in the test set you might have to deal with out of vocabulary words. For the PCA step, I'm not too sure how to proceed but I found this explanation .
