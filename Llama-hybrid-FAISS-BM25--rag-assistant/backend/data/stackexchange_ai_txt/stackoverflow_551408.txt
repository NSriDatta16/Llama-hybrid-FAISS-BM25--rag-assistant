It sounds like your site does not target the millions of captive IE6 users who work for large corporations, so they may not be a major concern to you. But for those hoping to reach those users, understand that many large organizations will not be migrating from IE6 any time soon. It is just too costly. The typical user there is not an administrator on their machine and can't change browsers (say, by downloading Firefox or Chrome). Here's one of the problems with the IE6 to IE7 migration: IE7 is picky about some tags. For example, you can't have a self-closing div or script tag. If you try that, IE7 renders a blank page. In addition, IE7 rejects duplicate attributes in a tag. This is a change from IE6. So, there's lots of sloppily-written intranet apps out there that would have to be fixed before they will work in IE6. And it's very hard to search through the code to find these issues. There's little ROI in doing it, so it just isn't being done.
