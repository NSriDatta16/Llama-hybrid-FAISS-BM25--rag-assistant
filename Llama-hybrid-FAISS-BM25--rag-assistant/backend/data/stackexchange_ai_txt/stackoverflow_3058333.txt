Is there any tips for minimising access to a public page without login?

I have a page that is just a non interactive display for a shop window. Obviously, I don't link to it, and I'd also like to avoid people stumbling across it (by Google etc). It will always be powered by Chrome. I have thought of... Checking User Agent for Chrome Ensuring resolution is 1920 x 1080 (not that useful as it is a client side check) Banning under robots.txt to keep Google out of it Do you have any more suggestions? Should I not really worry about it?
