Let $Z=\max(X,Y)$. It's always true by independence that $$ F_Z(z) = P(\max(X,Y) \le z) = P(X \le z)P(Y \le z). $$ If $0 \le z \le 1$, then $P(\max(X,Y) \le z) = z^2/2$. If $1 You get the density by taking the derivative. The density is $f_Z(z) = z 1(0 \le z \le 1) + 1(1 $$ E[\max(X,Y)] = \int_0^1 z^2dz + \int_1^2 z/2 dz = \frac{1}{3} + 1 - \frac{1}{4} $$ We can check this by taking the simulating data and taking the sample average with some R code. It should be close to our answer by the law of large numbers. num
