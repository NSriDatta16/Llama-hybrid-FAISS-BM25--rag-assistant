SVM: Why do we demand the hyperplanes to be equal $\pm 1$?

I'm following this well-known tutorial on SVM. What I'm trying to understand is why we demand the hyperplanes to be $wx - b = \pm 1$? and why is it always possible and done without loss of generality (I've understood that you can always scale $w,b$ accordingly - is that correct?)
