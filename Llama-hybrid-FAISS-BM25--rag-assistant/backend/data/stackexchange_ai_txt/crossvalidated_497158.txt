Is there a minimum number of observations needed to justify the use of random slopes in a logistic regression model?

I have a mixed-effects logistic regression model with 584 observations, which models the outcome of a variable linguistic phenomenon. There are three predictor variables and I I used random intercepts to take into account non-independence in the data (i.e., many observations come from the same word). A reviewer asks why I did not also use random slopes. When I was designing the model, I didn't do this because I didn't think I had enough data to justify random slopes. But I realize that this was just my intuition and that I don't know how much data I would need exactly to warrant random slopes. Are there guidelines on how many observations one needs to justify random slopes? If this is discussed in the literature anywhere, I'd be grateful for references.
