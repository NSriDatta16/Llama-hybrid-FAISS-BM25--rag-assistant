I think your image is mislabeled. I think each blue box is an LSTM layer, composed of multiple cells/units, each of which accepts a vector input x_t. With that, the answers to your questions are: 1) Yes 2) Yes, they are independent (at a single time step - they share information with each other between time steps) 3) Yes, each unit cell will take an input of size 5. I think the output size is always 1, similar to neural network nodes (like sigmoidal units) that combine and then activate.
