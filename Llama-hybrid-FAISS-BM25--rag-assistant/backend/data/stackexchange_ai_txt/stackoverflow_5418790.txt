Xcode 4 - Adding the iOS developer library reference to Organizer - Documentation

In Xcode 4, my Organizer - Documentation window doesn't appear to have the iOS documentation installed, only Mac OS X 10.6 Core Library and Xcode 4.0 Developer Library. Does anyone know if it's possible to add it without re-installing the whole of Xcode 4? (which I really don't want to do...) Thanks.
