There are two reasons: 1. Pragmatically, RFC 3286 refers RFC 2581 for most of the congestion control, and it works in bytes. 2. Practically, and this is a stronger reason, there needs to be a buffer assigned at each end and these would be hard to define in terms of TSNs (chunks) since these are variably size. This would either mean over-allocating space in the buffer e.g. 64K * TSNs, or using a dynamically allocated list. The former is wasteful of space, the latter relatively slow. Does this answer your question, or was it more related to your last question?
