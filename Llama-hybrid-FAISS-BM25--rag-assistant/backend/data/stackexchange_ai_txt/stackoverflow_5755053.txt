Can`t debug pic32 microcontroller or update the configuration bits

i have an PIC32MX460L512 microcontroler( Cerebot MX4 board from Digilent) and after doing some projects, i can`t program it any more. This happend after i tested the board multipliers and dividers to see how the board works using #pragma pll .... i can not write a new hex or change the configuration bits, and i get the following errors PIC32 Starter Kit hardware initialization failure. Error= -1004, Detail=0x80004005, (LID:29) or a second error Device reset failed/ make sure Configuration Bits are correct. I think the board still works because windows can see it in the Devices and Printers. what ca i do? can i reset the memory from some bits? i`m still a noob with microcontrollers. Thanks in advance
