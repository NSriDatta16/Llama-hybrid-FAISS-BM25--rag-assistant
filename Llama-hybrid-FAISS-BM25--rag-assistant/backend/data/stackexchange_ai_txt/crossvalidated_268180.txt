cforest prediction taking too long

I am using the R-package party to build a random forest. The cforest function takes about 5 min to build a random forest model: cf.model However, when I try to predict the training and test samples, the code sits there for hours, without giving me any output: pTrain Also tried the type = "prob" option without luck. Would really appreciate any help with this. Does anyone else have the same problem? Should I be using different options to get the probability output. I tried using ctree and that predicts just fine (and quite fast). I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong here. Thank you in advance!
