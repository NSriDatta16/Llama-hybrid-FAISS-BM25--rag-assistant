Even on something like StackOverflow, there is a certain amount of static organization; there are FAQs, tag pages, question pages, user pages, badge pages, etc.; I'd say in a very dynamic site, the best way to approach a sitemap would be to have a map of the categorizations; each node in the sitemap can point to a page of the dynamically generated data (a node for a question page, a node for a user page, etc.). Of course, a sitemap may not even be appropriate for a given site; there's a certain amount of judgment call required there.
