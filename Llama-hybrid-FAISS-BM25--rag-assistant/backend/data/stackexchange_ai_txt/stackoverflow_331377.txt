How to pack python libs I'm using so I can distribute them with my app and have as few dependencies as possible

How to pack python libs I'm using so I can distribute them with my app and have as few dependencies as possible and also not to conflict with different lib/version that is already on my system. L.E.: Sorry i forgot to specify. I will be doing this on linux. And I'm not referring in making my app a installable file like deb/rpm, etc but how to organize my files so like for example I'll be using cherrypy and sqlalchemy I'll ship those with my app and not put the user through the pain of installing all the dependencies by himself.
