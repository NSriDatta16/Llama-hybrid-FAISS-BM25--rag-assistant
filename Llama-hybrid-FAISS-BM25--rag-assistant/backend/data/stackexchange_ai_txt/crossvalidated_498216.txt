I'll try to give an answer which doesn't require statistical knowledge. On average, group A spend \$11.05 each and group B \$10.20 each. How plausible this difference is will depend on the variance in how much visitors spend on the site per visit. For an extreme high variance case, if the site sells extremely expensive cars, then maybe only two purchases in total were made: a single person in group A bought a \$442,000 car, and a single person in group B bought a \$408,000 car. These data wouldn't be surprising. For an extreme low variance case, suppose that every visitor spends either exactly \$10.20 or exactly \$11.05. For the numbers to add up, everybody in group A would have had to spend \$11.05 and everybody in group B \$10.20 - which is extremely unlikely to happen by chance. If you knew the sample variance, you could use statistical hypothesis testing to quantify how suspicious the difference in mean spending between the groups is. (It's possible that the interviewer was expecting you to make a guess about what the sample variance might plausibly be based on your intuition about visitor behaviour patterns on ecommerce websites.)
