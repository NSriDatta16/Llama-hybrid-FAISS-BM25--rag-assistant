An interval usually has two limits. So a credible interval or a confidence interval of $(-8.13, -2.69)$ would span from $-8.13$ to $-2.69$ . If nothing of the percentage is said, a $95\%$ credible interval for Bayesian statistics, or a $95\%$ confidence interval for Frequentist statistics, is the most likely confidence level. But that is not the only possible interval. Considering those limits to be the $2.5 \%$ and $97.5\%$ quantiles is reasonable, but it is not necessarily so. You need to read more about their method and results. If there is a different percentage mentioned somewhere in the text that goes along with these data. A confidence interval and a credible interval are very often close to each other in values, but there are very different theories behind them. They stem from two very different ways of doing statistics and a total beginner should probably first get accustomed with one oft them. When you feel advanced enough, you'll find lots of good texts on the differences on CrossValidated as well as on the web.
