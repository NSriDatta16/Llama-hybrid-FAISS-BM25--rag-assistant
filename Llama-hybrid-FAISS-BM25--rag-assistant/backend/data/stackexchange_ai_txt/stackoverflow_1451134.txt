The best way to do this would be with an inclusion tag. This is a tag that renders a template fragment which renders the 10 related articles. You just pass in the current article into the tag, and return the context for the template fragment - ie the related articles. @register.inclusion_tag('related_articles.html') def related_articles(article, count): category = article.category articles = category.article_set.exclude(id=article.id)[:count] return {'articles': articles} You'll need a related_articles.html file in your templates directory which outputs the articles. Then, to call it from your main template, you would just do {% related_articles article 10 %} where article is the name of the article object.
