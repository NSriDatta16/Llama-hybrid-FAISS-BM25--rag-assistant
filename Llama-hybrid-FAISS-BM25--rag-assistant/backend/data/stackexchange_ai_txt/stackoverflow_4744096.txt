Selected Item in ListBox gray out after returning from other page

I have two pages : P1 and P2. In P1, a) Loading data from IsolatedStorage and DataBinding to listBox1 take place in Button click event in P1. b) user select an item and be navigated to P2 example : user select CarModel_1 in P2: user press Back Key in P2 to return to P1. The problem : When returnning from P2, the Selected Item in ListBox1 becomes gray out or Not clickable to go to P2. example : CarModel_1 becomes gray out or Not clickable. The rest is clickable. Appreciate your help on this. Thanks
