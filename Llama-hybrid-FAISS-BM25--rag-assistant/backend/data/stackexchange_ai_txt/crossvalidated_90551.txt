You appear to be assuming that the largest eigenvalue necessarily can be paired with the largest coefficient within the eigenvectors. That would be wrong. The question clearly transcends software choice. Here is a fairly silly PCA on five measures of car size using Stata's auto dataset. I used a correlation matrix as starting point, the only sensible option given quite different units of measurement. . pca headroom trunk weight length displacement Principal components/correlation Number of obs = 74 Number of comp. = 5 Trace = 5 Rotation: (unrotated = principal) Rho = 1.0000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component | Eigenvalue Difference Proportion Cumulative -------------+------------------------------------------------------------ Comp1 | 3.76201 3.026 0.7524 0.7524 Comp2 | .736006 .427915 0.1472 0.8996 Comp3 | .308091 .155465 0.0616 0.9612 Comp4 | .152627 .111357 0.0305 0.9917 Comp5 | .0412693 . 0.0083 1.0000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Principal components (eigenvectors) ---------------------------------------------------------------- Variable | Comp1 Comp2 Comp3 Comp4 Comp5 -------------+-------------------------------------------------- headroom | 0.3587 0.7640 0.5224 -0.1209 0.0130 trunk | 0.4334 0.3665 -0.7676 0.2914 0.0612 weight | 0.4842 -0.3329 0.0737 -0.2669 0.7603 length | 0.4863 -0.2372 -0.1050 -0.5745 -0.6051 displacement | 0.4610 -0.3390 0.3484 0.7065 -0.2279 ---------------------------------------------------------------- (Output truncated.) The first component picks up on the fact that as all variables are measures of size, they are well correlated. So to first approximation the coefficients are equal; that's to be expected when all the variables hang together. The remaining components in effect pick up the idiosyncratic contribution of each of the original variables. That is not inevitable, but it works out quite simply for this example. But, to your point, you can see that the largest coefficients, say those above 0.7 in absolute value, are associated with components 2 to 5. There is nothing to stop the largest coefficient being associated with the last component. (UPDATE) The eigenvectors are informative, but it is also helpful to calculate the components themselves as new variables and then look at their correlations with the original variables. Here they are: pc1 pc2 pc3 pc4 pc5 headroom 0.6958 0.6554 0.2900 -0.0472 0.0026 trunk 0.8405 0.3144 -0.4261 0.1138 0.0124 weight 0.9392 -0.2856 0.0409 -0.1043 0.1545 length 0.9432 -0.2035 -0.0583 -0.2245 -0.1229 displacement 0.8942 -0.2909 0.1934 0.2760 -0.0463 Here trunk is the variable most strongly correlated with pc3 , but negatively. A story on why that happens would depend on looking at the data and the PCs. I don't care enough about the example to do that here, but it would be good practice. Although I produced the example with a little prior thought, and it is suitable for your question, and it is based on real data, it is also salutary: interpreting the PCs may be no easier than interpreting something more direct such as scatter plots and correlations. However, not every PCA application depends on ability to interpret PCs as having substantive meaning, and much of the literature warns against doing that in any case. For some purposes, the whole point is a mechanistic reordering of the information in the data.
