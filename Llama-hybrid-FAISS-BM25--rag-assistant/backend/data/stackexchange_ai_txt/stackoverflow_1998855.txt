I'm all for whitespace - it's an insignificant amount of memory usage that vastly improves the readability of code by cutting the program up into logical steps. This isn't a replacement for good comments, however . My commenting rule is 'try not to do the things that are irritating in other peoples code (which usually turns out to be not commenting - A simple '//do X and Y if Z says it's necessary' is a good level of detail for an individual comment I reckon) We have plenty of storage space and good sized monitors, so why not use it to make the job easier? Huge chunks of whitespaces can push code down off the screen however, which hinders the ability to look at the code and get a good overview, so it's best not to overdo it. Like all things in programming it's down to case-by-case judgement, personal preference and a hint of moderation.
