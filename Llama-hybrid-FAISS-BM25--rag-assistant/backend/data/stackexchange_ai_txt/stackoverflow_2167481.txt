ESENT table browser?

Has anyone had any experience with the Esent database engine? I've been taking a look at what it's used for, and am getting excited. Active Directory is implemented on top of an Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) table manager, historically called "Jet." This same table manager is used by Exchange, File Replication service (FRS) the security configuration editor, Certificate Services, Windows Internet Name Service (WINS), and various other Windows components. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961824.aspx There's also a c# wrapper around the API http://www.codeplex.com/ManagedEsent , and is being used by Ayende Rahien's DivanDB (.net document storage LINQ engine) https://rhino-tools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rhino-tools/branches/rhino-divandb Anyhow- does anyone know of a "table browser" / some for of GUI for managing Esent?
