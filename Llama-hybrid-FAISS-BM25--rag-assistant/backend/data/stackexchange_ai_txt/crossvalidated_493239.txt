How to calculate the expected value of an estimator?

According to my book : An estimator, say, T, of the parameter $ \theta $ is said to be an unbiased estimator of $\theta$ if $ E\left( T\right) = \theta$ . It then explains how to calculate $E\left( T\right)$ as follows: $E\left( T\right)$ is obtained by taking the average value of $T$ computed from all possible samples of a given size that may be drawn from the population. That is, $ E\left( T\right) =\mu _{T}$ . I am looking for an explanation of this method of calculating $E\left( T\right)$ .
