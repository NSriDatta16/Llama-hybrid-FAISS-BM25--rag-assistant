Problem using nppToR or Tinn-R

Thanks everybody for the reply! Now I fixed the problem by R 2.12.1 and NpptoR (version 2.5.2), without setting the registry. After a while of my updating of R from 2.11.1 to 2.12.0, I was now completely unable to pass scripts to R from Notepad++ (working together with nppToR). when I installed nppToR, I always get the same dialogue of "Could not find the Rgui.exe file. Aborting" , and it will not ready for use. I thought it is caused by the updating of R.2.11.1 to R.2.12.0 because the Rgui.exe were located in different location. Then, for a while, the nppToR works after I edit the nppToR.ini file, from this: [install] global=1 into this, which is also from the previous version of the nppToR files: [executables] R=C:\Program Files\R\R-2.12.0\bin\i386\Rgui.exe --max-mem-size=2047M Rcmdparms= Npp= NppConfig= [hotkeys] passline=F8 passfile=^F8 evaltocursor=+F8 batchrun=^!F8 rhelp=^F1 [putty] activateputty=1 puttyline=F9 puttyfile=^F9 [controls] Rpastewait=50 Rrunwait=10 restoreclipboard=1 appendnewline=1 [silent] enablesilent=1 silentkey=!F8 [install] global=1 However, in these days, this modification never work for me, even though I uninstalled the R.2.12.0 and installed R.2.11.1. And I really have no idea the reason for that. Is there some one had the same experiences? Or, can some one help me out? PS.: I also tried Tinn-R as an alternative, but after some time of use, the cursor usually appear in some position just like it is going mad, and when I input the code, each line can have only one single letter, and the cursor will move to the next line automatically.Do any body know why? Thank in advance~ Best Regards~ Marco
