You donâ€™t need MS Access installed on a computer to read data out of an Access Database Engine file. All copies of windows since windows 2000 ships with the Access Database Engine; however this will be the Jet 4.0 engine and you will need the components for the ACE (2007) engine. Happily, it is available for download from Microsoft as 2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components . Any programming language that supports com objects will left you lift out data without having MS Access installed. You can even use windows scripting here and not even install ANY software on your windows box. The following code is for the Jet mdb version of the Access Database Engine but you may be able to adapt it for your needs using ACEDAO: Set dbEng = CreateObject("DAO.DBEngine.36") strMdbFile = "C:\Documents and Settings\" & _ "Albert\My Documents\Access\" & _ "ScriptExample\MultiSelect.mdb" Set db = dbEng.OpenDatabase(strMdbFile) strQuery = "select * from contacts" Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(strQuery) rs.MoveFirst If rs.EOF = True Then Quit End If strTextOut = "C:\t5.txt" Set fs = Wscript.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set ts = fs.OpenTextFile(strTextOut, 2, True) '2 = write, 1 = read Do While rs.EOF = False strOutText = rs("LastName") ts.Writeline strOutText rs.MoveNext Loop ts.Close rs.Close However, really, if this is one time export, then finding someone with a copy of MS Access will make this less work, but you CAN read a access file without having to install ANY software. In fact, as noted above, even a virgin install of windows would allow you to use the above windows script file which also can be run without any software having been installed on the windows box.
