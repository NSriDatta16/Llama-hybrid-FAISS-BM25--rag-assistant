Analysis and writing up results

I am doing research for my Masters studies and am battling a bit with the statistical side of my study. I used a survey and have captured all the data into SPSS. I have no statistical background, I would thus need a bit of advice on how to interpret / analyse results. I am making use of Chi-Square test to look at relationships between categorical and other categorical variables and Correlation test for relationships between ordinal and other ordinal variables. Because of the dichotomy, I am making use of Binomial logistic regression. What I don't know is how to write results up and analyse results. For example a correlation of .000 is highly significant, but how do I word it? And what if almost all the results in the table are highly significant? For example people who agree that shopping online is safe also agree that the internet is trustworthy. Kind of expected - the result is significant but rather obvious.
