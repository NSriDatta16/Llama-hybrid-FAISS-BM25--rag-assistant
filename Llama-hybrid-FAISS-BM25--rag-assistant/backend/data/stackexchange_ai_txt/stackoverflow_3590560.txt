The C standard doesn't state many storage requirements. As it is, you could have: 256-bit C int s that take 32 bytes to store anything (see @nonnb's comment) A wide C string ( wchar_t[] ) that uses UCS-4/UTF-32 characters (as all GNU implementations do, apparently) A C implementation that uses 32-bit char s (which would have to be on a system with 32-bit bytes)
