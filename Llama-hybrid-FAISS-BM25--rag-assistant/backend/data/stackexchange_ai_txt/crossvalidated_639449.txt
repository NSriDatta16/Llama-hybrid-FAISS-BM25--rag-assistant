Linear Regression with Only Categorical Features: Evaluating the Model

Big Idea: This might seem a bit rambly, but there is a unified theme: how good is my model, and can I trust the predictions it's giving me? Background: I am performing a linear regression (not logistic regression), where the response is continuous but all the features are categorical. I asked this question yesterday, but I have a different question today. A priori, I wouldn't expect such a model to perform terribly well: it doesn't make intuitive sense that only categorical features would be able adequately to predict where a continuous variable should be. $\mathbf{R}^2\!\!:$ In my model, I've got a pretty low $R^2$ value, $0.13.$ Again, that's to be expected. But here's the kicker: the model is actually giving me very reasonable predictions. I'm wondering if the $R^2$ value (which I know is not the whole story of model evaluation - residual plot coming up) is just not a good number for evaluating linear regressions where all the features are categorical? Is there a better number for when all the features are categorical? Residuals vs Fitted: As promised, here is a plot of the residuals against the fitted: Would it make sense to try to reproduce this plot, while using some additional information to color the plot (by values of various categories)? And if the variance appears to be different for different values of a particular category, would that be evidence of heteroskedasticity? I have my suspicions about the small cluster of points to the right. Also, is this residual plot telling me I have some systematic phenomenon going on that the model isn't capturing? Other Diagnostics: The Q-Q plot is long-tailed, but I figure as long as I'm doing prediction (I just want to know the effect of switching from one value to another of the categorical variables) and not inference, I'm OK there. Leverages seem reasonable. There's no reason to suspect correlated errors (nothing is a time series or correlated in time). No doubt there are some outliers, but again, I'm not doing inference. Summary: Like I said, the predictions the model is giving me seem reasonable, but I need more than that; I need to take this model to leadership and I need to be able to say that the model is reliable enough to mean what it's saying, with authority. I've seen a related thread here , but it doesn't answer my question. Should I look into quantile regression, as this post mentions?
