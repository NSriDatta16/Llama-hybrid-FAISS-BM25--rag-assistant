See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.storageclient.bloblistingdetails.aspx . I think you want something like container.ListBlobs(new BlobRequestOptions() { BlobListingDetails = BlobListingDetails.Snapshots }); (Sorry if that code isn't quite right... don't have VS open.)
