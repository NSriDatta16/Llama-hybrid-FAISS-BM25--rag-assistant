Normalizing Ordinal Predictors When Treating as Continuous in Regression

There are a variety of questions about ordinal predictors in regression analyses. I am interested in logistic regression and specifically whether I need to normalize ordinal data after deciding to treat it as continuous. Should I normalize the data using the standard score (i.e. (x - xmean)/std deviation)? I think it makes sense to do so but are there other, better methods for normalizing ordinal data when treating it is continuous in a logistic regression equation?
