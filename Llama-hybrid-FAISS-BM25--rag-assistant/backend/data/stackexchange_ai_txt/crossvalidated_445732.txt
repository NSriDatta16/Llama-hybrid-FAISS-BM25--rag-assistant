time series model with additional, time-independent regressors?

How does one introduce time-independent regressors into a time-series model? Let's say that you want to model house prices based on mortgage valuations from the past 5 years AND based on additional regressors such as house size (time-independent) and population density in the area (time-dependent), as well as years since construction (time-dependent). Would such regressors be called external? Is this doable with AR/MA/etc models? If so, could you point me to the relevant approach? Thanks!
