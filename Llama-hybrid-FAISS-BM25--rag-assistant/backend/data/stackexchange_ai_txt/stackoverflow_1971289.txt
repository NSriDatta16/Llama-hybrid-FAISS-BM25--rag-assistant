Magento - Removing Active State From Home Page

I have this code in top.phtml which displays my menu items in my Magento store: __('Category Navigation:') ?> > getUrl('') ?>"> __('Home') ?> getStoreCategories() as $_category): ?> drawItem($_category) ?> > getUrl('catalogsale')?>"> __('Sale Items') ?> I have an extra li at the bottom which displays another page. The problem I have occurs when I click the ‘Sales Item’ page: its link becomes active but so does the home page link. How can I prevent the home page link from appearing active? I’ve added a screenshot to show the problem: Screenshot
