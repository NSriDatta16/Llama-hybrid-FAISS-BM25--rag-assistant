Silhouette Score for ordered clusters

My clusters are arranged according to a time series, and I want to compute the silhouette score for the clustering performed, considering that they follow an order. Therefore the nearest cluster to the present cluster will be the one that comes next in the time series. What I have tried, Data # Sample Matrix cell_1 Calculation intra cluster mean unique_clusters Calculation of separation based on the natural order of cluster labels nearest_means length(unique_clusters)){break} next_cluster_index Calculation of Silhouette Score # calculate silhouette score for each data point silhouette_scores Problems with the script I have a huge data matrix, and this script consumes too much time I implemented it using the silhouette score formula; however, different websites show different methods. I am not confident enough that it is a right implementation. Is there a library which to compute silhouette score taking into account cluster order
