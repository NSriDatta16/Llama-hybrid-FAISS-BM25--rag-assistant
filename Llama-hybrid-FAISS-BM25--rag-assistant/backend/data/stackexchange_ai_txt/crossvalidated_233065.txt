Can I use test data to fit a TFIDF Transformer/Vectorizer?

From the examples I've seen, it seems to me that generally people build a TFIDF transformer based on only on text in the training data, and then use that transformer to transform the test data. Why isn't OK (or is it) to have the TFIDF transformer fit on text in both the training and test data? After all, one wouldn't be looking at the test data's labels, and thus one could practically do this in the real-world when applying to new datasets whose labels are unknown.
