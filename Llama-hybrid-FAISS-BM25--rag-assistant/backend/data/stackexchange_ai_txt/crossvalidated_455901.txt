In a neural network, why can't there be more weights than the number of observations?

After having this exact same issue with caret , I arrived at this thread . However, I do not intuitively understand why this answer is correct. Why can't there be more weights than the number of observations? Is this a bug/idiosyncrasy in this particular R package or is there a statistical reason for it?
