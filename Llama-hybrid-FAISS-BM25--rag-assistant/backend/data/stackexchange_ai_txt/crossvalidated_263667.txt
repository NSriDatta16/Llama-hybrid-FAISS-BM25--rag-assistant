It is more challenging to detect non-linear effects in logistic regression as opposed to linear regression, but some possible answers are to plot the predictors vs the deviance residuals or pearson residuals. Or, look at sample proportions in categories defined by the predicted values (analogous to the hosmer lemeshow chi square). If there is major lack of fit there, that could indicate non-linear predictor effects. Then, try polynomial terms (or general non-linear regression approaches) and see if that improves the agreement between predicted and observed proportions.
