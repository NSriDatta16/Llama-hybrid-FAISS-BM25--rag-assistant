Markov chains that do not contain all the states in the model

I am trying to understand Mixture Markov Models in order to cluster a set of sequences that do not necessarily all have the same states occurring in them. If I have several sequences that I am trying to fit a Mixture Markov Model to, how do I go about the fact that some of the chains contain a part of all possible states while the others might contain other states? For example: sequence 1: 1 2 4 2 4 1 sequence 2: 3 2 3 3 3 3 sequence 3: 1 2 3 1 1 2 How would I define a transition probability matrix for each of the sequences, given that the set of possible states is {1,2,3,4}? In the context of Mixture Markov Modeling, shouldn't a transition probability matrix be 4x4 and contain transfer probabilities for each state from the collection -> each state of the collection? Take for instance sequence1: My understanding is that the TPM of sequence1 should be: 1 2 3 4 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0.5 0.5 0 0 This seems to be incorrect, since TPM is a stochastic matrix whose rows sum up to 1, and the third row is just all 0s. Should I completely remove state 3 if I am building a transition probability matrix of a specific sequence? The reason I need to have a Markov chain for each sequence is that I am trying to calculate log-likelihood distance between each two sequences in order to build a distance matrix and get medoids for initializing the Mixture Markov Model. The formula for distance that I am trying to use is: $D(seq_i,seq_j)=1/2* log(p(seq_i|v_j)+p(seq_j|v_i))$, where $v_i,v_j$ are the Markov Chains representing the sequences $seq_i$ and $seq_j$ correspondingly. How would I define sequences 1,2,3 in terms of their transition probability matrices and single ML-estimated Markov chains representing each sequence?
