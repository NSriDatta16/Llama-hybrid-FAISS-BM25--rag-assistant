This ought to be a typo on rstatistics.net. You are correct that the null hypothesis of the Breusch-Pagan test is homoscedasticity (= variance does not depend on auxiliary regressors). If the $p$-value becomes "small", the null hypothesis is rejected. I would recommend contacting the authors of rstatistics.net regarding this issue to see if they agree and fix it. Moreover, note that glvma() employs a different auxiliary regressor than bptest() by default and switches off studentization. More precisely, you can see the differences if you replicate the results by setting the arguments of bptest() explicitly. The model is given by: data("cars", package = "datasets") lmMod The default employed by bptest() then uses the same auxiliary regressors as the model, i.e., speed in this case. Also it uses the studentized version with improved finite-sample properties yielding a non-significant result. library("lmtest") bptest(lmMod, ~ speed, data = cars, studentize = TRUE) ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: lmMod ## BP = 3.2149, df = 1, p-value = 0.07297 In contrast, the glvma() switches off studentization and checks for a linear trend in the variances. cars$trend As you can see both $p$-values are rather small but on different sides of 5%. The studentized versions are both slightly above 5%.
