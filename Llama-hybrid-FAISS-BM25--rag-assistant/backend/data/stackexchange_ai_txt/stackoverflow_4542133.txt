It's not possible to store a 250MB database in 5MB of storage. Possible work-arounds: If you know about your data, you can write a specialized compression algorithm. Store only a subset of the data offline which you think that user will use. If they need other data, then they will need to connect. Don't include images, sounds, videos, etc. in the offline data, but include all the text. 5MB will hold a lot of text, but not very many pictures and graphics.
