The solutions you suggest are valid except for the last one. Since you are using 2d CNN you cannot use 1d input. In fact, your model already has a Rescaling preprocessing layer that will normalize the input to the range [0,1] and resize it to 250x250. Scaling can negatively affect accuracy (especially upscaling), but it can be mitigated by training the model with data augmentation - cropping, rescaling, padding (adding black pixels) - whatever you will use at the inference step for your users. Cropping may also cut out important parts of the image, so it depends on your task. For example, if it's face recognition, faces are usually centered, so cropping will work. You can also detect an object and crop it. If you cannot retrain you model, I would choose to crop and downscale for large images and upscale to the full width/height for small ones
