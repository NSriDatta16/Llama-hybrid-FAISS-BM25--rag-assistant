Yes, I use it a lot. By using different xslt files, I can use the same XML source to create multiple polyglot (X)HTML files (presenting the same data in different ways), a RSS feed, an Atom feed, a RDF descriptor file and fragment of a site map. It's not a panacea. There are things it does well, and things it doesn't do well, and like all other aspects of programming, it's all about using the right tool for the right job. It's a tool that's well worth having in your toolbox but it should used only when it's appropriate to do so.
