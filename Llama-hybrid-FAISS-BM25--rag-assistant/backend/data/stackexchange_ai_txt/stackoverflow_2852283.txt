python: naming a module that has a two-word name

I'm trying to put together a really simple module with one .py source file in it, and have already run into a roadblock. I was going to call it scons-config but import scons-config doesn't work in Python. I found this SO question and looked at PEP8 style guide but am kind of bewildered, it doesn't talk about two-word-name conventions. What's the right way to deal with this? module name: SconsConfig? scons_config? sconsconfig? scons.config? name of the single .py file in it: scons-config.py? scons_config.py? edit: I did see "the use of underscores is discouraged" and that left me at a dead end: should I use "sconsconfig" or "scons_config" (I guess the other ones are out)?
