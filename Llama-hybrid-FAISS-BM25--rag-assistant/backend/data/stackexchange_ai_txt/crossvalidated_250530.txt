Feature extraction from music segments

I'm doing a project on music mood classification and using the Million Song Dataset. I have two features Segments_Timbre and Segments_Pitches that I would like to analyze. Here is some information about these: https://web.archive.org/web/20161203075937/http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/example-track-description Segments_Timbre contains multidimensional arrays and the shapes vary for each song. For e.g, in one song it may (965, 12) while for another it could be (679, 12). This is an MFCC like feature. Segments_Pitches is similar and contains chroma features for each segment. My questions are: Can these two be called time series data? If this is time series data, is segment aggregation (taking average and standard deviation of each segment) enough? I assume this would cause a loss of information. How do I extract features from these two columns such that they can be used in SVMs, Random Forests and other classifiers? What sort of time series based feature extraction should I do? Is PCA useful here in anyway? The pitch and timbre features are quite large.
