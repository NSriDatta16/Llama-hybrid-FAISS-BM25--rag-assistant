Refactoring is good. While you might not want to start by reading this thesis about refactoring , it is a good read and puts it all in perspective. You might also want to check the answers to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/441896/how-to-be-master-in-c-and-object-oriented-technology which have a book on refactoring. The bottom line is that you don't have to put all the code in the right place and organize it in the right way. Do something that is good enough for now, make note of it in a possible refactoring list, and when you have some time, go through the list and take a fresh look at the code. Maybe good enough, is good enough. If not, help the code to EVOLVE into something better.
