Negative margin would be a much more elegant solution in this situation ( revised jsFiddle ). Note that I've had to move the #eee background to div#main, as it would otherwise overlay on the background of div#top. As a general rule of thumb, I'd also recommend avoiding relative positioning unless absolutely necessary - can often lead to z-index headaches in older versions of IE.
