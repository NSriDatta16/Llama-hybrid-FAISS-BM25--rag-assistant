Forcing aggressive supersampling in a raytracer

Does anyone know how to force a large amount of supersampling in Blender or POV-Ray, say 100 samples per pixel, at least? This is for a research project that is heavily dependent on sub-pixel artifacts. Rendering a large image and shrinking it will not work because a few critical pixels will be very bright, and the output values will be clipped. They would need to be averaged before clipping. Blender seems to support only 5, 8, 11, or 16 samples , since it uses predefined sampling patterns. POV-Ray does not support non-adaptive supersampling methods , which is necessary because there is a large variation within pixels that may not be apparent from variation between pixels.
