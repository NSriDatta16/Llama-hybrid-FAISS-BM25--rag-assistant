Clearest way to visualise temporal data?

I've collected bus arrival times at my local bus stop from the past month - so I have every time my bus (a specific bus number) shows up at my bus stop for each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). I am struggling at determining the best and clearest way to display this data. Eventually I want to use a clustering algorithm to help understand the most likely time the bus will show up. So on a Monday I know if the bus is more likely to show up at 7.45am or 7.48 am. I believe 8 charts will be best - one chart for each day of the week, and then one final chart that shows the average regardless of day of week. What would be my best chart type for clearly visualising this data?
