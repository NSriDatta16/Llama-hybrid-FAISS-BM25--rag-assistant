As far as I can see, you are looking for the storage part of a data warehouse system here (your reports would be the front-end). Actually, the way commercial systems are doing it, is the cache you described: Preaggregate your tables and create caches of them. The only way to accelerate your queries is to make the database system do less for them. This means less data, which in turn means less time spent in iterating the data or less data in the indices. That said, I would either propose the "40 cache solution" (are there really more than 24 timezones). You should be able to trivially parallelize the sorting queue by creating copies of the data. Another way to do this, would be to cache at hour granularity and then aggregate the hours into days (or 30 minutes if your timezones require this). This means you cache at a finer granularity than your daily cache but at a coarser granularity than the original data.
