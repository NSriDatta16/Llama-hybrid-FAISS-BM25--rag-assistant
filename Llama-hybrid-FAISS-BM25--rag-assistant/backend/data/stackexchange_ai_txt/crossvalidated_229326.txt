Recovering data from a poorly-formatted source

I've been given a stack of demographic data to look over by the small nonprofit I work for, though as the original electronic files have been misplaced by a predecessor I'm having to reverse-engineer it from a strangely-formatted hardcopy. The data is currently of the form; 00001 Name Address 1 Postcode Etc 00002 Name Address 1 Postcode Etc with each individual a paragraph and each line a field. While I've managed to scan and OCR the text into Notepad++ as well as strip out the printer's markings and other non-data, I'm struggling to get it transformed into excel (ie each para from the txt forms a new excel row, with lines within each para seperated horizontally into adjacent cells). There are enough entries that copy-pasting them across line by line is infeasible. Could anyone suggest a better way of doing this?
