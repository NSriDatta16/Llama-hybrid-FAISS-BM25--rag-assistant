Can someone explain Stein's method/discrepancy in a way that makes sense?

I have been wanting to understand this paper in a deeper way for a long time Stein Variational Gradient Descent: A General Purpose Bayesian Inference Algorithm But everytime I read about Stein's method or Stein's Lemma I get confused and I am not sure about where to go to get some understanding. To start, I don't understand how the Stein operator $\mathcal{A}$ and function $\phi$ $$\mathcal{A}_p\phi(x) = \phi(x) \nabla_x \log p(x)^\top + \nabla_x \phi(x)$$ come from the wikipedia articles linked above. IDK what makes this topic so confusing compared to other things, but I think I need a fresh perspective on this if someone could help explain it to me. Thanks
