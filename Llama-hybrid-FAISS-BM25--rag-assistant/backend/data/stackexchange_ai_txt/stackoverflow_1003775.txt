Here's an article talking about Use Case Points - via Normalized Use Case. I think the one factor overlooked in your approach is the productivity which is suppose to be based on past projects. 20 seems to be the average HOWEVER if you are VERY productive (there's a known 10 to 1 ratio of moderate to good programmers) the productivity could be 5 bringing the UCP est. close to what you think it should be. I would suggest looking at past projects, calculating the UCP, getting the total hours and determining what your productivity really is. Productivity being a key factor needs to be calculated for individuals and teams to be able to be used in the estimation effectively.
