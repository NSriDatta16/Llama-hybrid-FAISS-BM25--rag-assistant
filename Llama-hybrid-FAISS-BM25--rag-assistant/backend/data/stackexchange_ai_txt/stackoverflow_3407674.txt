FlashBuilder 4/Flex, set transparent background for web app?

I'm embeding a flex application into a web page using the most recent version of swfobject.js. I've set wmode to transparent and all that but whatever I've enterd for the embeded objects default size, is then a white background within my application. I've set the application's backgroundAlpha to 0 and I know that part works because my aplication resizes after it has finished loading. The resized portion of the application is transparent but the rest still has the white background so it's obvious it has something to do with the application and not the html or javascript embedding it. How do i fix this?
