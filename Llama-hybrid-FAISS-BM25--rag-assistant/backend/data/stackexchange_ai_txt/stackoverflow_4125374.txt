How to get rid of strongly typed tableadapters and datatables

In our organization we are maintaining a VS 2005 website that relies heavily on strongly typed tableadapters and datatables. Needless to say that it is a maintainability nightmare for many reasons: To generate new table adapters we need to connect to an MSSQL2005 and less database and since we upgraded our database to MSSQL2008 this is really hell. We're in the end of 2010 and we really like to use VS2010 for this project but upgrading it fails to compile miserably. I guess we could work on getting this to work but we would rather get rid of this terrible technology all together. The generated code is huge and looks awful and I doubt anyone can understand it without something like LSD. At this point we really would like to do the minimum to help us get rid of these tableadapters because we don't have time and it is less of a priority for management because it "works". So suggesting nHibernate is a revolution that we will not probably ensue. Thank you in advance.
