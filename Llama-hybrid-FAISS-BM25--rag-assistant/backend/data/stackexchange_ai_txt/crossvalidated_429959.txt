A likert scale is not the 5-point answering format. A scale is a sum of such "assigned" numbers and usual practice is to do some thourough investigation (including but not limited to factor analysis) whether the added items belong together in the sense of forming more or less a single factor. Such sums of multiple items have been used by Rensis Likert in Likert, R. “A technique for the measurement of attitudes”.Archives of Psychology, 1932;Vol 22, No. 140, p 55 https://legacy.voteview.com/pdf/Likert_1932.pdf Whilst attaching numbers to ordinal data still results in ordinal data that you are not allowed to sum, simply doing so worked well for Likert, as he writes Although the sigma technique seemed to be quite satisfactory for the intended use, it was decided to try a simpler technique to see if it gave results comparable with the sigma technique. If it did, the simpler method would save considerable work in a general survey type of study of this kind. The simpler technique involved the assigning of values of from 1 to 5 to each of the five different positions on the five-point statements. The ONE end was always assigned to the negative end of the sigma scale, and the FIVE end to the positive end of the sigma scale. After assigning in this manner the numerical values to the possible responses, the score for each individual was determined by finding the average of the numerical values of the positions that he checked. Actually, since the number of statements was the same for all individuals, the sum of the numerical scores rather then the mean was used. The reliability of odds vs. evens for this method yielded essentially the same values as those obtained with the sigma method of scoring. The scores obtained by this method and the sigma method correlated almost perfectly as will be seen in Table IV. So you are doing something that is not following strict mathematical rules but has worked anyways for some time now in a framework called "Classical Test Theory". Taking the habit of summing ordinal data out of that framework (i. e. scale building etc.) might impose serious problems, so there is no simple saying "Its ok, you're doing it right." Depending on the circumstances it may be the most suitable thing for you to do, but be aware of breaking the rules of mathematics here. The mean of "disagree" and "neutral" is not "disagree and a half"! Strongly disagree -> 1, Disagree -> 2, Neutral -> 5, Agree -> 10, Strongly agree -> 17 Assigning number 1 to 5 is common practice, using values of 5, 10 and 17 will need some serious justification.
