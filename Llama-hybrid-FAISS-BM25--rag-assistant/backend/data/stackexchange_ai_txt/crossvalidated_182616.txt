Meaning of expected value of ratio $\mathbb{E}\bigg(\frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}}\bigg)=1$?

I'm wondering what does it mean for the expected value of a ratio to equal one: $$\mathbb{E}\bigg(\frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}}\bigg)=1$$ and if this is some general property of the expectation of some ratio. This appears in the context of the Cox, Ross and Rubinstein options pricing model. I've seen a claim that this means that the "price doesn't change on average".
