At the very least, you should obfuscate your dlls to prevent hackers & competitors from viewing and making sense of your code. Obfuscation is not 100% foolproof, but it presents a big enough obstacle in their path. Some obfuscators such as Crypto Obfuscator have a feature of embedding all dlls in the main exe so your dlls are not explicitly visible and available on disk to open in reverse-engineering tools such as Reflector.
