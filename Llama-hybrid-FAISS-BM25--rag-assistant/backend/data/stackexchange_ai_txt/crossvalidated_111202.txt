There already exists a method very similar to what you're describing (weighted averages of predictions using cross-validated scores as weights). It is called SuperLearner. http://biostats.bepress.com/ucbbiostat/paper222/ ( This book focuses on another method called TMLE, but succinctly describes SuperLearner and its theory in a few chapters) Googling SuperLearner will get you the latest research on that.
