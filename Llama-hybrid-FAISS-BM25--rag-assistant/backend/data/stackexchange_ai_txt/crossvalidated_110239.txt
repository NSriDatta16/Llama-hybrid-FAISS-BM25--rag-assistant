At first a brief introduction: in the finite mixture models (HMM) you observe a time series $x_i, t =1,\dots, T$ and you suppose that at each time $t$ you are in a specific regime/state that are represented by the variable $z_i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. The observations $x_i$ are distributed accordingly to a distribution $F(\cdot)$, but the parameter of the distribution depends on the state you are, so in if you are in state 1 ($z_i=1$) then $x_i \sim F(\phi_i) $ or equivalently $x_i \sim F(\phi_{z_i})$. Regarding the distribution of $Z_i$ i think there is a problem, in the standard HMM the variable assumed by $z_i$ depends on the value of $z_{i-1}$. Let $\boldsymbol{\pi}_i = (\pi_{i1}, \pi_{i2}...)$ be a vector of probability where $pi_{ij}$ mean the probability of be in the state $i$ and in the next time being in the state j, then the probability of $z_i \sim \boldsymbol{\pi}_{z_{i-1}}$ Now: 1) $z_i$ indicates the state on time $i$, it depends on the vector of probability $\pi_{z_{i-1}}$ and decide which parameter use in the distribution of $x_i$ 2) is the distribution (multinomial) of $z_i$ 3)is the distribution of $x_i$
