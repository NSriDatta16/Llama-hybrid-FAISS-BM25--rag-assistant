Order of variables in PCA changes loading scores?

I carried out a PCA with three variables and noticed that when I change the order of the columns of these three variables the loading scores change i.e. negative to positive or vice versa. The values themselves stay the same. I don't know enough about PCA to grasp why it is doing this but from my understanding, the scores shouldn't change with the order of the variables since their position to one another is not altered? The variables are measured on different scales so I have standardised them first using scale() in R.
