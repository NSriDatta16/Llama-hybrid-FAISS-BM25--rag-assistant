Simple Percentage Calculation of an Input Field with JQuery

I'm building a PayPal form that the user enters the amount and after that transfered to paypal, everything is working fine but i need to add a calculation plugin to do the following, If a user enters in the field 10$ (Calculate 10$-2%=8$) and return the result as text inside a span 8$ At the end of the form i have a "(p) paragraph" with a span id "site_commission_box" inside. I need to show the calculated number inside this span. Which JQuery plugin is good for use on this and how i can use it? Any good example or tutorial to find out how i can do it? Thanks a lot, Philip Amount (US$) : PayPal takes $0.35 commission for a $1 donation. Please enter an amount and try again. &nbsp;Transferring to PayPal, please wait... -2% of the price it will be $ USD .
