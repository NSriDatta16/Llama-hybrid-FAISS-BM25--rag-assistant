Use a fulltext search engine in conjunction with mysql. For example sphinx. After every insert cycle let sphinx update it's cache. Than you can use sphinxse (use sphinx as a storage engine in mysql) to get your result. http://www.howtoforge.com/sphinx-as-mysql-storage-engine-sphinxse Also 10 to 15 minutes seems to much time for 500000 inserts. You should use MyISAM as a storage engine for log tables and than use INSERT DELAYED instead of INSERT (I don't know how to achive that with hybernate).
