Average Rating script

I have asked this once before but i didnt get a very clear answer. I need to know how to make a rating script for a site. I have a form that submits a rating out of ten to mysql. How would you get the average rating to be displayed from the mysql column using php? One person suggested having two tables; one for all the ratings, and one for the average rating of each page. Is there a simpler method than this?
