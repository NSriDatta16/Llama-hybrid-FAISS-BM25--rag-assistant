It used to be simpler when you could have the same webservice method name, and different parameters, years ago. :) Once you write a webservice, you are making a contract with the clients that this is what you will support. For older methods I would suggest logging to see if they are being used, and by whom, to see if you can get them to update. Other than that you best bet is to just write a new method, so you may have several similar function names that differ by a version. The problem with passing in a version number is that you have to ensure the clients always pass in a valid number, which, if you generate the stubs will work, but if you don't then this is very fragile. Putting a version number in the name seems to work best for me, as it makes it obvious what is old, and you can use AOP to more easily log older versions of the webservice methods.
