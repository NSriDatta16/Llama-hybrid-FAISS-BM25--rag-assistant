How to login to CVS with extssh

I'm trying to setup Hudson to pull from a CVS repo, and need a .cvspass file to do that, and to generate .cvspass, I need to first login manually to CVS (AFAIK). CVS server in question only seems to support extssh, and I can't figure out how to login into it. I tried something like this: robert@robert-laptop:~/temp$ cvs -d :extssh:USERNAME:PASSWORD@cvs.server.com:/path/to/project login cvs login: CVSROOT password specification is only valid for cvs login: pserver connection method. cvs [login aborted]: Bad CVSROOT: `:extssh:USERNAME:PASSWORD@cvs.server.com:/path/to/project'. I tried with and without password, and all other permutations I could think of, but nothing helped. Does someone know a proper way to do it? UPDATE: I managed to login and checkout with: robert@robert-laptop:~/temp$ cvs -d :extssh:USERNAME@cvs.server.com:/path/to/repo co PROJECT_NAME but .cvspass was not generated, which was the whole point. :(
