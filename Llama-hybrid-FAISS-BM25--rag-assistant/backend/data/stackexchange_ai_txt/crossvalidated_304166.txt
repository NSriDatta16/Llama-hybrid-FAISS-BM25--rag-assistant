What classifier allows me to classify: object 1, object 2, object 3, none of those 3?

I am working on an "object recognition" project. I have 3 types of objects. I am always able to detect them but unable to correctly classify them using an SVM. Very often, for example, an "unknown" object is misclassified as object 1 with very high certainty. My SVM only contains 3 classes actually: object 1,2 and 3, which correspond to my 3 classes. I don't have any data about the "unknown" object when training. When the object's features don't correspond to any of the 3 objects, it should be classified as "unknown." What classifier would be the most suited for this? Could it be that the incorrect classification happens because object 1 has 4x more training data than object 2? My initial thoughts are to use random forest, but I'm not sure.
