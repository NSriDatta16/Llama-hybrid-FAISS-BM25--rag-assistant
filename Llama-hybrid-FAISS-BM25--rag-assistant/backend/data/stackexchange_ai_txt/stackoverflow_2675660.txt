CGPath curve from points (iPhone)

I'm looking for a way to draw a curve (perhaps a parametric function?) into a CGContext The best example which I can think of is the Adobe Ideas iPad application. As the user drags their finger, the application draws lines for every touchesMoved: using CGContextAddLineToPoint. After the user picks up their finger at touchesEnded:, the application does some math and replaces all of the lines with a single, smoothed curve. What I have is a list of CGPoints, and I am looking to draw a smooth curve which follows those CGPoints into the CGContext. Any assistance?
