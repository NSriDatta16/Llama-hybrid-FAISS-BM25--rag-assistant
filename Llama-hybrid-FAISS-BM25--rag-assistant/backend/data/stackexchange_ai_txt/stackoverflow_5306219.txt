well with that would work quite simple with the assumption that you have one class per file and the class name (in camel-case) matches the file name (in underscore), e.g. MyClass s in the file my_class.rb Dir.glob("extensions/*.rb").each{ |file_path| file_name = File.basename(file_path, ".rb") require file_name class_name = file_name.gsub(/^[a-z0-9]|_[a-z0-9]/){ |a| a.upcase }.gsub(/_/,"") class_name.constantize.new.run } if you need multiple classes per file, then you have to parse the file and search for the word after the class keyword.
