VC++ 2010 exclude library

A project I'm building is attempting to include a library, but for the life of me I can't find out the call to include it is coming from. It's trying to include atlthunk.lib, which is supposed to be included through a #pragma comment in atlbase.h, but there's no such comment in my atlbase.h. I read about someone else who had this problem, but circumvented it by "excluding the lib forcefully". I realise this isn't a stable solution, but could someone tell me how one goes about forcefully excluding a library?
