One idea (and Cradiator does have an issue tracker item for it) is to only showing broken builds . Another idea, is to monitor multiple configuration sets and switch/fade between them at a set interval. Our team has 12 projects to monitor, but to get around the clutter we currently have 1 machine with 2 monitors connected. Each monitor has an instance of Cradiator running on it. Doing this and using the RegEx Project Filter feature in Cradiator we show 5 projects on one monitor and a different 7 on the other. This should keep us going until about 15 projects, when the clutter will start to gang up on us again. Cradiator is open source and the 'skin' concept is relatively isolated, just waiting for you to get your hands dirty in the source code! In fact, I have just moved the source code for Cradiator to GitHub for a more flexible approach to sharing each other's work. Fork away.
