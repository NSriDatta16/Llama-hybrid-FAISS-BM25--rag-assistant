How to add linebreak to decoded json array in php

I need to add some sort of line break after each segment (date, name, address, phone) to separate them, I have tried using the break and paragraph etc but just keep on getting syntax errors with the usual unexpected " Is there an easy way to format the output of this to display each part on a separate line please? date; echo $out->name; echo $out->address; echo $out->phone; ?> This is a sample of the array: { "name":"Joe Bloggs", "date":"11:58pm 28 August 2010", "address":"13 Boggy Ave, Hamilton", "phone":"555-5478" } and what I am currently getting: Joe Bloggs11:58pm 28 August 201013 Boggy Ave, Hamilton555-5478
