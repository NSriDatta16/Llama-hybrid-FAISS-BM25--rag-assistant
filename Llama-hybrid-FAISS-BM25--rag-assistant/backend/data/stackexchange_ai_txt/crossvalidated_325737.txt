You can still use a 4PL analysis since your software will calculate the IC50 or inflection point for you even if it is off curve. The software will iterate solutions for the four parameters in the 4PL function and seach for the best values of the parameters giving you the closest fit to your calibrators. You can determine if the curve matches your values properly if the curve fits your data points or by looking at the sum of squares value, this should be small. You can choose if you average the values of the duplicates or use them separately. My favourite is to average them as this will slightly reduce the effect of outliers on the curve-fitting.
