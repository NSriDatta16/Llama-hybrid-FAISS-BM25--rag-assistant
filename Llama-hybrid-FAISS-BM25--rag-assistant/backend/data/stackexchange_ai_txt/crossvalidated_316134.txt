Features and Variables in Data Analysis

I am pretty new to machine learning and data analysis in general. I have been learning about different algorithms as part of my course. Now, I am stuck with a particular problem. I have been given a dataset which has 52 variables (columns) and 500 observations (rows). The task is to classify the data into normal, overload and faulty operating conditions but there and no labels or classes in my dataset. My question is, are the given variables same as features of my dataset or do I have to do feature extraction and how to add classes to unlabelled datasets?
