Walking : Do an fft on the gravity direction signal. Measure its frequency response for walking at different speeds and then set a simple threshold. Stopping : if the average power i.e. total energy in the signal over the last few seconds drops below a certain threshold then you can say the user has stopped. Turning left,right : Use the gravity vector and the gyroscopes rotation speed vector to determine whether the user is rotating clockwise or counterclockwise Sitting : This will be very hard to determine but if youre lucky the SVM will find the right pattern. Each of the above can be given a weighting and then you will have to find a good way to obtain training data to train your SVM. Maybe stream the signals from the phone to a webserver and simultaneously record the users motions by hand. Your best starting point is Apples Sample code: CoreMotionTeapot Alternatively you could analyze the GPS signal. This will give you a very good way to determine the users larger scale motion like walking/moving or changing heading etc.
