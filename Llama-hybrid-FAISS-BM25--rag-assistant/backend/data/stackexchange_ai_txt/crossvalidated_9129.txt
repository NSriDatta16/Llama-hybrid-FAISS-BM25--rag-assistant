How to compute term frequency and find clusters in a dataset composed of strings?

I am currently looking for some Information Retrieval techniques. I have a SQL database table containing strings. It has 1000 records, each being a random sentence I picked from random web sites. I need to get the term frequency and represent each string into a vector. I also need to cluster the records, e.g. using k-means. Does anyone know what is the best way to do this? Are there any tools I can use? I am new to this and looking for a jump off point.
