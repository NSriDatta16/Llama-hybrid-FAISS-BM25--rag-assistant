Materialized views are based on a source table (or tables), and will update their data immediately when the source table(s) are updated. This is a powerful feature, but based on discussion on the prior posts it does not sound like what you want or need. A simple way to do what you want is to: Create a separate table to contain the aggregated (summarized) data Write a process (preferrably a stored procedure) to calculate and store that data Determine how and when to launch this procedure Does the summarized data need to be prepared at (or "as of") a specific time, such as 12:01am? If so, create a SQL Agent job and configure it to launch the procedure at 12:01am. Can the summarized data only be prepared after a prior routine or two has prepared or finalized the preceding day's data? If so, add a call to the summarizing routine at the end of that process. (How would this be configured this in DB2? How do you determine or configure when an MQT is refreshed?)
