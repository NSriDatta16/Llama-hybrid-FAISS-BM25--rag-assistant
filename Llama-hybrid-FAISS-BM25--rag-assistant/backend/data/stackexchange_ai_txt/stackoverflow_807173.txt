Python equivalent of Perl's while (<>) {...}?

I write a lot of little scripts that process files on a line-by-line basis. In Perl, I use while (<>) { do stuff; } This is handy because it doesn't care where the input comes from (a file or stdin). In Python I use this if len(sys.argv) == 2: # there's a command line argument sys.stdin = file(sys.argv[1]) for line in sys.stdin.readlines(): do stuff which doesn't seem very elegant. Is there a Python idiom that easily handles file/stdin input?
