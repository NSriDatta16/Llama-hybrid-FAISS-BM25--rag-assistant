The first fragment works for some environments but the definition really is required by some compilers and of course if you take the address of your constant. If you don't like to have to touch header and body to introduce the constant, there still is the old enum-trick: class A { public: enum { someconstant=1234 }; }; makes someconstant available as a compile time constant without the need of a definition in the body.
