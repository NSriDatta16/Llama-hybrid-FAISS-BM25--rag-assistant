RNN/ LSTM is designed for series (data has time step) like data(E. g. a sentence ) which has dependency between different parts of the data. In English, some words in a sentence have a dependency on previous words. To carry the dependency information and ignore the non-important information until the end of the sentence RNN/LSTM was introduced. If you use other variants of deep neural network (MLP) in series like data that network the network forget dependency information.
