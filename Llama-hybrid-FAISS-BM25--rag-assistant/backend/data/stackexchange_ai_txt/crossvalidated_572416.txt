Is it possible to pick more than 1 sample point in each iteration of bayesian optimisation?

I want to use Bayesian optimisation for my project and I plan to build a closed-loop system, such that there is a model, robot to conduct experiments, measurement of experimental data which updates the model and continues to iterate until the optimise output is produced. The experiment part involves a liquid handling robot that can produce +50 different components for the experiment in a high throughput manner. I have been reading a lot about Bayesian optimisation and for successive iterations, it only picks 1 point to explore/exploit. I wanted to ask if it is possible to select more than 1 point,such as 20, for successive experiments as I want to utilise the capability of the liquid handling robot as much as possible? Thanks.
