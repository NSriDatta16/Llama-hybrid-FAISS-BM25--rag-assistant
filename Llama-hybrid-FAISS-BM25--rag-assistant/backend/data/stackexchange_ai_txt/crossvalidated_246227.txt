How to get standard deviation when having a weighted average

I need some help. I have the expected number of heads in one coin toss . This is: $$ 0.4 \times 0 + 0.6 \times 1 = 0.6 $$ Now, I need the standard deviation, but I just can't understand how I need to do this. The question is: Give the standard deviation of the variable `number of heads in one coin toss' is approximately equal to 0.4 How do I start? What do I need? Can someone point me in the right direction? Am I assuming it right when I am saying that expected value = expected mean = expected number = weighted average ? Or is this not a fair assumption?
