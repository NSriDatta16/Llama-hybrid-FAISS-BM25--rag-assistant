You need to implement three consecutive mouse event handlers in javascript for this: The mousedown handler should trigger a drag start by enabling the mousemove event handler (see 2) The mousemove handler should map the vertical mouse position to the scrollTop property of the div The mouseup handler should trigger a drag stop by disabling the mousemove event handler Note that I don't think this is good user interface design: you're basically removing the ability to select text inside this div. Besides, the user can scroll using the mouse wheel, so I don't see the need for this.
