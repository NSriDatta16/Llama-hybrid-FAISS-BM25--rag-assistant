Plot of probability of 1-year survival event vs. variable value? Would be derived from a Cox model

I am hoping to plot the probability of a patient surviving to 1 year without progression ( status==0 ) vs. the value of a continuous variable ( radiation.dose ). This would be based on a univariate cox proportional hazards model. I've Googled this and can't find anyone who has done this before. What I imagine is similar axes to this logistic regression plot: Logistic probability vs. variable Here is some sample code for you to work with: library("survival") require("survival") days $days,df$ status) cox.mod Thank you for your help!
