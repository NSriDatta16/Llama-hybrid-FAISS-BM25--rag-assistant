You will often be disappointed in the confidence interval coverage probability in at least one of the two tails when using either the bootstrap or the delta method. This is one area where traditional statistical education, which focuses on frequentist methods, has done us a disservice. Contrast this with Bayesian modeling and using MCMC to generate thousands of samples from the multivariate posterior distribution of all the parameters. Given these samples, one merely transforms the parameters to any desired new parameter, transforming all of the posterior samples into the new metric, then computes things such as highest posterior density uncertainty interval. The delta method assumes that the sampling distribution of the derived parameter is approximately symmetric, which is very often not the case. The Bayesian solution is not only easy to program and doesn't assume that anything is normal (or even symmetric) but provides exact inference on the derived parameter to within simulation error.
