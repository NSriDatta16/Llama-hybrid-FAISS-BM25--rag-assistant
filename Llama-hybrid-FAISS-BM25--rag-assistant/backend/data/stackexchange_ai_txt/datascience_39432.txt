These waveforms are too beautiful for practice. In practice you get much more complicated waveforms and frequency and/or time-frequency analysis can be helpful for your case. If not you may consider more sophisticated features. To start, get familiar with existing terminology, pre-processing and feature extraction methods as music processing has been studied for a long time (you may follow a former professor of mine Meinard MÃ¼ller for deeper insight). I strongly propose to follow confirmed feature extraction methods as effective features for classifying special signals (speech, music, biological signals, etc.) are already out there. I do not think that Neural Networks are necessary here. Of course they are effective methods but in many situations, a simpler classifier (e.g. KNN on reduced number of features) work, however I suggest to follow those literatures as I am not a music analysis expert. I would go like this: Approach 1 Extract frequency/time-frequency features and try dimensionality reduction methods to visualize them and check if classes are well-separated. If so, you simply use a classifier (RandomForest, NaiveBayes, etc.) for classification. If not you may use more complicated time-series analysis. Approach 2 Try state-space reconstruction to extract the nonlinear behavior of your time-series. Via this analysis you can build Recurrence Plots and Recurrence Networks which most probably help your analysis. They offer variety of features .
