JavaEE sometimes hard to define Oh, your question isn't so stupid. It turns out that downloading JavaEE is a slightly tricky thing. If you go over to Sun, you will find this located at http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/ . But that's actually a GlassFish d/l. It's fine, but if you go somewhere else you might end up with JBoss which will have its own container implementations and its own package of modules to load. JavaEE is a big umbrella of technologies, many of them quite clunky and obsolete, and in any case you develop and deploy a very specific collection of things, rather than a program which just loads classes from some bigger version of JavaSE. Or, you might want to start with something even smaller, like Tomcat . You might want to think more in terms of "how should I set up to develop for the xyz application server".
