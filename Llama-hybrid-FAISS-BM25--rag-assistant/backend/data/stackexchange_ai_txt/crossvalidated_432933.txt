What is the relationship between these 2 formulas in the context of naive Bayes classifier?

In "Kevin Patrick Murphy. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective." (p. 83 in the book / p. 114 in the pdf) the author gives this formula to train a naive Bayes classifier: $$p(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i|\theta)=p(y_i|\pi) \prod_j p(x_{ij}|\theta_j) = \prod_c\pi_c^{\mathbb{I}(y_i=c)}\prod_j \prod_c p(x_{ij}|\theta_{jc})^{\mathbb{I}(y_i=c)}$$ while Wikipedia gives the formula $$ p(C_{k}\mid \mathbf {x} )={\frac {p(C_{k})\ p(\mathbf {x} \mid C_{k})}{p(\mathbf {x} )}}\,$$ which is different to equation 3.55. What is the relationship between these 2 formulas?
