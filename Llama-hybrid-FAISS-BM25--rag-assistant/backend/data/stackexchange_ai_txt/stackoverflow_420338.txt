Ask on one of the Mozilla user groups (probably mozilla.dev.tech.xul or mozilla.dev.tech.xpcom ). You could conceivably create the right XPCOM object to access the browser's bookmark manager -- this requires enabling privileges (the user will have to explicitly approve this). Not portable to other browsers (obviously) and perhaps not a great way of doing this. Most websites I've seen that facilitate bookmarking ( Jesse Ruderman's bookmarklet page is a great example) just ask the user to drag the appropriate bookmark to the bookmark folder of their choice, and this seems so much more straightforward/simpler than trying to automatically add something to the bookmarks.
