Design table-like custom interface without UITableView

I want to create an interface with the look and feel of a table. (e.g. somewhat similar to http://stephenmartin.me/iphone-form-field-design-patterns ) My app is going to display a form with labels/textboxes/buttons I do not want to use UITable, but want to do using custom views (labels/textboxes) Could someone provide help or any resources on how I can acheive this. Basically the look and feel of the form should be elegant like a Table view. What fonts are used for UITableView? Upate: Using a UITableView, I am not able to completely customize the look and feel. like adding buttons, textbox, etc That is the reason I am looking for a custom view design.
