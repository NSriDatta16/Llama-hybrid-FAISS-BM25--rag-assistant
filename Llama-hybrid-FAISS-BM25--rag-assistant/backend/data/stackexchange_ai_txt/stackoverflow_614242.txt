What is the best way to get the hash of a QPixmap?

I am developing a graphics application using Qt 4.5 and am putting images in the QPixmapCache, I wanted to optimise this so that if a user inserts an image which is already in the cache it will use that. Right now each image has a unique id which helps optimises itself on paint events. However I realise that if I could calculate a hash of the image I could lookup the cache to see if it already exists and use that (it would help more for duplicate objects of course). My problem is that if its a large QPixmap will a hash calculation of it slow things down or is there a quicker way?
