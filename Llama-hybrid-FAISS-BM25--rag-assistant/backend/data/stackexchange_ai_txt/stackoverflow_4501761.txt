Alright, so I have another MPMoviePlayerController instance which was being deallocated earlier, but when I try to create another instance of MPMoviePlayerController, all the messages sent to this one were being sent to the deallocated instance, resulting in the memory problem. So I just removed the part where I released the first instance, and it works perfectly fine. My question now is this: is there a way to deallocate this first instance so that it isn't a burden on memory when it isn't needed? I feel that there should be a more elegant solution to this problem. I will need to play videos frequently in this application.
