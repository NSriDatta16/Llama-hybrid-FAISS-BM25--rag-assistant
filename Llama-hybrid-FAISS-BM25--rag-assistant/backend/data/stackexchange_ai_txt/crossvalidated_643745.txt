predicting maximum output along with corresponding feature values through ML models

I'm trying to optimize efficiency of a system, I've trained and tested multiple ML models such as polynomial regression, RFR, XGBOOST and MLP. my initial thought was to use bayesian optimization to maximize objective function (I tried using my linear regression model as objective function, idk if it was the right choice, it didn't work tho). now, after some surfing on web, I've come upon genetic algorithm but I don't know if it'll work as well is it possible to find the corresponding feature values which give maximum output form these predictive models? if so, how
