Column-wise matrix normalization in R

I would like to perform column-wise normalization of a matrix in R. Given a matrix m , I want to normalize each column by dividing each element by the sum of the column. One (hackish) way to do this is as follows: m / t(replicate(nrow(m), colSums(m))) Is there a more succinct/elegant/efficient way to achieve the same task?
