The ordinal model that you state is called the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model (POLR), and was popularized by Peter McCullagh (McCullagh 1980). Yes, it is a generalized linear model (GLM), but it is a multivariate rather than a univariate GLM. The EDM in this case is the multivariate multinomial distribution. The vector of cumulative probabilities $P(y_i \le j)$ for the ordinal response can be written as a linear transformation of the mean of the multinomial distribution, and hence the proportional odds logistic model can be written as a multivariate link-linear equation in terms of the multinomial mean. The full GLM framework for the POLR model was written out explicitly in my 1991 paper on EDMs. I've never seen it written out explicitly anywhere else. It is a multivariate GLM for which the mean parameter is a vector and the variance function produces matrix values, equal to the multinomial covariance matrix. References McCullagh, P. (1980).
