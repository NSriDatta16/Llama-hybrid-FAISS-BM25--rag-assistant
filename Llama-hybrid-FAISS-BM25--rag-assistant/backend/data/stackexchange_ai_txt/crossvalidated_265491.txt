There are two books on this topic published by Wiley and another I think that was published by Springer-Verlag. This was the first one published by Wiley in 1972. Amazon lists some others but not the one I was thinking about. I am trying to find the other one published by Wiley which is much more current. Regression Modeling Strategies by Frank Harrell (one of our users) is now in hardcover and paperback. Another one is Order Restricted Inference by Robertson T., Wright F. T. and Dykstra, R. L. published by Wiley in 1988. To answer gammer once and for all, the frequentist would order the populations based on the largest observation in each population, particularly when all the sample sizes are equal.
