You are a life saver!!!!!!!!!!! This worked perfectly. I understand the frustration. If this. If this doesn't work I would recommend deleteing the entire directory and reinstalling eclipse. You should already have JDK installed: This is what I downloaded for 64bit windows:jdk-6u16-windows-x64.exe get one that matches your OS. Should be jdk version 6. I installed this version: Should work for windows x86 and 64bit: eclipse-java-ganymede-SR2-win32.zip Other versions shouldn't work. has to be 3.4 but not 3.5 (gallileo) and it has to be for java. Then I installed the plugin. Then I followed the instructions above and it worked.
