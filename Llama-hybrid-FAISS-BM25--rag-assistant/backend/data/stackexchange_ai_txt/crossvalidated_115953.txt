forecast::tbats() gives missing value error for zeros

I used tbats to find the best fit model to a 3 years of daily data. It could not find a model and showed the following error: Missing values encountered. Using longest contiguous portion of time series . I checked my data and there is no missing data. I only have a lot of "0" in my data. Is this error related to too many "0"s that the data has?
