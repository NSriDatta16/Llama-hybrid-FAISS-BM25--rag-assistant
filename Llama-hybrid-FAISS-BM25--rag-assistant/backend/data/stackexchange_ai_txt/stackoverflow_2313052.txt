You can try the RC release of Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate to generate dependency graphs for .NET code. You can generate a graph of all your assemblies, namespaces, classes, or some combination of these, or you can use Architecture Explorer to select specific artifacts and the relationships that you want to visualize: How to: Generate Graph Documents from Code : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409453%28VS.100%29.aspx#SeeSpecificSource You can use Visual Studio Ultimate to explore the relationships and organization in existing code by generating directed graph documents. These graphs represent code elements and their relationships as a set of nodes that are connected by links, or edges. You can use these graphs to help you visualize, explore, and analyze code. How to: Find Code Using Architecture Explorer : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409431%28VS.100%29.aspx You can select vertical sections or "slices" of code that you want to visualize by using Architecture Explorer. You can explore source code in a Visual Studio solution or compiled managed code in .dll files or .exe files. You can use Architecture Explorer to browse other domains by installing additional providers. When you find the code that you want to visualize, you can generate graphs to explore the relationships in that code.
