Multiple Timeseries Anomaly Detection & Correlation

I've got 3 univariate timeseries T1, T2, T3 individually analysed and anomaly detected. What I'm looking for is a correlated analysis where I should be able to correlate the anomalies across the time series. Is this possible? If yes, any pointers? I was reading about a simple analysis of overlapping points on T1, T2, T3. But this seems to be naive and not reliable as the anomalies may not occur at the same time window. How is this generally solved?
