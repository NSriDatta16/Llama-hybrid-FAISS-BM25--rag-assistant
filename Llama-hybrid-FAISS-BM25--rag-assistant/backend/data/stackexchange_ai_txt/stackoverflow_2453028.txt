Two approaches to programming that aren't just simple text come to mind: Structured Editing (which I know from Kirill Osenkov's blog). LabView . I think Structured Editing is pretty interesting, because it takes the 'braces with idententation' convention, which has proven really useful for keeping code organized, to its logical extreme. I think it could really be something, if someone were to make a brilliant (from a usability perspective) implementation of it. The LabView approach, on the other hand, doesn't excite me so much. The visual idioms don't seem powerful and obvious enough, compared to text. I haven't used LabView much though, so it's probably better than I think.
