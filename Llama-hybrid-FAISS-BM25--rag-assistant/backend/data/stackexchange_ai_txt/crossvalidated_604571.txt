Derivation of ELPD from KL Divergence

I am currently learning about how to estimate the predictive accuracy of (bayesian) models. See here: https://bebi103b.github.io/lessons/18/model_comparison.html#id4 I need help regarding the last step of the derivation. How do we get the sum of integrals from the integral of sums?
