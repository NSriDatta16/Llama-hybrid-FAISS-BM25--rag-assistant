Sounds a lot like meta-analysis to me. Your assumption that the samples are from the same population means you can use fixed-effect meta-analysis (rather than random-effects meta-analysis). The generic inverse-variance method takes a set of independent estimates and their variances as input, so doesn't require the full data and works even if different estimators have been used for different samples. The combined estimate is then a weighted average of the separate estimates, weighting each estimate by the inverse of its variance. The variance of the combined estimate is the inverse of the sum of the weights (the inverses of the variances). You want to work on a scale where the sampling distribution of the estimate is approximately normal, or at least a scale on which the confidence intervals are approximately symmetric, so a log transformed scale is usual for ratio estimates (risk ratios, odds ratios, rate ratios...). In other cases a variance-stabilising transformation would be useful, e.g. a square-root transformation for Poisson data, an arcsin-square-root transformation for binomial data, etc.
