I'm betting that there's not a single client of your app that needs 1.8M rows all at the same time. You should think of a sensible way to chunk the results into smaller pieces and give users the chance to iterate through them. That's what Google does. When you do a search there might be millions of hits, but they return 25 pages at a time with the idea that you'll find what you want in the first page. If it's not a client, and the results are being massaged in some way, I'd recommend letting the database crunch all those rows and simply return the result. It makes no sense to return 1.8M rows just to do a calculation on the middle tier. If neither of those apply, you've got a real problem. Time to rethink it. After reading the later responses it sounds to me like this is more of a reporting solution that ought to be crunched in batch or calculated in real time and stored in tables that are not part of your transactional system. There's no way that bringing 1.8M rows to the middle tier for calculating moving averages can scale. I'd recommend reorienting yourself - start thinking about it as a reporting solution.
