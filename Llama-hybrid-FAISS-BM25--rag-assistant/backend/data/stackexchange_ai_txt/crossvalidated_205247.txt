How to extract a splitting point for numerical values in a random forest model?

I have a dataset including discrete and continuous variables on which I ran a random forest model using the r-package randomForest . I have read several times that the output of a RF model is a "black box". I know that I can actually get the splitting points of the numerical values by tree. However, I would like to know, if I could extract a "representative" splitting point which I could use, in general (not specific to only 1tree).
