asp.net mvc checkbox inconsistency

I'm using an checkbox on an ASP.NET MVC form like so: The AgreeToRules property on the model is a boolean value. During testing, this all worked fine. However, now that we've gone live with this app, I'm seeing a relatively small but significant number of errors with the following messaging: System.Web.HttpUnhandledException: Exception of type 'System.Web.HttpUnhandledException' was thrown. ---> System.InvalidOperationException: The parameter conversion from type 'System.String' to type 'System.Boolean' failed. See the inner exception for more information. ---> System.FormatException: Y is not a valid value for Boolean. ---> System.FormatException: String was not recognized as a valid Boolean. This appears to happen when the view engine tries to render the form after a post, and the value of the checkbox that is returned from the ValueProvider looks like: Y,false OR N,false The html that is rendered in the original form looks like: During testing, I expected (and showed) the posted value to look like: true,false if checked or false if not checked. So where is the N and Y coming from? I added user agent to the list of information returned from the error handler and it appears (so far) that all of the errors are occuring under windows XP with FF 3.0.10, but that's exactly what I have tested with and the problem did not exist during testing. Any thoughts?
