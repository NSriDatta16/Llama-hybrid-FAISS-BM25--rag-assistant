How to better organize the code in C++ projects

I'm currently in the process of trying to organize my code in better way. To do that I used namespaces, grouping classes by components, each having a defined role and a few interfaces (actually Abstract classes). I found it to be pretty good, especially when I had to rewrite an entire component and I did with almost no impact on the others. (I believe it would have been a lot more difficult with a bunch of mixed-up classes and methods) Yet I'm not 100% happy with it. Especially I'd like to do a better separation between interfaces, the public face of the components, and their implementations in behind. I think the 'interface' of the component itself should be clearer, I mean a new comer should understand easily what interfaces he must implement, what interfaces he can use and what's part of the implementation. Soon I'll start a bigger project involving up to 5 devs, and I'd like to be clear in my mind on that point. So what about you? how do you do it? how do you organize your code?
