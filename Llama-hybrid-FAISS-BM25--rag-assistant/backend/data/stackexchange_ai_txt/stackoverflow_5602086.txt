From the OpenGL ES Programming Guide for iOS : If your application cannot use compressed textures, consider using a lower precision pixel format. A texture in RGB565, RGBA5551, or RGBA4444 format uses half the memory of a texture in RGBA8888 format. Use RGBA8888 only when your application needs that level of quality. Above that paragraph, they also really recommend using PVRTC compressed textures, because they save even more memory.
