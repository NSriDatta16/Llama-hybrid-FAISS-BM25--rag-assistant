How do I find the range? Details below

"The average mark in a grade 9 math class is 75.5% with a standard deviation of 9.5%. If Grade 9 math marks have a normal distribution: b) Within what range of marks are 99.7% of all students?" In a normal distribution curve, 99.7 percentile is a z-score of 2.75. How would I find the range of marks in this instance? Would I use the z-score formula?
