Are VB.NET Developers Less Curious? Standardizing on VB.NET

I'm asking this question as someone who works for a company with a 70% to 75% VB.NET developer community. I would say 80% of those developers do not know what an OOD pattern is. I'm wondering if this is the best thing for the health of my company's development efforts? I'm looking at the tag counts on: https://stackoverflow.com/tags There are currently: 12175 .NET questions 18630 C# questions 2067 VB.NET questions Checking Amazon, it seems like there are: 51 C# Wrox books 21 VB.NET Wrox books On CodePlex there are: 979 Projects tagged C# 136 Projects tagged VB.NET There is definitely less materials to learn from if you wanted to be a VB.NET developer. What would be a company's advantage to standardizing on VB.NET and hiring VB.NET developers? How does Microsoft answer this question? Is the only two arguments: We had these VB6 programmers and lets make them comfortable XML Literals If you work for a company that has completely standardized on VB.NET, can you post an answer explaining the pragmatic or technical reasons why they made that choice?
