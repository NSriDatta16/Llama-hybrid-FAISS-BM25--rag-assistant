Grails MongoDB Plugin: Embedded Collections vs References

Originally posted on the Grails mailing list... I'm not generally a database guy but with the release of the latest mongodb plugin for grails, I wanted to see what the big deal is with noSQL databases. MongoDB seems pretty interesting. I was reading the information on Document oriented storage and came across the following scenario: Customer / Order / Order Line Item The doc says orders should be a collection. customers a collection. line-items should be an array of line-items embedded in theorder object. With regards to GORM, how is this pattern ensured? I'd typically have the following: class Customer { static hasMany = [orders: Order] } class Order { static hasMany = [orderItems: OrderItem] static belongsTo = [customer:Customer] } class OrderItem { static belongsTo = [order:Order] } How do I make sure that Orders is its own collection and not embedded within Customer? If that is the default, how to I make sure that OrderItems are embedded in Order and not it's own collection? What is the default here? Thanks.
