Your CakePHP controller needs to look something like this: function jobdetails() { // get the data however you want // $_POST['id'] will have the job_id print json_encode(array( 'jobtitle' => $jobtitle, 'department'=>$dept )); exit; } Then you need to add a callback to your $.post that will actually update the fields: $(document).ready(function() { $('#job_id').change(function() { $.post('/surveys/jobdetails', {id: $(this).attr('id')}, function(json) { // now that we are in the callback, // the variable json is an object // with the values we passed above // so we can update the fields with the new values $('#jobtitle').val(json.jobtitle); $('#department').val(json.department); }); }) .change(); }); I also recommend you get a tool like Firebug so you can see the progress of your AJAX requests and make sure the server is returning what you think its returning. It makes testing and debugging anything related to AJAX way easier. In my opinion this is more elegant than outputting the whole DIV to update, but if you want to go that route you would just use jQuery's .load to achieve what you want.
