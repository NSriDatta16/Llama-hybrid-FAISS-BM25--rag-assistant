However, if you just need something that is SQL only because you unfortunately do not have the relationship with your DBA to add pl/sql functions to your schema you could possibly leverage regular expressions to meet a basic need. Example: select '234', REGEXP_SUBSTR('234','^\d*\.{0,1}\d+$') from dual union all select 'abc', REGEXP_SUBSTR('abc','^\d*\.{0,1}\d+$') from dual union all select '234234abc', REGEXP_SUBSTR('234234abc','^\d*\.{0,1}\d+$') from dual union all select '100.4', REGEXP_SUBSTR('100.4','^\d*\.{0,1}\d+$') from dual union all select '-100.4', REGEXP_SUBSTR('-100.4','^\d*\.{0,1}\d+$') from dual union all select '', REGEXP_SUBSTR('','^\d*\.{0,1}\d+$') from dual Below is the output of the above: INPUT RESULT 234 234 abc - 234234abc - 100.4 100.4 -100.4 -
