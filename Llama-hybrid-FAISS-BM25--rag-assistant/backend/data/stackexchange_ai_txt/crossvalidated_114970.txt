Logistic Regression, SVM or NN?

Just attended Andrew Ng’s online course on ML and although I’ve understood the methods I seem to be missing the intuition on where to apply them in terms of classification problems. What are the pros and cons of each method and in which situation should I chose one over the others? From the course I got the impression that NN is a more complex algorithm and therefore capable of identification more complex, no linear, patterns but might be computationally expensive to train. What is the advantage of SVM over LR?
