You want to compare the distributions, and they are not normally distributed. If log transforming the distributions makes them look roughly normal, you could compare the means of the logged data. Otherwise, comparing medians works. One of these will tell you if the groups are different on average. You could use the common language effect size, which is the % of the time a randomly selected datapoint from group A is larger than a randomly selected datapoint in group B. That one can be quite intuitive. You can also compare the spread of the data. standard deviation is usually the go-to, but again, data is not normally distributed so better to use interquartile range or median absolute deviation (MAD) Additionally, as sessions time out after 5 mins, how about % of the sessions that are 5 mins? It might be useful to know if in segment A 1% of sessions time out, whereas its 5% in segment B.
