How are ASCII characters stored in memory?

Consider a computer that has a byte addressable memory organized in 32 bit words according to the big endian scheme. A program reads ASCII characters entered at a keyboard and stores them in successive byte locations, starting at location 1000. Show the contents of two memory words at locations 1000 and 1004 after the name "johnson" has been entered.
