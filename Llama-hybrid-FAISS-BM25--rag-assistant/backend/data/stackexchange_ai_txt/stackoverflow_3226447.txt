Are there best practices with regards to the organisation of packages in Java and what goes in them? Not really, no. There are lots of ideas, and lots opinions, but real "best practice" is to use your common sense! (Please read No best Practices for a perspective on "best practices" and the people who promote them.) However, there is one principle that probably has broad acceptance. Your package structure should reflect your application's (informal) module structure, and you should aim to minimize (or ideally entirely avoid) any cyclic dependencies between modules. (Cyclic dependencies between classes in a package / module are just fine, but inter-package cycles tend to make it hard understand your application's architecture, and can be a barrier to code reuse. In particular, if you use Maven you will find that cyclic inter-package / inter-module dependencies mean that the whole interconnected mess has to be one Maven artifact.) I should also add that there is one widely accepted best practice for package names. And that is that your package names should start with your organization's domain name in reverse order. If you follow this rule, you reduce the likelihood of problems caused by your (full) class names clashing with other peoples'.
