No query " should " ever be adversely affected by adding a new index. Only write operations(that need to modify the index) should ever be slowed down by the presence of an index) Even an index that has fragmentation should be faster than no index at all. And if you just added the index, it's brand neww (more or less) and should not be fragmented to any appreciable extent. Adding to this that you say that the cost numbers are lower, I suspect that you have something else going on here unrelated to the index. Is it possible that some other transactions might have temporarily placed read locks on some of the data rows needed by the query and blocked it for some substantial period ?
