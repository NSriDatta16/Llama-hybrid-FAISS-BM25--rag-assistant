Jump to a particular page when embedding pdf document in HTML

I am trying to embed pdf file in HTML: According to PDF SDK https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters_v9.pdf#search=&embedded=true&chrome=true it is possible to jump to a particular page while opening pdf document. But it doesn't work at least in Safari with AdobePDFViewer.plugin on MAC OS X. Did I miss something?
