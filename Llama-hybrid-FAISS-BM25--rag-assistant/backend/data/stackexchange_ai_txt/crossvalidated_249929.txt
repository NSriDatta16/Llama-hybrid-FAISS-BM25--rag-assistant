Are the kernel parameters and the regularization parameter correlated in SVM?

Im trying to learn some hyper-parameters for SVM classifier, I want to know if there is any correlation between the kernel parameters and the regularization parameter - C,. because if not i can then try optimizing the C parameter and only when one has being optimized start with the kernel parameter, which will save me alot of runtime.
