You say not to "go on about subjectiveness" but you don't provide your definition of efficient for this. You don't specify how many websites you want to store or how you want to use them or what is important to you - storage size, i/o perf, ability to query in specific ways etc. It doesn't sound like a plist would be a bad fit but I guess my earlier point is just that way you are going to read, write data is generally equally or more important in setting context for questions like this.
