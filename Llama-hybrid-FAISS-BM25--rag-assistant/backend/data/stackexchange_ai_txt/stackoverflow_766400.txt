DDD: Organizing 100s of properties on an Entity

How would you organize an entity that has 100s of properties? One could go as far to say 100s of properties, with a few Value Objects (as a few of the properties have 2 or 3 properties of their own). But the point is, how to handle the large number of properties. I am re-creating our model from the ground-up using DDD, and the current issue is how to organize one of main entities that is broken up into many many many subsets. Currently it was written to have about a dozen sub-sets of properties. Like CarInfo() with 50+ properties, CarRankings() with 80+, CarStats(), CarColor(), etc, etc. Think of it as mass-data stored on a single entity root. Is it appropriate to have a service for the simple purpose of grouping a large collection of properties? Like CarInfoService that would return a Car() object, along with a large collection or sort. Another idea would be to look at how the data is displayed. There is no one view that shows all of this data. Instead, they are split up based on their subjective matter. Like CarInfo shows all information about the car. Another would be CarStats that shows all stats of the car. So in this sense, the Application layer can build the underlying details needed for the UI. But, I still need a way to store it in the domain. I have a mind to just put a number of xml property bags on it and call in the day. lol
