Dunning-Kruger only showed that almost everyone, regardless of actual ability level (with the exception of those with very high ability), believes their own performance is above average. This isn't surprising at all, because people judge their own ability relative to the more typical person - because there are more typical people out there, then exceptionally rare people. DK did not show that low skilled individuals believe they are superior to highly ability individuals, which is a common and convenient misinterpretation of the study. It does suggest the low ability individuals believe they are 'relatively', a lot more able than they actually are. Of course, one important consideration, is measures of 'ability' themselves. For example, in the test of 'logical ability', one should consider, in the light of recent studies on rationality and intuition, that an apparently high capacity for reasoning, on a test with strict time limits, does not translate into the probability of behaving rationally in real time. In other words, it has been established that how well a person performs on a test, does not translate directly into the probability that they will think rationally (and in this case, 'logically') at any given point of time. It has also been established by Chudhursky, 2012, that when time limits are relaxed on tests of fluid reasoning, that performance loses correlation with performance under strict time limits. In other words, some people perform a lot better when time limits are relaxed. All of this means, that artificially creating ability scales based on performance in a very narrow window of time, is a flawed practice.
