Reduce dimensions of a highly dimension data

To give some context to the problem at hand, I have a (900,15000) (columns are way bigger than observations) data frame where the columns are roads on a map and the rows are the average speeds in Km/Hr of those roads at some timestamp The data looks like this | road1| road2| ... | road15000 2017-05-09 17:00:00 | 30.6 | 0.0 | ... | 40.4 2017-05-09 17:15:00 | 25.1 | 26.4 | ... | 50.3 and my objective is to draw them colored according to their total average speed, like this my problem is rendering 15000 lines on a map makes it very unresponsive and takes some time (roughly 4-5 seconds on my machine) so I thought maybe I should use something to reduce my dimensions to be able to visualize only the statistically significant roads out of the whole roads set. At first I thought of using SVD / PCA but it turned out that SVD won't help me much with my problem, as I understood that SVD and PCA do not select from the existing dimensions but they transform the data into new lower dimensions on this StackOverflow question (I asked that question). So my question is if SVD can't help me, what other techniques should I use and why given that my data's columns are way larger than observations? And also just out of curiosity by performing SVD how can I visualize the new dimensions on a map? a heat map maybe? any help will be appreciated, thanks.
