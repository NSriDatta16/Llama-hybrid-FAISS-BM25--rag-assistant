You want answer b) and you want to implement a space-filling-curve or a spatial index. You don't want to store the bits in an array or object or an index but in a string-key. You want to read this string-key from the left to the right and thus you can easy query each depth with any string matching algorithm. You want to google for Nick's spatial index hilbert curve quadtree blog. But you are right with your assumption that answer b) is very expensive so I suggest you answer a) because it's not that slow and also there is already a free implementation of a javascript quadtree available from the closure library: closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/docs/class_goog_structs_QuadTree.html.
