Sharepoint intranet portal

Migrating (rewriting) a whole portal originally made in .net to shareopoint doesn't seem like a very easy thing to do. I've been assigned such task and now i'm just learning, planning and starting to get things practical in order to accomplish it faster. It's not exactly a question, it should be a discussion about it and may help others who might get to do the same job further on. 1 - There's something like a "message board" in the current portal, which i'm planning on building with a blog site kind, what do you sugest? 2 - as asked in another question, i have to manage users, and the local active directory is organized and reliable, so i guess that's what i'm going to use 3 - There's got to be a way to store files, images, documents and having version controlling in some of them. 4 - There's got to be a customization in design and a cleaning in the default controls of sharepoint masterpage (which may be useless for the desired purposes) 5 - About 30 local users and being accessible from the internet (local server) in case our consultors have to access it from clients 6 - i have available a version of the Visual Studio 2010 (already with the graphical webpart designer) because the company i work is MS gold partner. 7 - I'm going to program webparts in c#, and the designing part is still a mistery to me, since i'm not that familiar to shareopint yet. I'd like some tips, links and answers.. i'm going to be watching this question from now on and answering any other information.
