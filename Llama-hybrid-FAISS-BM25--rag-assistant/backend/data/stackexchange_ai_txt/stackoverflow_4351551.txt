Take a gander at the SWF spec from http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf.html Then do a hex dump or open the SWF in an editor that can display hex. The SWF version is one of the first few bytes and is before the compressed data starts. I want to say it is byte 4, but I don't totally recall. The value is the version number. IIRC, the point version is not encoded in the SWF. GNU file may also tell you. I may have edited my rules to do this, though.
