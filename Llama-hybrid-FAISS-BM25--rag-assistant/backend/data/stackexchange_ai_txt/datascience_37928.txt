how to identify the unknown class in machine learning?

In the problem of multi-label classification how to identify the unknown class which is not in training labels or classes. In the prediction phase, the classifier puts the data in any of the class even though it's not related to any of the classes or labels? For binary, the prediction probability of classification is 50/50 so how to interpret these as the confusion or just anomaly but when the data appears in both of the class or the similar to both of the class we can understand this scenario but what about the data which should be in any of the classes. So, how to handle the same situation for multi-class or a general solution which can provide the proper classification for unknown and non-relevant data.
