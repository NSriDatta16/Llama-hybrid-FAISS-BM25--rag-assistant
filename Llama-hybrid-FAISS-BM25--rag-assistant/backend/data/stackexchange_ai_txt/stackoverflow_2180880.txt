I think I can understand what Steve's after. I have a main activity reached via the 1st element in the TabBarController. I'd like the 2nd tab-bar element to selectively add either a modalview email, an access to facebook, or an access to twitter. It would be nice if that choice is offered via an actionsheet so as to not lose sight of what's "behind" from that first view controller (from the first tab-bar choice) and THEN the new view controller handling the choice shows up. This seems to be what "AP mobile" does when you want to 'share' a news article, for example. @Adrian : I couldn't get your solution to work out-of-the-box.. but then found out why (read on...) It doesn't help (obviously) to specifically drag from the Outlet:delegate to file-owner You'll get: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Changing the delegate of a tab bar managed by a tab bar controller is not allowed.' My delegate method was being ignored until I added the UITabBarControllerDelegate to the interface definition (UIApplicationDelegate was already present and I didn't read further)... AND In applicationDidFinishLaunching I added [rootController setDelegate:self]; Cheers.
