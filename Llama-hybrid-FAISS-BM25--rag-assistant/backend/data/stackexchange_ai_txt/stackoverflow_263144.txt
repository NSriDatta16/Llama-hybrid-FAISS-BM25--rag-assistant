Looking at the public members exposed by the ASP.NET Calendar control I do not believe that this information is something that you can just get from the calendar control. You have a few options as "workarounds" to this though, although not nice....but they would work. You could manually calculate the first week values You can handle the "day render" event to handle the binding of the individual days, and record min/max values. Granted neither is elegant, but AFAIK it is the only real option Edit After discussion in the comments, another option is a modified version of my second option above. Basically the first time Day Render is called, get the block of data for the next 42 days, then you can simply search the list for the proper day value to display on future calls to DayRender, avoiding a DB hit for each day. Doing this is another "non-elegant" solution, but it works, and reduces a bit of load on the DB, but introduces some overhead on the application side. It will be important here to define well structured page level properties to hold the items during the binding events, but to ensure that if a month changed, etc that it wasn't loaded incorrectly etc.
