Spring Framework Events

I was reading through Spring Framework documentation and found a section on raising events in Spring using ApplicationContext . After reading a few paragraphs I found that Spring events are raised synchronously. Is there any way to raise asynchronous events? your help is much appreciated. I am looking something similar which would help me to complete my module.
