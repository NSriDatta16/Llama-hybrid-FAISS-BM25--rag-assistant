Take a look at easyXDM , it will allow you to communicate freely between the code your users pastes in, and the code in the iframe. Just check out this example http://consumer.easyxdm.net/current/example/methods.html This library does not need to change the hash fragment in any 'modern' browser (inluding ie6/7) so it will not create history points - for this I recommend using a proper history library.
