Bash script to create symbolic links to shared libraries

I think this question is rather easy for you shell scripting monsters. I am looking for the most elegant and shortest way to create symbolic links to shared libraries for Unix by means of a bash shell script. What I need is starting out with a list of shared library files such as "libmythings.so.1.1, libotherthings.so.5.11", get the symbolic links created such as: libmythings.so -> libmythings.so.1 -> libmythings.so.1.1 libotherthings.so -> libotherthings.so.5 -> libotherthings.so.5.11 The library files are inside a directory which contains other files such as other shell scripts. EDIT : Well, "ldconfig -nN ." could work OK, but I also need the link without the major number of the library appended after ".so", at least one of the libraries, since one or more libraries are the entry points of JNI calls from Java, so when a library is instanced by means of System.loadlibrary("libraryname") it expects a library called "libraryname.so", not "libraryname.so.X". The solution with just ldconfig -nN could work if there were a workaround for the Java part.
