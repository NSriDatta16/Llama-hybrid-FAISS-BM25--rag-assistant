If there is no replacement of balls after drawing, then approaches 1 and 2 are equivalent. With approach 2, you can find the average of the proportions of white balls in each of the 10 samples, or find the total number of white balls in the 10 samples combined and express this as a proportion of 500. Both calculations will give the same result (given that, as is the case here, the samples are all of the same size). If however for approach 2 the balls are replaced after each sample of 50, then the sampling error will be slightly higher than with approach 1. One way to see this is to consider the extreme case in which rather than 100000 there are only 500 balls in the jar. In that case approach 1, which would then be a 100% sample, would be guaranteed to estimate the true proportion correctly. But approach 2 would still be subject to sampling error because each sample of 50 would be only a 10% sample. With a much larger number of balls this effect is still present, albeit greatly diminished.
