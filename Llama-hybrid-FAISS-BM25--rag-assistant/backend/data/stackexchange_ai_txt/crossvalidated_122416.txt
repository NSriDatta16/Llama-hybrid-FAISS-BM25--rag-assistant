As always @Marc Claesen as a great answer. I'd just add that the key concept that seems to be missing is the concept of a cost function . In any model you have an implicit or explicit cost of false negatives to false positives (FN/FP). For the unbalanced data described one is often willing to have a 5:1 or 10:1 ratio. There are many ways of introducing cost functions into models. A traditional method is to impose a probability cut-off on the probabilities produced by a model - this works well for logistic regression. A method used for strict classifiers that do not naturally output probability estimates is to undersample the majority class at a ratio that will induce the cost function you are interested in. Note that if you sample at 50/50 you are inducing an arbitrary cost function. The cost function is different but just as arbitrary as if you sampled at the prevalence rate. You can often predict an appropriate sampling ratio that corresponds to your cost function (it is usually not 50/50), but most practitioners that I've talked to just try a couple of sampling ratios and choose the one closest to their cost function.
