First, this only applies to lossless compression. Lossy compression (like jpg), can theoretically be applied over and over. Of course the quality of the compressed material drops each time. For lossless compression, we can think of compression as a routine that takes some data and transforms it to another form (A->B). Since it is lossless, we must be able to then take B and go A Compression takes advantage of the fact that for certain kinds of data some sequences of data are less common. These less common forms will become larger when compressed. The more common forms that we have chosen our scheme for will then become smaller . On average, the messages are either the same size or larger. Taking it one step further, if we repeatedly recompress the same message it will on average not change size (again, this is the best case).
