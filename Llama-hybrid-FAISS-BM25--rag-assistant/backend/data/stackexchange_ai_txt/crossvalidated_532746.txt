If one only wants to approximate pairwise Euclidean distance between points (which may be useful for downstream computation like t-SNE) but the dimensionality makes computing the pairwise Euclidean distance prohibitively expensive, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma makes random projections more suitable than PCA. For $n$ points in $d$ dimensions projection to $\frac{log(n)}{\epsilon^2}$ preserves the Euclidean distance between points to $1\pm \epsilon$ with high probability. I donâ€™t know of any similar guarantees from PCA.
