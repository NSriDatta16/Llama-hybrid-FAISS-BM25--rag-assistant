Seek a Java advanced tree component (include Windowless Richedit Control function)

I love BooguNote very much (it's a Sharp tool for collecting and organizing information scraps) But what a pity it just run under windows currently. I tried to build a Java version for BooguNote so I can run it under linux (first step: I want to just make a simple BooguViewer ) since I'm not very familiar with so huge Java libraries, so I ask for help who know the suitable Java tree component in this case. My requirement is this: it's not an usual tree component, as you can check from the BooguNote's screenshot as below: http://boogu.me/en.jpg Usual tree is used as an outline, but in BooguNote, tree node was used as a content container at the same time - you can even save a huge text in it! (I heard the author said in the forum before he used "Windowless Richedit Control" technology). Any advices are welcome, Thanks in advance.
