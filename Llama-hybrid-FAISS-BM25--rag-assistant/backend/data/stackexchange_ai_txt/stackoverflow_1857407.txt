How To Integrate Custom Functions Into Joomla!

I recently began looking into Joomla as a platform for developing websites. I've read various articles, tutorials, etc. However, I still have't read anything related to creating dynamic content. For example, suppose I need to create a table for hotels, insert data and then retrieve and display that data, how would I go about doing this? I assume I would need to create my own Joomla Plugin. Is that correct? If not, then how are custom functions, such as database queries integrated? Thank you in advance.
