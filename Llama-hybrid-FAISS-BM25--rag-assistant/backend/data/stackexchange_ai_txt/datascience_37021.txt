Why does adding a dropout layer improve deep/machine learning performance, given that dropout suppresses some neurons from the model?

If removing some neurons results in a better performing model, why not use a simpler neural network with fewer layers and fewer neurons in the first place? Why build a bigger, more complicated model in the beginning and suppress parts of it later?
