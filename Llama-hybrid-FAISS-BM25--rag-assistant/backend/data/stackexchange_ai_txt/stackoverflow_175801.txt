SELECT * FROM movies INNER JOIN (SELECT movie_id, COUNT(*) as num_ratings from ratings GROUP BY movie_id) as movie_counts ON movies.id = movie_counts.movie_id WHERE num_ratings > 3; That will only get you the movies with more than 3 ratings, to actually get the ratings with it will take another join. The advantage of a subquery over HAVING is you can aggregate the ratings at the same time. Such as (SELECT movie_id, COUNT(*), AVG(rating) as average_move_rating ...) Edit: Oops, you can aggregate with the having method to. :)
