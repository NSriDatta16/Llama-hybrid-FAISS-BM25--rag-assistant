Including biased data in training model

My friend is in the business of getting cats to the top of mountains. He currently uses a set of heuristics to decide which cats are most likely to get to the top. For the ones he likes, he feeds, at great expense, in the hope that they will be strong enough to get to the top. For the ones he doesn't like, he thinks it not worth his time / money to feed, and he's happy and surprised if they get to the top anyway. From looking at the data, we know that on average, the ones he doesn't feed get to the top less often. I am training a classifier to help him decide which to feed. Does it make sense to include rows in the training data where he fed them and where he didn't? When I excluded the rows where he did not feed them, the model did worse, which I did not expect. Forgive the example. It's contrived, but I think retains all of the characteristics of the actual situation.
