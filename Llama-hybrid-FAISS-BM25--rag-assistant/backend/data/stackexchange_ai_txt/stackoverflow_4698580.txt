Calculating average speed from columns that have both a distance and a time (NULL issues)

I have two columns in a MySQL database. One is a distance column, and the other is a time column. In some cases one or both of these values is not known, and thus, NULL. I want to create a query that finds the average speed, excluding any null entries. For instance: Distance Time 60 60 120 60 NULL 45 30 NULL NULL NULL The computed average speed should be (60+120)/(60+60) = 1.5 Thanks!
