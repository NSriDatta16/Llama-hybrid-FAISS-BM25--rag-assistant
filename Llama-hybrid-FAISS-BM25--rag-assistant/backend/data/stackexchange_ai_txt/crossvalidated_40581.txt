Does it make sense to average q-values?

I have 3 lists of significant hits (p-value Hit X (List1): pval=0.004, qval=0.0045 Hit X (List2): pval=0.0006, qval=0.0006 Hit X (List3): pval=0.02, qval=0.04 Therefore, to summarize my findings I would add to "Hit X" an average q-val of (0.0045+0.0006+0.04)/3 = 0.0150. Not sure if that makes sense though?
