How to interpret the classification boundary?

I am beginner to neural network and machine learning. I am working neural network with 1 hidden layer. I took spiral data set and I am trying to overfit the data. I applied neural network to it and I am getting a 98% accuracy. But, I am getting the of classification boundary in 2nd figure. I mean why am I getting read color on yellow side and blue color on red side! I should get boundary like the right figure. Is there a reason why I am not getting such boundary even though I am achieving high accuracy. Or can you tell what precautions I should take to avoid such problems.
