Time series as stationary stochastic process

(This is a homework problem.) Check if the following series is covariance stationary: $$ \newcommand{\if}{\text{if }} Z_t = \begin{cases} X_t &\if t\text{ is even}, \\ X_t + a &\if t\text{ is odd} \\ \end{cases} $$ where $a$ is constant and $X_t$ is a covariance stationary series (given $E(X_t)=U$). This is what I tried. If $X_t$ is covariance stationary then on taking the expectation of both sides I got: $$ E(Z_t) = \begin{cases} U &\if t \text{ is even}, \\ U + a &\if t \text{ is odd} \\ \end{cases} $$ And now since $E(Z_t)$ depends on $t \Rightarrow$ it's not covariance stationary (or even stationary in mean). Is my approach right?
