Equations in the news: Translating a multi-level model to a general audience

The New York Times has a long comment on the 'value-added' teacher evaluation system being used to give feedback to New York City educators. The lede is the equation used to calculate the scores - presented without context. The rhetorical strategy appears to be intimidation via math: The full text of the article is available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/education/07winerip.html The author, Michael Winerip, argues that the meaning of the equation is beyond the capacity of anyone other than, um, Matt Damon to understand, much less an average teacher: "The calculation for Ms. Isaacson’s 3.69 predicted score is even more daunting. It is based on 32 variables — including whether a student was “retained in grade before pretest year” and whether a student is “new to city in pretest or post-test year.” Those 32 variables are plugged into a statistical model that looks like one of those equations that in “Good Will Hunting” only Matt Damon was capable of solving. The process appears transparent, but it is clear as mud, even for smart lay people like teachers, principals and — I hesitate to say this — journalists. Ms. Isaacson may have two Ivy League degrees, but she is lost. “I find this impossible to understand,” she said. In plain English, Ms. Isaacson’s best guess about what the department is trying to tell her is: Even though 65 of her 66 students scored proficient on the state test, more of her 3s should have been 4s. But that is only a guess." How would you explain the model to a layperson?
