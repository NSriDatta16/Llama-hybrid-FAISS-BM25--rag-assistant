Is it sensible to use classification to analyse clustering results?

My goal is to analyse how some variables play a part in clustering a group of individuals, i.e. what are the deterministic factors that differentiate one cluster from another. Besides manually analysing the distribution of variables in each cluster, I was thinking about using classification techniques like random forest on the dataset, using the clusters as a pseudo response, which might give some idea of variable importance. However I am not sure if this is a sensible thing to do, and there seem to be no such discussion anywhere.
