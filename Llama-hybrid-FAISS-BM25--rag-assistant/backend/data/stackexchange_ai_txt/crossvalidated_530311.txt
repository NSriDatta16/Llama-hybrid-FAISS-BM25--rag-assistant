I'm not sure I see that this is a regression problem per se, since your target variables are discrete years and not fractions of a year. If that is the case, then I think you have a standard segmentation problem for which Unet is the best architecture. Unet is mostly used with 1 channel (grayscale) and 3-channel (RGB) images, whereas you have 30 channels but it's the same concept. However, if you really do want fractional years for output then it's a regression problem, yet with high spatial resolution required on the output. That I think is not a common CNN application at all, which just makes it all the more interesting. Unet could still be the right network, and how to change it for continuous output might come down to just adding a Dense layer with a number of 'linear' activated outputs equal to the number of input pixels, or it might be non-trivial. Unet is the way to start in my opinion though, as output is required at high resolution. As for missing data for which no prediction is needed, I believe you can turn this into a constraint in a custom loss function, to ignore the loss terms from those pixels. Keras/Tensorflow have a number of standard models built-in. I don't think that includes Unet, but Unet architecture is easy to find and copy from various internet sites or github.
