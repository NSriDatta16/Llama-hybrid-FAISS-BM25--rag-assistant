How do I encourage emacs to follow the compilation buffer

Occasionally when I'm compiling, I have to scroll up my compilation buffer to see the details of an error. At this point, emacs stops "following" my compilation buffer, i.e., scrolling to automatically display new output. I'm using Aqumacs on OS X. Any idea how I can "reattach" or re encourage the compilation buffer to follow again? Regards, Chris
