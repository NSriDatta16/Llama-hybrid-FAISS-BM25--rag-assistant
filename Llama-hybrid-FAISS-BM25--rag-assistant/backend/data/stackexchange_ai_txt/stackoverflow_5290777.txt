Webkit CSS Reset?

I know there's a few CSS Reset tools out there, Eric's and Yahoo's to name 2. However, when I'm using certain tags (I think they're called tags?) such as "li" and "ul", I get some extras in the User Agent Stylesheet. Some of these are: -webkit-margin-before: 1em; -webkit-margin-after: 1em; -webkit-margin-start: 0px; -webkit-margin-end: 0px; -webkit-padding-start: 40px; I'm wondering if there's a reset stylesheet out there that deals -webkit etc? I have searched for one, but with now luck.
