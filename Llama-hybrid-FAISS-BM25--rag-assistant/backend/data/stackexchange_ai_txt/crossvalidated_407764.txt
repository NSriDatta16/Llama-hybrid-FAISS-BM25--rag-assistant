Why is Propensity Score called a distance measure as well?

I had to use Propensity score matching for my study. I used the MatchIt function in R and I studied what it actually does. I understand that the propensity score is calculated using Logistic regression and it is the probability (p) of the treatment ( or log[p/(1 âˆ’ p)] ) which is used to balance the Case and control group, conditional upon the covariates. But I have read papers saying the propensity score is the same as a distance measure.. why is PS a distance? Aren't they slightly different? Shouldn't a distance be just an absolute difference of two propensity scores instead? (one from the Case and one from the Control group?) Also when I ran the MatchIt function and viewed the result after matching, the column (or variable) name for propensity scores was 'distance'... Am I understanding it wrong?
