For machine learning related problems: Ridge: want your weights to be bounded Lasso: want your weights to be bounded and potentially stored easily in a computer Ridge + Lasso = Elastic Net: want your weights to be bounded and potentially stored easily in a computer For any more details in terms of the differences you will have to use math. Of course, some optimization problems have natural $l_1$ or $l_2$ constraints to them, then Lasso or Ridge are a matter of necessity instead of some hand-wavy thing that people do in machine learning, e.g., enforcing sparsity in the solution.
