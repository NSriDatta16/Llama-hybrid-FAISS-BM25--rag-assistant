You could check if position exists by making a code like this: test = function() { if(!!document.getElementById("test").style.position) { alert('true'); } else{ alert('false'); } } Hi Since position exists in all main browser this will always return true. I imagine there isn't a way to check the possible values of position, so you'll have to check which browser and which version the user are viewing your page as Paolo Bergantino said.
