How to customize a link function to perform a logistic regression?

My data was collected using Randomized Response Technique . So I have additional variability into the data. I have a binary response variable. Should I customize a logit link function to incorporate the known probabilities of Randomized Response Technique to perform a logistic regression? I would like to know if this approach is appropriate or how one might correctly perform a regression with these kinds of responses. If a customized link function is appropriate, I should customize the logit $\log \left({p \over 1-p}\right)$ to the customized $\log \left({p-0.25 \over 0.75-p}\right)$. Can anyone help me to do that? I don't have too much experience using R.
