I'm speculating here. Other would know for sure, but maps aren't stored in an array. It's more like a B-tree. That means there is no way to know what record in the map was stored before or after another. Were I to build a map from scratch, I'd surely have no way to accomplish your task. Sorry. Perhaps a map isn't your best option for storage. If you want to retrieve things in the order you've pushed them in, then perhaps a vector.
