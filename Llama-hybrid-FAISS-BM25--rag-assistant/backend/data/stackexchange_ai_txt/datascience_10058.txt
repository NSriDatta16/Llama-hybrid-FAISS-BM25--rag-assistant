Analysis of Real-Time Bidding

I'm totally new to the topic of real-time bidding in which I know Machine Learning algorithms are used pretty often. Can somebody explain me the system in a plain language i.e. a language for a non-technical person? What is the bidding? Who bids on what? Where does Machine Learning get involve? What is cookie matching mainly about?
