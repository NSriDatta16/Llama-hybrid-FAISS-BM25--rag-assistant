Getting first JSON property

Is there a way to get the name of the first property of a JSON object? I'd like to do something like this: var firstProp = jsonObj[0]; edit: I'm getting a JSON object which hold categories of arrays with image URLs. like so: { "category1":["image/url/1.jpg","image/url/2.jpg"], "category2":["image/url/3.jpg","image/url/4.jpg"] } I am then iterating through the object to insert the images, and all I really wanted was an elegant way to see which category was inserted first. At first I just did for (var cat in images) { if (i==0) firstCat = cat; ... } But that some how "felt" ugly... So it was basically just a question of elegance.
