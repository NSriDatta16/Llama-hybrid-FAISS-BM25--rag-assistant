I think its best if you read up on svn. This can be a good start http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.tour.html On the other hand, there is no fixed way to commit comments. It is encouraged to commit changes after a days work with all the changes made to that version of the code. You can include the bugs that remain, bugs fixed and work left to be done. It really depends on you. But the more detail you put in, the easier it becomes when you have to sort through different revisions.
