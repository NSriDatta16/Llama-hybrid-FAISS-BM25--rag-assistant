It depends on what you mean by "combine these two together". Predicting the stock price with a suffiently large dataset sounds like pretty standard application for common time series models like ARIMA (I know in finance GARCH is pretty common as well but I don't know if this is applicable here). So this would be similar to building a regression model for prediction purposes. However also algorithms from supervised learning can be applied to time-series data like random forests or neural networks.
