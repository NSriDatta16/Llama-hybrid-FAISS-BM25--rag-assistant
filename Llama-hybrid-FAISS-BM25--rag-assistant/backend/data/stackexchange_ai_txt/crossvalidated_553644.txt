Yes and no. PCA doesn't replace anything with latent variables you might be thinking of factor analysis (FA). PCA does construct principal components (PC) which are linear combinations of all the variables. If for example you were to find that the first PC explains 90 % of the variability, you could focus on this PC and check which variables mostly contribute to this PC, by checking the loadings/weights/coefficients (which makes sense if your data was normalized). In this case you can find the variables which explain most of the variability... through the PCs.
