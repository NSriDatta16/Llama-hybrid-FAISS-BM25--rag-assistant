how long does session storage on iPhone/iPad last?

If session storage lasts until the browser is exited, and iPhone/iPad does not exit mobile Safari, then how is sessionStorage handled? It would logically seem to be equivalent to localStorage, but it seems like there would have been a workaround or exception for this. Does anyone know how this is handled? Thanks!
