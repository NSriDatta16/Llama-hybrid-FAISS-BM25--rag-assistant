.NET Windows Forms Transparent Control

I want to simulate a 'Web 2.0' Lightbox style UI technique in a Windows Forms application. That is, to draw attention to some foreground control by 'dimming' all other content in the client area of a window. The obvious solution is to create a control that is simply a partially transparent rectangle that can be docked to the client area of a window and brought to the front of the Z-Order. It needs to act like a dirty pain of glass through which the other controls can still be seen (and therefore continue to paint themselves). Is this possible? I've had a good hunt round and tried a few techniques myself but thus far have been unsuccessful. If it is not possible, what would be another way to do it? See: http://www.useit.com/alertbox/application-design.html (under the Lightbox section for a screenshot to illustrate what I mean.)
