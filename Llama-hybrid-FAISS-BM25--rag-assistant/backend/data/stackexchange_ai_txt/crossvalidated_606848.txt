Bayesian neural network is a fake technology. Take any example, which shows distribution of the target and change data into multimodal, just split them into two blocks with the gap between, launch BNN and it returns you same unimodal distribution. BNN only returns correctly expectation and variance. But you can get same result by two deterministic models. Make one model for targets as $t = M_E(x)$ . Introduce variance as feature dependent value ${v = [t - M_E(x)]}^2$ and build second deterministic model for variance as $v = M_v(x)$ . Compare it to BNN result and you'll see that they match.
