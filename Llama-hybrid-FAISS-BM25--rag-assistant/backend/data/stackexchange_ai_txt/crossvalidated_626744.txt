Which hyperparameters should I choose to tune for different ML models?

I'm applying hyperparameter tuning with techniques such as, randomized search and grid search in python. I could find important hyperparameters and tuned them for Random Forest Regressor algorithm, since there are many examples of this specific algorithm and I knew which hyperparameters are important to tune. But for other machine learning algorithms how should I choose important hyperparameters and define the space for them and tune them? I'm confused since each ML model has many hyperparameters and I know that only some of them are dominant and affect the result the most. In general, I'm wondering for different ML models which hyperparameters I should choose and tune.
