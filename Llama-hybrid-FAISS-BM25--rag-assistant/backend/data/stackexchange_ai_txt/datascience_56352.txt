records with perfect correlation to the answer. Drop or Keep?

I have about 1000 records (5 numeric, 5 categorical vars) and about 25 of them have something in 5-level categorical variable that just gives away answer. It's just too obvious and I'm not worried about over-fitting. I'm using methods are xgboost or catboost and wondering if keeping these hurt or improve fitting of other variables. When I just keep it, once in a while it gets 1 out of 25 in test set wrong and I just override that. I'm wondering if it's better to just leave those out and label 1 manually.
