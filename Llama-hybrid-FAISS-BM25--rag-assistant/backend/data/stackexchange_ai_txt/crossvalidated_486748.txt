Hypothesis testing that a sentiment appeared more often

Im new to statistics and have a question that I cant answer. It's also difficult for me to tell if an online guide has the right solution for my question. So any help from you would be great. What I did is following: For ten thousands of text documents, I predicted their sentiments based on a machine learning model. So the prediction is either 'negative', 'neutral' or 'positive'. My model does not always predict the correct sentiment and has an accuracy of about 70% (for all documents, about 70% of sentiments should be predicted correctly). For simplicity, I would ignore this 70% correctness issue and just change the confidence interval from 95% to 99% later, because my solution does not require to be perfect. Probably I also would not understand a complicated statistical solution. Next, I counted how often each sentiment appeared. Results look like this: 15% negative, 14% neutral and 71% positive. I would like to prove now that documents with a 'positive' sentiment appeared statistically significant more often than 'neutral' and 'negative'. Based on my statistical understanding, sentiments are categorical (nominal) values, thus Chi-square testing with goddness of fit. In general, could you please help me or post a link to set up the calculation? Also, is h0: 'All sentiments appeared in equal frequencies' and h1: 'Positive sentiments appeared more frequent than neutral and negative'? Example data would look like this: Document, Predicted Sentiment 'I am so happy today', 'Positive' 'I did not like the food!', 'Negative' Thank you in advance
