Create a threshold for binary classification problem based on distribution of criterion

I created a criterion for my financial data-set for classify data to two classes for other processing (like neural network binary classificatio ). After calculating this criterion (between 0 and 1) the distribution of output is like exponential (but between 0 and 1 - something like beta distribution ). Now i want set a threshold to create two classes from these samples. I can set every threshold ( 70% - (0.7) was good in classification accuracy ) but I want i want a logic for that. for example in normal distribution we can set 68–95–99.7 rule . I want set this default value in my program because different samples are inserting in my system in the feature. Thanks.
