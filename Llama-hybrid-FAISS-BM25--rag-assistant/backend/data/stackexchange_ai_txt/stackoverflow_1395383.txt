Order By typically incurs a sort operation as part of the query. If the number of rows being sorted is small enough to fit in a designated buffer of memory, the overhead is minimal. For larger result sets, in which there are too many rows to perform the sort in memory, the sort will require additional disk I/O to dump the data out to temporary storage and read it back in. A clustering index on your preferred sort key can greatly reduce the frequency and expense of sorts, but you can only choose one clustering index per table.
