As of Maya 2010 the treeView widget appears to still require a string name of a mel procedure to be used for some of its callbacks, but not for others. For example, the dragCallback and dropCallback do work as expected, but the selectCommand and others don't. Many other widgets do accept a python function for their callbacks. Even though the docs list the arguments for some treeView callbacks as strings, it isn't stated that the string must be a mel procedure name, and it is certainly inconsistent.
