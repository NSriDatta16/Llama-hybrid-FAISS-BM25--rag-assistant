What are the main distribution semantics based algorithms?

I am aware that LSI, RRI and word embeddings are distributional semantics models. However, I am not certain if the below mentioned are also distributional semantic models. Non-Negative Tensor Factorisation Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Vector Space Model (VSM) Please let me know if the above mentioned algorithms are also distributional semantics models. Moreover, please also let me know the other distributional semantics based algorithms.
