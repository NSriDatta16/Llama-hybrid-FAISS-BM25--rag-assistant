With API 8 and greater, the location of the SD card has changed. @fiXedd's answer is good, but for safer code, you should use Environment.getExternalStorageState() to check if the media is available. Then you can use getExternalFilesDir() to navigate to the directory you want (assuming you're using API 8 or greater). You can read more in the SDK documentation .
