The other answers are correct to note that this is for convenience when derivatives are taken. However, that convenience is justified by the fact that positive scalar multiples of functions (along with other strictly increasing transformations) have the same critical points (same maxima, same minima, same saddles), just achieving different values. It is those critical points that are of concern in the optimization being discussed, rather the function values of those critical points, as the minima or maxima (depends on if loss is minimized or "gain" is maximized) are the parameter estimates. I once addressed this on the Data Science Stack.
