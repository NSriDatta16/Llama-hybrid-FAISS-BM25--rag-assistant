Accuracy vs Precision: Can I use the Sphercity Assumption data in a meaningful way?

I understand that when conducting a repeated measures design with say one factor having three levels (Training: None, Standard, New Method), in the analysis you want the sphercity assumption to not be violated, i.e. that the variability of responses of one participant are consistent throughout the different repeated conditions. But, isn't just applying a correction if this assumption is not met ignoring potentially useful information? This is my hypothetical: say that the training I am running has an effect. In Standard training everyone has 10points higher than in the None, but when they are given the New Method, some get extremely better, 50points, while some only 15points. If I just look at the means, i see that None gives a performance on average of 100, Standard training of 110, and New Method of 130. If Sphericity is violated, then I just correct the DF and report that. However, isn't the fact that the New Method, while showing better scores overall, is also wildely less precise (or unpredictable) in performance boost important? TL;DR, if a manipulation has a significant effect, but the variability of this effect is much higher than that of previous manipulations, can I still somehow report that information in a meaningful way?
