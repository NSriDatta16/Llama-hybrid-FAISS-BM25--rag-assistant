Can I fine tune GPT-3?

Can anyone fine-tune the GPT-3 model on commodity hardware without GPU? What I meant is can we fine tune available GPT-3 equivalent models? For example, we have only access to GPT-J. Can we fine-tune GPT-J with commodity hardware or lets say with only basic GPU such as 1with one RTX 3080. Can we fine-tune these models (not training from scratch)? Or will it need high-end infrastructure with GPUs?
