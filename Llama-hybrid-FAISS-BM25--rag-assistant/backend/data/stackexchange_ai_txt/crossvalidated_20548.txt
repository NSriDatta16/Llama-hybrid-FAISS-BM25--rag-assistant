You could try Runs test for randomness. I am not familiar with Java functions. I got a link related to runs test that may useful to you. JAVA NPST . Apart from this you could do durbin-watson test or Ljung-Box portmanteau test. Most important is the visual check of time series plot ( I guess you have done this already).
