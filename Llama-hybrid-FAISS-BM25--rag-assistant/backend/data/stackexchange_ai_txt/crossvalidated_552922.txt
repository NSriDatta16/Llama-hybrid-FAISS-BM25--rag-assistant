What is a "permutation" in PERMANOVA?

I'm using PERMANOVA to calculate significant differences between groups in my beta-diversity analysis for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, while I understand the results, I don't understand what the statistical analysis does. I'm using the adonis function on the vegan package as follows: library(vegan) bray F) sample_data(physeq_shime3)$Treatment 1 0.05315 0.053155 1.2739 0.04352 0.2507 Residuals 28 1.16834 0.041727 0.95648 Total 29 1.22150 1.00000 My understanding, as far as beta-diversity analysis goes, is that the distances are calculated from the centroid of each group to the group's data points. What then? And how do permutations come into play? I've seen similar posts on this forum and others, but they don't quite answer what is being "permuted". Thanks in advance.
