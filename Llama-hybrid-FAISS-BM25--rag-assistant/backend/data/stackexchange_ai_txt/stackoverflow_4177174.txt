You can check the User-Agent string. In JavaScript, that's really easy, it's just a property of the navigator object. var useragent = navigator.userAgent; You can check if the device if iPhone or Blackberry in JS with something like var isIphone = !!agent.match(/iPhone/i), isBlackberry = !!agent.match(/blackberry/i); if isIphone is true you are accessing the site from an Iphone, if isBlackBerry you are accessing the site from a Blackberry. You can use "UserAgent Switcher" plugin for firefox to test that. If you are also interested, it may be worth it checking out my script "redirection_mobile.js" hosted on github here https://github.com/sebarmeli/JS-Redirection-Mobile-Site and you can read more details in one of my article here: http://blog.sebarmeli.com/2010/11/02/how-to-redirect-your-site-to-a-mobile-version-through-javascript/
