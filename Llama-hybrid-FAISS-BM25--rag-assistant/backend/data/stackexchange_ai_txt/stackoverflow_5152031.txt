If you working with a viewmodel, it's not that hard. Bind you comboboxes itemssources to properties on your viewmodel. Bind the first combobox's selecteditem to a property on your viewmodel. In the setter of that property, change the collection of the second combobox. With viewmodels, this is the easiest method. Although creating datagrid columns in you view is not, you could move that to a helper class and call it from the code behind or subclass te datagrid. With runtime columns it's hard, I know. Update: What I normally do is to use normal columns when showing data, and comboboxes on the row which is selected. That way you won't have that problem You'll have to synchronise the selecteditemproperty when the selecteditem of the datagrid changes. That will also trigger the update of the itemssource of the second combobox Another option is to make to collections of the combobox subitems in your main collection and pre-populate them. And change the collection of combobox 2 on changes of the selected item in combobox 1. But that could be potentionally be a lot work and storage.
