You would have to use AJAX to populate the drop down list, which you can do using a web service. Another problem with this is that if you use the standard ASP.NET DropDownList control, and modify the list on the client, you may get an error because the dropdownlist expects the list provided to it from the previous load. Alternatively, when the user closes page 2, it could call a method on page 1 that calls __doPostBack to force a page postback in page 1, so you could use server code to populate page 1. A separate page is going to add to the challenges, it would be a lot easier to leverage teh AJAX popup IMHO. HTH.
