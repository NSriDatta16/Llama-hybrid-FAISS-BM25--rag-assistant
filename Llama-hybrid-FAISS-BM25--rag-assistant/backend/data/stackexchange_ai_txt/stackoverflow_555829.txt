Well if your tests don't test the thing which happens in the code covered. If you have this method which adds a number to properties for example: public void AddTo(int i) { NumberA += i; NumberB -= i; } If your test only checks the NumberA property, but not NumberB, then you will have 100% coverage, the test passes, but NumberB will still contain an error. Conclusion: a unit test with 100% will not guarantee that the code is bug-free.
