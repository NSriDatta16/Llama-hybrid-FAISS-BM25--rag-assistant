Magento Large Database Backup/Restore Failed

I have a large database (about 244 MB+) and now I want to transfer it to other location from production to development server for fixing the bugs, upgrading and also backup. The hosting provider is Siteground.com When I try to make a backup of magento database using magento backend Backup utility, phpMyAdmin or from Navicat for MySQL, unfortunately it fails each time showing no error. I need Magento community help. What should I do to accomplish the backup successfully. Any help would be greatly appreciated! ~Shaman
