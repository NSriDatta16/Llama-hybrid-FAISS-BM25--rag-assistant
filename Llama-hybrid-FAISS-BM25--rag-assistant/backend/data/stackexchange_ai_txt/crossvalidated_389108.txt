Repeating CV multiple times

I understood the purpose behind CV (i.e. just to make sure the data is spread well across the folds, and the skewness is somewhat averaged-out). Let's take this example - cv_cart_Scores=[] for k in myList: cart = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 777, min_samples_leaf=k) cart_scores = model_selection.cross_val_score(cart, x_train, y_train, cv=10, scoring='accuracy') cv_cart_scores.append(cart_scores.mean()) Here, cv_scores stores the accuracy score of each fold in the CV. And later we mean it in next line. I'm not getting: What is the purpose of cv_cart_scores . What is the purpose of looping it myList number of times? Shall we take cv_cart_scores.mean() at last to get the final score of the model? RB (on Python 3.6)
