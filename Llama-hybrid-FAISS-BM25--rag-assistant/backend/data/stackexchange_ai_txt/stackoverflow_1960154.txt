Since you're tinkering on your project, tinker with organization and methodologies as well. Try a few version control systems until one feels right. Try a few issue tracking systems. Run with no formal project management for a while and then try something rigid. Do everything by hand and then try to automate everything you can - code generation, builds, and testing. Find out what works best for you by trying everything. Experiment.
