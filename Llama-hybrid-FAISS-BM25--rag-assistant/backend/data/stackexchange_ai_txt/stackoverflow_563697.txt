Storing word documents

I'm working on job site (using asp.net 3.5) in which a user can upload one or more resumes. Database is sql server 2005. Whats the recommendation regarding storage of these documents? Shall i store it as a blob in the database or just store the path in database and keep the document in the physical folder? Can someone please mention the pros and cons of each wrt performance and scalability? Thanks!
