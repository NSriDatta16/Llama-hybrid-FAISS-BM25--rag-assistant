Problem inserting a user variable in connection expression

I am trying to import 110 excel files into a sql server database in SSIS2008. I am at the the point where I have dragged in my foreach loop container, pointed to the correct folder. I have made a string variable (with foreach loop scope) and set the default value to a file in the source folder of excel files. When I try to build a connection string expression and try to find the user variable it is not in the list. The only variables in the list are system variables. Does anyone have any idea where I might be going wrong. I feel that I have set the correct scope by defining the string variable from the foreach loop. (The User::FilePath variable that I made is not visible in the package explorer either.) Thanks.
