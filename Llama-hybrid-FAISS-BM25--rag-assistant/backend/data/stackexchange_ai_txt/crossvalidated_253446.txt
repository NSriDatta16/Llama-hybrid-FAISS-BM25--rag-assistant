First of all, you should to be sure that you have multicollinearity. Check correlations between variables and use the VIF factor. Then, if you want to solve multicollinearity reducing number of variables with a transformation, you could use a multidimensional scaling using some distance that remove redundancies. PCA is useful when you have continuous variables, but I'm not sure that was good when your data is binary, so maybe you need to use MDS with binary ED or CorEx.
