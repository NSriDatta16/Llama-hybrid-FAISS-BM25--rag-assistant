Using jQuery to edit individual table cells

How can I use jQuery to click on a table cell and edit its contents. There is a particular column which contains several paragraphs of data, so if possible, have a pop up window with a large text area (or ideally an HTML editor). The changes need only be superficial as I am using another jQuery plugin to scrape the table contents and export it to something else. Difficulty, none of the cells can have unique names or id's.
