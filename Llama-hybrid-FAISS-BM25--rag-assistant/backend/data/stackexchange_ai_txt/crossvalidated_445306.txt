In the two-stage approach, in the first step, you summarize the repeated measurements per peptide_Id into a single number. This inevitably leads to some information loss. To give another example, say that you measure the blood pressure of a patient ten times. Even though these measurements are correlated, they contain more information than their average. The only case in which they would contain the same amount of information as the average is when they are perfectly correlated. That is if the ten measurements are exactly the same. In the mixed model, you are using all the data into one model, and therefore you have more information leading to smaller standard errors. More specifically, regarding your other questions, For the reason mentioned above but also for other reasons (e.g., if you have missing data), the mixed model approach is better than the two-stage approach. The difference in the degrees of freedom is because again different pieces of information/data are used in the two approaches. Moreover, the issue of calculating the denominator degrees of freedom in mixed models is a complex one . What would be a better model will depend on your aims, but in any case, you should look for a model that describes the correlations in the repeated measurements of each peptide_Id sufficiently well.
