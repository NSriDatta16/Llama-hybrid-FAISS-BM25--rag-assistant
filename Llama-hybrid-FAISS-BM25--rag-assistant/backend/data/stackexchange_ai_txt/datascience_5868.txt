Data Science is, as others have noted, a much broader term than machine learning. Applying Machine learning techniques is one aspect of data science. Data Science, more generally, is the science of deriving knowledge from data. The term was coined back in 1960 and kept evolving to describe the flow and interplay of problem definition, data collection, data transformation, data modeling/ analysis, and decision making. So to answer your question specifically: Machine learning aids data science by providing a suit of algorithms for data modeling/ analysis (through training of machine learning algorithms), decision making (through streaming, online learning, real-time testing that are all topics that come under machine learning), and even data preparation (machine learning algorithms automatically detect anomalies in the data). Data Science stitches together a bunch of ideas/ algorithms drawn from machine learning to create a solution and in doing so borrows a lot of ideas from traditional statistics, domain expertise and basic mathematics. In this way, data science is the process of solving a use case, providing a solution as opposed to machine learning that is an important cog in that solution.
