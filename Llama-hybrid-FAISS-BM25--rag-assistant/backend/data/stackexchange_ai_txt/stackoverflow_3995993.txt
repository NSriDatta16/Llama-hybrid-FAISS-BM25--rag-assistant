Creating a configurable Magento attribute from scratch

I need to extend Magento to allow changing the price of a product based on an attribute, such as size or color. I can't use any in-built facilities Magento might have for this - I need to write the code myself. I'm a beginning Magento developer. Can anybody help? Maybe point me to a guide or walk-through for this on the internet? Thanks!
