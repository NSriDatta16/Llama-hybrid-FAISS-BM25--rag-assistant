In response to this question: can I modify the code (such as the value in a variable or if my stepthrough line is about to hit an if statement ... can I modify the if statement....etc)? You cannot pop a new value into a variable directly, but what you can do is this: Set a breakpoint When that breakpoint is hit, click on the arrow in the left margin and drag it up to a previous line Now you can add code to change the circumstances (for example, you can set a variable to a new value, add/remove items from a collection, etc.) See the other answers about enabling Edit & Continue -- in particular, make sure you're in Debug mode.
