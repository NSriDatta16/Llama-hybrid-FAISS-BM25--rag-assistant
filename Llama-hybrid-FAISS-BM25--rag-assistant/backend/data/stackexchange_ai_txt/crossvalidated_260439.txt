Correct way to average data or to compare in another way

I have data which is of similar type (though about a different subject) to that below and I would like to calculate averages per day so that I can compare between the different types of food. I would like to calculate the average weight of food eaten per day for different types of food. I have calculated mean, standard deviation etc. of (food eaten/animal)/day as in the example shown below. I also have the raw data, but I don't think I should just pool all the data together and take the average over all the days, as that would give more weight to results from certain days than others (whereas weather or other daily conditions changed from day to day and are likely to have had an effect). I have seen on the internet and it makes sense to me logically as well, that it's probably not correct just to average the average, but I'm not sure how to go about comparing the different foods? Food eaten APPLES 10/12/2013: Mean = 1.8kg, s.d.= 0.5kg N=20 11/12/2013: Mean = 2.2kg, s.d. = 0.3kg N=6 12/12/2013: Mean = 3.1kg, s.d. = 0.4kg N=12 BANANAS 10/09/2013: Mean = 2.3kg, s.d.= 0.5kg N=10 11/09/2013: Mean = 2.2kg, s.d. = 0.3kg N=4 12/09/2013: Mean = 1.1kg, s.d. = 0.5kg N=10 CAKE 20/01/2014: Mean = 1.0kg, s.d.= 0.2kg N=8 21/01/2014: Mean = 2.0kg, s.d. = 0.3kg N=8 22/01/2014: Mean = 2.0kg, s.d. = 0.3kg N=4 etc. I want to compare the amount of cake eaten with apples and bananas and several other foods. I know there are a lot of other factors to consider here if I was really comparing food eaten. Actually my data is about something different I just don't want to put it on the website as it's owned by my company. Thanks!
