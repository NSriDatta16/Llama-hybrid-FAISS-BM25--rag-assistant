Stabilize pose estimation keypoints

I'm currently facing a problem of stabilizing the generated key points from the HRNet as in this repository . I created my personalized dataset where the key points mark the extreme locations of an airplane: nose, tail and wings. The problem is that the dataset marks the actual furthest positions and the prediction is always shifted a couple of pixels to the side. Question : Is there any algorithm that will stabilize the prediction so they don't shake too much between predictions? Objects move and I am trying to track their joints and make the movement smoother. Two options come to my mind: averaging predictions across iterations, Kalman filter. Any ideas how to improve the process?
