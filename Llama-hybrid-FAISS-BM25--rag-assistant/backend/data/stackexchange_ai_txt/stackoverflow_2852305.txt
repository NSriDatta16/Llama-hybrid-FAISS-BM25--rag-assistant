If you have to, always use underscores _ . Using a dot . would not even work, otherwise from scons.config import whatever would break. But PEP 8 clearly describes it: Package and Module Names Modules should have short, all-lowercase names . Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability . Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged . UPDATE: To directly target your question: I think sconsconfig is fine. It is not too long and quite readable. But honestly, I don't think anyone will blame you if you use underscores and your code will run with either decision. There is always a certain level where you should not care that much anymore.
