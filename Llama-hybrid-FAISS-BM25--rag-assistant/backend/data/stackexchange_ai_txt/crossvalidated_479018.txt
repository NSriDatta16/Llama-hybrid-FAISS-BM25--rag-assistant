Sampling from finite populations The sampling theory for finite populations is usually applied to objects of a non-random, determined nature, for example all adults aged 18 or older living in a country at a given date. All is based on the probability $\pi_i$ that element $i$ , $i=1,\dots,N$ , is selected for the sample, and the probability $\pi_{ij}$ that elements $i$ and $j$ are jointly included in the sample. There are statistics and sampling distributions, but not i.i.d. samples because the reciprocal of the selection probability, $w_i=\pi_i^{-1}$ , is a random variable, but $y_i$ , the individual values of a variable of interest are considered fixed (see here .) In other words, in sampling from finite populations a random sample is not a set of i.i.d. random variables, the meaning of "random" and "randomization" is not the same as in sampling from infinite populations, what is (or is not) random is elements selection. Sampling from infinite populations The sampling theory for infinite populations was originally applied to the measurement of astronomical and geodesical quantities, which involved continuously-distributed random errors. The measurements formed a sample from an infinite set of possible results, and the observational errors were subject to a probability distribution (triangular according to Simpson, double exponential according to Laplace, then gaussian). The results of the observations were treated as experimentally found values of the random variables subject to this distribution; this is how satistical inference was born (see Stigler, The History of Statistics , and here .) In sampling from infinite populations (i.e. from random variables) a sample is a set of random variables, your observations are realizations of those random variables. You need their joint distribution, which is easily handled if you may assume independence and identical distribution. This is why, in sampling from random variables, you try to select observations that can be viewed as realizations of i.i.d. random variables (so called "randomization"). In cross-sectional data, data collected by observing many subjects at the one point or period of time, this might be hard, but is often feasible. However, assuming i.i.d. in time-series data would be nice, but may be impossible, because a time series of a random variable has often serial dependence.
