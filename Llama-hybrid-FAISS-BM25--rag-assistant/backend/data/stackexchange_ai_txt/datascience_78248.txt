Does training of neural networks follow the same order in each epoch?

Each epoch uses the weight from the end of the previous epoch(correct me if I am wrong). Is the updating of parameters after each batch always in the same order? To rephrase, are the batches always in the same order? Could this bias the learning and are there any adaptations that deal with this.
