I think You should have only one @font-face declaration with many sources for one font-family. It looks IE doesn't like your declaration. The code from mentioned article ( http://randsco.com/index.php/2009/07/04/cross_browser_font_embedding ): @font-face { font-family: " your FontName "; src: url( /location/of/font/FontFileName.eot ); /* IE */ src: local(" real FontName "), url( /location/of/font/FontFileName.ttf ) format("truetype"); /* non-IE */ } /* THEN use like you would any other font */ .yourFontName { font-family:" your FontName ", verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; } The first source should be for EOT file. The second source should be for TTF file and start with local font name. It is some kind of hack. The second source attribute looks invalid for IE so this browser use the first. For other browsers both are valid, however only the last is used. For converting TTF files to EOT I used this small programme: http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/ The method should be supported by following browsers: Firefox 3.6 + Internet Explorer 4 + Opera 10.00 + Chrome 4.0 + Safari 3.1 + I have done some test and it have been working for me. The Chrome 2 is probably too old.
