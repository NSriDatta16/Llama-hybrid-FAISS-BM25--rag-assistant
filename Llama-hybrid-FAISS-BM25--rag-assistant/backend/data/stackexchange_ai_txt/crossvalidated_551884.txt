Categorical or Continuous

I am trying to do machine learning using CART and linear/logistic regression using R, however, I faced a problem. The variable I am predicting is insurance premium, and in my dataset, I have 988 rows. I did a: length(unique(CBA$Premium)) and found that it only returns 24 unique values. Should I treat this variable as categorical or leave it as continuous?
