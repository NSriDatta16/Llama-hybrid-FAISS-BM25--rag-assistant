Change cursor type when the mouse gets over some selected text using HTML/Javascript

I need to change cursor type when the mouse gets over a selected text. Here you can find an explanatory image : Image to explain the type of cursor I want http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/1786/72162829.png In this example the user has to drag some text to the textarea. Since the traditional pointer is not intuitive I would like to use the "move" pointer (cursor:pointer). I made this image with photoshop. Does anyone know how to make it for real in HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT ?
