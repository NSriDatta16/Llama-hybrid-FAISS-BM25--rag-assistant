Using autocorrelation to measure a Markov chain's mixing time

This paper has a footnote that says The sum of the auto-correlation coefficients from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ is an estimate of the mixing time. What is the rationale for this? The author calls this the "effective correlation length" in another paper , but I haven't gotten much success in finding an explanation for this.
