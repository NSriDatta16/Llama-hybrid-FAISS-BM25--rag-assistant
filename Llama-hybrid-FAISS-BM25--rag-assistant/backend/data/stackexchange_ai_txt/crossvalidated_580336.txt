Test for seasonality with LR-test?

I have an economic time series in monthly frequency. I want to test for seasonality using LR-Test. So the idea is to: Regress the time series y on a model with a time trend and 12 seasonal dummy Estimate a restricted form of this model by restricting all seasonal dummies = 0 Comparing the two models (restricted and unrestricted) with a Likelihood-Ratio Test (lrtest() in R) Are there any objections doing this?
