How to find variance of multivariable expression

I have an expression of this form $W_i = a * X_i * (1 - Y_i * (1 - Z_i))$ , where $a$ is a constant, $X_i \sim Bernoulli({p_x}_i)$ , $Y_i \sim Bernoulli({p_y}_i)$ , and $Z_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma)$ Background : So, I have three models for X, Y and Z, and these are models for probability of survival, probability of death, and a model for some distance measure, respectively. So X and Y are logistic regression models, and Z is a normal regression model. I have a dataset, and I predict the expected values for the three models, and then I calculate W . But I know that this expected W has a high degree of uncertainty attached to it, because the underlying drivers are highly uncertain. I wish to get a distribution of W for all datapoints, so I can measure the uncertainty. Attempt : I have 100k rows of data, so $i = {1,2,3,...,100000}$ , where I have predicted values in each row for ${p_x}_i$ , ${p_y}_i$ and $\mu_i$ , and $\sigma$ is constant/equal for all rows. I want to find the variance of the expression for W above for each row, and I've tried Monte Carlo sampling, and then bootstrapping to find the variance, but it is just very slow. Is there a faster way to do this, or do I need to calculate $Var(W_i)$ "by hand"? Code : # data set.seed(1234) n $t0, lowerCI = x1$ percent[4], upperCI = x1$percent[5]) }))
