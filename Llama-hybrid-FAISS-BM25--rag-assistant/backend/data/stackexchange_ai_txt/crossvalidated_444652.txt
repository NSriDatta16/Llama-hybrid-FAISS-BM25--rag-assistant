Welcome to Cross-Validated. :) Sample mean is $\mu = \frac{\sum_i^n x_if_i}{\sum_i^n f_i}$ , and sample variance is $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_i^n (x_i-\mu)^2f_i}{\sum_i^n f_i}$ , where $f_i$ is the sample frequency of the $i^{th}$ interval, and $x_i = \frac{x^{upper}_i+x^{lower}_i}{2}$ is the average of the upper and the lower limits of the $i^{th}$ interval. You can apply the same formula even if the class intervals are unequal/uneven.

You can try for sample variance also. Sample standard deviation is square root of sample variance.
