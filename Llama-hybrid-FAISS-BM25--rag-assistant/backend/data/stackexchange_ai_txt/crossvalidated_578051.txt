Suppose people are selected independently with probability $p$ . The number of people $M$ selected in a family of four has a $M\sim Binomial(4,p)$ distribution, and you want $P(M>1)/P(M>0)=1/2$ In code curve(pbinom(1,4,x,lower.tail=FALSE)/pbinom(0,4,x,lower.tail=FALSE), ylim=c(0,1),ylab="P(another selected in family)", xlab="proportion selected") abline(h=1/2,lty=2,col="purple") If 1/3 of the people are selected, your probability is just over 1/2. I might suspect there's a more elegant reason why it's 1/3, except that it isn't exactly 1/3. Numerical optimisation gives 0.32809
