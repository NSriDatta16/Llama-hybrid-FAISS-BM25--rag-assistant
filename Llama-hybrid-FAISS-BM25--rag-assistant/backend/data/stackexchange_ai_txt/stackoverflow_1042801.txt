Help with Infragistics ultragrid cells - manipulate text property?

I'm having trouble with an infragistics ultragrid using vb.net. I currently have a cell with the value "inner", however I want to be able to display a completely different string for that cell without losing the value. I understand that the cell has two properties, one value property and one text property. The text property is read-only so I cannot simply assign a new string to that. Any suggestions would be fantastic! Thank you very much, Adem
