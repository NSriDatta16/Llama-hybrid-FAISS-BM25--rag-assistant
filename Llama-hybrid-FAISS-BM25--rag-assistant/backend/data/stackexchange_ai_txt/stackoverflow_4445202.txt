Well first off it's Vertex , not Vertice . Secondly, you have (approximately) implemented an adjacency list as the data structure for your graph; it would be more standard to use an adjacency matrix . Do you know what depth-first search is? Roughly, you start at a vertex and pick a neighbour, then pick a neighbour of that, and so on until you run out of neighbours to pick. Then you backtrack and pick the next neighbour, and so on. It is elegantly implemented recursively (have you come across that before?), because the problem can easily be separated into smaller pieces: to search a graph depth-first you simply start from any vertex and then depth-first search from all its neighbours in turn. Concretely, you need to break the problem into smaller problems: suppose you can find the nodes reachable from b and c . What can you reach from a ? Well, b , everything reachable from b , c , and everything reachable from c .
