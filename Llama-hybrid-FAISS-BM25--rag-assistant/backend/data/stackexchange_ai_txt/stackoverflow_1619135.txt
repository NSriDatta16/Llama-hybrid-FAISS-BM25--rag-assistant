I have some experience with warehouse management systems. Much of it is not very sophisticated in a CS point of view, but there are some juicy optimization problems where CS can be applied. For example, to reduce the time spent to "pick" an order (go through the warehouse and collect the goods for an order), it's desireable to find the shortest way to go to all those places in the warehouse, which boils down to the "traveling salesman problem". Another place where CS is applied is inventory taking; there are some very clever software products (e.g. INVENT Xpert) that allow a random sample inventory taking to reach the accuracy required by law; this means that instead of going to all storage locations and count the quantity stored there, only a small percentage (5-10%) of the locations are actually counted.
