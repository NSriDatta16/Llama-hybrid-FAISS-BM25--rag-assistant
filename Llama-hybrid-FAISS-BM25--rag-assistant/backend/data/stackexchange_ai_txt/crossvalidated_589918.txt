These seem to be the fitted conditional standard deviations (or perhaps variances) of four time series. On average, you would expect higher absolute returns when the distribution has a higher standard deviation (variance). This need not hold for every instance, only on average. Whether this is what you see in the graphs is hard to tell, as there are so many data points squeezed in a small area. If you zoom in and find this to be the case, then there is nothing to worry about; the model implications do not contradict the data. If the high conditional standard deviations tend to occur where low absolute returns are observed, on average, that would be a cause for concern, as the model would be contradicting the data. The fact that you run DCC is irrelevant here, as you are interpreting the results of the univariate models fit for each time series separately. Meanwhile, DCC is (essentially) a model of the dependence between them, building on top of the univariate models.
