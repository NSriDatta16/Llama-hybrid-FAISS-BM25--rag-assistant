Best way to implement an xpath-like configuration system

I'm trying to come up with the best way to handle configuration in an application. At first i just used SimpleXML and put the code in a singleton. I've decided to try to create a way to query the configuration with something like $config->getConfig('/module/name'); Do you have to use xpath to do this or is there any other method that is faster/easier to use? I know Magento uses this scheme but with a custom xpath-like syntax. Feel free to suggest different schemes as long as it is based on XML. SimpleXML is a nice approach however i feel the need to wrap something around it as the return values are almost always objects where I want a string value. Could someone explain how to wrap the xpath call to return a string value if the query returns a value, or an object if the query has multiple children? $xml = $this->xml->xpath($path); How do you detect if the node returned is a leaf node?
