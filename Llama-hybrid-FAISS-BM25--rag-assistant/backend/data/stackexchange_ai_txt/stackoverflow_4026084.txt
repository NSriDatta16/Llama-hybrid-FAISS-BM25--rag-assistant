Jquery - Finding Alt Text for Current Image

Using Jquery UI to make a form where when you drag an image to an input, the alt text is parsed as the value of the input. I have this working fine for 1 image but, I want to make it so it pulls for the current image ( so that I dont have to specify the ID's of all of the images ). See the script below: $(function() { var teamname = $(".helmet").attr("alt"); $( "#draggable" ).draggable(); $( "#draggable2" ).draggable(); $( "#droppable" ).droppable({ drop: function( event, ui ) { $( this ) .find( "input" ) .val("" + teamname + ""); } }); $( "#droppable" ).droppable({ out: function( event, ui ) { $( this ) .find( "input" ) .val( " " ); } }); }); And here is the HTML Right now, whether I drag the first or second image, its only grabbing the alt text of the first image. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
