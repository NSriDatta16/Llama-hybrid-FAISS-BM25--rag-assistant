I can't recommend the best way to do this, but there are really a few considerations on how to break things up: Most Important: Read up on the Microsoft SharePoint Best Practices Resource Center . It has tons of good information, and way more than can realistically be covered here. First , the basic unit of storage on the backend is a content database, and it is generally considered a best practice to have one site collection per content database. In your case it might make sense to have two or more site collections - one for Company and one for Employees (and anything else). Second , security. Most things kind of inherit down the tree from the site, but I could easily envision needing to provide a different set of permissions for the Company and Employee sections, and possibly even the Employees 1 and 2 (taking at stab that they might mean things like HR, Facilities, etc.). Ideally, it would be nice to lay things out in some way that logically follows your company hierarchy or process. http://Server/Company/News http://Server/Company/Blog http://Server/Employees/HR http://Server/Employees/Facilities http://Server/Divisions/IT http://Server/Divisions/Sales http://Server/Divisions/Management In the above layout, you would create "Managed Paths" in the Central Administrator tool for Company, Employees and Divisions, then create Site Collections for News, Blog, etc... Third , do the sites need to share information? It is slightly harder to share information across site collection boundaries - though certainly not impossible. While it would help you to better scale up and outward, it might not be worth the additional effort. Fourth , the Publishing features are something you should definitely look into to get the content on the site. It enables a bunch of nice features that allow end-users to easily contribute content to get published, attached to a workflow for approval and you can even specify time you want the new pages to go live (though that might be a MOSS only feature).
