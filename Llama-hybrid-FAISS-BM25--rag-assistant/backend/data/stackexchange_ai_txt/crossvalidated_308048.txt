Since your picture starts at eqn (10), most of the notations are undefined and we have to make a guess at them. I will thus assume this is a standard linear regression model where $(i=1,...,n)$ $$y_i=\beta_1+\beta_2 x_i + u_i$$and where the $u_i$ are iid with mean zero (0) and variance $\sigma^2$. Second, it seems you are confusing sample empirical average with theoretical mean. Averaging the $n$ regression equations leads to eqn (10): $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \{\beta_1+\beta_2 x_i \} + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i$$In this equation, the random variable$$\bar u = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i$$has expectation zero but is not zero with probability $1$.
