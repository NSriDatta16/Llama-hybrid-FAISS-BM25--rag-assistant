Displaying Errors, Having Controls After to Move Downwards

So I am trying to have a message displayed when the input is invalid, suppose I want something other than a ToolTip , something that stays until the error is corrected. I tried having an ErrorTemplate I get Where the label overlays elements after it. How can I have it such that it works just like another element in the stackpanel? UPDATE: Using The VSM Now, I want to go 1 step further and animate the error label up and down. I am considering VSM following @robertos answer. I tried implementing in in Blend. A few problems I faced. I tried ... Then I lost access to VisualStates in Blend. Then I tried Not ideal as the StackPanel is within the border. Also my attempts at animation looks just weird http://screenr.com/byk http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0' width='560' height='345'>http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' >http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' flashvars='i=130553' allowFullScreen='true' width='560' height='345' pluginspage=' http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer ' > 1st I must make the label hidden instead of collapsed the animate just the opacity. I want the label to appear like its coming out from the textbox
