A "significant" intercept is one whose estimated value is "significantly" different from 0. In a logistic regression, that means different from equal outcome group probabilities when the predictors are at reference levels (categorical) or at 0 (continuous) . So just centering a continuous predictor or changing the reference level of a categorical predictor can change the "significance" of an intercept. Don't put too much importance onto the "significance" of an intercept in this case. With 3 pre-defined predictors you shouldn't be doing these analyses based on just one or 2 of them. In logistic regression omitting any predictor related to outcome whether correlated with the other predictors or not will tend to bias results , often in a way that makes it harder to find true associations with outcome. So you would be better off working with the full model (also including communicated as a predictor, potentially with interaction terms, if that makes sense based on the subject matter) and testing your specific hypotheses based on that full model. When you have multiple outcomes things get even more complicated. I'd recommend finding some local statistical expertise to help with the issues that arise then, as (1) you might want to take associations among outcomes into account and (2) with separate models for each of the outcomes you need to correct for multiple comparisons .
