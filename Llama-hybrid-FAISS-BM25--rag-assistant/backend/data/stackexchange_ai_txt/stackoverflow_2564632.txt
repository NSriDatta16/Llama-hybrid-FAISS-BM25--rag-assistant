However, I am not having any luck finding any clues to help me add that functionality into my program. If you want the functionality from the Music application (which, by the way, is not named "MediaPlayer"), go look at its source code . Here is a StackOverflow question with answers that point you to the specific class ( TouchInterceptor ) that enables the drag-and-drop. The question is whether I can use existing functions to help me, or do I need to manually program motion events and such until I get nearly the same functionality. If you are looking for a widget with built-in drag-and-drop, there is none in the SDK.
