Is layer 1 a div or a ul ? if it is a div , text-align: center should work, as long as you haven't set display: block on your a tags. to center a block element, you need to use margin: auto . to center an inline element, it is text-align: center . if that doesn't work, it has to do with your markup, or some other way that styles are getting overridden. I would highly suggest using firebug to see what is going on, I used to have these "wtf is going on" moments all the time with html, but since getting good with firebug they rarely last more then a few minutes. The other thing is text-indent is for indenting the first line of a paragraph. use padding-left to add whitespace inside a block element, or margin-left to add it outside.
