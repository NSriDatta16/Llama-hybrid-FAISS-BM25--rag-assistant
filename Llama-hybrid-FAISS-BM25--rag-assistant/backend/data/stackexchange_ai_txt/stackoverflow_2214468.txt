Does Conway's Law Hold?

I understand Conway's Law as saying that any organization that designs or produces a product is destined/doomed to produce a product that is an image of their organizational structure. I originally though it was meant to be comedic, but have seen it play out a number of times in the projects I've worked in. When there are two development teams that are seperated geographically and socially, the product comes back in two parts that don't communicate well. When there are three groups, three parts, etc. The question is this - has your experience in development reflected this as well? Further - what can be done to counteract this effect? How are the massively distributed projects, like the big open source projects, impacted by this?
