I have a similar structure, although I fetch my data from a Web Service. The way I organize is: Create classes in lib/imports , eg DailyDataImport , DailyDataSummarize (you can organize the hierarchy and names as per your wish or willingness). Create a rake task under a new namespace, say import and add it to your cron job depending frequency. Take a look at Cron in Ruby . Its helpful. This allows me to have a better control over what goes in my database. Some questions to consider: What schedule does the Device follow to populate the data? Do you need the data as-is or you want a little control over it or you need to process it, like summarizing and aggregating etc.
