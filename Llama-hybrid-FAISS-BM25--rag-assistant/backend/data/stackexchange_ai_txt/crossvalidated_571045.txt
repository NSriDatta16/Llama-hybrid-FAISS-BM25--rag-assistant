MCMC chains do not generate independent samples. To convince yourself, look at the autocorrelation plots, the autocorrelations would be non-zero. That is why one of the metrics we use for judging the quality of the results we use metrics as effective sample size that tries to estimate how many independent samples does your chain contain.
