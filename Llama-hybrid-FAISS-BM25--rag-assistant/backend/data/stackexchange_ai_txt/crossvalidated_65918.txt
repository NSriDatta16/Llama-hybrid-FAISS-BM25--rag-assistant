To gauge motivation score?

In order to gauge the level of motivations of my respondents to connect in Second Life, I have proposed to them to answer (with a Likert scale - 7 points: from totally disagree to totally agree) to 16 statements (items) that I have categorized myself in four motivation categories. For example the fulfillment motivations The fact that my avatar gains a higher status (in terms of money, material possessions, reputation, etc) is important to me. (HIGH STATUS) The fact that Second Life allows me to undertake and make money is important to me (START BUSINESS) The fact that Second Life allows me to gain valuable knowledge in the virtual world (scripting language, etc) and / or in the real world (to follow courses in Second Life, etc) is important to me. (TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE) The fact that Second Life allows me to create whatever I want is important to me. (CREATE) The fact that Second Life allows me to be altruistic (helping new residents, …) is important to me. (BE ALTRUISTIC) I would like to compute the average score of each respondents the fulfillment motivation HIGH STATUS|START BUSINESS|TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE|CREATE|BE ALTRUISTIC| Resp n°29 4 6 6 7 6 5,8 Resp n°30 2 4 6 6 4 4,4 Resp n°31 5 7 4 1 5 4,4 In place of computing a simple arithmetic average I envisage a principal component analysis If I do a PCA for the 5 assesments of the fulfillment motivations : Principal components/correlation Number of obs = 373 Number of comp. = 4 Trace = 5 Rotation: (unrotated = principal) Rho = 1.0000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component | Eigenvalue Difference Proportion Cumulative -------------+------------------------------------------------------------ Comp1 | 2.72909 1.81017 0.5458 0.5458 Comp2 | .918928 .121757 0.1838 0.7296 Comp3 | .797171 .242364 0.1594 0.8890 Comp4 | .554806 .554806 0.1110 1.0000 Comp5 | 4.44089e-16 . 0.0000 1.0000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Principal components (eigenvectors) -------------------------------------------------------------------- Variable | Comp1 Comp2 Comp3 Comp4 | Unexplained -------------+----------------------------------------+------------- Statut_Elevé | 0.2544 0.8212 -0.4932 0.1330 | 0 Lancer_Bus | 0.5549 -0.3110 -0.2713 -0.1475 | 0 Créer | 0.4279 0.0046 0.4411 0.7889 | 0 Altruisme | 0.3693 0.3637 0.6442 -0.5625 | 0 Acquérir_C | 0.5549 -0.3110 -0.2713 -0.1475 | 0 -------------------------------------------------------------------- I was wondering if I could not sort my items in both components: Resp n° 29 Comp1: (0.2544*4)+(0,5549*6)+(0,4279*7)+(0,3693*6) + (0,5549*6) = 12,8875 Comp2: (0,8212*4) + (-0,3110*6) + (0,0046*7) + (0,3637*6) + (-0.3110 *6) = 1,7672 And after computing the mean of both components : 7,32735 Is this approach appropriate? If not, what can I do better than simple average items to calculate a score of achievement motivation?
