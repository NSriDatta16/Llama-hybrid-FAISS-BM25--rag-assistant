This is what I do in projects : Pre-process data in DB / Data Lake. aim is to : A. Form batches (might require a new table with shuffled indices) B. Create a copy with Normalization and other feature related tasks After this, try algorithms that support batch learning. Neural networks support batch learning and few other algos ( https://sklearn.org/modules/scaling_strategies.html#incremental-learning ). With batch learning, you can plot loss for each batch and see if algo is working or not.
