For using the same sessions on multiple domains/servers, you have to take care of two aspects: where the session data is stored so that both domains/servers can access it, and how the session identifier is carried along both domains/servers so that. Storage For different servers you could write your own session save handler that both servers can use. This could for example be a database that both have access to. Session ID sharing If you want to share a session ID for multiple domains (might be on the same server or different) and want to use cookies to transport the session ID, you have to modify the session ID cookie settings so that the cookie is valid for both domains. But this is only possible if both domains share the same higher level domain. For www.example.com and jobs.example.com that share example.com , the $domain parameter for session_set_cookie_params() has to be set to .example.com .
