OLS model assumptions for ML

hey i'm a beginner in data science, started working on the familiar "Boston" dataset ,and i tried to fit a multiple linear regression model to predict the "median house price " , after preprocessing the data , i was able to create , a model with an adjusted r squrared :75% , and it performed well on test data ,the p value of shapiro test on residuals is equal to 0.04 which i tried to maximize by reducing skewness and variability of data ,the durbin watson test is verified there is indebpendance of residuals , and also the mean is of residuals is centered around zero, there isn't that much variability in data . my question is based on my situation , can i accept this model , if this violates normality ,and do we only care about the performance of model on data test ? i tried to use transformers , and deleting some outliers in order to obtain a model that fits the assumptions of "OLS" model , is it enough ? do i need to verify all the assumptions ?,is my model poor ? thank's
