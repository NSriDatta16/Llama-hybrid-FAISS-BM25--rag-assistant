Why is time series forecasting different for each software?

I have 2 different software programs: SPSS, and Statgraphics. I am using them for time series forecasting but Each one gives different arima parameters when using the auto ARIMA model, and The forecast is also different when using the same arima parameters in both software . Can you please clarify why there are differences between them?
