This a job for Bayes Theorem, not for null-hypothesis testing. You've given us some information, so we should now simply determine how much more or less consistent that information is with the hypothesis than with its negation & adjust our priors accordingly. Based on what you've told us I conclude that the likelihood "Bill is skilled" is low--somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% (that is, I'll bet he is "lucky" unless you offer me odds better than 9:1 against "skilled"). Here's why: Neither the failure to make hypotheses in advance of the 2 games, the lack of information about how many games have been played or will be played after the 2 in question, nor the possibility that someone is cheating, etc. really matter. Having been supplied no information bearing on the situation, we should assume an 8-player poker game drawn at random from the universe of such games being played. That deals w/ w/ all the "what ifs" & "could bes" that Whuber draws our attention to: b/c the proportion of games that are fixed, or involve 1 avg player competing w/ 7 imbeciles, or are played w/ unshuffled decks etc., is tiny in comparison to the proportion of games that are fair & involve "run of the mill players," you will just be making your life complicated if you assume this game involves anything other than a "normal game" (if you have a different sense of how the universe of 8-person games is populated, then modify this part of the analysis accordingly; I'm just trying to demonstrate how to think about this problem!). Based on billions of games & meticulous record-keeping, I put the likelihood at about 0.10 that any randomly selected player in a normal game of poker is a "skilled" (again, if you have a different sense of what the talent distribution looks like, substitute your own estimate here). In a normal game of poker, the likelihood that a skilled poker player will win any 2 consecutive hands against 7 randomly selected players is only a scintilla higher than the likelihood that an unskilled one will. Poker is a game of skill, yes, but variance is super high (if you think otherwise, fine, but in that case you definitely are not an experienced poker player). If you had said "Bill made 2 consecutive 40-foot jump shots," or "won 2 consecutive olympic marathons," in contrast, then my priors about how much better he is than the average baseketball player or the average marathon runner would shift much much more dramatically-- those are lower-variance indicators of those types of skill. Because the likelihood ratio for the hypothesis and the negation of the hypothesis is thus very close to 1, you won't do much better here than going with your priors. Again, mine is that there is 1/10 chance that Bill is skilled.
