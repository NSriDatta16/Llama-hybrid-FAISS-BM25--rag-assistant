I am using clustering to find matching pairs of vectors. This is just a shot in the dark really since I'm not sure exactly what your are trying to do. Based on the sentence above, there are tools in bioinformatics to align DNA or protein sequences against each other on a large scale (e.g. minimap2 , BLAST , VSEARCH ). If you can formulate your problem in terms of sequence alignment, then maybe you can leverage on those open-source tools
