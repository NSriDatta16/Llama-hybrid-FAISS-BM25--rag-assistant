I'm absolutely no Cocoa expert, but AFAIK windowDidMove gives a notification even when you are still dragging and just take a little break (left mouse button still pressed, mouse is not moved for half a second or so). What about watching two things: You know that the window drag starts and you know when it is finished. The time between watch the mouse movement, then you got your moving window position.
