Does it make sense to combine PCA and LDA?

Assume I have a dataset for a supervised statistical classification task, e.g., via a Bayes' classifier. This dataset consists of 20 features and I want to boil it down to 2 features via dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and/or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Both techniques are projecting the data onto a smaller feature subspace: with PCA, I would find the directions (components) that maximize the variance in the dataset (without considering the class labels), and with LDA I would have the components that maximize the between-class separation. Now, I am wondering if, how, and why these techniques can be combined and if it makes sense. For example: transforming the dataset via PCA and projecting it onto a new 2D subspace transforming (the already PCA-transformed) dataset via LDA for max. in-class separation or skipping the PCA step and using the top 2 components from a LDA. or any other combination that makes sense.
