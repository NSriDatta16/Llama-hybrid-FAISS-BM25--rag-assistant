Is there a JQuery plugin which combines Draggable and Selectable

I'm looking to implement a web interface with a number of items which can be selected and dragged around to position them, either in groups or singly . Rather like the Windows Desktop, really. We're using JQuery already, so additions to that would be first choice. JQuery UI Draggables and Selectables individually do much of what we want, but don't really work together to give the sort of effect we're looking for. I am completely overwhelmed by the JQ plugin site (it's 'popular' algorithm doesn't seem very useful), and would welcome guidance as to the best way to avoid a lot of wheel-reinvention here, as I would guess that this metaphor has already been done.
