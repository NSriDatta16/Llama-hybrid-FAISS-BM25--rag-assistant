The answer to this question is not absolute as it often depends on the task you have at hand. If you're creating some kind of SDK for reuse by others, then namespaces are very important; however, if you're creating an in-house tool with just a few classes, the namespaces are pretty much unimportant. Classes Generally speaking, classes should have their own file as this simplifies how people navigate around the code solution, helping with development and maintenance (it's much harder to merge changes when everyone is changing the same files, for example). It can be acceptable to split one class across multiple files in some situations such as: When there are nested classes, each nested class could have its own file. When there are auto-generated portions to the class such as designer code. When there are fixed portions to the class such as a common set of hidden properties or a common implementation of an interface. In one of our projects, we have a common implementation of an interface that many classes expose. As we don't have multiple inheritance, we take a mix-in approach whereby we autogenerate an additional file for each class. This could be done manually, instead of automatically (and was, originally). There are other situations, but this is somewhat subjective and dependent on your own project's requirements. Namespaces Namespaces should generally focus on sensible groupings of your types. A namespace should allow a developer to intuitively locate what they are looking for. For many small projects, a single namespace such as MyAwesomeTool is sufficient, but for a larger project with many classes will need a more logical grouping. Such large projects, like SDKs or the .NET BCL rely on the namespaces to breakdown the otherwise overwhelmingly large collection of types. Each namespace level provides additional information of what might be found there, such as System.Windows.Forms or System.Drawing or Microsoft.VisualBasic . When creating namespaces, every consideration must be given to the purpose of that namespace and the associated project. If the project is in-house and small, call the namespace what you like as it is merely a necessity for grouping your types; if the project is externally visible or contains a large amount of types, think carefully about logical and meaningful groupings that will enable others to intuitively find the types they are looking for. Conclusion There are no hard and fast rules that work in every situation. How you arrange your code into files relates to your own development processes, impacting you and your team; all your classes in one file will be hell to develop with but the compiled product won't act any different (provided the one file approach didn't lead to errors), whereas the arrangement of your namespaces relates to future development and the consumers of those namespaces, so the consequences of getting it wrong can be more serious. Aim to organise your classes in a way that simplifies current development and future maintenance. Aim to organise your namespaces in a way that simplifies all development and, where appropriate, the experience of your end users.
