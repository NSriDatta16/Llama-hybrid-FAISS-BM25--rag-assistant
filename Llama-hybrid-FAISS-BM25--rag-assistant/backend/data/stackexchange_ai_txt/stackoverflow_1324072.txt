I'd use a favorite program as a reference for something like this. What command line utility do you think has a good, efficient interface that you could model your program on? Use it. Update : So I think I need to revise this a little. It was taken way too literally. Google and this site proved that the internet is very democratic. What is popular is replicated, linked to or reproduced in someway. Given this, plus one's personal experiences with computers, I think it is feasible to derive a pretty good solution based on personal experience and consideration for the solution to be provided. For example, vim is a great program. A lot of people use it and love it. But that type of interface is probably not going to work (at least well) for a version control system. But both interfaces are very elegant for the purpose they suite. On the other hand, the vim type interface might work for a section of the version control system -- the commit dialog for example. Now, I know that vim is normally used for the "commit dialog" (by default) for svn (on unix based OSes). This is just an example of mixing two styles of interfaces to come up with a cohesive solution.
