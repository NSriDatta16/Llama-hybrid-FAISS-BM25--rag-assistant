ARIMA and regression with ARIMA errors are comparable in terms of AIC as long as the models are estimated by maximum likelihood, the dependent variable is exactly the same and the likelihood is evaluated on exactly the same data points of the dependent variable in all competing models, and the AIC (mainly, the likelihood) is calculated exactly (without scaling, without dropping constants) to ensure comparability across models. (Or the transformations made in AIC calculation are the same across models so that comparability is not compromised.) The latter point addresses different software implementations which often make the calculated AIC values incomparable. Alternatively, you can compare the predictive performance of your models using time series cross validation based on rolling or expanding windows.
