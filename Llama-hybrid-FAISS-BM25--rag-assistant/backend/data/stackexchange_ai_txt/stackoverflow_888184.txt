MS Access MSChart.Graph.8 not printing

Software: Microsoft Access 2007 SP2 Database File Version: Access 2000 I have an access program that I inherited from a previous employee. It uses forms for reports and since I don't have much experience in access I have continued to do this. I have created a copy of the program for another project and modified it to suit. I am having trouble getting more then one chart to print. All the charts display in form view, they all have the same properties (excepting data, position, etc.) For some reason they are not printing. They don't even show up in the print preview. I am thinking it must be something with the graphs themselves as they sometimes lose all information. I have to open the graphs in edit mode and change the data source from column to row and back again so that it gets redrawn. (Refresh doesn't fix it) So right now I don't even have a clue as to where to look so ideas are welcome. Edit #1 It seems to be a problem with linking to an unbound form. Subform Field Linker: Can't build a link between unbound forms. The query for the main form is SELECT tTest.ixTest, tMotorTypes.ixMotorType, tMotorTypes.asMotorType, tMotorTypes.fDeprecated, tTestType.asTest, tTest.asSerialNum, tTest.asOrderNum, tTest.asFrameNum, tTest.asRotorNum, tTest.asOperator, tTest.iStation, tTest.dtTestDate, tTest.ixTestType FROM tMotorTypes INNER JOIN (tTestType INNER JOIN tTest ON tTestType.ixTestType=tTest.ixTestType) ON tMotorTypes.ixMotorType=tTest.ixMotorType; The query for the chart is: SELECT qGraphRSTTemperatures.Frequency, qGraphRSTTemperatures.[Drive End], qGraphRSTTemperatures.[Non Drive End], qGraphRSTTemperatures.[Air In], qGraphRSTTemperatures.Core FROM qGraphRSTTemperatures ORDER BY qGraphRSTTemperatures.ixTemperature; Query qGraphRSTTemperatures: SELECT tElectricalData.dblFrequency AS Frequency, tTemperatures.dblDrvEnd AS [Drive End], tTemperatures.dblNonDrvEnd AS [Non Drive End], tTemperatures.dblAirIn AS [Air In], tTemperatures.dblCore AS Core, tSubTest.ixTest, tTemperatures.ixTemperature FROM (tSubTest INNER JOIN tElectricalData ON tSubTest.ixSubTest = tElectricalData.ixSubTest) LEFT JOIN tTemperatures ON tElectricalData.ixElectrical = tTemperatures.ixElectrical WHERE (((tSubTest.ixSubTestType)=5)) ORDER BY tSubTest.ixTest, tTemperatures.ixTemperature; So how come, in the form view it shows the graph with the correct data when linked thus: Child field: ixTest Master field: ixTest but won't print the graph. The graph will print if I remove the links, but then I have all the data from chart query as it is not limited by ixTest. edit #2 It seems to be a data retrieval/rendering issue in printing. Is there anything in printing that changes the context of records with respect to parent/child relationships?
