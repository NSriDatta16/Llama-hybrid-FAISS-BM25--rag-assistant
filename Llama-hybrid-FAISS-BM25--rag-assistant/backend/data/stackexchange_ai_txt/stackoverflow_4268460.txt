I would use pure css (although i would use some jQuery/js to modify the BASE font size live) it's best to use ems although it can get really frustrating as the ems cascade. (more on this later) You need a base font size set in pixels at the top of the resizable area (12px is the standard) and everything under that should be in ems. now for the frustrating part: keep in mind that if you have a div with font-size:0.9:em; and a nested paragraph with font-size 0.8em the paragraph will be smaller then expected as its base will be the div with font-size:0.9em. once you work all this out though all you need to do is change the base font-size in pixels!
