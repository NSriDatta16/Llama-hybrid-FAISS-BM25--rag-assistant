Person's parameter (ability) calibration using R's package ltm

I have a user response ( $0/1$ ) matrix user_item_matrix , which has $1000$ rows (users) and $30$ columns (items/questions). There is a lot of missing data (more than $50\%$ , on average, for each user/row). Now, I'm using ltm package as follows: # Load package library(ltm) #... # Fit the model pl3 $score.dat$ Exp # Summary of the vector of estimated parameters summary(theta_pred) It returns: # Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. # 0.001 1.286 9.123 71.363 98.157 708.748 So, we get only positive theta 's and a lot of them are quite big ( $>10$ ) which feels not right. Any ability level bigger than $6$ seems weird. Am I wrong? Is there a way to "calibrate' the estimated parameters (say, forcing them to be within $[-5,5]$ )? Can these huge ability levels be a result of the fact that I have so many missing values in my data?
