Page Speed recognizes expiers headers, but YSlow doesn't

We're running IIS6 on Windows Server 2003. Our site is written in ASP.NET. We configured our site to expire headers after 7 days. While Page Speed gives us a check for "Leverage browser caching", YSlow gives us an F on "Add Expires headers". How can that be? An example page can be found here
