Have a look at the WdBuiltinStyle Enumeration . When assigning styles, you can do so by their local name (which is what you seem to do now), but you can also use one of the enumeration values, in your case setting the Style property to WdBuiltinStyle.wdStyleHeading1 would do the trick. Dim para As Paragraph Set para = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1) para.Style = WdBuiltinStyle.wdStyleHeading1
