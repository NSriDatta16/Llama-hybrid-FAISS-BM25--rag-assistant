futta's idea is right, but what you will probably find is that only one section of your frontpage changes often. Leave that empty, then let the rest of the page be cached and don't worry about it. When you visit the page, the cached version is called up instantly, and you can run a script to grab the dynamic page fragment from the server and set it with innerHTML to complete the page. The effect is that there is still one HTTP request (plus one for the manifest), so it is no slower, and it addition you can show part of your app while the dynamic section is being downloaded. If you ever want to refresh the whole page, have a comment in the manifest marking the version, and increment that to reload the whole app. Clean and neat. I think that is how the system is intended to be used, without trying to avoid a bit of javascript, since that is after all the only way you can play around with the offline and do useful things with the app when offline.
