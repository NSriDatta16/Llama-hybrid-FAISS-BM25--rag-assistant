You basically, and correctly, rederived OLS, as these are the moment conditions exploited by your GMM estimator (namely, that regressors and errors are orthogonal, so that no external instruments are needed (equivalently, that regressors serve as their own instruments). Notice that, assuming no multicollinearity, $X'X$ has full rank and hence is invertible. Hence, $$(X'XX'X)^{-1}= (X'X)^{-1}(X'X)^{-1}$$ so that $$\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}\underbrace{(X'X)^{-1}X'X}_{=I}X'y=(X'X)^{-1}X'y.$$ I am not sure if that is the actual answer to your question, as we seek an inefficient estimator, but OLS is, under the present assumptions, efficient, by the Gau√ü-Markov theorem. P.S. Not that it is not correct to equate expected values and sample averages. Rather, the sample moment condition is the analogon exploited by the population moment condition.
