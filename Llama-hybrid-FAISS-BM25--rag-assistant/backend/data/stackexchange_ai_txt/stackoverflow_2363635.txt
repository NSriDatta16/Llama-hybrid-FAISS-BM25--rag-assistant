Use a Debugger There's a debugger for most (if not all) popular C++ development environments. I'd be of the opinion that you cannot develop non-trivial code without one. (Yes I'm aware there's a movement in TDD that states if you've sufficient test coverage you don't need a debugger. Which is complete @rse IMHO)
