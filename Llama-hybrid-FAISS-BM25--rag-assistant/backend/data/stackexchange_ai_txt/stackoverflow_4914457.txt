This depends basically on the way you implement your drag&drop. A SurfaceView can be fast and there is no need for switching to OpenGL ES just to show 2D... Find out what causes the lag. If the lag is caused by the touch events aren't fired often enough to be "lag free" that even OpenGL wont help...
