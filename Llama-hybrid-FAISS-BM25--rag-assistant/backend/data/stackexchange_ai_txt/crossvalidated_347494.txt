Bayesian test quantities

I have a Bayesian model and was looking to do some model checking via Posterior Predictive p-values. From Bayesian Data Analysis (Gelman et al) it is stated that we adopt a test quantity $T(y,\theta)$ in order to assess whether the statistic with random replications of the data exceeds the statistic from our original data. $$T(y^{\text{rep }s},\theta^{s})\geq T(y,\theta^{s})$$ Now, it states that the test quantity can either be a function of the data $T(y)$ or a function of both the data and the parameters $T(y,\theta)$. I can easily think of statistics to assess that are a function of the data (mean, variance etc.). However, I am struggling to think of a statistic that could also depend on the parameters. I think I am obviously overlooking some simple examples.
