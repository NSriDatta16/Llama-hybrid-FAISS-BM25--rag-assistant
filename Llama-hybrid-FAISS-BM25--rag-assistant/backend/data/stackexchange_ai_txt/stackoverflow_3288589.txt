How to block a status from an Ivy resolve

At our company, we use a base ant file that is included by everyone to do their builds. It contains the things we want to define globally and uniform, like build-test, test-coverage, build-release, publish on ivy, etc. I would like to enforce that in the ivy resolve that is done for creating a release build, libraries that have test (integration) status are rejected. Basically, that for a release build, you can only use release-class libraries. However, I cannot find a way to enforce this in the ivy resolve ant task (not in the ivy.xml file). Does anybody have an idea on how to accomplish this?
