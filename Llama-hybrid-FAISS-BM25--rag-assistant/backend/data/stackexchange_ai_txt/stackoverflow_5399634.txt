I would actually discourage you from using the repository pattern. In most cases, it is over-architecting and actually makes the code more complicated. Ayende has made a number of posts to that end recently: http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2011/03/16/architecting-in-the-pit-of-doom-the-evils-of-the.aspx http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2011/03/18/the-wages-of-sin-over-architecture-in-the-real-world.aspx http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2011/03/22/the-wages-of-sin-proper-and-improper-usage-of-abstracting.aspx I recommend just writing against Raven's native API. If you feel that my response is too general, list some of the benefits you hope to gain from using another layer of abstraction and we can continue the discussion.
