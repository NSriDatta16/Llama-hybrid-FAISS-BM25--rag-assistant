Speed dating algorithm

I work in a consulting organization and am most of the time at customer locations. Because of that I rarely meet my colleagues. To get to know each other better we are going to arrange a dinner party. There will be many small tables so people can have a chat. In order to talk to as many different people as possible during the party, everybody has to switch tables at some interval, say every hour. How do I write a program that creates the table switching schedule? Just to give you some numbers; in this case there will be around 40 people and there can be at most 8 people at each table. But, the algorithm needs to be generic of course
