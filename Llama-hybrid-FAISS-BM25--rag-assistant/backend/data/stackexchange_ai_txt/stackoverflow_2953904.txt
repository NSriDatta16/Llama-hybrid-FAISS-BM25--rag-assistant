You can do this in the Linq to SQL designer by dragging a stored procedure from the server explorer over to the "methods" pane, which is on the right hand side of the objects pane. Then, you will have a method on your datacontext that will return a type of ISingleResult. You can optionally override this method to map to any type from the model that you wish.
