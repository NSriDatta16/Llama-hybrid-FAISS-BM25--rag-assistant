That form of standardization would be a comparison of means ... and this is a very common thing to do; however the scores need to be something for which an average will carry meaning. If you're interesting in seeing which is bigger on average (or whether it's plausible that both are random samples from the same population distributions with the same mean), then this standardization would (likely) not only be reasonable, but pretty much necessary. So it's probably a good place to start. If you're interested in comparing some other statistic - or even the whole distribution, rather than just the means, you might do something else. If you just want to make some visual comparison, there are a number of suitable choices you might consider, but since the values are integers over a small range, you would probably find something like a histogram suitable, though there are other choices. If you can explain more about what you're trying to achieve we may be able to say more.
