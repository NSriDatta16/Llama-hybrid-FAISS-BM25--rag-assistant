Drag and drop add to cart function

I am testing out some new designs for my website and have decided to try and run a little drag and drop add to cart function to my site. Basically what I want is the user to be able to drag the picture of an item to the top right corner of the screen (to a 'position : fixed' box, perhaps?) and then dropping this item within the square adds it to the users cart. A simple idea, but one I haven't seen before. Can anyone help me to implement this ? I am not sure how to go about it. Thanks a lot. So far my work is as follows : function setupEvents( ) { document.getElementById('picture').onmousedown = enableDragging; } function enableDragging( ) { document.onmousemove = dragElement; document.onmouseup = disableDragging; return false; } function dragElement(evt) { document.getElementById('picture').style.left = evt.clientX; document.getElementById('picture').style.top = evt.clientY; return false; } function disableDragging( ) { document.onmousemove = null; document.onmouseup = null; }
