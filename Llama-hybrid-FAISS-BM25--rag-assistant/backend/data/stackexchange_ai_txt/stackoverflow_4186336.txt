TFS 2010 Build Agent DLL References outside branch

We've got a project in source control: $/Project/Trunk/Project.sln most of the projects live under the trunk $/Project/Trunk/Website $/Project/Trunk/BLL etc. The problem is, they all reference DLLs stored in $/Project/Common When I try to build using the build agent, I get an error saying it can't find the DLLs in the $/Common folder. I've run VS on the build agent machine and done a get latest on the $/Project/Common folder. I've also done a get latest on the $/Project/ and managed to build it myself on the build agent machine without issue. How can I convince the build agent to look in the $/Project/Common folder (or where it maps to D:\Source\Project\Common ) during builds? Whilst this does highlight the fact that those DLL references should point below the branch, we're not going to be able to change the structure for a month or so due to business requirements (it works at the moment, automated builds are nice but not critical, getting upcoming releases out is critical) so any suggestions appreciated.
