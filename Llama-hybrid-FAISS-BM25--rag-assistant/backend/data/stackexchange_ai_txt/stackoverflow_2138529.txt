std::map theMap; theMap[2] = 5; std::map ::const_iterator iter = theMap.find(2); if (iter != theMap.end()) iter->second; // found it Insert pairs of ints, retrieve value by key, logarithmic complexity. If you have a really large data set and need faster retrieval use std::tr1::unordered_map or boost::unordered_map (in case your standard library doesn't have TR1 implementation).
