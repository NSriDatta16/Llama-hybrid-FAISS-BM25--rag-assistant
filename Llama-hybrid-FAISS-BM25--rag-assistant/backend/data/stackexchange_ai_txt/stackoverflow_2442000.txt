Accessing Class Variables from a List in a nice way in Python

Suppose I have a list X = [a, b, c] where a, b, c are instances of the same class C. Now, all these instances a,b,c, have a variable called v, a.v, b.v, c.v ... I simply want a list Y = [a.v, b.v, c.v] Is there a nice command to do this? The best way I can think of is: Y = [] for i in X Y.append(i.v) But it doesn't seem very elegant ~ since this needs to be repeated for any given "v" Any suggestions? I couldn't figure out a way to use "map" to do this.
