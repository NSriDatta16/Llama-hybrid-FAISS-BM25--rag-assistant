It is possible to assume that the population from which data were randomly sampled has a probability distribution with a finite mean $\mu$ and a finite variance $\sigma^2$ without assuming that the distribution has a PDF (density or PMF) of a particular form. Here are some examples in which the form of the population distribution is known. The particulars depend on the form of the distribution. If you assume that the population has a normal distribution, then you can use the sample mean $\bar X$ to estimate the population mean $\mu$ and the sample variance $S^2$ to estimate the population variance $\sigma^2.$ Example: It may be reasonable to assume that the time it takes to make assemble a particular electronic device is normally distributed. Then if a trial run for making $n = 25$ such devices with a new method had average $\bar X = 7.5$ hours and standard deviation $S = 2$ hours, then we might estimate the process mean with the 95% confidence interval $\bar X \pm t^*S/\sqrt{n}$ or $(6.67,9.44),$ and the variance with the 95% confidence interval $(n-1)S^2/U, (n-1)S^2/L,$ or $(2.44,7.74),$ where $t^*$ cuts probability $0.025$ from the upper tail of Student's t distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom and $L, U$ cut probability $0.025$ from the lower and upper tails, respectively, of a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. 7.5 + qt(c(.025,.975), 24)*2/5 [1] 6.674441 8.325559 # 95% CI for pop mean 24*4/qchisq(c(.975,.025), 24) [1] 2.438772 7.741217 # 95% CI for pop variance If you assume that the population has a Poisson distribution, then you can use the sample mean $\bar X$ to estimate the population mean, often denoted as $\lambda.$ But then the population variance is also numerically equal to $\lambda.$ if you assume that the population has a beta or a gamma distribution, then you can use the sample mean and variance to estimate the population mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2,$ but the parameters of these distributions are functions of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ and so extra steps must be taken to estimate the parameters. Sometimes there is no one way to estimate the parameters, and one needs to consider criteria for making the best choices. By contrast, if form of the population distribution is not known, you may need to use various distribution-free (or nonparametric) methods of estimating the center (e.g., mean or median) of the distribution or the spread of the distribution (e.g., standard deviation, variance, range). These methods may include, among others, rank-based methods or bootstrapping. Example: Suppose the length of time it took to process a pharmaceutical drug (in hours) for 20 batches of a particular process is as listed below: x [1] 45.0 14.4 35.5 22.8 29.2 24.2 31.0 26.7 31.1 5.5 [11] 23.4 26.5 15.3 12.7 18.1 14.9 20.1 6.3 17.9 16.1 We have no idea what the time distribution of the process might be and so we use simple quantile 95% bootstrap confidence interval $(17.9, 26.1)$ as an interval estimate of the mean number of hours: set.seed(2021) a.re = replicate(3000, mean(sample(x,20,rep=T))) quantile(a.re, c(.025,.975)) 2.5% 97.5% 17.89487 26.07500
