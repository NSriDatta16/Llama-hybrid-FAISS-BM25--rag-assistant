Following your comment saying that you are only interested in the performance of a treatment averaged out over all products; you are right to simplify the data as you did into the first table. You might have considered using an ANOVA test but that would only tell you if there is a difference between any two groups out of the control or treatment. That means that it could pick up that treatment 1 performs differently from treatment 8, but you don't care if two individual treatments differ, only if treatments differ from the control. Since you're comparing all the treatments with only one group-the control you should use a Z test, however you need to correct for multiple comparisons. Comparing multiple things causes false-positives to occur more often. In a single Z test with $\alpha = 0.05$ the critical Z value is $\pm 1.96$. But you can imagine that if you had 100 treatments you are likely to find one of them with a Z score above $1.96$ occurring by chance. Since all your treatments are sampled independently you can use the family wise error rate. If you want a significance of $\alpha$ then you will need to adjust this to $\alpha_{adjusted}=1-(1-\alpha)^8$ because you have 8 comparisons. Compute a critical Z test statistic with the significance $\alpha_{adjusted}$. If any treatment has a Z score larger than this then it is significant.
