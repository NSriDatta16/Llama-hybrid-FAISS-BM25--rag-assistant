I don't think there's a way of disabling the http-equiv refresh. Is the status page the first page in your app? If not, then why not get the capabilities of the client up front before requesting the status page? If it is then you might have to inject a UI-less page that grabs the capability of the browser and instantly post back to the real status page. All this assumes that you're not willing to use the user agent string in the HTTP Header to get the browser capability.
