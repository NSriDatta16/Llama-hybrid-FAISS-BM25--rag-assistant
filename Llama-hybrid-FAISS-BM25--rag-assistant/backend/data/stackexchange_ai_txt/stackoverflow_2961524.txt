String replacement on a whole text file in Python 3.x?

How can I replace a string with another string, within a given text file. Do I just loop through readline() and run the replacement while saving out to a new file? Or is there a better way? I'm thinking that I could read the whole thing into memory, but I'm looking for a more elegant solution... Thanks in advance
