Are there any issues in using different sizes ? If there are, how should I approach this problem (since formulas won't all fit in the same image size) ? It depends on the architecture of the neural network. Some architectures assume that all images have the same dimension, other (such as im2markup) don't make such an assumption. The fact that im2markup allow images of different widths don't bring any issue I believe, since they use an RNN that scans through the output of the convolution layer. group images of similar sizes to facilitate batching That's typically to speed things up by avoid adding too much padding.
