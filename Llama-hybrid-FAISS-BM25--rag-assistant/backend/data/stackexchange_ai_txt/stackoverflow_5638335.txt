Reading / Writing files in Javascript - IE6

I need a database storage system for Javascript where the state can be maintained on the local disk. Here comes the spanners in the works :- It only needs to support Internet Explorer but the minimum version must be IE6 Files need to be written so they can be read in again later (upon closing and re-opening of browser) There can be no web server (unless it's extremely easy to distribute and does not require a install) since the HTML pages will be distributed on USB. Does anyone know of any solutions that might help here?
