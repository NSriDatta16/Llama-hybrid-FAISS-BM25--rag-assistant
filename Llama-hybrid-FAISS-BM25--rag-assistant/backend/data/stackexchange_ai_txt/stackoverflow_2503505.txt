I was trying to think of any applications that I've seen that display the notion of something being read only visually, but not many things came to mind. One that did is SQL Server. When a database is read only, it is greyed-out in the UI (as well as it explicitly saying read only): alt text http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7886/sqlr.jpg I think this works quite well as you are in effect saying that this node/folder is unavailable for the current action (ie. dragging files to it). As others have mentioned, a lock icon also works well (I've seen this done in Visual Studio when a file is read only).
