Load view with nib file from another nib file

I'm sure this is fairly simple but i cannot make it work. I have a UIViewController called viewController including a nib which should load up several other views. Four of these other views are views of my class BlockView (subclass of UIView). I've made a nib file for the BlockView class also (by creating a new nib and setting it's file owner to BlockView, is there something else to be done here?). In the viewController I drag in four UIViews and set their file owners 'Class' to be BlockView. When I run this I am only seeing four white squares where I put the BlockViews, why is that? Thanks -Michael
