Understanding exchangeability

Suppose you had information of a true success rate of passing an exam from different schools, and that the 'true' success rates are similar, can you assume exchangeability is applicable to these values, or is there not enough info to assume it?,if so, then what more info is needed to make a reasonable assumption? Also, since the values are considered similar, what would be a logical way to estimate the success rate at a say 5-th school given you have values of the true success rate from 4 schools already, is it just a simple average? I'm not sure whether the concept of exchangeability can be applied here, and generally not getting how it can be applied to similar situations, involving a sequence of numbers.
