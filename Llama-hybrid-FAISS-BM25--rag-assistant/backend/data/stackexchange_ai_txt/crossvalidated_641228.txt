Can Random Sampling Help Improve Data Quality Problems?

I am working with a hospital dataset. Patients come in and provide information (i.e. var1, var2, var3) about themselves and their partner (if they have one). Later, their partner also come and provide the same information about themselves and their partner that just came in. The dataset looks something like this: | patient | patient_partner | patient_var1 | patient_var2 | patient_var3 | patient_partner_var1 | patient_partner_var2 | patient_partner_var3 | |---------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------| | john | sally | 1 | 5 | 7 | 1 | 5 | 7 | | sally | john | 1 | 5 | 7 | 1 | 5 | 7 | | kevin | NULL | 7 | 1 | 0 | NULL | NULL | NULL | | tim | lucy | 9 | 6 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 1 | | lucy | tim | 5 | 4 | 1 | 9 | 6 | 1 | | jane | jack | 1 | 2 | 2 | 9 | 6 | 2 | | jack | jane | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | As we can see: sometimes a patient has no partner (e.g. kevin) sometimes the patient and their partner have exactly the same information and both will give the exact same information about each other (e.g. john and sally) sometimes the patient and their partner have different information and both will still give the same information about each other (e.g. tim and lucy) sometimes the information provided by the patient about their partner does not exactly match the information that their partner directly provided. (e.g. jack and jane) There could be many reasons why this is (e.g. data quality errors, miscommunication, the information could have changed during the time that the first partner provided the information, the information could actually be different e.g. the patient and the partner have 2 kids together but the partner also has a kid from a previous marriage, etc.). It is also possible that Jack can provide more accurate information about Jane compared to the information that Jane provides about herself. The goal is to estimate the average values of var1, var2, var3 in this dataset. Ideally, I would have de-duplicated the dataset and kept one row of data for each couple- however, in this case it is not possible as I am not sure which row to keep and discard. If I keep both rows, I risk overestimating/underestimating the average value of var1,var2, var3. If I remove one row, I also risk overestimating/underestimating the average value of var1,var2, var3. Here is the idea I came up with: Suppose I assume data quality issues are randomly distributed Then, perhaps only using the patient_var1, patient_var2 and patient_var3 columns on the original dataset (i.e. no de-duplication), I can randomly sample rows with replacement (e.g. 5% of the rows) and calculate the average values of patient_var1, patient_var2 and patient_var3. I can repeat this random sampling process and averaging many times to get a distribution of var1, var2, var3. Then, I can take the average value of each distribution to get the final average of var1, var2, var3. By doing this, I think I will have indirectly guarded against data inconsistency issues and have gotten a general sense of the average values of var1, var2, var3 Is this a statistically valid idea?
