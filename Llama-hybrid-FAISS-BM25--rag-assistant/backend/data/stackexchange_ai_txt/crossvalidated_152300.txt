Forecast bayesian GARCH model

I am using this package in R to do Bayesian estimation of GARCH models. I want to forecast $y_t$ (i.e. the mean equation), but it seems that the package has no built-in function for this. The model setup in the package is as follows: Now I was thinking how I should implement a forecasting procedure. I thought of doing this: Estimate model to obtain parameter posteriors Take mean of each posterior to get a point estimate Obtain $h_t$ Simulate from normal and gamma to obtain $y_t$. My questions/problems: Is this a proper way of doing it? This might take very long, because every forecast means that I have to simulate three times, first to get the posteriors, than for $\epsilon_t$ and then for $\bar{\omega}_t$ Are there any better options (preferably already coded)?
