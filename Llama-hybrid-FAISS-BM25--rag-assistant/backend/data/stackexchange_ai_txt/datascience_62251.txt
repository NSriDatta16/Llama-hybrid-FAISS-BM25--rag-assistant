Genetic algorithms: what connection to support vector machine / naive bayes

I found the following list of seven classifiers: Linear Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier Nearest Neighbor Support Vector Machines Decision Trees Boosted Trees Random Forest Neural Network What are genetic algorithms, and why aren't they considered as part of the seven classifiers?
