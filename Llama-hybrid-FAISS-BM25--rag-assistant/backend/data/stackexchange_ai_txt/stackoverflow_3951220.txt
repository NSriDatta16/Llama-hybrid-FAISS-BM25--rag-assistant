ActiveMQ without persistence

I'd like to set up a publisher-subscriber based communication protocol between a server producing messages and many clients receiving them. After a bit of research, I decided to go with ActiveMQ. I looked at a few tutorials and the ActiveMQ site and set up the broker as follows: BrokerService broker = new BrokerService(); broker.setPersistent(false); broker.addConnector("tcp://localhost:61616"); broker.start(); I only need the message passing functionality, no database persistence or anything alike. However, when I start the application, a activemq-data folder is created regardless of the the configuration. This in turn causes an exception the next time I start the broker. SEVERE: Failed to start ActiveMQ JMS Message Broker. Reason: java.io.EOFException: Chunk stream does not exist at page: 0 Is this a bug or am I not setting up the broker correctly (using ActiveMQ 5.4.1)? How can I disable persistence, so the additional data storage is not created? Also, I prefer to configure the broker from within the Java application and not through an xml file. Cheers, Max
