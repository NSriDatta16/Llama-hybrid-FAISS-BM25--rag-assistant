How does one compare two nested quasibinomial GLMs?

Lets say I have two models: Model 1 and Model 2, both of which are used to fit a quasibinomial GLM on some 0/1 response data (that I believe has overdispersion, hence quasibinomial GLM instead of logistic regression). Model 1 is a subset of Model 2. So there are k explanatory variables in Model 2 that are not in Model 1, and I want to test whether the addition of these explanatory variables provides an improvement (in-sample). In regular logistic regression, my understanding is that I could use deviance tests to compare nested models. However, from what I've read, this is connected to the likelihood of the model, which is not available in the same way with a quasibinomial regression, since we don't have a complete log likelihood. As such, I'm unsure of whether a deviance test has the same distributional properties that it would in the general GLM case. So as a result, my questions are as follows: Is a deviance test still valid when using quasibinomial regression? If so, how is it calculated, with the addition of estimated dispersion parameters? Are there other ways to formally test whether the addition of the k variables in Model 2 improve performance. Is simply using a Wald test on each of the added variables (with some sort of correction to account for the multiple tests) be valid? I've looked around here and on other places for an answer to this question, but I haven't seen anything conclusive.
