First of all, there is no such a thing as "uninformative priors" (we rather talk about "weakly informative" priors ), each prior brings some kind of assumptions into your model. On another hand, the more information does your data provides, the less influential your prior becomes . But taking this aside, with "uninformative" priors the point estimates from your model are the same as if you used maximum likelihood estimation (see this discussed for linear regression ). So why would we use Bayesian estimation with uninformative priors? Well, if you are interested only in point estimates, then it is basically the same. However with Bayesian estimation what you get is a posterior distribution of the parameters, so much more information than using maximum likelihood. This is the most elementary difference. There are more differences, but they all follow from the fact what we have a full probabilistic model and we would need a whole book to discuss all of them.
