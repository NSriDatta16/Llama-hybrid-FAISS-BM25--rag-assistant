IE 8 css comment question

Hello as always there are some differences with looks of websites in firefox and IE 8, now my problem is I have some paragraphs that are not properly aligned so I'd like to add some margin properties for them, the problem is that they are not found in the style sheet but in the head element of html within style tags ... how can I change this ?
