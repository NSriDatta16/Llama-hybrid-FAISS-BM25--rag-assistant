You ask: u'\u3053\n' Is it utf-16? The answer is no: it's unicode, not any specific encoding. utf-16 is an encoding. To print a Unicode string effectively to your terminal, you need to find out what encoding that terminal is willing to accept and able to display. For example, the Terminal.app on my laptop is set to UTF-8 and with a rich font, so: (source: aleax.it ) ...the Hiragana letter displays correctly. On a Linux workstation I have a terminal program that keeps resetting to Latin-1 so it would mangle things somewhat like yours -- I can set it to utf-8, but it doesn't have huge number of glyphs in the font, so it would display somewhat-useless placeholder glyphs instead.
