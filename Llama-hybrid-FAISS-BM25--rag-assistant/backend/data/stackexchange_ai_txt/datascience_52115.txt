Churn Prediction Model based on Customer Activities

I am new to data science, so forgive me if i have not done my research well. I want to build a system that calculates the churn scores for each customer and hence try to prevent it. I just want to test the concept, so result is not really important. The business was about sending newsletter to customer and receive ad revenue for it. The data We have customer activity like open emails, read emails, click emails, and that is about it. The idea is to look into the customer activity and see if we can identify if the customer is about to cancel the subscription. I have look into several classification models and wonder if there is a model that can look into the activities history, not just the current events. Any help will be appreciated!
