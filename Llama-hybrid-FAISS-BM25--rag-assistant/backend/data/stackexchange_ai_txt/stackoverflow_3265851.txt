I know that i can set a maximum value on this annotation, but does anyone knows if it is possible to set an unlimited max value? The max is an int and defaults to Integer.MAX_VALUE . And since the Java String API does NOT support Strings longer than Integer.MAX_VALUE characters (such a String would require more than 4GB of storage), this is coherent. And allowing a bigger size at the constraint level is definitely not . And by the way, an unlimited max value doesn't make much sense as "constraint". If you don't want to constraint something, don't define a constraint. As a side note, I suggest to use the standard @Size from bean validation instead of the @Length annotation from Hibernate Validator.
