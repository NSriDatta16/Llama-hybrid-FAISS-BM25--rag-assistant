ADDITIONALLY: $_SERVER also contains HTTP protocol variables, request headers in general, like those added by network devices [such as proxies, gateways etc], user-agents [browsers etc] and such... Since you can create your own custom protocol headers as well [those that start with "X-" prefix], the possibilities there are infinite. And of course, $_SERVER additionally contains certain server-specific variables as well, which can change in server-basis. If you learn a little bit about HTTP protocol, I am sure it will be much clearer to you.
