Interpretation and application of PCA - positive factor patterns for first component for all variables

I am attempting to reduce the number of variables in a dataset for regression purposes and I suspect that many of the variables are correlated. Hence, I attempt a PCA, which I must admit I'm very new at. The variables in question are a range of indices, all ranging from 0 to 100. After running PCA, I identify 3 components with eigenvalues greater than 1 (see results attached), with strong patterns for all variables in the first component. Now I'm unsure how to proceed when it comes to using this information to apply to my regression, notably if factor patterns are strong for all variables in the first component, does that render the two others meaningless? How do I use this information to limit the number of variables in my regression model and avoid collinearity?
