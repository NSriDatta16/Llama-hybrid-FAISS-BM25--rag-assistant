Not really programming related, but I found this on Google, there is not a direct keyboard shortcut , but makes it a little quicker. To enable or disable QuickEdit mode: Open the MS-DOS program, or the command prompt. Right-click the title bar and press Properties. Select the Options tab. Check or un-check the QuickEdit Mode box. Press OK. In the Apply Properties To Shortcut dialog, select the Apply properties to current window only if you wish to change the QuickEdit setting for this session of this window only, or select Modify shortcut that started this window to change the QuickEdit setting for all future invocations of the command prompt, or MS-DOS program. To Copy text when QuickEdit is enabled: Click and drag the mouse pointer over the text you want. Press Enter (or right-click anywhere in the window) to copy the text to the clipboard. To Paste text when QuickEdit is enabled: Right-click anywhere in the window. To Copy text when QuickEdit is disabled: Right-click the title bar, press Edit on the menu, and press Mark. Drag the mouse over the text you want to copy. Press Enter (or right-click anywhere in the window) to copy the text to the clipboard. To Paste text when QuickEdit is disabled: Right-click the title bar, press Edit on the menu, and press Paste.
