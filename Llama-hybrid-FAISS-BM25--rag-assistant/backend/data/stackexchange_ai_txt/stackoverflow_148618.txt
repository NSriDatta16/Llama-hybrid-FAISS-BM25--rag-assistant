To answer your question - it's not possible to instrument interop assemblies for code coverage. They contain only metadata, and no executable code as you mention yourself. Besides, I don't see much point in trying to code coverage the interop assembly. You should be measuring the code coverage of code you write. From the MDN forums thread you mention, it seems to me you actually want to measure how your code uses the COM component. Unless your code's goal is to enumerate and explicitly call all methods and properties of the COM object, you don't need to measure code coverage. You need unit/scenario testing to ensure that your code is calling the right methods/properties at the right time. Imho, the right way to do this would be to write a mock layer for the COM object and test that you are calling all the methods/properties as expected.
