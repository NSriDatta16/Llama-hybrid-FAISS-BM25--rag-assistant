snk vs. code signing certificate

In my organization we use snk files with strong names assemblies. We generate the snk ourselves. In addition we use a code signing signature on the binaries. We get the pfx from Verisign. What is the difference between these two processes? Isn't it a problem that the snk is not recevied from Verisign also?
