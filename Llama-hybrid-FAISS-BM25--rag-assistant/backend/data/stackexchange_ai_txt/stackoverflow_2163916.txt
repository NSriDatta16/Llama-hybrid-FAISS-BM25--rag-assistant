Column moved [finished] event in JTable

How should I detect that column moved action is finished in JTable? I've added columnModeListener to my column model but the problem is columnMoved method is called every time a column moves (by certain pixels). I don't want this behavior. I just want to detect when the column dragging is finished. columnModel.addColumnModelListener(new TableColumnModelListener() { public void columnAdded(TableColumnModelEvent e) { } public void columnRemoved(TableColumnModelEvent e) { } public void columnMoved(TableColumnModelEvent e) { //this is called so many times //I don't want this, but something like column moved finished event System.out.println("Moved "+e.getFromIndex()+", "+e.getToIndex()); } public void columnMarginChanged(ChangeEvent e) { } public void columnSelectionChanged(ListSelectionEvent e) { } }); I hope it is clear what I'm looking for. Thanks.
