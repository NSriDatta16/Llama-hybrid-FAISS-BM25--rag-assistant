How can I solve this classification problem?

I working with R on a classification problem. My outcome variable is binary with two levels 1 and 2. First of all I tried the logistic regression, which of all methods has the best performance, altough still poor. I tried nnet package, random forest, the fuzzy package frbs and decision trees. The nnet function gives me only one class - in this case 2. I had some hope with frbs package. See my code below: obj But the predictions are wrong, the class 1 is completely missclassified #percentage error tdef I'm wondering what I could improve to classify the output variable. Is something wrong with my data? Are the parameters not right? Can someone please verifiy? I'm at the end of my knowledge...
