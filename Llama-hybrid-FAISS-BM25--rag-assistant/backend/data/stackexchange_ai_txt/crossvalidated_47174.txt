How can you detect if a Gaussian process is over-fitting?

I am training a Gaussian process with an ARD kernel with lots of parameters by maximizing the marginal lielihood of the data, instead of cross-validation. I suspect that it is over-fitting. How can I test this suspicion in a Bayesian context?
