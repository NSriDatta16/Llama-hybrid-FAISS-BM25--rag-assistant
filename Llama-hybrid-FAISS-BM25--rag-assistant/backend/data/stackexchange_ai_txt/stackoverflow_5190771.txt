include file error?

I have these lines inside my code. I have also included the file in my header list inside my project. But when compile I got the below error. What is my mistake? #ifndef WIN32 # include # include # include # include # include # include # include # include #else # include "getopt.h" # include # pragma comment (lib, "wpcap.lib") #endif /* ^WIN32 */ Error 1 fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'getopt.h': No such file or directory c:\filetry.c
