The safest way to do this is by adding an HTTP header to your site: X-UA-Compatible: IE=EmulateIE7 not with the meta tag as mentioned in most answers. Note that the http header is set on a per-site basis rather than a per-page basis. This is because the meta tag does not alter the browser user-agent (which is obvious if you think about it - the user-agent has already been read by the time IE8 reaches the meta tag), which can cause browser sniffing to be incorrect. For example, the browser detection in YUI 2.7 incorrectly treats IE8 with the IE7 meta-tag as IE8, which causes problems. You can read more about the differences between the header and meta-tag approaches here
