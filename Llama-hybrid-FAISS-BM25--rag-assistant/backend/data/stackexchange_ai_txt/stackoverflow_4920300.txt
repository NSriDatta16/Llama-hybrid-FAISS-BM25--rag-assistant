Because an object with automatic storage * needs to be, well, automatically destructed. So the destructor needs to be available to call; if it's not, you can't have that type in automatic storage. Contrarily, it's up to you to delete it when you allocate it dynamically. You can, of course, not do so. *Objects here are, on "typical" platforms, commonly allocated on the stack.
