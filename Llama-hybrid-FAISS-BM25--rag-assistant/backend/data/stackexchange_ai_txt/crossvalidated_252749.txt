Metric to measure consistency (or randomness) of a group of time-series data

I have hourly time series consumption data of four customers namely ( F238, F262, F267, F264 ) for a complete month, plotted as Each line represents the consumption on a separate day. I want to find which among these customers is most stable/consistent in terms of repeating patterns across days and which among these is most random. Is there a specific metric which measures the randomness or shape consistency among different days of time-series data? On visualisation, F238 seems most consistent as compared to others because of consistency in patterns followed across days of a month, while as F262 seems most random because every day seems to follow a different pattern. Is there any metric which can summarise this observation, such that the metric output may vary between fixed pair of values (like [0, 1])?
