OpenGL API changes the state of the rendering context. A rendering context includes also the actual textures used for producing geometry fragments. If you enable texturing (i.e. *glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D)*), this is applied to all geometries drawn till this state flag is set. You can disable texturing using *glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D)*. Probably you do not disable texturing for other planes, indeed the texture is still applied to other planes. You should do something like the following: glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); ... DrawPlane0(); // This plane is textured ... glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); ... DrawPlane1(); // This plane is not textured
