How do you organize your RPGLE subversion repository on IBM i?

How do you organize your RPGLE subversion repository on IBM i ? I'm currently working in a travel business company that has a vast amount (about 13k) of RPGLE - sources for their in-house application and finally they want to use version control and adopt a more modern style of coding (the whole WDSC - RDi stuff). So my all-the-time-project is to sanify and modernize the whole coding process bit by bit. The open source subversion for OS/400 works like a charm with just 2 minor issues during install. I have a pretty good image in my head how it should work, but i think it breaks with some traditions, so i want your opinion. /subversion/repositories/{name of the in-house-application} /{project_a} /trunk /doc /sql /{a source file that is named like the project. i.e. project_a } /myRPGsrc.rpgle /myCLLEsrc.clle /myDDSsrc.dspf /myDDSsrc.pf /compile.clle .iseries_project_properties .project /branch /tag /{project_b} /global_stuff /nightly_build So the main difference would be not having different source files like QRPGLESRC, QCLSRC, QDDSSRC and the like and instead one sourcefile that contains all project sources and can be checked out as an WDSC-project. The project-sourcefile could also easily be named "src" like it is common on other repos, but in case some developers would want to check out multiple projects into /QSYS.LIB/SOMELIB.LIB/ they wouldn't have to worry about namespaces themselves. So what do you think? is it hybris? do you see problems? Do you have already some experience? please share! :)
