As also pointed out in the comments, $N$ is the number of terms (RVs) you sum, not the possible values that $X$ can take. For example, the number of possible values $X$ can take could have been infinite as well, as in geometric distribution. Basically, the statement means if you roll $N$ dice, on average, the sum will be around $7N/2$ where $7/2$ is the average of one dice.
