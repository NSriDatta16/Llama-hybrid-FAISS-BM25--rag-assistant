OpenSource Projects - Is there a site which lists projects that need more developers?

Do any of you know of a website which lists open source projects which are in need of help? Let me elaborate, I would like to work on another open source project (I already work on a couple), however, it would be nice to have a site which lists lots of OS projects, their aims, deadlines, workload, how many more developers they are in need of etc. Of course, I could just pick a topic I'm interested in, find an OS project and then work on it. However, it would be nice to see a diversified list of projects, primarily because some little known awesome projects get little attention and big projects such as jQuery forks, adium, gimp etc. etc. get a lot of attention because they are well known (and of course because they are great) and thus get a lot of developers working on them. It would be nice to see some little known projects getting more attention and thus hopefully drawing some people to work on them. Currently there are many websites hosting open source projects, such as github, sourceforge, google code etc. A website to centralise all of this into one place and categorise it would be awesome.
