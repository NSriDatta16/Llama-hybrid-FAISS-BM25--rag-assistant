Can we use both validation loss and cross validation at the on CNN?

I have seen that validation loss is used for avoiding overfitting of the training set and cross-validation is used for generalized the models' results. Are they use for similar purposes or results? If not, then how can I use both validation loss and cross-validation combined on CNN?
