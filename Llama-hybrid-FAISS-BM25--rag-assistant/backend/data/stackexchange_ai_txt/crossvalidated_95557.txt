You might instead analyze change in employment status (i.e. employed$_{t=2}$ - employment$_{t=1}$) as a function of educational attainment. Your outcome then becomes ternary ($-1,0,1$), because respondents can go from employed to unemployed, have no change in employment status, or become employed. So you would likely switch from logistic regression to either a contingency table test ($\chi^{2}$ test) or a multinomial-logit (polytomous) regression model. When using ordinal predictors such as educational attainment, I might start with some kind of generalized additive model/nonparametric regression approach to see if the relationship can be represented linearly (in my own experience using educational attainment I have found both saturation, and non-monotonic effects), or if you would be best off using some nonlinear function of educational attainment.
