OpenCV parameters of Random Trees

OpenCV provides an implementation of random forest named random trees and derived from a decision tree class. One parameter to train the random forest is the maximum depth, which in the provided examples is typically between 10 and 20. I learned that random forest is generally grown to its full depth and no pruning is done and, therefor, other random forest implementations do not provide a parameter of maximum depth. Why then, without consulting the source code, which might give the answer, does the OpenCV implementation provide this parameter and is it meaningful to limit the maximum depth in a random forest?
