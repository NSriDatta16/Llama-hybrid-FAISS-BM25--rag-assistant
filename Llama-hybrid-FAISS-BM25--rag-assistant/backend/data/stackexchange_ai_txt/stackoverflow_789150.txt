Is there a particular scheme you have in mind? "Identity-Based Encryption" is quite a broad term. But in any case, possibly you haven't seen so much attention because it's not cryptographically that special per se. General principles of cryptography will still apply, such as how many bits of entropy are there in the encryption key? what are the risks of collision attacks and other attacks based on having large volumes of plaintext/ciphertext if the same key is going to be used for an essentially indefinite period of time..?
