Can I use bayesian estimation for Linear Discriminant Analysis?

I was studying classification algorithm , LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis). In this, we have to estimate the mean and variance of predictors, given a particular class. Can I use Bayesian estimation procedure to estimate mean and variance from the data ? Just wanted to know, how much results vary when compared to when we use conventional estimates of mean and variance from the data and then using them for classification procedures. I am a beginner in this field, so pardon my naive question. Thanks
