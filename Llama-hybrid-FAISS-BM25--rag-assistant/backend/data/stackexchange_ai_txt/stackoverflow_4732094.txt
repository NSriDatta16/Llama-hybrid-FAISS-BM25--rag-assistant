'No method found' compiler warning for a method inside a #define directive

I have a method DoSomething() defined in my AppDelegate. This is the full implementation of my appDelegate: #import "SampleAppAppDelegate.h" #import #define DoSomething()\ NSConnection *conn = [NSConnection connectionWithRegisteredName:@"myConnection" host:nil];\ NSLog(@"Compiler seems to have found the class %@", [NSConnection class]);\ @implementation SampleAppAppDelegate @synthesize window; #pragma mark - #pragma mark Application lifecycle - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { // Override point for customization after application launch. DoSomething(); [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } - (void)dealloc { [window release]; [super dealloc]; } @end Although the implementation is working fine as expected (the log is recognizing the class) the compiler is displaying a warning: warning: no '+connectionWithRegisteredName:host:' method found Any ideas how I can solve this issue? How can I modify the implementation to get rid of the warning?
