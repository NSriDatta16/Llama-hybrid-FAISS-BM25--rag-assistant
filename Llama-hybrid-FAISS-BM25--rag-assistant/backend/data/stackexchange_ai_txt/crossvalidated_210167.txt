The problem of using only z-score to determine outliers is that if works pretty okay if your variables are independent but they show bad results when they have high correlation between each other. For example, in the plot below the blue circle is what you expect your normal data to be in. You have a new data plotted in green which you expect to be classified as an $outlier$. But according to a z-score analysis (plotted in pink) your new data is classified as $normal$. To avoid this problem of interpretation you can use Anomaly Detection Systems for giving better predictions or - if you have a lot of data on your outliers - you can use Logistic Regression so it can adapt to what you are looking for.
