Why is WordPress considered to be poorly programmed?

I'm not a fan of PHP or spaghetti code, or anything like that, but in my experience WordPress works amazingly well, it's well organized, and I've never come across any hard to understand code. The documentation is incredibly thorough, any security flaws are fixed within seconds, and it "just works". Not to mention that it does EVERYTHING, and it has an awesome plug-in system. Oh, and "the Loop" is awesome. I've never had any problems doing simple modifications to the code or to themes. Can you guys give any specific examples of what you don't like about it, or what you would have programmed differently? I just don't understand why it gets such a bad rap. I wish my own software worked as well and had as many features and looked as nice.
