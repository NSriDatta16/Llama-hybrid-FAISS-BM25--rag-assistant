I don't see the argument that Random Forest is less work than ARIMA. I would present RF is more work. Here is the process for ARIMA: 1. Detrend / transform your data 2. Test for stationarity 3. Run autocorrelation plots 4. Set your parameters for your model 5. Run a grid search if you want 6. Look at RMSE Here is the process for Random Forest: 1. You still have to transform your data 2. You still have to test for stationarity 3. You have to think about creating a bunch of useful features like season, time of day, t-1, t-7, t-14, split weeks, holidays, features that go into all machine learning models 4. Set up cross validation (train, test) 5. Optimize with gridsearch or kfold 6. Pick parameters, then run a model 7. Look at results
