Make an object searchable with array_search in PHP

I would like to make a class in PHP such as it would be searchable with PHP native method array_search . Currently my class implements IteratorAggregate and Countable , which allows me to do foreach on it. There is a couple of other SPL interfaces (SeekableIterator, ArrayAccess, etc...) which seems to maybe fit, but I would like to know if someone has already done this and which interface is suitable for what I want to do. Thank you
