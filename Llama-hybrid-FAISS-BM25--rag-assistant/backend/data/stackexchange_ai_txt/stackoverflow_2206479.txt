How does personalization happen of web page?

I just wanted to know how does personalization of a web page happen? How does the state of the web page get saved in database? which field does it use? I've used Asp.net Membership and in Asp.Net it's very easy just drag and drop and you see the magic. But sadly i am using Java and i want to implement this concept in Java. How can this be done? What is the basic idea behind it? and which field in database can hold such information certainly varchar can't :p
