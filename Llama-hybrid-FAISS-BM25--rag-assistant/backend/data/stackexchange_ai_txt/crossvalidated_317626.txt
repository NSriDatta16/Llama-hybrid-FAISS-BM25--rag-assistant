Residual plot for mixed model shows obvious trend

I have a paired data set where each subject has been weighed at the onset of an experiment and at the end. I am interested in how growth over time is affected by two crossed factors (feed and enrichment). I have 199 subjects that have all been weighed twice, so there are 398 observations. My initial model was: model1 Where va = weight, enrichment and feed are factors with two levels (dummy variables), time is also a factor with two levels and ID is subject ID. One problem with this model, as pointed out here , is that there are only two observations per subject, so I can't have both time and ID in my random specification. This can be solved using Ben Bolker's useful guide where he suggests taking time out of the randoms resulting in a model like this: model2 Summary: Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: va ~ enrichment * feed * time + (1 | ID) Data: welfare REML criterion at convergence: 1559.7 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.82014 -0.38182 -0.04042 0.37271 2.99733 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Clearly, the residuals for time 0 and time 1 are nothing alike. I expected them to differ, but also expected to account for this by including time in my error structure. Does anyone know how I might move forward? A MCMCglmm like this: mcmcglmm1 Spits out pretty similar results to the lme above, but I'm not comfortable with Bayesian modelling and it seems like a lot of work to learn only for this. Iterations = 3001:12991 Thinning interval = 10 Sample size = 1000 DIC: 1483.758 G-structure: ~ID post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp ID 1.689 1.171 2.235 862.6 R-structure: ~units post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp units 1.731 1.4 2.121 887.7 Location effects: va ~ enrichment * feed * time post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp pMCMC (Intercept) 3.7159 3.2064 4.2103 1000 The simplest solution I can think of, is to only have one observation per subject coded as proportional growth (weightafter-weightbefore)/weightbefore and get rid of random error completely. However, that seems defeatist, and I'd really like to know if I've misspecified the model and whether there's something else I should do. EDIT: Logged weights produce this plot: Certainly much better behaved. Hasn't substantially changed results, though they're slightly more similar to the MCMCglmm posted above.
