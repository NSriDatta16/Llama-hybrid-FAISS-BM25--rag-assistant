QLabel does not do this. But you can easily create your own widget containing a bit of text: class MyLabel(QtGui.QWidget): def paintEvent(self, event): painter = QtGui.QPainter(self) painter.setPen(QtCore.Qt.black) painter.translate(20, 100) painter.rotate(-90) painter.drawText(0, 0, "hellos") painter.end() Another option is to draw a QGraphicsView , you then have the liberty to map real widgets (i.e. a QLabel ) through any coordinate transformation.
