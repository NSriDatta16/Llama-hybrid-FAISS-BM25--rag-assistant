I'm not really getting what you want to do, if it is just logging into the site you can maybe do something like this: Mainsite : / logonto-other.html : Name Password This way the user will just be logged into the other site, your interaction abilities with it would still be limited (or should, I think, I never learned the same-origin policies as I have never felt that there is any restriction to what I do. Maybe todays browsers are stricter). About the "2 hop" thing, do you have a certificate and SSL/HTTPS support on your server A? Does server B have this? Do you think you can make the users trust you on having their password? One tip would be that you add a paragraph explaining the situation and a link there the user can contact site B to add pressure on them to implement OAuth and / or OpenID? It might be possible to path something up nicely, even if you don't have HTTPS on your server you can use JavaScript or an Java applet to encrypt the password (there has to be PGP in JavaScript somewhere on the net. Although, if the browsers addressbar turns green, the users have an easier decision whether or not to trust you. Would Like some answers to my questions, and can we be allowed to know what Site B is? And what exactly you try to do, maybe we can work this out together. Wish you good luck.
