A pasteboard is just a container for data in different types, so whatever you put on the pasteboard must be convertible to data in some type. What you need is to give each Person object an identifier of some sort and put that on the pasteboard under a custom type identifier of your own invention. Generally, such an identifier should be the bundle identifier of your application (which should be the reverse of your domain name plus your application name—e.g., com.example.surfwriter) plus the name of the type (e.g., com.example.surfwriter.tabstop). When receiving a drop, check for this type. If it's present, look up the correct object and do whatever you're supposed to with it. A drag from the table view to the same table view should implement this by moving or copying the object to a new row. Don't use the address of the object—i.e., the object itself—as its identifier. If the object dies (e.g., is deleted), the address will no longer be valid, or may refer to a different object (which may or may not be of the same class as the original object). Use something that you can look up and safely fail to find. This applies to cut/copy and paste more than to drags, but you can and should handle both with pretty much the same code.
