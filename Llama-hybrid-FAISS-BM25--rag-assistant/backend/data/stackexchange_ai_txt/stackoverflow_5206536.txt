Archiving project in Xcode incorrectly creates multi-application bundle

Archiving my project in Xcode is creating a multi-application bundle, instead of bundling my main target for release, which is what I want. Specifically, when I validate my archive in Organizer, it gives me the message: "[projectname] does not contain a single–bundle application or contains multiple products. Please select another archive, or adjust your scheme to create a single–bundle application." It sounds like there is some setting in the scheme that needs to be adjusted, but I can't figure out what's causing other targets to be included. I'm using Xcode 4.0 by the way.
