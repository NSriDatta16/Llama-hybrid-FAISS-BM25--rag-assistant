You might be able to use Dragon Naturally speaking for this, they have an SDK and an internet explorer plugin. http://www.nuance.com/naturallyspeaking/pdf/ds_DNS10_SDK_Client.pdf http://ct.scansoft.com/customerfiles/kbasefiles/3067/wp_DNS_HTML.pdf I think its designed primarily for traversing the web pages but if there is an option to handle custom voice commands then I dont see why you could not fill a text box with the command name for example. might not be able to provide what you need but certainly worth checking out if you have not already
