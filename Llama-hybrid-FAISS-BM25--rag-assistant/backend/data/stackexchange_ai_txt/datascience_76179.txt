Machine learning goal: given a population of 100,000 students, predict a group of 3,000, and minimize the median grade of that group

In other words, I am looking to predict students that will fail out of school before it happens. The data includes socioeconomic status and other related variables. I have tried an XGB binary classification (both tree and forest), but the problem is that it doesn't penalize severely wrong answers (predicting that a student will be in the bottom 3% in terms of grades, but they're actually A+ students). The result is that the average grades of the predicted students is quite low, but the median grades aren't actually that bad - there are a few extremely bad students that pull down the average but not the median. I have tried a XGB regression (both tree and forest), but the problem is that I can't get the model to focus on the bottom 3%. It seeks to reduce error for all predictions. I couldn't care less about telling the difference between an A student and a B student, I only need to consistently identify the bottom 3%ile. I was thinking that perhaps this could lend itself to reinforcement learning instead of supervised, but I know nothing about reinforcement... WOuld it be possible to make a reinforcement model where the goal is to minimize the median grades of the 3% of students predicted? Or are there any other machine learning techniques that would work?
