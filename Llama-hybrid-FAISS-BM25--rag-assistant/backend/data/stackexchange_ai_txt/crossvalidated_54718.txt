Logistic classifier is a linear classifier. It uses 'Least Square' to adjust the f(x) function, which classify the 2 class. Instead of predict the class, the classifier predict the probability of class Y being 1 with knowing X. In my problem, the Logistic regression model uses Newton algorithm instead of 'Least Square'. It builds a matrix to adjust the function. To classifying 7 class, it needs to have 7 logistic function, where each logistic predict the probability of one class. That's how I've got.
