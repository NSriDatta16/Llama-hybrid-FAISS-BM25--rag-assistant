Unsupervised learning outlier detection

I have a dataset that looks as follows userid⇥week1⇥week2 ⇥week3⇥week4⇥week5⇥week6⇥week7 1234⇥39724⇥34377⇥34377⇥38990⇥38298⇥39129⇥40500 2345⇥35960⇥39368⇥39368⇥39368⇥60732⇥37390⇥38836 3456⇥804⇥⇥938⇥⇥938⇥⇥938⇥804⇥⇥0⇥⇥974 4567⇥⇥5296⇥⇥4872⇥⇥4872⇥⇥4872⇥4176⇥0⇥0 here each row is the weekly consumption of electricity for each user, from this now i need to find the users who are having abnormal consumption suddenly, like those of users 3456 and 4567. i.e i need to classify them as outlier/anomaly, i came across certain algorithms like one-class svm for novelty detection but in the dataset as you can see itself has anomalous data also in them, so before actually applying the one-class svm i need to remove the possible anomalous data, is there any good algorithm that will identify them as outliers? Note:- i also have a dataset that shows daily consumption instead of weeks. Sorry for the way i have presented my data, i am new to this place.
