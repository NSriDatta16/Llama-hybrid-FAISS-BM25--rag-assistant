Initiatives to namespace PHP core and libraries

With the introduction of Object-Oriented and Namespacing capabilities in PHP, I am loving the new found cleanliness of PHP code that can be produced. The annoying thing though is that the core of PHP is still cluttered, unorganized mess of functions. Are there any initiatives to organize the PHP core and "common" libraries into namespaces and classes?
