I haven't had much luck with the \addtocontents mechanism. I have much better luck writing arbitrary LaTeX code to the .aux file. The examples are really too big to post in an SO answer, but you can find one in the noweb in the way "subpage labels" are handled, and you can find something similar in my technical report Teach Technical Writing in Two Hours Per Week , which accumulates some lists of principles and practices. The noweb source is public (and in Debian), and if anyone wants to the the other, send me an email. For stuff like this, I encourage you strongly to dig under the LaTeX layer and study The TeXbook by Donald Knuth. That's the place where the mechanisms available are really explained. If your list of tasks is really going to come at the end , you can avoid all the nonsense and just allocate a global tokens register which you accumulated throughought the document. You'll find some helpful ideas and examples in Appendix D of The TeXbook (Dirty tricks).
