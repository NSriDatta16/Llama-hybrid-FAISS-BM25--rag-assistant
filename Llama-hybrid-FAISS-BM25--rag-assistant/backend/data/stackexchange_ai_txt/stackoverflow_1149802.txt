Pythonic Swap of 2 lists elements

I found that I have to perform a swap in python and I write something like this: arr[first], arr[second] = arr[second], arr[first] I suppose this is not so pythonic. Does somebody know how to do a swap in python more elegant? EDIT: I think another example will show my doubts: self.memberlist[someindexA], self.memberlist[someindexB] = self.memberlist[someindexB], self.memberlist[someindexA] is this the only available solution for swap in python?
