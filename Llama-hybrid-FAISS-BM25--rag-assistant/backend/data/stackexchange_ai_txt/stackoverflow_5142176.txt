This will depend on the framework you are using for validating your models. So what you are asking is not possible without taking this into account. ASP.NET MVC by default uses a data annotations model provider which invokes the validation rules for data annotations and if you want to test this you will need to do a DataAnnotations.Validate in your unit tests or verify that your model is decorated with the proper attributes. Personally I use FluentValidation.NET which provides an elegant way for unit testing my validators so it is not much of a hassle.
