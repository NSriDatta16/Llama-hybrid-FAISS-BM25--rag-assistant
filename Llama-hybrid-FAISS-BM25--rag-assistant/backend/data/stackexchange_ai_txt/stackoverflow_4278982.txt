Is it possible that REMOTE_ADDR could be blank?

As far as I'm aware, the webserver (Apache/Nginx) provides the ( $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] ) based on the claimed location of the requesting user agent. So I understand they can be lying, but is it possible that this value could be blank? Would the network interface or webserver even accept a request without a correctly formed IP? http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php
