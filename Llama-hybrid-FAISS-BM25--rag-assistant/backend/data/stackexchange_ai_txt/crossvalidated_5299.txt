Data Augmentation Examples

I am looking for applied references to data augmentation (preferably with some written code). Either online references are books would be great. I found this book online: http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Missing-Data-Problems-Biostatistics/dp/142007749X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1291905761&sr=1-1 But with no reviews I am hesitant on purchasing it. Thanks! Edit: I have two variables X and Y. Let's say X follows a mixture of normals and there is a logistic relationship between X and Y. There is measurement error when observing X. We observe 100 X Y pairs and need to estimate the function between the two. In a book on measurement error (John P. Buonaccorsi) the author recommends data augmentation (I believe the introduced variables are the true X means) for estimation. However no details are given. I am looking for simple examples (R code but doesn't really matter) to get started.
