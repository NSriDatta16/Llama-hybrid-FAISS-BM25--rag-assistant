Python fCGI + sqlAlchemy = malformed header from script. Bad header=FROM tags : index.py

I'm writing an Fast-CGI application that makes use of sqlAlchemy & MySQL for persistent data storage. I have no problem connecting to the DB and setting up ORM (so that tables get mapped to classes); I can even add data to tables (in memory). But, as soon as I query the DB (and push any changes from memory to storage) I get a 500 Internal Server Error and my error.log records malformed header from script. Bad header=FROM tags : index.py , when tags is the table name. Any idea what could be causing this? Also, I don't think it matters, but its a Linux development server talking to an off-site (across the country) MySQL server.
