What is the difference between the average treatment effect obtained from Propensity Score Matching and the Hazard Ratios?

I performed a moderation analysis according to the point "moderation analysis" https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/vignettes/estimating-effects.html Now, I have found that my three subgroups that are evident in TG as well as CG apparently do not act as a moderator for my outcome as the pairwise comparison was insignificant for all of the combinations of the three subgroups that I have. I am wondering what this means.
