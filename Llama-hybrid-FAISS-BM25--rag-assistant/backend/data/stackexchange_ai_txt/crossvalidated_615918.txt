What is a Student-t VAE ? and how is it different from Gaussian VAE?

I am currently reading https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0374.pdf ,this is a research paper based on Student-t Variational Autoencoder for Robust Density Estimation , In this research paper, they told about a zero variance problem in Gaussian VAE's and proposed a new idea of Student-t VAE to overcome that problem , I read many online sources but most sources just state about the uses of Gaussian VAE's but no one stated anything about this problem , I am new to VAE's and Multivariate statistics , so it is a bit hard for me to understand the concept of Student-t VAE's and how it is overcoming the shortcomings of Gaussian VAE's . I have read and understood some parts but still some parts are unclear , I will appreciate if someone can help? Edit: I understood till the part of the zero variance problem like how Gaussian VAE's become unstable because of the variance term in denominator in the Lower Bound , we are trying to maximize but after that they started with a concept of conjugate priors like precision parameter has Gamma distribution as conjugate prior , from there how they reached to t-distribution and how they are going to use this in the VAE model , this I could not understand.
