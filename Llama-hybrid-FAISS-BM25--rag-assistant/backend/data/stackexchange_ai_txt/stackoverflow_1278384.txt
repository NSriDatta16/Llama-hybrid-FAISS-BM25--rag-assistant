Before you think about generating XML using string concatenation instead of a proper library, please go and read the XML specification . Pay particular attention to niceties such as charsets and character references. You can do it now. I'll wait. Now ask yourself - do you really want to have to ensure that your concatenated string is valid according to all those rules and write all the helper functions yourself, or do you want to use a well tested library where all that logic has been encapsulated for you? Good. Glad that's sorted.
