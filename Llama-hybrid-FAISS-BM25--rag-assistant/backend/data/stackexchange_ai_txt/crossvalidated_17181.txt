If you know that this is the exact pattern to expect, then you can look for this exact pattern, but then you will miss other patterns. So. If you know that the peak will be 150, then you could look for 2 or 3 or 4 or (however many) consecutive values of 150. But you say "or so" - how big is the "or so"? Perhaps the peak is defined as "3 consecutive values over 130" or maybe it's "3 out of 5 consecutive values over 140". That's for you to decide. On the other hand, if you are just looking for some general program to detect peaks - well, that's been looked at. There are a bunch of smoothing methods (e.g. loess, splines of various sorts, moving averages etc.). Not a field I'm expert in, but there's lots of literature on this.
