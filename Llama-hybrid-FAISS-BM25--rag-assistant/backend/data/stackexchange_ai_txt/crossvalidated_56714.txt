Closed form Karhunen-Loeve/PCA expansion for gaussian/squared-exponential covariance

The Gaussian, or squared exponential covariance is $k_{SE}(s,t) = \exp \left\{ -\frac{1}{2l} (s - t)^2 \right\}$. It is a common covariance function used in Gaussian processes. The Karhunen-Loeve expansion is an orthonormal decomposition of sample paths of a Gaussian process. If $g(t)$ is a sample path from a Gaussian process with mean 0 and covariance $k(s,t)$, then $g(t) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \xi_i f_i (t)$ where the eigenfunctions $f_i(t)$ are deterministic functions determined by $k$ and eigenvalues $\xi_i$ are the standard normals. My question is, does there exist a closed form expression for the $f_i$ corresponding to $k_{SE}$? According to [1], closed form expressions for $f_i$ are known for exponential covariances ($k(s,t) = \exp \left\{ -|s - t| \right\}$), band-limited stationary processes (finite sums of trigonometric functions), and Brownian motion.
