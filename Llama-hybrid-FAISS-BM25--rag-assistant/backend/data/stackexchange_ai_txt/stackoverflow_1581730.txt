AiVosto has a set of tools to visualize source code from many languages: Visustin. It is on the market since a long time. I tried it a very long time ago, was not 100% convinved. Maybe you want to give it a try and evaluate if it's worth the money for you. For me it was so that in order to understand some complex algorithm, I have anyway to experiment with it, having a graph helps a bit but as a coder you probably can visualize loops and decision trees well without software. I don't want to discourage you from using that, just try it out before investing money, having graphs is nice but shall also be useful.
