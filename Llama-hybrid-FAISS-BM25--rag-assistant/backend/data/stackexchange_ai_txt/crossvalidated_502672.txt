Can we calculate the correlation between 2 variables just from the correlations between subsets of the data?

If I have two variables X, Y and I already have correlations for subsets of the data that that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, can I compute the overall correlation directly from this? It seems intuitively we should be able to just take the weighted average correlation but Iâ€™m not sure this is totally sound. I have a feeling we probably need to have extra assumptions that the means and st.devs etc are constant among the different subsets?
