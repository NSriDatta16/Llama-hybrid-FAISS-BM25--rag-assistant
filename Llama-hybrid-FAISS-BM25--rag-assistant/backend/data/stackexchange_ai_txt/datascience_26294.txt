Ordinal Integer variable vs Continuous Integer variable

I am working on titanic dataset. I have one feature Pclass which I understand is an ordinal variable having values 1,2 and 3. I have created a new feature cabin_int from feature Cabin , which is essentially the number of cabins alloted to a passenger. So, it has values like 0,1,2,3 and 4. Now this new feature is not ordinal, it is just a continuous variable taking only integer values. My question is how does Machine Learning algorithm understands the difference between the two, if I pass these two columns ( Pclass and cabin_int ) as they are during training of my model? If some more feature engineering needs to be done, please tell.
