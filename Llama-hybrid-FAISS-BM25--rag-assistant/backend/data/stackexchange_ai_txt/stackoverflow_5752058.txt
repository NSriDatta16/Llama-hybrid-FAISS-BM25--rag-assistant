You need to make sure your connected device is provisioned through the iPhone Provisioning Portal. Check it's status by opening the Organiser in Xcode (Window -> Organizer) or press crtl + command + O. Your iPhone will have to have a valid provisioning profile on an active iPhone developer account in order for you to run your app on your device. However, running in Release mode and Device mode are different things, if you're trying to run in Device mode without a certified Device, that would cause this error. It wouldn't matter whether it was in Debug or Release mode though.
