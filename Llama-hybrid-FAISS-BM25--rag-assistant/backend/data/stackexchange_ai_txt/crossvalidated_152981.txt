In a logistic regression model, odds ratio provide a more coherent solution as compared to probabilities. Odds ratio represent the constant effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable. Here, being constant means that this ratio does not change with a change in the independent (predictor) variable. Odds ratio in this sense provide a much easier way of comprehending the marginal effects.
