By default, there is no guarantee because of possible padding. However, many compilers (at least VC++ and gcc) allow you to set the alignment of structures using a pragma, like this: #pragma pack(push, 1) template struct val2size { char placeholder[N]; }; #pragma pack(pop) Setting the alignment to 1 essentially prevents any additional padding at the end of the structure.
