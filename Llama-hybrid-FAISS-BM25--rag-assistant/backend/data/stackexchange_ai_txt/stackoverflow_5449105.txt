Deleting from Multiple Isolated Storages - windows phone 7

I currently have a itemsCollection and a historyCollection. Both are separate isolated .dat files. The saving and displaying works fine for both of these isolated storages, however the problem is when I try to delete something out of the itemCollection I also want to remove all the items out of the historyItemCollection where the historyItemCollection contains that specific itemIndex. Update: The itemCollection could contain something like this: a b c The historyItemCollection could look like this: a b c b So if I remove b (itemIndex 1) then I want both to be removed in the historyItemCollection. I can remove the items out of the itemCollection fine, but the historyItemCollection throws errors. int i = 0; for (i = 0; i The error message I'm getting: Parameter name: index It fails on this line: App.ViewModel.historyItemCollection[i].Remove(i);
