For Recursive Feature Extraction (SVM-RFE) the packages e1071 and Kernlab doesn't implement it i think. For the Weka SVMAttributeEval package is for Java i think, but the question was for R as i saw. The best way is trying to implement the SVM-RFE using e1071 and LIBSVM library I found a good parper relating that here .
