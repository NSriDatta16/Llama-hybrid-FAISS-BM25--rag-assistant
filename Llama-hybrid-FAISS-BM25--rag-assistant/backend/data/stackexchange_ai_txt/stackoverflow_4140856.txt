The current_user is request- or session- bound data, and I'd encourage you to keep it out of the model. That's really what the controller is for. However, it's not a bad idea to move it out of this particular controller if you feel like it's something that should be available in other places. In that case, you might move it up to ApplicationController, or better yet, a module that you can mix into this controller. You'd still need to separate out your @email_address -setting behavior from the decision about which email address to use, since setting that instance variable doesn't make sense in the model's context.
