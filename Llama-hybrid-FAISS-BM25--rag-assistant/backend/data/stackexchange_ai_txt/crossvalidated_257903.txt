Chapter 5 of Hugo Larochelle's course on machine learning ( video ) is the best introduction I've found so far. The derivative of the loss function is not derived in these lectures but it's not hard to do it (I can post a scan of my calculations if needed, but it's really not that hard). I'm still looking for a good textbook covering this topic but mainly there are only articles. There is a good overview of the articles in chapter 20 of Bengio's Deep Learning Book.
