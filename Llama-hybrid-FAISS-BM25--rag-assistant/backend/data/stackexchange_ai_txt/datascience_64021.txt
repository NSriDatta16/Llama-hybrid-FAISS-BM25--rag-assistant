There are multiple options, one can try and decide which suits your data best: Word Embeddings: Can use pre-trained models. Can train your own Word2Vec model on your domain-specific data Try to group different values: Rare words having very low statistical significance can be marked as other Try different clustering algorithms depending upon your data There might be other more efficient methods, will add those as well in case I find any. Thanks
