need some suggestions on my SVM feature refinement

I've trained a system on SVM,that is given a question,whether the webpage is a good one for answering this question. The feature I selected are "Term frequency in webpage","Whether term matches with the webpage title", "number of images in the webpage", "length of the webpage","is it a wikipedia page?","the position of this webpage in the list returned by the search engine". Currently,my system will maintain a precision around 0.4 and recall at 1.It has a large portion of false positive error(that many bad links were classified as good link by my classifier). Since the accuracy could be improved a bit,I would like to ask for some help here on considering refine the features that I selected for training/testing,could remove some or adding more in there. Thanks in advance.
