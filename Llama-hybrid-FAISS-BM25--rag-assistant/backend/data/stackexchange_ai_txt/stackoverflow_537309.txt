All bets are off concerning the higher-specificity rule because it targets the TD and not the SPAN. You gotta know when to fold 'em. :-) Edit You state in a comment that you are not seeing the concept mentioned here: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#cascade ...that's true. You'll find it a couple paragraphs up here: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#inheritance which states, "...If no color has been assigned to the [child element], the [child element] will inherit the color of the parent element ... When inheritance occurs, elements inherit computed values. The computed value from the parent element becomes both the specified value and the computed value on the child" In your example, inheritance principles don't apply since a CSS rule targets the SPAN element directly for the color property.
