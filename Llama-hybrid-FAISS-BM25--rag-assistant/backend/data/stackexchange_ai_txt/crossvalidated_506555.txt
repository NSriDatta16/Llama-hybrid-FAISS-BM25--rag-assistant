Imagine you estimate a probability that AC Milan beats Real Madrid and they have played 3 games in their current line-up. All 3 games were won by Real Madrid. Then a frequentist says that Milan can never beat Real Madrid, which makes no sense. A Bayesian might take a prior from the previous seasons, which would result in some positive posterior probability for Milan.
