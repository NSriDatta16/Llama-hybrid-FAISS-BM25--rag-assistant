Correlated Normal distributions

Consider a number $X$ being selected according to normal distribution $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}exp\left[-\frac{X^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right]$. Suppose the outcome is $X_1$. Then, a new number $Y$ is picked according to probability distribution $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}exp\left[-\frac{(Y-X_1)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right]$. Lets say it is $Y_1$. What can be said about the average of the quantity $(Y_1-X_1)^2$?
