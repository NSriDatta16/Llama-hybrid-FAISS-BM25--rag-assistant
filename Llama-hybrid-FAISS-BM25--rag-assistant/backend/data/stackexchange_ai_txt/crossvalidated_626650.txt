Why is this program not necessarily an MCMC?

In Chapter 1, Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo , Geyer writes Suppose you have a computer program Initialize x repeat { Generate pseudorandom change to x Output x } If x is the entire state of the computer program exclusive of random number generator seeds (which we ignore, pretending pseudorandom is random), this is MCMC. It is important that x must be the entire state of the program. Otherwise the resulting stochastic process need not be Markov. Why is this program not necessarily an MCMC if x is not the entire state of the program?
