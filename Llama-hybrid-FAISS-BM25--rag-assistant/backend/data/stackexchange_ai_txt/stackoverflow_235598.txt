I would think Godeke's robots.txt answer would be sufficient. If you absolutely cannot have the bots up your counter, then I would recommend using the robots file in conjunction with not not incrementing the clicks with some common robot user agents . Neither way is perfect., but the mixture of the two is probably a little more strict. If is was me, I would probably just stick to the robots file though, since it is easy and probably the most effective solution.
