What does "..[method of] training a deep autoencoder is to greedily pretrain the deep architecture by training a stack of shallow autoencoders" mean?

I am working a huge project, and one of the data pipelines I'm including will include a system of stacked autoencoders, the idea of which I got from a research paper I read recently. Since I'm preparing my whitepaper for the initial framework, I have been studying all the different things I need to understand deeply before beginning to code, and I stumbled upon this phrase in 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow et. al. and is the only reference I have read so far about deep or stacked autoencoders. So what exactly are they saying here as far as structure and methodology because I find the wording very confusing? Also, could someone please help me identify the differences between stacked autoencoders and deep autoencoders and any information you can provide on both.
