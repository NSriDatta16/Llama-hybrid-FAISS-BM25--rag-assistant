How to model an integer-valued (medical) score as response variable in regression

Here is the distribution of my response variable that I have to regress: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 11 15 2 9 3 7 7 7 6 5 7 1 Its a medical score that can take integer values from 0 to 24. The question is: what tool to use? I have the following options in my mind: Linear regression. The response is not continuous, and this scale doesn't seem to be fine enough to disregard this fact. Poisson (/quasi-Poisson/NB) regression. The distribution is not Poisson, and it is not supposed to be Poisson, as this is not count data, so this seems to be completely wrong. Logistic regression. Multinomial logistic regression is out of question with such low sample size, so proportional odds (ordinal) model seems to be the only possible option. This seems to be fine from 1 to 8, but I'm worried about 8-11-15, as the proportional odds model would consider these to be equal steps. Beta regression. Divide the values with 24 (the maximum that is exogenously known) and then regress them as proportions. Seems to be quite indirect solution... Binomial regression (with the denominator set to 24). I don't know how well the binomial distribution fits the data, beta distribution certainly looks more flexible, but at least I can use the original data, without transforming them. Beta-binomial regression. Just like binomial regression it requires no transformation of the data, but its functional form is more flexible (at the expense of an additional parameter to be estimated). So I'm stuck here. What is the best approach/what are the pros and cons of these approaches...? Or something else is the solution?
