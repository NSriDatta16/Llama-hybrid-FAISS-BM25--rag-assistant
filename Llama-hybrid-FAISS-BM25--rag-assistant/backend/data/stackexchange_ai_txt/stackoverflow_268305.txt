Figured this one out - when I started looking outside the code. Answer lies in resource configuration rather than access code. If you want to have the subject of the meeting reflect the original subject. Make sure the resource has set the setting properties DeleteSubject and AddOrganizerToSubject to false. It can be achieved with the following shell command: Set-MailboxCalendarSettings resourcename -DeleteSubject 0 -AddOrganizerToSubject 0 Regards Jesper Hauge
