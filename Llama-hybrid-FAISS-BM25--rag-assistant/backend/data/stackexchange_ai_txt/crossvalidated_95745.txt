There aren't much relevant statistics you can do with the highly aggregated data you have (especially since you don't have any measure of the variance within each time period), so given how you've described the course and problem I assume that the purpose of the question is not to perform a statistical analysis, but to use the summary statistics you've been given to make a decision. Unless you have more information, your best bet is probably to just schedule more nurses during the times when there are high numbers of patients admitted. If each data point is an average of over a thousand days, the Central Limit Theorem likely means that you can be fairly confident in the accuracy of those averages, unless the day-to-day variance is enormous or there's some trend on the scale of years.
