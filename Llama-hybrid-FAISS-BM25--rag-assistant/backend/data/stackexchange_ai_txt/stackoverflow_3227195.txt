What you need to do is, on mouse up start a timer the time should be retrieved from SystemInformation.DoubleClickTime , and do the click action on the timer tick (only if you didn't detect the double click in the mean time, obviously). Likewise use SystemInformation.DragSize to prevent accidental drag&drop. Note, the SystemInformation class is part of WinForms so you need to add a reference to System.Windows.Forms , this class will work just fine in WPF apps.
