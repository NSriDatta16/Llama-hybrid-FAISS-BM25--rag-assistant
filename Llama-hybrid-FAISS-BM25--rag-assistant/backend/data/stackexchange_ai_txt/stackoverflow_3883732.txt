You should also consider Xtify . Similar to Urban Airship, Xtify will save you time/effort/resources but should you choose to expand to other platforms beyond iPhone such as Android and Blackberry etc. which don't have native push support you can use one API's handle all of your notifications. Xtify also includes tools to allow you to easily leverage things like location, with your notifications or independently.
