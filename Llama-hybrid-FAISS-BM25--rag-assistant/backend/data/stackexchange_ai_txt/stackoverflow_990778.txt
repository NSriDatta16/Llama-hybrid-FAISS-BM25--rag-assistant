The problem in your code is that only one Toggled var is used for all three paragraphs. You can avoid using the variable at all. Use .toggleClass('readless').toggleClass('readmore').text($(this).text()=='read less' ? 'read more' : 'read less'); Haven't tested it, but something like this should do the trick.
