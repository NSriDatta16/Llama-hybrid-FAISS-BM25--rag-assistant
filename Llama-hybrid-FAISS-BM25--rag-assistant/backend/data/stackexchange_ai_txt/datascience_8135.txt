Is supervised machine learning by definition predictive?

I am trying to organize a cheat sheet of sorts for data science, and I am working with the basic distinction between description, inference, and prediction. As examples of the first I see unsupervised methods described, and for the last I see supervised methods. So my question is simply, do these two sets of categories align? Is unsupervised to supervised as description is to prediction?
