Basically it is just work as much as you can. 4-8 hours a day for 2-10 years, and I'm not kidding :) Here is a really short list for becoming a good php-programmer; Teach yourself object oriented programming Disipline yourself to organize your code in libraries and put them in directories Read about "Don't repeat yourself" and "Convention over configuration" on wikipedia Teach yourself Ruby (and/or Python) (yes, really), and use what you learn. Read about Design Patterns Google for phpdoc and phpcs and start using those tools. When you are finished with a piece of code write it again using what you've learned Follow the tutorials of some of the PHP Frameworks out there. Follow the tutorials for Doctrine when starting with a database centered project. Write enormous amounts of code, and wait several years before being satisfied with something you've written.
