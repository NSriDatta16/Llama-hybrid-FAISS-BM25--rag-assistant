Well, it doesn't sound like anyone else has thought of a better idea and posted it. I noticed our own Stack Overflow has the same behavior (at least on the Ask Question page), disabling the submit button, and when I clicked "Back", the button was still disabled. Maybe the best I can do is to leave it with the button(s) disabled, thus forcing them to refresh the page manually, or (hopefully) encouraging them to use the site navigation instead of the Back button where possible. If anyone else has any better ideas, though, I'm still open to them.
