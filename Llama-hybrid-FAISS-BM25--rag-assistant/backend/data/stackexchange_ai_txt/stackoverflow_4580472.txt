will work with HTML5?

I have these webapplications build in old style HTML, including [framesets] to speed up the GUI of the administration. Its not accessable by SEO etc. so thats not the issue here, it was all based on speed and minimizing reload at the time. Now we would like to transform these applications and have begun to investigate HTML5 for the purpose. Ofcause there is AJAX and db-storage etc. to speed up the interface with the new standards, but our question is really: is IFRAMES and FRAMESETS going to be removed from the HTML5 standard or will it be "allowed" but "less appriciated" ? Does anyone know whats going to happend?
