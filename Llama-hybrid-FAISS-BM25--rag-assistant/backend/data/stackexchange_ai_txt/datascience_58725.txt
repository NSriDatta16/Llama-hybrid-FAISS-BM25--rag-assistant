Where to find height dataset, or datasets in General

Hi there smart people, I am new to data Science and wanted to take my first few steps. Unfortunately I struggle to find datasets or any data at all regarding my topics of interest. For example, I wanted to build a simple program that takes a person's height and predicts the likely height of his/her child. (greetings from Galton) But even for this relatively famous topic I am unable to find data. Are there any good websited or something that list a lot of datasets for specific topics? A database of datasets, so to speak. I mean, I am on the Internet, it should not be that difficult to find some data ;)
