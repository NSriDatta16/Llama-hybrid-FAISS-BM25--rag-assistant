First of all, yes, you are correct in the way you are interpreting the fixed effects. However, note that we are only dealing here with fixed effects. Your model also has random effects, and in particular you have random coefficients for treatment which means that each subject has their own individual treatment effect. The calculations with the fixed effects therefore represent averages across all subjects. Although the findings are largely the same, I would present your findings based on the model with the interactions. We can view the model with no interactions with this plot: While the model with interactions looks like this: Formally, you can do a likelihood ratio test using the anova() function to test which model is better (you will have to re-run your models using the REML=FALSE option because likelihood-based methods cannot be used to compare models with different fixed effects). I would focus on treatment 3 being associated with higher values of amp.sqrt at time 7 and further at time 8, and these differences are also statistically significant at the 5% level. Treatment 3 is associated with lower values at time 6 (although this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level). Also, there is very little differences between treatments 1 and 2 at all time points (and these are also not statistically significant). Moreover there appears to be no time trend for treatments 1 and 2. You might be interested in a test of whether treatment 2 is different between years 6 and 8 since there is a small upward trend. Personally this looks negligible to me, compared with treatment 3 but if you wanted to test this you could use a post-hoc test such as Dunnett's.
