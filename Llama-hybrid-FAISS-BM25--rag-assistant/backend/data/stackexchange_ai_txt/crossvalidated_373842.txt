Since you mentioned Bayesian statistics, let me recommend Data Analysis: A Baysesian Tutorial by Sivia and Skilling to you. I am reading it myself at the moment and find it fantastic. The book really helps in understanding the big picture of (Bayesian) probability theory. Also it finally links together all the divergent pieces of information that I had accumulated but never really understood in statistics classes. It has just the right amount of mathematical rigor and practical application. I could go on, give it a try! Here is what the book says about itself: Statistics lectures have been a source of much bewilderment and frustration for generations of students. This book attempts to remedy the situation by expounding a logical and unified approach to the whole subject of data analysis. This text is intended as a tutorial guide for senior undergraduates and research students in science and engineering. After explaining the basic principles of Bayesian probability theory, their use is illustrated with a variety of examples ranging from elementary parameter estimation to image processing. Other topics covered include reliability analysis, multivariate optimization, least-squares and maximum likelihood, error-propagation, hypothesis testing, maximum entropy and experimental design.
