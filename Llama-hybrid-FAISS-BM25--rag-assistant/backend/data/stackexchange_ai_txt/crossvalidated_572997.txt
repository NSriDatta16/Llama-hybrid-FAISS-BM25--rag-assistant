Unfortunately, there are not yet selection models that accommodate multilevel meta-analysis nor, indeed, many other forms of dependent or clustered effect sizes. This is an active area of research. A good review, with simulation results, on this topic is: Rodgers, M. A., & Pustejovsky, J. E. (2021). Evaluating meta-analytic methods to detect selective reporting in the presence of dependent effect sizes. Psychological Methods, 26(2), 141. This issue actually raises some fairly deep questions about what assumptions should be made on the selection process for a multilevel meta-analysis: for example, if papers contribute multiple point estimates, on which estimate(s) does selection operate? The estimate in the abstract? The average of all the estimates? Or...? There's still much work to be done.
