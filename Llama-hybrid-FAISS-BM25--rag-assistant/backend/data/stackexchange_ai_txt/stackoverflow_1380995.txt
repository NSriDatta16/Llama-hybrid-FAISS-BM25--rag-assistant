Save email after modification

I have code, similar to the following, that I would like to modify: Sub SendEmail() Dim myOlApp As Outlook.Application Dim myItem As Outlook.MailItem 'Create an Outlook application object Set myOlApp = New Outlook.Application 'Create a new MailItem form Set myItem = myOlApp.CreateItem(olMailItem) 'Build and display item With myItem .To = “test@test.com” .Subject = “Test Subject” .HTMLBody = “Test Body” .Display .SaveAs “C:\Test.msg”, olMSG End With End Sub This code is called from various buttons throughout the application. When a button is clicked, a new email is created and saved. Unfortunately, the email is saved as soon as it is created and BEFORE it is sent... so, if any modifications are made to it, they will not be in the saved version. What can I do to modifiy this code to ONLY save the email once it has been sent? Feel free to ask any followup questions as necessary and I will respond as best I can. Thanks! Robert
