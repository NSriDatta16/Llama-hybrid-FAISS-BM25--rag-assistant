It's not precisely an answer, but it's the closest I got -- I asked in #hbase on irc.freenode.net yesterday, and one of the Cloudera employees responded. The "Input Splits" problem I'm having with Pig is specific to Pig 0.7, and Pig 0.8 will be bundled with Cloudera CDH3 Beta 4 (no ETA on that). Therefore, what I want to do (easily write M/R jobs using HBase tables as both sink and source) will be possible in their next release. It also seems that the HBaseStorage class will be generally improved to help with read/write operations from ANY JVM language, as well, making Jython, JRuby, Scala and Clojure all much more feasible as well. So the answer to the question, at this time, is "Wait for CDH3 Beta 4", or if you're impatient, "Download the latest version of Pig and pray that it's compatible with your HBase"
