What browsers currently support JavaScript's 'let' keyword?

I'm developing an app and don't have to ever worry about Internet Explorer and was looking into some of the features present in A+ grade browsers that aren't in Internet Explorer1. One of these features I wanted to play around with is JavaScript's let keyword I can't seem to get any of their 'let' examples to work in Firefox 3.6 ( User-Agent string: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)). I get SyntaxError: missing ; before statement when executing let foo = "bar" . So, what browsers support the let keyword? (Or am I doing something wrong?)
