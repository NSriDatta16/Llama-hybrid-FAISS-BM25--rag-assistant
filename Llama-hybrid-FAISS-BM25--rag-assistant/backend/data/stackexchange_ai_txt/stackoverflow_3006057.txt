Advantages of C++/OO data structures: Natural grouping of data structure with methods that manipulate the structure. Much more natural names for methods/functions dealing with the data-structure: e.g. push() and pop() rather than some artificial namespace-embedding function names. Compiler-checked protection of data structures. Inheritance - deal with any iterable sequence.
