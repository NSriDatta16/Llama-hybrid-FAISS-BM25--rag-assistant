You have to go with your buttons location in the dom, such as Close $('.dialog .close').click(function() { var $button = $(this); // now we have a reference to the button $button.parents('.dialog').dialog('close'); //find the dialog div up the DOM tree and close it }); In summary, you need to leverage the use of this to get the current item and get its parent dialog.
