Non-monotonicity under Bayesian dynamic borrowing

Dynamic borrowing refers to the idea that information from different data sources can be shared within the Bayesian framework based on their observed similarity. Kopp-Schneider et al. (2020) mention that "in case of dynamic borrowing, the posterior probability is not necessarily a monotonically increasing function of [the number of responses]". From this, counterintuitive decision may arise - Kopp-Schneider et al. show an example for the binomial case with $n=40$ and dynamic borrowing from an external source where the rejection region is $C=\{12\} \lor \{16,...,40\}$ , i.e. the null hypothesis would be rejected if 12 responses are observed but not if 13 responses would be observed. Although this phenomenon seems logical (since less similarity means less borrowing and hence less power), the decisions arising from this are for surely not intuitive and probably undesirable in practice. I am suprised that this was the first time that I have read about these counterintuitive decisions under dynamic borrowing. Does there exist a generalization of this issue and have solutions been offered? Kopp‚ÄêSchneider, Annette, Silvia Calderazzo, and Manuel Wiesenfarth.
