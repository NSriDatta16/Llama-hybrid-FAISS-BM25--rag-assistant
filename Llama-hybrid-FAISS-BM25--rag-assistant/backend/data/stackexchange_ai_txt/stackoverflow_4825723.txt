QScrollArea - how to enable touch interactions to scroll to next item?

I'm using the Nokia Qt SDK and designed a small banner carousel in the top area. It looks like this: The hierarchy looks like: After installing this in the emulator, I try to make it scrollable (flinging). It's a simple task I would guess (like ScrollView in Android, or UIScrollView in iOS), but so far no joy. All links in the internet point me of custom scroll implementations etc etc. which I don't want to do nor expect to do as Qt should be a higher level framework? What is the state of the art here? ;-) Question in short: How can I make this QScrollArea respond to touch (fling, scroll, drag etc) events and reveal the other widgets in the queue? I'm not expecting it to be able to "snap" into a child widget (which is another requirement later ;)).
