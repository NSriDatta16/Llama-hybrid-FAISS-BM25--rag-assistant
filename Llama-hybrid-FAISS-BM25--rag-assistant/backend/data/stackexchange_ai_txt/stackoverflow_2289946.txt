If you are properly using cURL with curl_multi_add_handle and curl_multi_select there is no much you can do. You can test to find an optimal number of handles to process for your system. Too few and you will leave your bandwidth unused, too much and you will loose too much time switching handles. You can try to use master-worker multi process pattern to have many script instances running in parallel, each one using cURL to fetch and later process block of pages. Frameworks like http://gearman.org/?id=gearman_php_extension can help in creating elegant solution but using process control functions on Unix or calling your script in the background (either via system shell or over non-blocking HTTP) can also work well.
