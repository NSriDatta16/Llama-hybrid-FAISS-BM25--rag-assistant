Broad question, but I certainly think that a knowledge of finite state automata and hidden Markov models would be useful. That requires knowledge of statistical learning, Bayesian parameter estimation, and entropy. Latent semantic indexing is a commonly yet recently used tool in many machine learning problems. Some of the methods are rather easy to understand. There are a bunch of potential basic projects. Find co-occurrences in text corpora for document/paragraph/sentence clustering. Classify the mood of a text corpus. Automatically annotate or summarize a document. Find relationships among separate documents to automatically generate a "graph" among the documents. EDIT: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a tool that has grown considerably in popularity due to its simplicity and effectiveness. It's easy to understand. I currently research the use of NMF for music information retrieval; NMF has shown to be useful for latent semantic indexing of text corpora, as well. Here is one paper. PDF
