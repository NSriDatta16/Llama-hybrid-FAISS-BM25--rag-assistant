I've always solved this by having a Partial View which loops over an IEnumerable and calls Html.DisplayFor() on each item, but then I didn't even know you could call Html.DisplayFor() on an IEnumerable and have it automatically render each templated element until you said so in your question. Thanks for that, by the way! :) In any case, I think your best bet is to simply return a PartialView() which accepts a collection of Employees and renders them one at a time calls Html.DisplayFor() . It's not as elegant as returning an HtmlHelper from your controller, but at least it's simple enough to implement.
