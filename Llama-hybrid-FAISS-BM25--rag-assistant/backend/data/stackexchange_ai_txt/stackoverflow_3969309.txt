Mogens Norgaard used to joke about "single node RAC" but now it actually exists! Basically, One Node is running a RAC database on a single server, rather than across a cluster of servers. There is an Oracle white paper on the topic. Find it here. The money quote is: "Oracle RAC One Node enables: • Better server consolidation • Enhanced protection from failures • Greater flexibility and workload management • Better online maintenance In addition it allows customers to virtualize database storage, standardize their database environment, and, should the need arise, upgrade to a full multi-node Oracle RAC database without downtime or disruption."
