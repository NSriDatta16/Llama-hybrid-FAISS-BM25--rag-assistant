I'm a bit confused as to how you are attaching the script.as to the swf. Classes in AS3 must be in a file with the exact same name as the class name - so your file should be named MyClass.as as a first point. The second question is what is myfan exactly? Is it a symbol in your library? What does that symbol contain? What happens if you drag the symbol onto the stage instead of trying to instantiate it using ActionScript? Finally, if you are instantiating MyClass where are you doing so? On the first frame of the movie within the timeline? I notice that you aren't adding the variable trying onto the display list at any time .... that would mean the variable stage might be null. Try adding: public function create() { target = new myfan(); target.x = 400; target.y = 50; trace("Stage here?:", stage); stage.addChild(target); } To see if you get anything.
