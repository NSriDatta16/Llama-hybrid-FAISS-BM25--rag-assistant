Python Regex to parse apart Blackberry browser user agent

I need to parse apart blackberry browser user agents so I can get what device and version it is using python 2.5. For example: BlackBerry9630/4.7.1.65 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 VendorID/-1,gzip(gfe),gzip(gfe) In the above user agent I would like to gather the following groups: Browser: Blackberry Device: 9630 Major Version: 4 Minor Version: 7 The rest of the info I don't care about. Here is another example: BlackBerry9530/5.0.0.328 Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 VendorID/105,gzip(gfe),gzip(gfe),gzip(gfe) Browser: Blackberry Device: 9530 Major Version: 5 Minor Version: 0 I'm horrible at figuring out regex and any help would be great. Thanks
