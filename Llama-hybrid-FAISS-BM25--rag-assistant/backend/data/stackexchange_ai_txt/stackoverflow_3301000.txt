Using breakpoints will invalidate the User Initiated action which Silverlight requires in order to increase the storage quota and will not increase the size when the call is made. Remove the breakpoints as advised and see if that solves your problem. Using Debug.Writeline shouldn't cause a problem though. I tested my working code with them and it fired just fine. My code is lifted from here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc265154(VS.95).aspx The section I've taken is the IncreaseQuota_OnClick and referenced that from my button. There's some other good methods in there too.
