A logistic regression shouldn't have constant variance. As far as I've seen (but please correct me if I am mistaken), Breusch-Pagan is for linear regression, not logistic regression. It looks to me like ?bptest has the same view. A version of the test could probably be developed for logistic regression, but it would be testing a different hypothesis than homoskedasticity vs heteroskedasticity (you'd test whether there was deviation from the particular variance assumption in logistic regression).
