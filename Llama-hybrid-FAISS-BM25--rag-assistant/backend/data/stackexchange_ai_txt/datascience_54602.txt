Implication of a dominant Principal Component in PCA analysis

I need help, are there any practical implications of a dominant principal component. For example, if of three PCs, PC1 explains almost 100% of the variance in this dataset, What does this mean in practical terms? or what does it say about the dataset? Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks!
