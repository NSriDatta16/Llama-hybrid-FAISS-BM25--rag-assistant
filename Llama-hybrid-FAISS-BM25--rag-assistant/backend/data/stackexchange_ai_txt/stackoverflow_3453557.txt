How to build an iPhone app for distribution on the clients account?

I've developed a small app for my client which is supposed to be released under one of their brand names. They've created an iPhone developer account to be used for this purpose. So far, for testing I provided them with ad hoc distributed builds using my own developer account. But how do I proceed about building their app store distribution build? It is my understanding (from what I read in the "Program User Guide" on the provisioning portal) that only the team agent is able to create distribution certificates and build for distribution on behalf of his account. So, even if they add me as team member or team admin to their team, the team agent (one of my clients employees) would still need to do the final build. However I don't want to provide them with the projects source, it's not part of the deal and none of their staff have the knowledge to actually build something in xcode - they're not even using macs. So, how do I build an app for distribution via an account that is not mine, without surrendering my source?
