There is an overhead of lazy structures (pmjordan's answer is great for giving you the gory details.....). My very rough estimate is that you pay a 2-5x penalty. However, there are also some upsides: Lazy evaluation means that your working set of data may be smaller, since it is only created when needed. This may improve your cache utilisation and hence performance in some cases Lazy evaluation helps you write simpler, cleaner code. So you can focus your attention on writing better algorithms. The benefit from having a better algorithm (e.g. O(n log n) vs O(n^2)) may be worth a lot more than the overhead of lazy evaluation My advice would be to use lazy evaluation freely unless you are sure you are in a situation where you really need high performance and can't afford the overhead (e.g. image processing or something like that....)
