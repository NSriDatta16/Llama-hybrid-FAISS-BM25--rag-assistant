The sample size of the two populations can be easily taken into account when comparing them. If you are looking to compare some kind of sample average (pay per session etc.) then you can use t-test. Use the formula for unequal sample size and unequal variance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Equal_or_unequal_sample_sizes.2C_unequal_variances . Do make sure you understand the assumptions and they are met for your analysis.
