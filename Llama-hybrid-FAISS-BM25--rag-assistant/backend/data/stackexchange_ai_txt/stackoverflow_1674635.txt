Best way to find illegal characters in a bunch of ISO-889-1 web pages?

I have a bunch of html files in a site that were created in the year 2000 and have been maintained to this day. We've recently began an effort to replace illegal characters with their html entities. Going page to page looking for copyright symbols and trademark tags seems like quite a chore. Do any of you know of an app that will take a bunch of html files and tell me where I need to replace illegal characters with html entities?
