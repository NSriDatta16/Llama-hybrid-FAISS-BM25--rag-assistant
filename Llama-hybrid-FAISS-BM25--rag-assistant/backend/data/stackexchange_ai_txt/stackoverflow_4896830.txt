hey dominic your answer was nice but if your have a site like http://localhost/project/index.php the 'project' link gets repeated since it's part of $base and also appears in the $path array. So I tweaked and removed the first item in the $path array. //Trying to remove the first item in the array path so it doesn't repeat array_shift($path); I dont know if that is the most elegant way, but it now works for me. I add that code before this one on line 13 or something // Find out the index for the last value in our path array $last = end(array_keys($path));
