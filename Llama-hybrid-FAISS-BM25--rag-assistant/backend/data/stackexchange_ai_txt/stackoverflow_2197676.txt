Change dragging object and restore it after dropping it

please help me, I know in general how to use the draggable and droppable classes, but I can not find a way to achieve this: I have a large-sized image that I need to drag and drop into a div. 1) while dragging, instead of moving around the large-sized image, I want to use a small-sized image (I already have it, just need to change the src). 2) Once it reaches the target div, I would like to hide that dragged image and show again the large-sized image in its original place. The only restriction is: "revert: invalid" must apply. This is my code: $("#big_img").draggable({ revert: 'invalid', drag : function(e, ui){ //Change big image with a small version of it $(this).attr("src").replace("/Large/","/Small/"); // Thank you.
