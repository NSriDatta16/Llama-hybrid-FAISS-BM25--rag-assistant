It sounds like there's a time-series relationship to your data. XGBoost is not generically able to solve time-series problems (but perhaps someone has figured out a clever way to do so -- I don't know). Perhaps a better solution would be to use an actual time-series model. Either way, the samples with 2 actions reflect dependence among your observations, whether or not that dependence is time-series in nature. XGBoost is not configured to natively fit dependent data structures. Another possibility is that you need to tune your hyper-paraemters. The additional data might benefit from a different configuration, and this might influence your model fit.
