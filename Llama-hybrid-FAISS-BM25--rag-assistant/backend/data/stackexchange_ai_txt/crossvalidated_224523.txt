This is simply what the lag operator does - it operates on the time series by shifting the index one period back - it is defined as $Lx_t\equiv x_{t-1}$. The lag operator behaves very much like a regular operator. For instance, $$L^kx_t=L^{k-1}Lx_{t}=L^{k-1}x_{t-1}=x_{t-k}$$ More generally, $$ (aL^k+bL^m)x_t=ax_{t-k}+bx_{t-m} $$ You will thus get different results if the lag operators are additionally multiplied by different coefficients. Zero or negative powers are also legitimate, $L^0x_t=x_t$ and $L^{-j}x_t=x_{t+j}$. Some polynomials in $L$ carry a special name. The difference operator $\Delta\equiv1-L$ is a prominent example. Powers of functions of $L$ work perfectly analogously. E.g., the double difference operator $\Delta^2=\Delta\Delta=(1-L)^2=1-2L+L^2$.
