Easy way of indicating the likelihood of a text?

I am trying to find out a simple way of quantifying "how much sense a text paragraph makes" . The measure is not necessarily fail-proof, but it has to be somewhat simple. One example measure that meets my need is defining the likelihood of a text paragraph as $L=P(l_2\mid l_1)\cdot P(l_3\mid l_2)\cdot\ldots\cdot P(l_n\mid l_{n-1})$, where $P(l_2\mid l_1)$ stands for the probability of the second letter $l_2$ comes right after the first letter $l_1$, and $n$ is the total number of letters in a sentence. There are definitely flaws in this definition of likelihood, but it is simple and thus favored in my applicaiton. What are some other comparatively easy measures that you have in mind?
