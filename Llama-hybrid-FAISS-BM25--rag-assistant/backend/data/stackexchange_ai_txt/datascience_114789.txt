Before testing on 1200+ timesteps, you should test on 100 or 200 timesteps (with sampling or deducing data), because ARIMA have logical constraints. Then, I suggest to use a simpler model of ARIMA with few parameters before increasing complexity. If your data is known to have important noise (ex: stock markets), data smoothing could be interesting to improve predictions. model = ARIMA(df, order=(2,1,2)) results = model.fit(disp=-1) Note: LSTM is able to memorize more data than ARIMA. https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-part-19-time-series-and-autoregressive-integrated-moving-average-model-arima-c1005347b0d7
