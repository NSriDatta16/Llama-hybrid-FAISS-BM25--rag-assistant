Couple of options: Grizzly for embedding a generic server (http://grizzly.java.net/) Mina is another similar option (http://mina.apache.org/) Instead of Telnet, it might be easier to just embed a web server. Not that a CLI isn't cool and all, but it might be a bit easier/more friendly. Jetty http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Embedding+Jetty Tomcat http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/catalina/docs/api/org/apache/catalina/startup/Embedded.html JMX is great for monitoring but the UI isn't very good for 'writing' data. NetBeans has some nice tutorial projects in it. I think of all of the options above the embedded Jetty is probably the easiest.
