FYI, if you have joins, select * is especially to be avoided as it wastes server and network resources especially since all join fields have the same information. Junk coding like "select *" creates performance problems that become very difficult to fix when every query in the system is poorly written. I know in SQL Server you can drag the columns over from the object browser, wouldn't be surprised if ORacle had something similar. In addition select * can create many, many later bugs as the data tables change. It is poor practice to not name your columns in the specific order you want them.
