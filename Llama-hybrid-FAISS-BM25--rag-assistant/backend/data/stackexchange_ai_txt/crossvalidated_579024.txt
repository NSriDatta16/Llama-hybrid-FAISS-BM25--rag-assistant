I understand that your problem is that your dataset is a time series but that you are not interested in making forecast (i.e. making prediction of future state from past state). In this case, you should avoid random shuffling in your cross-validation because it may lead to overfitting. Indeed, you would have points in your testing set that are surrounded by points in your training set. Therefore, the performance of your model would be unrealistically high. The scikit-learn user guide has an interesting note about this : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#a-note-on-shuffling
