Good question. My quick answer: CouchOne is lead by Damien Katz, the originator of the CouchDB Apache project. CouchOne is now focused squarely on scaling couchdb down to run efficiently on mobile devices. The goal is to leverage the p2p replication model of CouchDB to solve the sync problem on mobile. Cloudant is founded by 3 PhD's from MIT with big-data backgrounds. Cloudant is focused squarely on scaling CouchDB up (see the open-source bigcouch project) to power data-intensive applications in the cloud. Cloudant provides scalable data as a service for high-rate, large volume online transaction processing, search and analytics. Thus there is a real opportunity to see the CouchDB API flourish at two tremendously different scales to provide the application developer a single platform that runs on the mobile and in the cloud, with seamless data (and CouchApp!) migration between the two.
