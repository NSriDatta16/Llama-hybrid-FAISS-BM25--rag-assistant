Testing for Significance - Should t-test be used or paired t-test

Let's say there are 100 stock exchanges on which I trade stocks and the cost of me trading has the averages below Average Cost to Trade Exchange1 .23 Exchange2 .34 Exchange3 .10 .... ..... Exchange100 .025 Someone asks me "Are those numbers statistically significant"? Each average is calculated from the distribution of costs on each exchange. I was thinking of doing 100 t-tests with the null hypothesis that the mean is 0 and alternative that the mean is not 0. If the p-value Is that the approach to take when trying to answer "Are those numbers statistically significant"? Should I be doing paired t-test? Thank you.
