Not true. The data for logistic regression is binary 0 or 1 but the model predicts p say the probability of success given the predictors $X_i$, $i=1,2,..,k$ where $k$ is the number of predictor variables in the model. Actually because of the logit function the linear model predicts the value of log($\frac{p}{1-p}$). So to get the prediction for p you just do the inverse transformation $p=\frac{\exp(x)}{[1+\exp(x)]}$ where $x$ is the predicted logit.
