I am no expert, but I think you must calculate the gradient of the loss function wrt the inputs. This would tell you the relative importance of each input for classifying a specific training example. To get a measure of importance of an input for the whole training set you could take the average of these gradients across all examples in the training set. Or it might be better to take the MAX of the gradients (a low value would mean an input never had much effect).
