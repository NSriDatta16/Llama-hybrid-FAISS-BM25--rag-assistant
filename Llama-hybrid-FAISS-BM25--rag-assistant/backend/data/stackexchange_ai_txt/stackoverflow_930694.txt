Not having a unique identifier for each row is even worse than it first seems. Sure, it is precarious and it's easy to inadvertently delete some rows. But performance is much worse too. Each time you end up asking the database to get you the rows for Employees with EmployeeType = 'Manager' you are doing a string comparison. Identifiers are just faster and better. Besides, storage is cheap and in this case I imagine the impact on space will be less than a quarter percentage point if that--as a data warehouse you are probably designing for terabytes of data.
