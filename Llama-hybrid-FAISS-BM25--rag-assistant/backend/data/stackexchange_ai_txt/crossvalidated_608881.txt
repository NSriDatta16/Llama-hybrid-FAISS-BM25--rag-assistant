How to interpret elpd_diff of Bayesian LOO estimate in Bayesian Logistic Regression

I have conducted a Bayesian Logistic regression, and I would like to compare 2 models : one model with one continuous predictor (M1) and one model without predictor (M0). The outcome is a binary variable. I have used LOO estimated of brms package. I find following results : Model comparisons: elpd_diff se_diff (M1)Bayes_Model_Binary 0.0 0.0 (M0)modelLOO -0.4 1.3 But how can I interpret that ?
