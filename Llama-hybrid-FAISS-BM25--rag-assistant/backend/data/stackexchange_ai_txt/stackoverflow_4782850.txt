You aren't supposed to organise your application as views that you add on top of one another. A more typical way of organising your application is to split the different screens into different view controllers and use a UINavigationController to navigate between them. If you just lump all your code together into a single view controller and manually add and remove views, you're going to get into a mess very quickly. I strongly recommend reading View Controller Programming Guide for iOS .
