Is there a tool that can tell me how a subset is different from a whole (in terms of features)

Is there a tool/technique where we can specify a subset of tuples (of feature values that are real numbers) from an overall set and ask how this subset could be anomalous? (i.e., what are the key feature values that distinguishes this subset, and how) For example: Feature average F1 in subset is 2 stddev higher than in overall set Another exmaple: 40% of F2 values are non-zero in subset, but only 10% are non-zero in overall set. etc. ...
