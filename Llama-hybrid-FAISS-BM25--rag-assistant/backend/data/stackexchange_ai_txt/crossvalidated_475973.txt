Bayesian inference with an arbitrary prior

A classical problem in Bayesian inference arises when we wish to learn about (say) the fraction $\theta$ of balls in an urn that are white; and do so by sampling from the urn with replacement. In such a situation, the likelihood of the data is binomial: i.e. for any $\theta$ , the chance that $y$ balls out of the $n$ sampled are black is proportional to $\theta^y (1 - \theta)^{y-n}$ . In the textbook I have been reading, the prior is assumed to take the form of a beta distribution. I am wondering, however, about what we can say without making any particular assumptions about the shape of the individual's prior. For example, it seems to me that the following should be true: The posterior expectation of $\theta$ is increasing in the fraction of balls sampled that are black $y/n$ . Equivalently, holding $n$ fixed, the posterior expectation is higher the greater is $y$ . As $n \rightarrow \infty$ , the posterior expectation tends to the true proportion $\theta$ . Is there a textbook (or any other resource) that provides a discussion of topics like these (without making any assumptions about the shape of the prior)? Alternately, is there an easy way to prove that (1) and (2) must be true? Many thanks in advance!
