In fact, JNLP won't allow you to run your application a browser (as say the unofficial JNLP FAQ, JNLP!=Applet ). It will instead allow you to easily distribute current (and nexts) version of your application to your clients, by simplifying the install process. The simple way to do it is to transform your application into a real applet (complet with all its usage restrictions), then make this applet detachable, using new Java6 feature. I unfortunatly only found info on that very excellent feature in a blog post .
