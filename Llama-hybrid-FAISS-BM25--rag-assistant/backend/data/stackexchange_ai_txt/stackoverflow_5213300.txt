How to organize projects on Git server?

I am fairly new to Git and I am moving from SVN. I am working on setting up a new Git server for my team. I am trying to understand the best way to setup projects on the Git server. Is each project that I want to branch and tag its own repo in Git? In SVN, it would normally be its own folder in the central SVN repository. It seems Git prefers project to be their own isolated repository. If I am correct in assuming each project is a new repository in Git, how are things grouped? In SVN, different teams may have a section of the SVN repo, with their projects under that section. Examples maybe grouping all frontend projects in one folder and all services in another. Is this done in Git by naming the te repo with a prefix or is there a concept of folders or groups? Thanks for the help!
