if( /msie/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase()) ) { // omg it's an internet explorer } This is the real quick&dirty solution. Anyway you should do feature detection instead of browser detection. For instance, if you need a JSON parser, go for if( 'JSON' in window ) {} This would be the correct solution. To check for a browser (maybe even the version also) is not realiable.
