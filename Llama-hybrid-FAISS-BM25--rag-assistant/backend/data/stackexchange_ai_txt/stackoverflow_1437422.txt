Working around fls limitations with too many statically linked CRTs?

When loading external DLLs (not under our control) via LoadLibrary, we're hitting a problem where the statically linked CRT in those DLLs are failing to allocate fiber-local storage. This is similar to mskb 193462 , except that this is FLS and there's only 128 of them. Are there any useful ways to work around the problem? The CRT is using GetProcAddress to find FlsAlloc anyway (since that apparently never existed in XP), so does it even really need it? (This is on Vista, where FlsAlloc actually exists; the DLLs appear to be using MSVC8)
