For both problems, you could use a Secure two-party computation equality-algorithm. There are many schemes, for example this by Damgard, Fitzi, Kiltz, Nielsen and Toft: Unconditionally Secure Constant Round Multi-Party Computation for Equality, Comparison, Bits and Exponentiation . Of course an agent could try to pose as an agent from another side to get a 1/3 chance to discover the true side of another agent, but that seems unavoidable. A much simpler scheme for the photo-problem, which should be almost as good as the secure multiparty computation, is the following: Alice and Bob sorts their pictures and generate a SHA-512 hash. Alice sends the first bit of her hash to Bob. Bob compares the bit to the first bit of his hash. If it is different, they know that they have received different photos. Otherwise they continue. Bob sends the second bit of his hash to Alice. Alice checks this bit and decides whether to continue. Continue until the protocol aborts or all bits have been checked.
