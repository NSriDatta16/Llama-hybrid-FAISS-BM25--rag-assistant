How to calucate recall at k when the number of relevant document is large?

In information retrieval, how to calculate r@k when the number of the relevant document is large? The formular is: $ \text{Recall@K} = \frac{\text{True positive}}{\text{relevant document}} $ If relevant document is too large, R@K will be very small regardless of k. How can I handle it?
