timeGAN Model Retraining

I am using timeGAN from ydata-synthetic repo, and now question is about re-training the model. Suppose we have trained a model, say synth1 , based on a certain dataset. Now, we have new dataset which has similar data characteristics of the previous data. I am wondering if the ydata-synthetic package support to load the pre-trained model synth1 (in pickle files), and then re-train to synth2 ? I did tried loading model first and run model training like 5 epochs. I expect the 5 epochs should not change model significantly, but it shows genertaing very different distribution.
