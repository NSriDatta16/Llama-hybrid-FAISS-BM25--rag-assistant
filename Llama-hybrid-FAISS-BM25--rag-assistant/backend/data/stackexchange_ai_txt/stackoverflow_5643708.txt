JSON to describe HTML tags

I have a need to express HTML tags in a user friendly format, and then render them as actual HTML on a Web Page. For example, imagine that a user would like this link to show up on the page: Stack Overflow My average user is not familiar with HTML, so I was thinking about letting him/her use JSON instead. Something like this: {Link:{Title:"Stack Overflow",URL:"http://stackoverflow.com"}} I would then use a JSON parser to render the actual HTML on the page. The same method would apply to other HTML tags (images, buttons, etc.). Has this already been done? Are there any conventions on how to express HTML tags in JSON? Thanks!
