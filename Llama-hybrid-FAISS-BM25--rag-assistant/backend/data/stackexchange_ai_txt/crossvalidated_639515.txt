Important hyperparameters in survival random forest that need optimizing?

I use survival random forest for a relatively large dataset with 1200 obs and 40 features. I also wanted to compare 3 algorithms with each other by benchmarking. As tuning can be computationally expensive. What are Important hyperparameters for survival random forest algorithms? Is it allowed that we select just a limited subset of hyperparameters (e.g.. mtry and nodesize ) and not all or many to tune? How to better identify the important parameters and those that contribute to the improvement of the model?
