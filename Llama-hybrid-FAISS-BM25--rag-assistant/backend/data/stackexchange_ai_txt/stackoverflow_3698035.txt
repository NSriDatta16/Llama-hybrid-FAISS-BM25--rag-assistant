I'm guessing announcements_read is a named scope, with an :order clause which looks something like :order => "created_at" . It's ambiguous because the created_at column is in more than one table in the query. Fixing it should be straightforward -- the order clause is a SQL fragment, so you should be able to prefix created_at with the appropriate table name. As to why the other methods don't generate an error, perhaps you have different environments? Can you look at the logs to see what queries are being generated?
