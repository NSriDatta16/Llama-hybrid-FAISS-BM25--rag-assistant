The average silhouette index is not enough for validating our clustering. A clustering with less average silhouette index may have better quality then a greater one; imaging a case which all member of first cluster have high SIL index but the other clusters have negative SIL value and the average SIL index is still positive and high. So what is the benefit of having a high and rare SIL index in clustering? What is the benefit of having high p-value?
