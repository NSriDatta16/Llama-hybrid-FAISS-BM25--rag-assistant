You can do that using XamlServices.Save(filename, activity); It is not possible to add an entry in the toolbox from a xaml file, because only compiled type can be added to the toolbox (both in VS and rehosted designer). I suggest you have a listview or treeview instead, and implement drag and drop for this listview or treeview so that you can drag the xaml activities to the designer. (So this listview will be the substitute for toolbox. I don't think this is possible either. If you implement (2) the contained activity will appear. If you want custom designer, you will have to create a compiled type for it.
