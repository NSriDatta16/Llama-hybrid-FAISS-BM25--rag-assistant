Does weighted factor analysis exist?

I would like to perform factor analysis on a set of responses to a psychological questionnaire. Is there some method that allows me to "weight" each questionnaire item by how important I believe it is (based on the output of some other statistical analyses)? Does it even make sense to ask such a question? Put otherwise, I would like to impose some sort of Bayesian prior about which questions are more likely to "contain information" or to be "informationally relevant" in a broad sense, or "more likely to be highly loaded on the 'true factors'", etc.
