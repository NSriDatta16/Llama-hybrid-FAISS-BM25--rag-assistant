Is new value coming from the distribution of the previous points?

I have a set of 30 data points, measuring percent of acknowledgement of an event that should not happen. So ideal value is 0.0 but we are getting some values greater than that, of order $10^{-5}$ . It is not time series data. A person has elicited an upper bound. If this is crossed, we ring some bells, but we want a more data-driven approach so we thought, let's use the previous data points to create a distribution, extract 'some interval' and if next point is outside that 'interval', ring the bells. We also thought that if a 'suspicious' value comes, we can say (after investigation) if it is 'guilty' so we can make it 'contribute' or not to the created distribution. How can we achieve that?
