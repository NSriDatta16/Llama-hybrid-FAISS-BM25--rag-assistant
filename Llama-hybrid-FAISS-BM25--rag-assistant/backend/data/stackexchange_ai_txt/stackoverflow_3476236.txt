Touch handling is in the responsibility of the view. Just like you I think it should be on some kind of controller and Apple luckily introduced UIGestureRecognizer in iOS3.2. If you are targeting anything below 3.2 you'll have to stick with the touchesBegan/Moved/Ended methods, or create something for yourself. For targets after 3.2 please take a look at UIGestureRecognizer and it's subclasses and read the Gesture Recognizers chapter in the Event Handling Guide. It's also possible you create your own subclass, if you have touch handling needs not covered by the shipping gesture Recognizers.
