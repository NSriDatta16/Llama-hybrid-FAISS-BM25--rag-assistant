Oh my... mustISignUp is absolutely correct in saying "you definitely have a deeper underlying problem". I have variable-height table rows, and I was doing all height calculation and data storage on the rows themselves rather than on the data model that populated them. As a result, ALL cells were being created and populated by my heightForRowAtIndexPath method which was reading cell height from the cell objects. SO â€“ lesson learned. Thanks mustISignUp, and I love your username.
