B.Tech Project for final year of College

I am an Engineering student in NSIT, Delhi, India. In our last year of B.Tech degree we have a B.Tech project, aka, BTP. I am in ECE(Electronics and Communication Engineering) dept. Usually, my ECE batch mates would perform the project majorly regarding electronics, but I want to do in data Science or data manipulation under other departments(COE or IT). I approached a COE mentor under whose supervision I would like to do the project. But I have been struggling in choosing the right topic for project. There are a lot of suggestion online, and many are preferably done by students who just want to complete a project instead of it been already done and executed by others. I want some decent approach suggestions for choosing the right project topics as I am quite confused right now. What student level data Science or, specifically, Data manipulation projects can I do in my final year of College?
