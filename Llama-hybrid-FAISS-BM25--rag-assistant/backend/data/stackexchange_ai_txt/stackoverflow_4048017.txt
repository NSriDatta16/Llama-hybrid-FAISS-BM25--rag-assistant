Your data seems fairly application-specific, so you may just have to experiment. First see if the order of ISR invocations with interrupt numbers (without timing information) discriminates sufficiently; just take the final N calls of each burst and do a search to find any other bursts with similar fragments near the beginning. You can use any string search algorithm for this task. If too few matches are returned, try a fuzzy search algorithm. If too many matches are returned, try a smarter matching algorithm that also weighs each match by the similarity of timings. Overall this shouldn't be too complicated, since a complete chain is just about 15 bursts, whereas for example in DNA sequencing you need to match up millions of very short fragments.
