If you create a higher abstract exception that works as a base class for CupCakeException you don't bind the Reader Interface to a specific implementation like you would be doing if you added the CupCakeException to the Reader interface. If you don't let one Exception inherit from another there is a constructor in the exception class that takes a throwable as second argument like Thorbj√∏rn Ravn Andersen allready showed in his short code example. The enables you to generate a more abstract exception and every part of your code that needs to know more then just "there is an error" can look for the cause of the higher exception.
