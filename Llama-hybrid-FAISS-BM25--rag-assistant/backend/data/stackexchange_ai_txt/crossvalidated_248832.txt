Time series forecasting with a combination of methods

So, i read this article: https://www.r-bloggers.com/timeseries-forecasting-using-extreme-gradient-boosting/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+RBloggers+%28R+bloggers%29 And i want to ask if it is sensible to forecast a time series like in the article - ARIMA, then forecast with THETA method and then calculate the average of those 2 results. Or even averaging the results from 3 and more methods? You can completely disregard the part with R and RStudio with the code and all. My question is strictly theoretical if such an approach would be a good idea.
