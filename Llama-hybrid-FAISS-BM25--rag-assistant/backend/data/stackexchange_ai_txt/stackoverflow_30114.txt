For Visual Studio, take a look at ReSharper . It's an awesome tool and a definite must-have. Versions after 4.0 have the code formatting and clean-up feature that you are looking for. There's also plugin integration with StyleCop , including formatting settings file. You'll probably want Agent Smith plugin as well, for spell-checking the identifiers and comments. ReSharper supports per-solution formatting setting files, which can be checked into version control system and shared by the whole team. The keyboard shortcut for code cleanup is Ctrl + E , C . In 'vanilla' Visual Studio, the current file can be automatically formatted with Ctrl + K , Ctrl + D , and Ctrl + K , Ctrl + F formats the selected text. As for a runs-everywhere command line tool to be used with commit hooks, try NArrange . It's free, can process whole directories at once and runs on Mono as well as on Microsoft .NET. Some people also use the Artistic Style command line tool, although it requires Perl and works better with C/C++ code than with C#.
