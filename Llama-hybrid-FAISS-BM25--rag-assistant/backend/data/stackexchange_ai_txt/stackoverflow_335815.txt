I will google it first to see something exists in the same way/or even closer and learn more about it. With the power of the languages and frameworks available nowadays, any average programmer could write the code but the quality will really depend on how much 'best practices' you have used to achieve that solution. And how fast you achieve the result also matters. So I think Googling is going to be an important cycle in SDLC process :)
