A couple things: First: Your first paragraph is contradictory. When independent variables are highly collinear (which is not exactly the same as correlated) then the DV can't depend on only one variable, at least, not statistically. The different IVs are very similar. If the DV is related to one, it must be related to the others. It is possible that you can make a substantive argument that only one relationship is "real" (for some definition of "real") but they will all be statistically related. Second: Maybe you already know this, but when you add IVs to a regression, you are testing whether that IV explains more variance, after controlling for what's already in the regression. With collinear variables, this is a) Often not what you want and b) Very hard to estimate. Third: Although I am not completely sure what your p values are, it certainly looks like they are saying that the additional variables are significant. Fourth: No, you can't look at the ratio of p values. You could look at the effect sizes in the two data sets.
