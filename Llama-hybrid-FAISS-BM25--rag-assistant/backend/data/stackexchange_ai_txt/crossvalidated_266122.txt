The function$$K(\theta|\theta^{t-1}) = \alpha\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)q\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right) + \left(1-\alpha\left(\theta^{t-1}\right)\right)\delta_{\theta^{t-1}}(\theta)$$is a probability density in $\theta$ for a given value of $\theta^{t-1}$ measurable in $\theta^{t-1}$ for a given value of $\theta$ hence qualifies as a Markov kernel. It allows for the generation of $\theta^t$ given $\theta^{t-1}$ and hence for the production of a Markov chain $(\theta^t)_t$. The mixture structure of $K(\cdot|\theta^{t-1})$ means that, with probability $\left(1-\alpha\left(\theta^{t-1}\right) \right)$ the chain repeats itself and with probability $\alpha\left(\theta^{t-1}\right)$ it moves to another value. Since, in most cases, this probability$$\alpha(\theta^{t-1})=\int_{\Theta} \alpha\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)q\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)d\theta$$cannot be computed in closed form, it is often replaced with the unbiased estimate $\alpha\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)$ when $\theta\sim q\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)$.
