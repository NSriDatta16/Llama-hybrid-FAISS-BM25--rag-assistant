raw data stationary but still can see trend and seaonality is stl

So I am looking at unit sales data. I am doing a univariate time series analysis. My data is weekly sales numbers figures, spanning 2012- 2014 (obviously no till end 2014). I first ploted my response var against time. I suspected trend and seasonality which would make sense. So I did a seasonal trend decompose with loess (STL). Here is the result. However when I did a stationarity test on my original dataset, it gives me stationarity. And I tried Box-Ljung Philips-Perron unit root test augmented dicky fuller test with stationary and explosive as alternative both and kpss. Stationary. So why is it that my trend and sesonality not significant? I assigned to every observation a month index and did boxplot(sales~month, data=???) Here is the result: Then asked myself if differences in mean were significant, they were not. I tried aov pairwise.t.test and TuckeyHD. even if difference in mean for some means was important, overall not. Could I say then that no significant trend and seasonality appears in the dataset and model with an ARIMA? Also I have only 156 observations in my dataset. Here is the acf and pacf what ARMA would you specify? if ARMA at all. I am really at loss it is the first time I see a staionary raw sales figure.
