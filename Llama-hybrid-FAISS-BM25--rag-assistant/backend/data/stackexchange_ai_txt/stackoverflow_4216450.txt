So after playing around with it for a while, I found that the answer given here actually gave me what I needed, even though the question being asked was different. It turns out you can subclass UIGestureRecognizer; and have it handle all the touches for the view that it has been added to (including an MKMapView). This allows all the normal MKMapView interactions to still behave without any problem; but also alerts me of the touches. In touchesMoved, I just check the location of the touch; and see if it is within the bounds of my other view. From everything I tried; this seems to be the only way to intercept touchesMoved while the user is dragging an MKAnnotation.
