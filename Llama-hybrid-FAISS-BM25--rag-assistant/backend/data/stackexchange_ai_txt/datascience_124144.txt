Binary classification using xgboost

Why when adding new features in my ADS for a binary classification using XGBOOST my score and uplift has decreased ? What is the best way to treate categorical features or other features in order that the performance of the model won't decrease ? Ps. I have skewed data so in my pipeline I created PowerTransformer() I Have very imbalanced data, so I used undersampling. I have outliers that I can't delete or replace due to the fact that I don't have many rows for categorical features I encoded them using LabelEncoder(). Thank you ?
