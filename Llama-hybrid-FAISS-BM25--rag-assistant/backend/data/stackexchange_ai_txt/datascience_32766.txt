Hyper parameters and ValidationSet

Please correct me if I am wrong. "Training Set is used for calculating parameters of a machine learning model, Validation data is used for calculating hyperparameters of the same model (we use same weights with different hyperparameters), and Test set is used for evaluating our model". If true, can someone explain the whole process in a little more detail. TIA.
