Task/Method scheduling from within a timer

From within a Windows service I would like to cast a method once an hour. A polling timer exists which I would like to use rather than adding a "Windows Task". In the timer callback, I am checking whether to call the method or not by the following code, where _config.PollingInterval is the interval of the timer. if (DateTime.Now.Subtract(new DateTime(DateTime.Now.Year, DateTime.Now.Month, DateTime.Now.Day, DateTime.Now.Hour, 0, 0)) For some reason, the condition is met twice within the same minute (e.g. 08:00). I guess there is a logical error somewhere, since it's assured that there is only one timer. Any hints for a working or even completely different/more elegant approach?
