What are the main differences between uwot and umap packages in R?

There are two packages in R that implement the UMAP algorithm for low-dimensional embedding ('uwot' and 'umap'). I've found they can give vastly different results for some datasets. For example, the embeddings below are of the same $4001$ equidistant points in $R^{4000}$ . In this case the 'umap' package seems to give a better gestalt of a set of equidistant points. On the other hand, in other cases such as the UMAP on Cartesian coordinates of 41K cities below, 'uwot' seems much better. I was hoping someone could explain the main differences between these two implementations and give some general advice as to when to use which package.
