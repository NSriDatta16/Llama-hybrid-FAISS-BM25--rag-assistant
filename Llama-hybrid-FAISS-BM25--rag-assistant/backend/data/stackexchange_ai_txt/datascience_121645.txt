Looking for a couple of ideas please

I’ve got some data by postal zone that includes: Postal zone code Average rent value per square foot Brand affinity 1 Brand affinity 2 Brand affinity 3 Brand affinity 4 …and so on The brand affinity data is a value from 0 to 100 that shows how much affinity the people living in that postal zone code have with a particular brand. There are about 50 brands. I’m running a bit low on inspiration for this one. Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be done with this data? Specifically - any data analysis, ML Thank you!
