What we can learn from the data if PCA scree plot bins are almost the same?

Suppose we have a data-set with 4 features. Suppose we calculate the PCA for this dataset and we plot the scree-plot : What we can learn from the features? Can we say that they are not linearly correlated? Can we say something else?
