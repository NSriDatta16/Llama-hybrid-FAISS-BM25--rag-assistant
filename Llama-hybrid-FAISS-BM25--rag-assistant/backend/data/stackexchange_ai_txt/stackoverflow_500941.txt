Date formatting is not easy in XSLT 1.0. Probably the most elegant way is to write a short XSLT extension function in C# for date formatting. Here's an example: With this input document 2007-11-14T12:01:00 you will get 14.11.2007 The function formatting the date takes a date value as string and a format as described in DateTime.ToString Method . Using .NET's DateTime struct gives you parsing arbitrary XSD datetime values (including time zone specifiers), timezone calculation and localized output for free. However, be aware that there is one caveat (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316775) with msxml script extensions: Each time you load the XSLT an assembly containing the script code is generated dynamically and loaded into memory. Due to the design of the .NET runtime, this assembly cannot be unloaded. That's why you have to make sure that your XSLT is only loaded once (and then cached for further re-use). This is especially important when running inside IIS.
