What sort of server are you running? Is there any reason you couldn't host a web server within your server product, potentially on a "normally unused" port? You don't need to ask the customer to install and manage a web server if you bundle it yourself. What platform is this on, btw? EDIT: As suggested by David in the comments, there's a related question about a embedding lightweight web server .
