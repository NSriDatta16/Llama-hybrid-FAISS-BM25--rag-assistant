To check for full-screen, call CGDisplayIsCaptured(screenID) on each screen. But I'm not sure if you're checking the right thing. For one thing, I could have one screen captured ("full screen") and a second screen uncaptured, what do you want to do in this case? Also, does fullscreen really mean anything? If I'm using GarageBand to work on a song, I probably don't want to hear random sounds, regardless of whether or not anything's full screen. Or I could be running a Windows VM full-screen, but still want to be notified of IMs.
