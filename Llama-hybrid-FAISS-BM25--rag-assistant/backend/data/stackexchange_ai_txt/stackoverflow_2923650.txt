How do I quickly group the time column in a dataframe into intervals?

Assuming in R, I have a data.frame with the first column representing the time (as POSIXct). The rest of the columns (e.g., columns 2) are numeric data. I would like to group time into 3-minute intervals. Each interval will the the average of values that falls into that particular interval. Right now, I have a for-loop that iterates through the time column and generate the interval on the fly. I am wondering if there's a more elegant way to accomplish the same thing? Thanks in advance.
