MAP estimation for multiple parameters

Consider $N$ observed data points $x_i$ ($i=1,..,N$), and a likelihood that depends on $p$ parameters: $f(x_i|\theta_n)$ ($n=1,..p$). From Bayes' theorem $$p(\theta_n|x_i) = \frac{f(x_i|\theta_n)g(\theta_n)}{h(x_i)}$$ I apply an MCMC sampler and obtain as a result the (sampled) posterior $p(\theta_n|x_i)$, and a (sampled) probability distribution for each $\theta_n$ individually (from where I can obtain for example the mean and the median for each $\theta_n$). By definition, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) is obtained as: $$\hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{MAP}}(x_i) = \underset{\theta_n}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \ p(\theta_n|x_i) $$ This is where I get lost. Are the MAP estimates of each $\theta_n$: the values associated to the maximum value of the (sampled) full posterior $p(\theta_n|x_i)$?, or the values obtained finding the maximum (ie: the mode) in the (sampled) distribution of each single $\theta_n$ parameter? To illustrate what I mean, here's the result of an MCMC run showing the sampled distribution of a single $\theta_n$ parameter: You can see that the mode (cyan line) of the distribution for this parameter is very different from the MAP (red line) value that I obtain from the maximum value of the sampled posterior $p(\theta_n|x_i)$.
