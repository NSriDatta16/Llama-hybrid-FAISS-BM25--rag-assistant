Microsoft says that any control can accept data from a drag-and-drop operation in progress, and that you can designate a control as a drop zone by setting the AllowDrop property to true. I would think that, if you set AllowDrop to false on those controls that you do not wish to be a drop zone, you should get the desired behavior. If you want to detect drag and drop between two instances of your program, you can set an ID in the dragging object (i.e. put a GUID in the tag of the control), and check it during the drag process to see if it matches the GUID of your currently running instance. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973845.aspx
