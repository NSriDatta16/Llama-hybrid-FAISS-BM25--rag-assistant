How to format individual DropDownlist Items (color, etc.) during onDataBinding event

I have a basic DropDownList bound to a ObjectDataSource: The DataTable from which it receives the DataTextField and DataValueField values also returns some other interesting information about the records. Say Active = Y/N for simplicity's sake. What I'd like to do is to set the background-color property of the DropDownList Item based on that Active field in the DataSource results. Further, I'd like to do this "in the same pass" as when the DropDownList is bound to the data. So my guess is that it has to happen during OnDataBound. Things I already know/tried: I could go back and loop through the DropDownList items later. But it would involve embedding loops and re-visiting the DataTable rows and it just seems inefficient int row; for (row = 0; row We already do stuff like this with the GridView OnRowDataBound event, by accessing the GridViewRowEventArg s e. What I seem to be missing is an OnDropDownListItemBound event, so to speak. Hope I've been clear and concise. Seems as though it should be easy...
