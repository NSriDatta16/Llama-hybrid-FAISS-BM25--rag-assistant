We use a Bayesian model in forecasting retail sales with the SAP Unified Demand Forecast (UDF) . The Bayesian approach offers two advantages: We can use priors. For instance, suppose your supermarkets stocks a new item, and we would like to forecast its first Christmas sales. We can simply use the average effect of similar items as a prior for the new item's Christmas effect. Which has the added benefit that the prior gets automatically updated once we have seen the new item's first Christmas sales, so both the prior and the item's own data influence the prediction for the second Christmas. The priors regularize. Our model is heavily over-parameterized, with seasonality, day of week, trend, holidays and tons of promotion predictors, so regularization is hugely important to keep the predictions under control. (Note that the pictures you show in your question do not show such an overparameterized model.) Aspect 1 is more important to our marketers and to business users, and aspect 2 is more important to me and to statistician or data scientist users. Yes, there are ways to address both issues without a Bayesian model, e.g., by pooling for aspect 1, and the Lasso or Elastic Net for aspect 2. We just chose the Bayesian approach, and I find the updating particularly elegant. So, yes, Bayesian regression is used in real life, and it has paid my salary for the last couple of years, along with the salaries of a number of my colleagues. And while making sure your supermarket does not run out of your favorite shampoo.
