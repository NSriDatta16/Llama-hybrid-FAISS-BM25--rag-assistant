fixed width bash prompt

I'd like to set my bash prompt to a fixed width, and make up the difference in space before the $, so whether long or short, my prompt remains the same width: [name@host] ~/Directory/Dir...Another/LastDir $ [name@host] ~/Directory(branch) $ Currently, in a short directory path my prompt looks something like this: [name@host] ~/Directory(branch) $ a deeper directory path looks like this: [name@host] ~/Directory/Dir...Another/LastDir $ You can see I've truncated the PWD in the middle so I can see where the path begins, and where it ends. I'd like to make up the difference before the $. Here is my current prompt: # keep working directory to 30 chars, center tuncated prompt_pwd() { local pwd_symbol="..." local pwd_length=30 newPWD="${PWD/#$HOME/~}" [ ${#newPWD} -gt ${pwd_length} ] && newPWD=${newPWD:0:12}${pwd_symbol}${newPWD:${#newPWD}-15} } # set prompt prompt_color() { PROMPT_COMMAND='prompt_pwd;history -a;title_git' PS1="${WHITEONMAGENTA}[\u@\h]${MAGENTA} \w\$(parse_git_branch) ${MAGENTABOLD}\$${PS_CLEAR} " PS1=${PS1//\\w/\$\{newPWD\}} PS2="${WHITEONTEAL}>${PS_CLEAR} " } In my search, I found A Prompt the Width of Your Term which does do some fill, but couldn't get it working for this particular prompt.
