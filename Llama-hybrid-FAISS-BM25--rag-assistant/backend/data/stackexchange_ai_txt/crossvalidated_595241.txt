Automated Machine Learning (autoML) progress comparable with normal machine learning?

autoML is a very convenient model for beginner to explore on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The process itself rapidly growing and many ML algorithm can be found in autoML, but hardly to be analyses and interpret, the algorithm itself automates the data exploration, feature engineering and assess the best model. I have build an autoML model that have 9 models that are discriminant analysis, ensemble, kernel classification, k-nearest neighbor, linear classification, na√Øve bayes, neural network, support vector machine and binary decision tree. autoML choose neural network as the best model. I have fixed and play around on the number of iterations to optimize the learning and I am using bayesian optimizier. I would like to know how and why autoML choose Neural Network as the best model? Is it solely based on accuracy? How does bayesian optimizer influence the number of iterations, I hardly found any reference that relates bayesian optimizer with the iterations.
