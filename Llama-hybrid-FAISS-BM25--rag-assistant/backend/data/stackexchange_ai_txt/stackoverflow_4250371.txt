Drawing the line in Interface Builder does the same thing as calling [theButton addTarget:theController action:@selector(theAction) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; theAction needs to be a method that is defined with a type of IBAction . For your situation, in your NewViewController.h, declare - (IBAction)removeView; Then in NewViewController.m: - (void)removeView { [self.view removeFromSuperview]; } In your newView.xib file, you should be able to drag a line from the UIButton that you've drawn to your File's Owner, and select the removeView action.
