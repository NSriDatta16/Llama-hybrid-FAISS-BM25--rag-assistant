I'd strongly recommend Bulmer's Principles of Statistics as a leaping-off point. It's a touch dated, but it's short, clear and available in a cheap Dover edition - around $10 from Amazon. For a more modern and to the point statistical book I'd suggest Wasserman's "All of Statistics" . I got it a few months back and it's been a good survey of everything - I've not read the first few chapters in detail but it seems ok on a skim. I like some of the practical advice which would be useful in a self study context - e.g. "Unbiasdness used to receive much attention but these days is considered less important". But this is assuming you want a practical statistics text which covers some probabilty rather than a probability theory text. For probability theory, I'd suggest reading a lot on measure theory and hit something on Lebegue integration first - but this doesn't sound like where you're at.
