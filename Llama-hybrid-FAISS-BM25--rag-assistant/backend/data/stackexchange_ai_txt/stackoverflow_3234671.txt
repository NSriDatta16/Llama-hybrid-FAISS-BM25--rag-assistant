ListBoxDragDropTarget prevents ListBox from filling its parent control

Its extremely easy with the Silverlight Toolkit to enable basic drag and drop. http://silverlightfeeds.com/post/1325/Silverlight_Toolkit_adds_DragDrop_targets.aspx Unfortunately it seems that the wrapper ListBoxDragDropTarget screws up the normal default behavior of a ListBox which is to stretch itself to the parent control - such as a grid cell in this example. I end up here (after binding data to the ListBox ) with a small listbox resized to fit its contents sitting in the middle of a yellow box. No amount of HorizontalAlignment=Stretch etc. seems to be able to get it to fill the parent box. How can I get the ListBox to fill the Grid ?
