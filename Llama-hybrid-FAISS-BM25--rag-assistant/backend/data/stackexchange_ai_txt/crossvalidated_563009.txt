Filling a short time series for cross correlation

I have two times series data X and Y . X is the number of times the phrase "sole proprietorship" is searched on a local search engine while Y is the number of sole proprietorship venture newly created. Both series are measured on a monthly frequency but in different time periods. To be specific, series X spans 2020-2021 (24 rows) while series Y spans 2016-2021 (65 rows). They have the same end time. I intend to do a time-lagged cross correlation to understand the relationship between the two series. However, cross correlation requires that the two series are of the same length. So it's either I trim the Y series to fit X (which leads to substantial amount of information loss given that X is a short series already) or I find a way to fill X up to 65 rows such that my analysis is still plausible. Now, given that I prefer the latter method (my research shows that doing stationary test and even cross correlation for short series comes with a lot of issues), I was able to get another time series data, say Z . Z is a Google trend data similar to X (that is, number of times the phrase "sole proprietorship" is searched) but covers the time period of Y . Left to my devices, I would just take from Z to fill X and move on, but the range of values for X (3700-18000) is far greater than that of Z (120-400). So my question is Is it even wise at all to fill X with Z ? And if it is okay, what method is most likely to produce more realistic values? What I tried initially was a moving average method to fill the values but I feel there should be a more reliable method. Also, the closest question I found is this but the answer suggests resampling the frequency (which is not an issue in my case) and dynamic time warping, an approach I have tried but don't know how to clearly interpret.
