Flextime and not worrying too much about what comes across the internet pipe (so long as it's legal and wouldn't bother a customer if they saw it) are both good things. Flextime generally comes with some core hours where everyone is expected to be there so meetings can be scheduled. Being able to work from home on occasion is also nice. Otherwise social events can be a good idea. The best culture I've worked in allowed managers a budget to do whatever they wanted with their team. It must have been fairly sizable, we went out for lunch every couple of weeks, we had afternoons off after every major project where we went and had some fun down time (movie, pool hall, etc.) Still, if you have bad people, especially in high positions, then there's not much that can be done until they're gone. Generally that seems to be the cause of a lack of culture more than a lack of policy to encourage a good culture.
