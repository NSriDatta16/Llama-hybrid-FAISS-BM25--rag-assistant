Alan is right- Joda time is great. java.util.Date and Calendar are just a shame. If you need timestamps use the oracle date type with the time, name the column with some kind of suffix like _tmst. When you read the data into java get it into a joda time DateTime object. to make sure the timezone is right consider that there are specific data types in oracle that will store the timestamps with the timezone. Or you can create another column in the table to store the timezone ID. Values for the timezone ID should be standard full name ID for Timezones see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getTimeZone%28java.lang.String%29 . If you use another column for the TZ dta then when you read the data into java use DateTime object but set the timezone on the DateTime object using the .withZoneRetainFields to set the timezone. If you only need the date data (no timestamp) then use the date type in the database with no time. again name it well. in this case use DateMidnight object from jodatime. bottom line: leverage the type system of the database and the language you are using. Learn them and reap the benefits of having expressive api and language syntax to deal with your problem.
