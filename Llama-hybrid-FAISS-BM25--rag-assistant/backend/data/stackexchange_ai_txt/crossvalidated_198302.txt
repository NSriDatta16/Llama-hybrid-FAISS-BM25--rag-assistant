To calculate the partial dependence requires a few steps. First you select the covariate of interest, x. Then, create a grid of evenly spaced values from x-min to x-max. For every value in the grid loop through the entire dataset and calculate the predicted response. The average of all predicted responses for each x-value holding all other covariates constant is what is meant by "integrating" out the other variables. This average response is what is plotted on the y-axis in the partial dependence plot.
