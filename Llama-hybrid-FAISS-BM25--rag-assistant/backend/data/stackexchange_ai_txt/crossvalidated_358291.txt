Why find the weak learner by the formula in the blue box? You define a class of weak learners as part of your boosting algorithm. For example you can perform boosting on decision trees, on SVM, logistic regression etc.. All you need is a particular class of weak learner. What the meaning of the formula wih(xi)? For a particular iteration, you find the particular model (of the pre-defined class) that best fits your data, given the weights and parameters given in the formula I think the formula is to calculate the gradient In Gradient Boosting, ‘shortcomings’ (of existing weak learners) are identified by gradients. As @Doubllle says in comments: The principle idea of gradient boosting is to make the weak learner at each iteration pointing to the direction of negative gadient of the current loss with respect to the current ensemble."
