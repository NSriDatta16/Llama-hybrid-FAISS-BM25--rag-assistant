It seems that you are using Spring's proxy-based AOP. If so, this is a known limitation. See Understanding AOP Proxies from Spring documentation for more details. You have two ways to solve this issue: Use the AopContext.currentProxy() approach outlined in the documentation. I will discourage this approach, since your code will now be tied to Spring AOP quite explicitly. Use AspectJ's byte-code weaving. Since there is no proxy involved with it, you won't have the issue with 'this' pointing to original object and proxy is transparently available only to external objects.
