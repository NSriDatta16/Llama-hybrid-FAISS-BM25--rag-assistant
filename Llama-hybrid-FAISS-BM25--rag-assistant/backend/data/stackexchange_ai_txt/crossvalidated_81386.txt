What kind of learning algorithm is suitable for classifying unknown number of groups of unlabeled data?

I'm looking for a learning algorithm to analyze data, then group it and define how many classes are fit to distinguish the data set. Type of experiment is in the context of evolutionary biology, how a set of bacteria evolve over the course of time. The data is initially unlabeled so I'm assuming I should look into unsupervised learning algorithms. I'm trying to classify instances of the training set into groups, so I thought clustering types of algorithms would be more suitable (following a pre-processing of PCA for an easier grasp of the data). The number of groups are unknown, so something like K-Means might be more troubling since the number of centroids is preselected before the analysis step. I did some reading/research and stumbled upon Hierarchical Clustering , which seemed like a great candidate for this problem.
