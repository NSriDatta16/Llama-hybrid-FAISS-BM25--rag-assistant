Code Coverage possible for TFS Build 2008 building Visual Studio 2010 Project?

We have moved to Visual Studio 2010 but our TFS folks are not ready yet. After some work, we can get the build to work, but we don't get code coverage. We are running using the MSTest test runner. Does anyone know any tricks to get TFS to report code coverage using Visual Studio 2010 on a build server that has a TFS 2008 Build agent?
