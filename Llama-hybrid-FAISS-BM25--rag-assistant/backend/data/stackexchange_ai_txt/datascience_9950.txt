NLP - Is Gazetteer a cheat?

In NLP, there is the concept of Gazetteer which can be quite useful for creating annotations. As far as I understand: A gazetteer consists of a set of lists containing names of entities such as cities, organisations, days of the week, etc. These lists are used to Ô¨Ånd occurrences of these names in text, e.g. for the task of named entity recognition. So it is essentially a lookup. Isn't this kind of a cheat? If we use a Gazetteer for detecting named entities, then there is not much Natural Language Processing going on. Ideally, I would want to detect named entities using NLP techniques. Otherwise, how is it any better than a regex pattern matcher?
