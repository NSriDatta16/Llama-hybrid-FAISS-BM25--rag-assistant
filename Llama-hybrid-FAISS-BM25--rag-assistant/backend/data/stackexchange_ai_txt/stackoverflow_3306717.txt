Image and Media control do not accept the drop even after Allow drop is true

In Silverlight 4, I have a button with AllowDrop = True. If I drag a file and drop on this Button, drop event fires up and I write some code in it (regardless of whether I run Elevated or Non-Elevated!) Same drop event doesn't seem to work for at least 2 controls, mediaelement and image control. Am I missing anything?
