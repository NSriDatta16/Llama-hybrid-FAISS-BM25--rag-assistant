Locating a file in a network disk in a Servlet

I create ImageServlet to refer to videos out of my web application scope. The location of all of my videos are on a intranet location that could be reached from any computer in the intranet: String path = "\\myip\storage\ogg\VX-276.ogg" In my application, when I write it as URL - it can't display it! If I try to open it with chrome it automatically changes it to file://myip/storage/ogg/VX-276.ogg and the file is being displayed. I tried to do so: file:////odelyay_test64/storage/ogg/ as well but Java converts the string to: file:\myip\storage\ogg\VX-276.ogg which does not exist! What is the correct way to refer to it? EDITED I create a small test: String path = "file://myip/storage/ogg/VX-276.ogg"; File file = new File(path); if (file.exists()) System.out.println("exists"); else { System.out.println("missing" + file.getPath()); } and I get: missing file:\myip\storage\ogg\VX-276.ogg As you can see the slashes are being switched
