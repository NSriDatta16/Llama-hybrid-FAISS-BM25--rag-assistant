How does h2o handle time-series cross validation?

I've read about How does h2o.r cross validation work? . However, for a time series dataset, does H2o support the type of CV described here Using k-fold cross-validation for time-series model selection ? In particular, something like this: fold 1 : training [1], test [2] fold 2 : training [1 2], test [3] fold 3 : training [1 2 3], test [4] fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4], test [5] fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6]
