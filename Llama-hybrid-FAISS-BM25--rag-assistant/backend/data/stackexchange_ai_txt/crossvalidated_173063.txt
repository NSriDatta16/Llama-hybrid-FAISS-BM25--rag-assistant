I had the pleasure of attending a lecture given by Dr. Hadley Wickham, of RStudio fame. He defined it such that Big Data: Can't fit in memory on one computer: > 1 TB Medium Data: Fits in memory on a server: 10 GB - 1 TB Small Data: Fits in memory on a laptop: Hadley also believes that most data can at least be reduced to managable problems, and that a very small amount is actually true big data. He denotes this as the "Big Data Mirage". 90% Can be reduced to a small/ medium data problem with subsetting/sampling/summarising 9% Can be reduced to a very large number of small data problems 1% Is irreducibly big Slides can be found here .
