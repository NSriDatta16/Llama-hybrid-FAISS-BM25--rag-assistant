ASP.NET - in Global.asax detect ASPX page request vs. other things

I have an ASP.NET application where I want to set some additional HTTP headers (related to page expiration) if the request is for a normal ASPX page. However, I don't want to add these headers for things like images, or AXD handlers, or static HTML pages, etc. What is the best way to detect, inside Global.asax request begin handler, that the current request is for an ASP.NET page? It seems wrong to me to look at the URL for "aspx" because then when they request root pages (such as myapp.com/ or myapp.com/products) it won't work. And it just seems fragile. Thanks, ~ Justin
