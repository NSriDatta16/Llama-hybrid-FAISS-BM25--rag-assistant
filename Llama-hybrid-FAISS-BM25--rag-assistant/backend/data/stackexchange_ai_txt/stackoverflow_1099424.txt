Best display / editing of subcategories (use Tree ASP.NET or VB.NET winform control?)

I've got a categories table, and sub-category tables 3 levels deep (in the database they're called Categories, SubCategories, SubSubCategories, and SubSubSubCategories). On the presentation side, I am curious what the best way is to manage those. The categories form a tree/hierarchy structure, so a tree control of some kind sounds useful. Drag-and-drop functionality would be nice. This can be done in a VB.NET 3.5 web application (preferred) or VB.NET Windows application. Any thoughts on the best way to handle this? It looks like the TreeView doesn't support drag-and-drop. Thanks!
