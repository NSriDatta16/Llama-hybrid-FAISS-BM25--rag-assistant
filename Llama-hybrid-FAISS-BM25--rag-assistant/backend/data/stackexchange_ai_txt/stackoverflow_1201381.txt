Check if an element exists

I'm trying to find out if an Element in a Django model exists. I think that should be very easy to do, but couldn't find any elegant way in the Making queries section of the Django documentation. The problem I have is that I've thousands of screenshots in a directory and need to check if they are in the database that is supposed to store them. So I'm iterating over the filenames and want to see for each of them if a corresponding element exists. Having a model called Screenshot, the only way I could come up with is filenames = os.listdir(settings.SCREENSHOTS_ON_DISC) for filename in filenames: exists = Screenshot.objects.filter(filename=filename) if exists: ... Is there a nicer/ faster way to do this? Note that a screenshot can be in the database more than once (thus I didn't use .get).
