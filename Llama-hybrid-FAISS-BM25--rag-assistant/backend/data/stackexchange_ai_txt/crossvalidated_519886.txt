How to create a threshold based on a classification model?

I have a data-set that is comparing two groups (Injury only (baseline) and Surgical Modification) across multiple injury severity values (Peak Force). Reference scatter plot for context: BBB score - yaxis is what is defined and measured for 'neurological recovery' (categorical). Peak Force - xaxis is various injury severity across subjects (continuous). The goal is to come up with a model, type of analysis that tries to define the threshold injury severity (x-axis) that shows no improvement of neurological recovery (BBB score - yaxis) that is seen with surgical decompression (Duorotomy/Piotomy). Some sort of classification model may be needed but am unsure if that is the best way to establish 'the threshold'. UPDATE I decided to leverage decision tree approach to help determine a cutoff point for surgical decompression influence on recovery (BBB). Summary of Data: Group Peak_Force Recovery D:16 Min. : 34.16 Full :20 I:21 1st Qu.: 40.51 Mild :21 M:25 Median : 45.39 Moderate:21 Mean : 52.39 3rd Qu.: 60.91 Max. :106.31 Reference figure below: The model itself is not that great (~ 46% accuracy). Here is the raw data/code that follows the plot: # Drop variables clean_df % mutate(tertiles = ntile(Week_8_BBB, 3)) %>% mutate(Recovery = if_else(tertiles == 1, 'Mild', if_else(tertiles == 2, 'Moderate', 'Full'))) %>% na.omit() clean_df % select(-c(tertiles, Week_1_BBB, Week_5_BBB, Week_8_BBB)) clean_df $Group Group) clean_df $Recovery Recovery) ## Create train/test dataset ## create_train_test $Group)) prop.table(table(data_test$ Group)) ## Build Model ## fit
