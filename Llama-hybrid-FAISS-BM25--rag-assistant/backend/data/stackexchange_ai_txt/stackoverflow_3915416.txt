How to enable VSYNC in D3D windowed app?

So, Im using D3D in a windowed application. I inited D3D with the following parameters: windowed: true; backbufferformat: D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8; presentinterval: D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_ONE; swapeffect: DISCARD Each time OnPaint is called, I render the image to the backbuffer and present it to front. As far as I know (and so does MSDN say), once I set D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_ONE , vsync will work. But in this case, the image is teared when dragging horizontally. (It seems there's a line across the image, image below the line shows on the monitor and the above part follows.) Some sites say D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_ONE will not work in windowed applications. How can I enable vsync anyway? p.s. I finally found D3D vsync is enabled, while some window settings are not right that perhaps the window itself is not sync ed. though, I haven't peek the settings out.
