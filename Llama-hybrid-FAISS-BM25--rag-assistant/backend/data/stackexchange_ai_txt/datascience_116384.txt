How to include information about labels in a multilabel classification task

Currently, I'm working on a multilabel classification problem for a shared task in NLP. I have quite a few labels, and with those labels, I have a little paragraph defining them. I was wondering if there is some way I can include that label information in a multilabel classification pipeline. Up until now, I've tried prompt-learning, designing a prompt that includes that paragraph, but I haven't obtained good results. My best shot so far has been using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, and I thought that if I could include that label definition somehow in the pipeline, I could obtain better results, as the LM beneath could extract more information about it. Thanks in advance! Cheers.
