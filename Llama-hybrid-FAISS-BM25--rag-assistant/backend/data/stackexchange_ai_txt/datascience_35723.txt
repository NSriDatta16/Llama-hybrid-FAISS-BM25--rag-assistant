This is quite theoretical. I will try hard to simplify. Lets say one egg cost 3 bucks at an egg store To get 3 eggs you need 9 bucks in your pocket. -- But (if you are a cashier) -- Someone handing 9 bucks tells he/she want 3 eggs Buyer need to have an engineer mind and "build" a decision of how much money is needed, while cashier need to have a scientist mind and break down the 9 bucks scenario that this person want 3 eggs. Data sciences became more with the data availability explosions and being (the data) copy of real world (here you are understanding the real world as a scientist) while generative mind is more about engineering to build a solution for the real world.
