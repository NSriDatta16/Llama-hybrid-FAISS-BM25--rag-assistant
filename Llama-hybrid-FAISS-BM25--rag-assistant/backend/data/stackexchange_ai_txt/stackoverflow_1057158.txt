A question about printf arguments. C/C++

We have the following code fragment: char tab[2][3] = {'1', '2', '\0', '3', '4', '\0'}; printf("%s\n", tab); And I don't understand why we don't get an error / warning in the call to printf . I DO get a warning but not an error, and the program runs fine. It prints ' 12 '. printf is expecting an argument of type char * , i.e. a pointer to char . So if I declared char arr[3] , then arr is an address of a memory unit which contains a char , so if I called printf with it, it would decay to pointer to char , i.e. char * . Analogously, tab is an address of a memory unit that contains the type array of 3 char's which is in turn, an address of memory unit contains char , so tab will decay to char ** , and it should be a problem, since printf is expecting a char * . Can someone explain this issue? Addendum: The warning I get is: a.c:6: warning: char format, different type arg (arg 2)
