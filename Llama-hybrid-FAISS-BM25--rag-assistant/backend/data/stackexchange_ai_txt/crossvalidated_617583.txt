It may help you to read my answer to Interpretation of plot (glm.model) . The plots that R is generating are not specific to a logistic regression. They are the plots for a standard OLS regression. For example, the qq-plot is not of the residuals vs a binomial distribution. It shows them relative to a normal distribution. However, there is no theoretical reason that the residuals from a logistic regression 'should' be normally distributed. On the other hand, the residuals from a logistic regression very much should be heteroscedastic, because the variance is a function of the mean. Your model seems fine, as far as I can tell.
