Should the RMSE of an unrestricted VAR model decrease as compared to a restricted Autoregression model when there is Granger Causality

I have 2 time series, say for instance, T1 and T2. T1 granger causes T2 at lag 2. Should this mean that if I make a VAR model with these two time series, and an autoregression model with just T2, the RMSE from the former should necessarily be lesser than the latter?
