Linking two Flash Player windows together

We have a Flex 3 application of which the main .swf is running in Firefox. Lets call this application Main.swf. I'm required to create a secondary .swf, call it Panel.swf which is to be embedded in a separate Firefox popup window, which will be invoked via ExternalInterface calling JavaScript from Main.swf. Is it possible to link Main.swf and Panel.swf in such a manner that I can enable Drag 'n Drop from Panel.swf to Main.swf? The idea is for our Main.swf RIA to be run, for example on the users main monitor, and then have the Firefox popup window, containing the separate Panel.swf running on the users other additional monitor if he has one...or at least a separate minimizable window. Panel.swf for example contains some thumbnail images, and the user can drag 'n drop these images from Panel.swf to Main.swf. Thanks in advance.
