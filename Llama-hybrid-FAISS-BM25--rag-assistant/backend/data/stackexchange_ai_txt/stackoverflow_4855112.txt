I had the same issue where I was creating an image gallery and the buttons I added to each thumbnail would not respond to TouchUpInside events. I was able to get it working by creating a custom UIView subclass to hold each individual image and implementing touchesBegan:withEvent: and touchesEnded:withEvent: in that subclass. See the UIScrollView programming guide for sample code. If you aren't allowing zooming on the UIScrollView you can simplify the code by assuming every touch end is a single touch event.
