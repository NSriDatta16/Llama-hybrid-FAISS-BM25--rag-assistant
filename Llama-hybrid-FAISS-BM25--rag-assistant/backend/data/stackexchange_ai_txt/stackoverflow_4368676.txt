Is there a way to pad to an even number of digits?

I'm trying to create a hex representation of some data that needs to be transmitted (specifically, in ASN.1 notation). At some points, I need to convert data to its hex representation. Since the data is transmitted as a byte sequence, the hex representation has to be padded with a 0 if the length is odd. Example: >>> hex2(3) '03' >>> hex2(45) '2d' >>> hex2(678) '02a6' The goal is to find a simple, elegant implementation for hex2 . Currently I'm using hex , stripping out the first two characters, then padding the string with a 0 if its length is odd. However, I'd like to find a better solution for future reference. I've looked in str.format without finding anything that pads to a multiple.
