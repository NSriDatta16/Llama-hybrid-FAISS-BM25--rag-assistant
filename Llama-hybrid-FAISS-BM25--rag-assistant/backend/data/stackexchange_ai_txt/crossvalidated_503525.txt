How to compare the results between decomposition and SARIMA for a time series?

I was asked in an exercise to compare the results of function decompose and the model SARIMA. I only know to plot the results of function decompose and the prediction of model SARIMA Could you please elaborate on some aspects for which I can compare them? Y = scan('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanhdung1994/Time-Series/main/trafic.dat') Y = ts(Y, start = 1963, frequency = 12) X = window(Y, end = 1979 + 11/12) # Decomposition Z
