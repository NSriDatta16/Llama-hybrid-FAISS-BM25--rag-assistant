I have been having the same issue and as far as I can tell, it could be related to the type of variable that TIME is. Can you provide some sample data and try TIME as numeric instead of factor? Here is a resource that further discusses the usage of random intercepts and slopes: https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/linear-mixed-effects-models-with-one-random-factor.html Alternatively, you might not have pseudoreplications in your data and thus a random intercepts only model may be the more appropriate model anyways. Hopefully someone else with even more stats knowledge can comment here because I am still not certain what the real problem is. I also wanted to pass on this paper that encourages that if you can use a mixed ANOVA, it can more effectively model the random effects than the lme4 approach: Arnqvist, G. (2020). Mixed Models Offer No Freedom from Degrees of Freedom. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 35(4), 329â€“335.
