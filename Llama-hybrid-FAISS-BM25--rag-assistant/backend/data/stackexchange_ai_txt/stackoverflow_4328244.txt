Capture single row in a datagridview

I have a .NET windows app. I have a DataGridView which has a few rows in it. I had added a column containing buttons to allow the user to edit a row. This pops up a new form/dialog - my edit form. // Add a CellClick handler to handle clicks in the button column. dgv.CellClick += new DataGridViewCellEventHandler(dgv_CellClick); The code which fires this is: private void dgv_CellClick(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) { if (e.ColumnIndex == buttonCell) { // Get the id number int number = Convert.ToInt32(dgv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[0].Value); EditForm edit = new EditForm(number); edit.ShowDialog(); } } Problem My edit form displays (correctly). I make my changes, and close the form. It then loads again! It does this for the same number of rows in my Grid. Ie. It fires the code above once for each row in the DataGrid. How can I prevent this? Is there a more elegant solution?
