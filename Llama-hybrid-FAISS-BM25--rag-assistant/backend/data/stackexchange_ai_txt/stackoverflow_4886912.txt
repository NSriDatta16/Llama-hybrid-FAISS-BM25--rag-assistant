When or for what Reasons should folks turn PHP Safemode ON/OFF?

Question about PHP safe-mode: By default it is switched on in PLESK shared-hosting account environment: While on my site seems to work fine, but maybe it will work faster/better when off? I dont understand the below text very well, especially PHP's explanation: PLESK: By default, PHP is configured to operate in safe mode with functional restrictions. Some web applications may not work properly with safe mode enabled: If an application on a site fails due to safe mode, switch the safe mode off PHP.net: This feature has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged. The PHP safe mode is an attempt to solve the shared-server security problem. It is architecturally incorrect to try to solve this problem at the PHP level, but since the alternatives at the web server and OS levels aren't very realistic, many people, especially ISP's, use safe mode for now. Question1: When/for what reasons should folks turn Safemode ON? Question2: When/for what reasons should folks keep Safemode OFF?
