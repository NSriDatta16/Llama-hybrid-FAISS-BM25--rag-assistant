What you have here is a vector autoregression (VAR) with lag order $p=2$ and dimension $K=2$. You can think of it as a natural extension to the scalar autoregressive (AR) model. In an AR($p$) you have a scalar -valued time series where the current value is a linear combination of $p$ past values (skipping the intercept for simplicity), $$x_t=\varphi_1 x_{t-1}+\dotsc+\varphi_p x_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t.$$ In a VAR($p$) you have a vector -valued time series with the current value of each of $K$ (scalar) components being a linear combination of $p$ past values of itself and other (scalar) components. In vector and matrix terms, $$\mathbf{x}_t=\Phi_1 x_{t-1}+\dotsc+\Phi_p \mathbf{x}_{t-p}+\mathbf{\varepsilon}_t;$$ in scalar terms, $$x_{i,t}=\varphi_{1,i1} x_{1,t-1} + \dotsc + \varphi_{1,iK} x_{K,t-1} + \dotsc + \varphi_{p,i1} x_{1,t-p} + \dotsc + \varphi_{p,iK} x_{K,t-p} + \varepsilon_{i,t}.$$
