This depends on the language and the breadth of the organization and code. You're right that having a long list of namespaces scattered throughout the code makes it harder to read. But they do have a good purpose: code organization. Does your language give you the ability to alias these domains, or just to include the names once at the beginning of the file, via a "using" or "imports" statement? If that's the case, then in the body of code, you only need namespaces where they conflict.
