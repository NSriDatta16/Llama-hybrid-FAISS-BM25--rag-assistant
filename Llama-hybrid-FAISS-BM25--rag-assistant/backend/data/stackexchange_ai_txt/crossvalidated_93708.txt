Fit and predict logistic regression model for censored data?

Suppose I have a data frame such that: set.seed(2014) df 100] where y is the outcomes and futime are right censored of follow up time. I would fit a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes as if they are not censored. I saw there are some options such as tobit model, survival model and censReg package, but seems not very similar situation. Would somebody know the best way for this using age and sex as predictors?
