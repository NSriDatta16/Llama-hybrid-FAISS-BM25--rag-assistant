Suggestions for technical approaches to Licensing a CRM4 (ISV) add-on

The team I'm working with have created a CRM4 add-on which encapsulates 'standard' CRM customisations (such as modifying existing entities, adding our own custom entities), reports, plug-ins, and our own web pages (in IFrames) and web services. All pretty typical stuff. I'm writing all the requisite installation code to simplify / automate the install process so that our ISV add-on can downloaded and trialled by anyone, but have been asked to think of appropriate way restrict functionality - to encourage people to purchase a license. I'm not that familiar with the concepts/best practices/pitfalls when it comes to the 'licensing' of .net apps (especially CRM4 add-ons) so am asking you if you have any suggestions. We're looking for something fairly simple, and should be reasonably 'crackable', since we believe that having to enter a license code is generally a PITA. Does the CRM API have anything to offer the ISV developer? (I see that one is able to nterrogate the License entity, but I'm assuming that this is for the CRM license itself) Are there any existing code samples / projects / frameworks that are appropriate to use or implement? I'm tempted to create a Registry Key upon installation of the add-on which, if after a month the correct license key has not been entered, will restrict functionality. Is this the best way to do this? Have you seen any other add-ons do it differently / better? In terms of restricting functionality, I'm thinking of throwing InvalidPluginExecutionExceptions. Surely there must be a more 'graceful' way to do this? All thoughts and suggestions appreciated. Regards, Peter.
