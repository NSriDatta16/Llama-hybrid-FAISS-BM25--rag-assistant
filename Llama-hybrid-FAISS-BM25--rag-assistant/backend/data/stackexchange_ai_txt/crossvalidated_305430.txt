Why do we want to maximize the variance in Principal Component Analysis?

I understand that in PCA, maximizing the variance is for preserving as much variability (or information) as possible during the process of reducing the dimension of the data", and I read the previous question, too: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12395542/why-do-we-maximize-variance-during-principal-component-analysis However, I still do not quite understand why we want to maximize the variance from the perspective of moments ; for example, why don't we maximize higher-order moments, say, maximizing multiple even-order moments jointly (according to some desired weighting scheme), why just second moments?
