Possible to detect the *type of mobile device* via javascript or HTTP Headers?

I've got a request from a customer to automatically detect the type of mobile device (not the browser, the type. ex: Moto Q, Blackjack II, etc.) and automatically select the device from a drop down with a list of supported devices. So far I've found that the HTTP Headers (submitted by mobile IE) contain information such as Resolution UA-CPU (i've seen ARM from WM 2003 and x86 from WM5) User Agent (which basically just says Windows CE) The only thing I can think of right now is possibly using a combination of the resolution/cpu and making a "best guess" Any thoughts?
