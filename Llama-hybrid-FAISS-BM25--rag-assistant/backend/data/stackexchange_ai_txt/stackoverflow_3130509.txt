My strategy on this is simple. I separate production from development, both in CSS files and in JS files. in development, I can have up to 20 JS files and 10 CSS files, organization is super slick and easy, I always know where everything is. In production, all files are minified into 1js and 1css file, changes are always made in development and then "staged" to production so I gain the maintainability of the application and the performance in production. I use Yahoo minifier to minify my files but you can use whatever is convenient for you.
