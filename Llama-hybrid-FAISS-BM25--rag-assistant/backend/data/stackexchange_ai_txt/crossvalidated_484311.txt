As an example of the process mentioned in Greg Snow's answer: I quite often use high-level programming languages (Octave, Maxima[*], Gnuplot, Perl,...) to compute ratios between marginal likelihoods for Bayesian model comparison. If one tries to compute the ratio of marginal likelihoods directly, intermediate steps in the calculation (and sometimes the final result too) very frequently go beyond the capabilities of the floating-point number implementation in the interpreter/compiler, producing numbers so small that the computer can't tell them apart from zero, when all the important information is in the fact that those numbers are actually not quite zero. If, on the other hand, one works in log probabilities throughout, and takes the difference between the logarithms of the marginal likelihoods at the end, this problem is much less likely to occur. [*] Sometimes , Maxima evades the problem by using rational-number arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic, but one can't necessarily rely on this.
