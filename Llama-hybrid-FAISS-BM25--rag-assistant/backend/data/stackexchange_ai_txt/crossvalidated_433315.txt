Consider two values symmetrically placed around $0.5$ - like $0.4$ and $0.6$ or $0.25$ and $0.75$ . Their logs are not symmetric around $\log(0.5)$ . $\log(0.5-\epsilon)$ is further from $\log(0.5)$ than $\log(0.5+\epsilon)$ is. So when you average them you get something less than $\log(0.5)$ . Similarly, if you take a teeny interval around a collection of such pairs of symmetrically placed values, you still get the average of the logs of each pair being below $\log(0.5)$ ... and it's a simple matter to move from that observation to the definition of the expectation of the log. Indeed, usually, $E(t(X))\neq t(E(X))$ unless $t$ is linear.
