Nested Dynamic PHP Class

I may just need a terminology update, but I have been playing in Magento and Joomla, and they do references like $mage = new Mage; $mage->block('blockname'); where class Mage through some process I am failing to figure out is calling: class blockname extends something{ } Don't quote me on that code, however I am looking to do something like that where I have a file that I can do $myscript->block('blockname'); and it will load and call the file with class blockname.
