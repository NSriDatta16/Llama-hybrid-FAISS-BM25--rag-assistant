If $j$ does not go too high, I see no reason not to use simple euclidean distances. The data is already scaled and all variables are of the same type (interval). As distance measures go, this is an easy case. I'm assuming that there is no specific hierarchy among the variables. i.e. that $j=1$ does not measure something like the proportion of measures flagged "low", $j=2$ "medium" and $j=3$ "high". If that is the case, then a record with most of the proportion in high is more different from one with mostly low as it is from one with mostly medium. That would complicate things. If your only objective is to visualize the data, I am not even sure you need to use a distance matrix. You could do a simple PCA.
