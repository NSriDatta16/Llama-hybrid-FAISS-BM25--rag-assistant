C parameter does not affect accuracy (LibSVM)

I'm working on LibSVM and I'm using linear kernel. But i have a problem with C parameter, it does not affect accuracy during test set! Is it possible? I send a picture with the distributions of the two classes and the separator line. This line did not change when I changed C. I have no idea why! :-(
