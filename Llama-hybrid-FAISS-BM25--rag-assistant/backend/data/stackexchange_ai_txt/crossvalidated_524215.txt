Coefficient of variation in a gamma location-scale mixed model

In ecology, location-scale mixed models are often used to extract the so-called 'coefficient of individual variation for predictability' (e.g. see, for instance, this paper ), which is defined as the coefficient of variation for the cluster-varying intercept parameters in the model for the scale of the distribution. Imagine we have a model describing some trait $y$ measured at instance $i$ and individual $j$ : \begin{equation} y_{ij} \sim Normal(\mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij}) \end{equation} where the model of the location is: \begin{equation} \mu_{ij} = \alpha + \nu_{1j} \end{equation} and the model of the scale (standard deviation) is: \begin{equation} \log(\sigma_{ij}) = \zeta + \nu_{2j} \end{equation} where for simplicity we assume that the individual-level terms are independent: \begin{equation} \nu_{1j} = Normal(0, \sigma_{v1}) \end{equation} \begin{equation} \nu_{2j} = Normal(0, \sigma_{\nu2}) \end{equation} From this model, the coefficient of variation for predictability is defined from the lognormal distribution as: \begin{equation} CV_{p} = \sqrt{ e^{\sigma_{\nu2}^2} - 1 } \end{equation} Recently, I have been working with the same model but with a Gamma likelihood, where the Gamma distribution is parameterized using shape and rate parameters $\kappa$ and $\theta$ , respectively, which relate to the location $\eta$ and scale (standard deviation) $\phi$ of the Gamma as: \begin{equation} \kappa = \eta^2 / \phi^2 \end{equation} \begin{equation} \theta = \kappa / \eta \end{equation} Now, the location and scale models above both use the log-link function: \begin{equation} \log(\eta_{ij}) = \alpha + \nu_{1j} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \log(\phi_{ij}) = \zeta + \nu_{2j} \end{equation} In the Gamma distribution, the variance is a function of the mean, i.e. $\phi^2 = \frac{\kappa}{\theta^2} = \frac{\eta}{\theta}$ , which makes it more difficult to calculate residual variances for variance components analyses and requires approximations, such as the trigamma function , where $\text{trigamma}(\kappa_{ij})$ would provide the residual variance for each individual at each measurement instance. Because of this, I think it's also non-trivial to calculate the coefficient of predictability for a Gamma likelihood model. Does anyone know the exact relationship? My own attempt is that the coefficient of variation of the Gamma is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa}}$ , which can be calculated for the population averages from the above model as: \begin{equation} CV_{gamma} = \frac{\exp(\zeta) }{ \exp(\alpha) } \end{equation} Thus, would replacing the population-average scale, $\exp(\zeta)$ , with the standard deviation of group-level standard deviations, $\sigma_{\nu2}$ , also work to represent the coefficient of predictability?
