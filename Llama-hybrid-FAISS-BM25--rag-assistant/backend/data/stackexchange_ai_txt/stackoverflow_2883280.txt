You just need to make multiple VCS Roots in your Administration settings and apply each one to the appropriate build. For instance, if svn://196.168.0.1/software is your SVN repository, then you might have VCS Roots for each of the following projects: svn://196.168.0.1/software/agent/trunk svn://196.168.0.1/software/server/trunk svn://196.168.0.1/software/database/trunk "Branch-specific" revisions is sort of a misnomer, but each of those VCS Roots will use the branch's most recent repository revision number in its build.vcs.number .
