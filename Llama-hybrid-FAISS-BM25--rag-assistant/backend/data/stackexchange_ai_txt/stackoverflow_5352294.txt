Magnolia CMS: Duplicate data validation in spring blossom paragraph

I have a paragraph defined in spring blossom which consists of edit,file, select and date controls. Now I want to allow only one data entry for each date in that page, i.e. date field should be unique. How can I do duplicate data validation based on date field in DailogValidator? Thanks, Rupali
