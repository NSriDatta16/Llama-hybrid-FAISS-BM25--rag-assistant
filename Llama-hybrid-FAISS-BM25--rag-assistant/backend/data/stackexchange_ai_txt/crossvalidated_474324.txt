Point estimator for product of independent RVs

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent random variables. Given an (iid) random sample of size $n$ of $X$ and a random sample of size $n$ of $Y$ , what is a good way to estimate the mean of their product, $E[XY]$ ? The most obvious estimator is the sample mean: multiply each $X_i$ and $Y_i$ , and then average over $n$ . Another unbiased estimator would be to take the average of the $X_i$ 's, then take the average of the $Y_i$ 's, and finally multiply these two averages. Which of these two unbiased estimators is better (is less noisy or has lower variance)? Is there an estimator that has even smaller variance than the two proposed?
