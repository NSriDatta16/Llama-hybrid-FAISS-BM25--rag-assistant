md5 hash for password string in GWT/GWT-Ext?

I am currently trying to modify an existing GWT-Ext application, that is using plain text passwords in its MySql database. My plan was to use md5 hashes, as the existing passwords can be easily altered with the MySql function and I was expecting to find an easy solution for the GWT-Ext side as well. But as I found out, java.security is not supported by GWT and there doesn't seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the password string to a md5 hash on client side. Only "solution" I found so far, is to re implement a md5 method via JSNI as described here: http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/browse_thread/thread/ad09475a9944c9f8 There is an existing user extension for Ext-JS, but I couldn't find anything for GWT-Ext: http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=133516 Does anybody know a more elegant/simple way to solve this problem? Maybe I should use something else instead of md5 to make sure the passwords are encrypted? Cheers Frank
