How to calculate the expected value of a time series just from the data

in this question Can stationary time series contain regulary cycles and periods with different fluctuations I was told that stationary time series do not have regular cycles and that having constant cycles implies that the expectation value is not constant. One of the properties of stationary time series is "Expected value is constant for every t". Now I am wondering why this is the case. Let's have a look at this blue time series: I personally would argue that it has a constant expected value which is just the mean in this case because on average this is the value of the time series. How can I show that this time series in fact does not have a constant expectation value. I do not have any further information about the time series but just the values themselves. How could I calculate the expectation value for every t and show that they are not constant for every t which would imply that this time series is not stationary. I would like to know just from the time series if this time series is stationary and how I can calculate the expected value (because this is essential for saying whether the time series is stationary or not). I'd appreciate every further comment and would be quite thankful for your help. Reminder: As this question is really important for me and I am not entirely satisfied with the answers given so far, I will award a bounty for a more detailed answer. I'll be quite happy for your help.
