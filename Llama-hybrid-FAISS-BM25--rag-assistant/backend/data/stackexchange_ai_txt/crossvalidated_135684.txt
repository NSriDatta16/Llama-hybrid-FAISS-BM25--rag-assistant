First, let me say that there is no single answer for your question. There is multiple examples of when you can (or have to) use simulation. I will try to give you few examples below. Second, notice that there are multiple ways you can define a "simulation" , so the answer at least partly depends on the definition you choose. Examples: 1. You are a Bayesian statistician , so simulation is your method of choice for doing statistics. There are non-simulation-based ways approaches to Bayesian statistics however in vast majority of cases you use simulation. For learning more check "Bayesian data analysis" book by Gelman (or other possible resources). 2. You want to assess the performance of statistical method. Say you have designed some statistical test $T$ that was designed for estimating some parameter $\theta$ given empirical data. Now you want to check if it really does what you want it to do. You could take some data sample and use your test on this data - however if you need a statistical test to know the $\theta$, then how do you know if your test works fine having only the data..? Of course you can compare the results with estimates of other statistical test, but what if the other test does not estimate $\theta$ correctly..? In this case you can use simulation. What you can do is you generate some fake data given your parameter $\theta$ and then check if your estimated value is the same as true value of $\theta$ (that you know in advance since you have chosen it). Using simulation lets you also to check different scenarios (sample size, different distributions of data, different amount of noise in your data etc.). 3. You don't have the data or it is very limited. Say you want to know what would be the possible outcome of nuclear war. Unfortunately (hopefully) there was no nuclear war before, so you do not have any data. In this case you can use computer simulation where you make some assumptions about reality and then let computers create parallel virtual realities where the nuclear war happens, so you have some samples of possible outcomes. 4. Your statistical model does not fit the software or is complicated. This approach is advocated, for example, by Gelman and Hill in "Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models" , where they describe simulation-based Bayesian estimation as a "next step" in regression modeling. 5. You want to learn about possible outcomes of a complicated process. Imagine that you want to forecast the future outcome of some complicated process, the problem is however that the behavior of your process is chaotic and given different inputs you get different outputs, while the number of possible inputs is very large. Generally, this was the case because Monte Carlo simulation methods were invented by physicists and mathematicians working on nuclear bomb during World War II. With simulation you try different inputs and gather samples so to get a general idea about the possible outcomes. 6. Your data does not meet the criteria for some statistical method , e.g. it has skewed distribution while it ought to be normal. In some cases this is not really a problem , however sometimes it is, so simulation-based methods like bootstrap were invented. 7. To test a theoretical model against reality. You have a theoretical model than describes some process, e.g. spread of epidemic through a social network. You can use the model to generate some data so that you can compare if the simulated is similar to the real data. Lada Adamic gives a multiple examples of such a usage for Social Network Analysis on her Coursera class (see some demos here ). 8. To generate "hypothesis 0" data. You generate a fake (random) data so to compare the real data to it. If there were any significant effects or trends in your data then it should differ from the data generated at random. This approach is advocated by Buja et al. (2009) in their paper "Statistical inference for exploratory data analysis and model diagnostics" where they propose how using plots could facilitate an exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing (see also documentation of nullabor R package that implements those ideas).
