You have to create an -(IBAction)abc:(id)sender; IBAction in your .h file, and a respective method in your implementation (.m) file. In Interface Builder, you then have to right click on the button, and from the circle next to Tap Up Inside drag over to your File's Owner box. Then let go over abc and you're golden. Implement the code you want to run in your abc() method.
