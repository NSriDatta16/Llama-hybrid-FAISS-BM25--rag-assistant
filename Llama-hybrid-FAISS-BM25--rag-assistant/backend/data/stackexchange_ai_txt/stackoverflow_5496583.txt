Magento ::: auto display products from child categories on top (parent) category without 'is anchor'

All my products are assigned to sub categories - I want All products to also display on the parent categories without explicitly assigning them. is anchor is not good for me, because it does not use the seo-friendly urls for the sub categories, and this is an important requirement for me. Is there another way I can achieve this, even with an extension?
