This should be what you are looking for "Enhanced: Drag and move WinForms" public partial class MyDraggableForm : Form { private const int WM_NCHITTEST = 0x84; private const int HTCLIENT = 0x1; private const int HTCAPTION = 0x2; /// /// Handling the window messages /// protected override void WndProc(ref Message message) { base.WndProc(ref message); if (message.Msg == WM_NCHITTEST && (int)message.Result == HTCLIENT) message.Result = (IntPtr)HTCAPTION; } public MyDraggableForm() { InitializeComponent(); } } As the blog post states, this is a way to "fool" the system. This way you don't need to think about mouse up/down events.
