This is similar to Ben's question, but are you just trying to test whether a multi-variate Poisson distribution fits this data? Your major problem here is that you're having to estimate the poisson mean for each cell from the data that you're trying to get a p-value/likelihood score/whatever for. Now strictly speaking this may not be a problem, but if you don't have enough data for any of these individually, you're not going to have enough data for them collectively without some additional restriction on your hypothesis (which could come in a variety of forms). Here's an example of the model you're vaguely describing. Let $i$ be each cell and $Y_i$ be the count within each cell. $$ Y_i\sim Poisson(\lambda_i)\\ \lambda_i=\mu+\alpha_i $$ This is a general Poisson regression where the number of parameters is equal to the number of observations. Unless the ratio of those two approaches 0, your estimates for the number of parameters are not statistically consistent and your likelihood ratio won't tell you very much. Now the model Ben Describes is a little better if you have the time interval data: here let $Y_ij$ by the time between $(j-1)th$ and $j$th observations: $$ Y_{ij}\sim Exp(\lambda_i)\\ \lambda_i=\mu+\alpha_i $$ This is a little bit better, and if the ratio is small enough you may be able to test this via something like a Q-Q Plot on the probabilities of each time (which again, credit to Ben, is roughly what he's describing). If the number of locations is roughly the log of the number of observations, you may be in business there, but that QQ-Plot is still going to have some real bias, especially toward making the big outliers look more normal. Some real improvements would be if there is any kind of additional knowledge you could impose on the problem. Like for example if you could say that sensors in nearby locations should have similar rates of firing, then you could leverage that knowledge by imposing a linear model on lat/long or maybe a thin-plate spline if you're not sure how the spatial relationship should look. Or maybe if the sensors of a certain "type" and you could say that sensors of the same "type" should have similar rates, and you could again make it linear and do an Anova test, or make a random effects model or something like that. Anyway, there are a lot of ways to go with this if you have some kind of additional knowledge, or if your # of locations is $O(\log n)$. HTH
