Photo Organizer Server

Does anybody know of a server side project that can be used to organize photos? I have tons of images and I want to have them on a server. The functionality that I'm looking is very simple: be able to browse large sets of images (something like google images) The software needs to be generate the thumbnails. Download the full resolution image. Some kind of security would be nice! A PHP based software would be ideal. Tks.
