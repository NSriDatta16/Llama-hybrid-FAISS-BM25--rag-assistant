Column-level privileges vs. legacy application

I got a request to implement Column-level privileges, for example: GRANT UPDATE("column1") ON "TABLE" TO ROLE; But I found that client applications ( in Delphi+ODAC ) always emits SQL updates like: update TABLE set column1=:column1,column2=:column2,column3=:column3,...etc where id_c=:id_c; what causes Oracle to always throw ORA-01031: insufficient privileges , even if only column1 was changed. The obvious solution is to change the client application so that it emits SQL updates only with changed columns, but it looks like quite a lot of coding. Is there any more elegant solution possible? Edit: I forgot to mention that there is considerable number of hardcoded insert/update queries in my Delphi sources. ODAC cannot help in this case.
