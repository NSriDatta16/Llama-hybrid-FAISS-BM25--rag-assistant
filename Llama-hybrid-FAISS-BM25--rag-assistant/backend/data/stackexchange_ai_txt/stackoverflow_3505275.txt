Click and drag not working on iPhone

Check this site. It's working fine in all browsers but when I run this in iPhone Safari, it does not work correctly. It's just a JavaScript code that finds click and drag event. Using click and drag I am changing images. Please click and drag images. I need some special code for making this work in iPhone Safari.
