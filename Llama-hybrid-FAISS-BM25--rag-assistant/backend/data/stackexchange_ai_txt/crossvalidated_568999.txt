Year fixed effect in time series data

I am following one country (USA) over time (2005-2010). In this time series analysis, I want to put a year or a time fixed effect to take into account the variation in the outcome that takes place over time and that is not attributed to my other explanatory variables. However, everytime I run the regression without year fixed effects, everything is good. With year fixed effect (which is just the year going from 2005 to 2010), the entire regression results is basically just the coefficient (no standard errors, t stats, confidence interval, they are all blank). I needed suggestions about how I can add in a time fixed effect, while not messing the results.
