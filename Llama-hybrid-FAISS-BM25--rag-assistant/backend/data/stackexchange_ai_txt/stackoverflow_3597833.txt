If allowing videos, you should either validate against an acceptable object format that matches the expected values coming from YouTube and other systems OR (ideally) create a UI that handles the embedding for the user.

It had the benefit of making the user experience pretty streamlined as well as protecting the system from a potential vector of attack.
