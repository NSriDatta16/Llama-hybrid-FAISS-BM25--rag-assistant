How to plot a marginal histogram correctly? Why is my plot different to the one in a textbook?

Chapter 1 of "Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective" by Kevin Patrick Murphy gives this figure (fig_1), and says this is a pairwise scatter plot on iris dataset. The diagonal plots the marginal histograms of the 4 features. This post , gives this figure (fig_2) to illustrate "marginal histograms". I am trying to plot a histogram by using the approach that plotted out fig_2, with first feature of iris dataset, that is, sepal length. Here is the code, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn import datasets import seaborn as sns; sns.set(style="white", color_codes=True) iris = datasets.load_iris() _ = plt.hist(iris.data[:,0], bins = 11) which plotted out this figure (fig_3.) Which looks different to the top left in fig_1. I've searched whole site and got this and this , none of them gives explanation what a marginal histograms is.
