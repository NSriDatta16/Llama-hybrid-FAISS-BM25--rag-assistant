How to use DLM with Kalman filtering for forecasting

Could someone walk me through an example on how to use DLM Kalman filtering in R on a time series. Say I have a these values (quarterly values with yearly seasonality); how would you use DLM to predict the next values? And BTW, do I have enough historical data (what is the minimum)? 89 2009Q1 82 2009Q2 89 2009Q3 131 2009Q4 97 2010Q1 94 2010Q2 101 2010Q3 151 2010Q4 100 2011Q1 ? 2011Q2 I'm looking for a R code cookbook-style how-to step-by-step type of answer. Accuracy of the prediction is not my main goal, I just want to learn the sequence of code that gives me a number for 2011Q2, even if I don't have enough data.
