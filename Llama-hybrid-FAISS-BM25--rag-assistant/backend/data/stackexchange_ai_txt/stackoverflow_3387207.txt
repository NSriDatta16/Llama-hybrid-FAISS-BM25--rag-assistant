XSLT, how to only process first X items?

I am trying to use XSL to convert a news feed into a fragment of html for insertion into a web page. The news feed is several hundred items long and so I only want to include the latest 10 headlines... The xsl is below, I was thinking I could have a counter and break out of the loop after the desired number of iterations. However after a bit of reading it seems xsl is not designed to be used this way. What is the "best" way to get the desired result in xsl? Many thanks for any suggestions. edit: Doesn't seem to let me post xml snippets. But the pattern I am following was lifted from here: http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0407.html
