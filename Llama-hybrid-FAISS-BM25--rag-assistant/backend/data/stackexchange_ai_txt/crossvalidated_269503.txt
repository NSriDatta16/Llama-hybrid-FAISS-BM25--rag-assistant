Predictions remain same for ARIMA model?

I have a table which has data CO2 emission of the world from 1960 to 2011. After going through some tutorial i performed ARIMA method on my dataset,but the prediction of CO2 emission for the next 10 years remains the same.I have already gone through some post,but I am unable to understand it.Below is the Table. If ARIMA doesn't work , Is there any better method for predicting time series?
