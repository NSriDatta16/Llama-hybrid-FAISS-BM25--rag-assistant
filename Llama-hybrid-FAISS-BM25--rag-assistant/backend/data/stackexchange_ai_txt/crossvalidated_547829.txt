PCA explained_variance_ratio in Python

I wonder if I can presume that if higher sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio), better the separation of groups? I wish to randomly check PCA on 100 samples and I wish to plot only the one with best separation. Is checking the highest value from explained variance ration the way to go? For example 1.st PCA(3) has a sum variance ratio 0.7 2.nd PCA(3) has a sum variance ratio 0.9 Can I assume 2nd one will give me a better plot? Thanks!
