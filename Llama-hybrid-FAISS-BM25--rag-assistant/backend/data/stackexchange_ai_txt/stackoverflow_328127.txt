How do I move a wpf window into a negative top value?

If I use dragMove the wpf window will not move to a location where the y value is negative. I can however set the windows top value to a negative value. Is there a simple way to enable dragMove to allow the top of the window to be moved above the displays 0 position? Edit: It seems that this is the default window's handling of moveWindow. Verified with a call to SendMessage( hwnd, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_MOVE, null);
