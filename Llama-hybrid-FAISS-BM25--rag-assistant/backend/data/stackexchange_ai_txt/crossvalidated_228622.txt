Handling Null value in Logistic Regression

In a data set, there is a variable previous_contact which captures how many days have passed since last contact was made. It takes values like 0,1,2 ... 50. And for records when no contact was made earlier, it is NULL . I am trying to build a logistic regression and previous_contact is an independent variable in the model. How to capture the NULL in the variable? One idea which I had was to code NULL as a large number like 9999 . It will mean if the person was not contacted before, it is equivalent to him being contacted a very long time back. I was wondering if there is a better way to do this, because won't the result change if we code NULL as 9999 or 99999 or something else? Frequency of NA is ~95% in the data
