It's easy to illustrate how a high leverage point might not be influential in the case of a simple linear model: The blue line is a regression line based on all the data, the red line ignores the point at the top right of the plot. This point fits the definition of a high leverage point you just provided as it is far away from the rest of the data. Because of that, the regression line (the blue one) has to pass close to it. But since its position largely fits the pattern observed in the rest of the data, the other model would predict it very well (i.e. the red line already passes close to it in any case) and it is therefore not particularly influential. Compare this to the following scatterplot: Here, the point on the right of the plot is still a high leverage point but this time it does not really fit the pattern observed in the rest of the data. The blue line (the linear fit based on all the data) passes very close but the red line does not. Including or excluding this one point changes the parameter estimates dramatically: It has a lot of influence. Note that the definitions you cited and the examples I just gave might seem to imply that high leverage/influential points are, in some sense, univariate “outliers” and that the fitted regression line will pass close to points with the highest influence but it need not be the case. In this last example, the observation on the bottom right has a (relatively) large effect on the fit of the model (visible again through the difference between the red and the blue lines) but it still appears to be far away from the regression line while being undetectable in univariate distributions (represented here by the “rugs” along the axes).
