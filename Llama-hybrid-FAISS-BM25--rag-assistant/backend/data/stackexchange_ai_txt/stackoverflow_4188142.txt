Here is what I did to make it work: tasks.rake require 'database_cleaner' require 'dummy_tasks' namespace :db do task :dummy => :environment do DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation DatabaseCleaner.clean Rake::Task['db:seed'].invoke end end There may be a more elegant way to do this, but this should at least prevent you from having to add the database_cleaner gem to the app Gemfile
