What you need to improve your model is not normalisation, but create extra features which could affect the target. e.g. captured the change across months in independent variables: webvisits.month2-webvisits.month1 or average, max of 3 months. capture the increasing and decreasing trend. Again just webvisits might not be good predictors, you might need to include other information in model, like what they did in the webvisit. Hope this helps!
