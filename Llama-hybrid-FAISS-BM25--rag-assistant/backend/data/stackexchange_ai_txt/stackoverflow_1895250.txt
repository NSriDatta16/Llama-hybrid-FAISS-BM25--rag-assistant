Also you can use XSL transformations to separate logic from presentation. XSLT-transformer receives XML tree and generates HTML output, using XSLT transformations to produce presentation. But XSLT is quite difficult for studying and demands knowledge of XML and XPath. I have been using Smarty in my recent projects, but my current project is build on XSLT templates, so I had to learn XSLT. It seems more complicated to me, that Smarty and its ancestor FastTemplate. However, XSLT is another way to separate logic from presenatation. Advantage of XML & XSLT is that these technologies are used with different languages, not only with PHP. Besides there is one more template engine - PHP template engine . It is default template engine for Drupal CMS. I'm not Drupal expert, so I can say nothing about it. However it uses PHP syntax, so it is quite simple to learn. You can read about XSLT here . I hope my answer will be useful for you.
