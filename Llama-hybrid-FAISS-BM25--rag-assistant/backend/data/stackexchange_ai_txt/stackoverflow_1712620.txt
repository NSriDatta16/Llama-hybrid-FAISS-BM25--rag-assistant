Maybe both options are a bit wrong, because neither version of the class has any behaviour. It's hard to comment further without more context. See http://www.pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask Now lets imagine that your FeedItem class has become wonderfully popular and is being used by projects all over the place. You decide you need (as other answers have suggested) validate the URL that has been provided. Happy days, you have written a setter for the URL. You edit this, validate the URL and throw an exception if it is invalid. You release your new version of the class and everyone one using it is happy. (Let's ignored checked vs unchecked exceptions to keep this on-track). Except, then you get a call from an angry developer. They were reading a list of feeditems from a file when their application starts up. And now, if someone makes a little mistake in the configuration file your new exception is thrown and the whole system doesn't start up, just because one frigging feed item was wrong! You may have kept the method signature the same, but you have changed the semantics of the interface and so it breaks dependant code. Now, you can either take the high-ground and tell them to re-write their program right or you humbly add setURLAndValidate .
