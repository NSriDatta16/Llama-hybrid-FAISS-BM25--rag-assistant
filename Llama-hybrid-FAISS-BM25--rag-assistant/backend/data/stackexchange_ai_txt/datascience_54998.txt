Ways of filtering erronous email addresses using NLP?

Background: I have a database of user information, in which they registered through a website. Objective: I would like to filter out erroneous emails, not by if it is malformed (i.e. it's missing an @-sign), but rather by "weird strings" in the "local-part" of the address. So examples of erroneous email address are things like: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz@gmail.com asdfasdfasdf@gmail.com yourenotgettingmyrealemail@gmail.com 123@yahoo.com test@test.com I know most of these require some "human" interpretation to figure that they're probably not real, but I was wondering if there are any algorithms that can help me out.
