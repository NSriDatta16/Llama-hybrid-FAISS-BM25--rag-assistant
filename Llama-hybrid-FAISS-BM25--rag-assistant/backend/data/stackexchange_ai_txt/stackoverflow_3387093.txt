^ is the beginning of the string, and $ is the end. \s means a whitespace character (which in JavaScript specifically means tab, vertical tab, form feed, space, non-break space, byte order mark, Unicode space separator (category Zs), line feed, carriage return, line separator, or paragraph separator), and + means 1 or more. | is alternation, a choice between two possibilities. g is the global flag. So the regex means the beginning, then one or more whitespace, or one or more whitespace, then the end. Then, we replace all matches (since it's global) with the empty string.
