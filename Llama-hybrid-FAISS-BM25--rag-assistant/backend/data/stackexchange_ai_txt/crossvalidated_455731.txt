In the early stages of an epidemic growth is exponential. The two key parameters are R0 (average number of people infected by each person who catches it) and incubation time. The goal is to reduce R0 - once it is less than 1.0 the epidemic is over. Most counties are still at that stage for COVID-19. Once a significant fraction of the population becomes immune, an exponential model is no longer a good fit. See user953847's great answer above. Sextus Empiricus points out that actual data are irregular. That is true of any real data. Nevertheless, ideal models can be useful as a way to find and communicate trends underlying the irregularities.
