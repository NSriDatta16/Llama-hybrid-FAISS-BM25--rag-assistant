I don't think you can do this. The AT command-set is only for doing "phonestuff". Calling, texting (which in itself is an extension), and such. The usual reason for usb-modems to have built-in storage is so you can store the drivers there. This would let you use the modem on any computer without needing to connect to the internet to get the drivers.
