The test statistic will be obtained by calculating the Kendall correlation of the time series with the sequence $1,2,...,n$. Getting identical Kendall correlations with very small samples is not a surprise. When there's no ties, this correlation corresponds to counting the number of increases (times $y_j>y_i$ when $j>i$) minus number of decreases (times $y_j i$) divided by number of such pairs. Your 3 sets of ranks are rank(x);rank(y);rank(z) [1] 3 5 4 1 2 [1] 5 3 1 4 2 [1] 5 3 1 4 2 the last two sets are identical, so the Kendall correlation for z must be the same as for y. Let's just look at the first two, then. "3 5 4 1 2" has 3 increases (3 vs 5, 3 vs 4 and 1 vs 2) and the rest are decreases. "5 3 1 4 2" has 3 increases (3 vs 4, 1 vs 4 and 1 vs 2) with the rest decreases. This means the Kendall correlation with time in each case is $(3 - 7)/10 = -0.4$ ... which is what your test says they are; the p-values are then the same because the sample sizes are the same.
