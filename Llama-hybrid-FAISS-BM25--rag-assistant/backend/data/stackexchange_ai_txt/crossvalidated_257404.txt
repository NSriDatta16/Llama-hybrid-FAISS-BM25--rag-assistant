Models that train on Mean Absolute Error or similar?

I'm trying to do time series prediction and I'm interested in training on MAE or other custom loss functions. For my problem I'd prefer having errors of {0, 10, 0, 10, 0, 10} as supposed to {5, 5, 5, 5, 5,5} so that I am occasionally hitting i.e. getting error=0. I tried rlm() in R and that saw an improvement versus lm() since I'm guessing it's giving less conservative projections and not worried about missing on outliers, so for that reason I'd like to try more models that use MAE or allow for custom loss function. Linear models have been working best so far, but I'm interested in suggestions on any models that might help. Thanks
