The filter values are learned. Keras, along with every other deep learning software, does not randomly produce the values that go in a CNN filter. Through minimization of error of a particular kind defined by the “loss function“ you specify, the best parameters are discovered. This is quite similar to how OLS linear regression finds the best parameters via $\hat{\beta}_{OLS}=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ , except that the neural network does not have a nice, closed-form solution to the error minimization problem. (For that matter, neither does a logistic regression.) Also, there is no upper bound on the number of filters you can use.
