Tableau will work best for you when you feed it raw data. What you're doing is like taking a half-baked dish to Tableau and asking it to sort out, list, and change the ingredients without knowing what they are! Take the data you're pivoting in Excel, and pivot it in Tableau instead. This will allow the aggregates to update dynamically alongside the filters. In general, pivoting things in Tableau is as easy as in Excel -- Drag your measures out and choose aggregates appropriately. Once you have your aggregate calculations built, you can filter by the calculation results instead of the "static, flat excel" results.
