ReSharper Code Cleanup/Reformat Code feature vs Versioning Control Systems

ReSharper Code cleanup feature (with " reorder members " and " reformat code " enabled) is really great. You define a layout template using XML, then a simple key combination reorganizes your whole source file (or folder/project/solution) according to the rules you set in the template. Anyway, do you think that could be a problem regarding VCS like subversion, cvs, git, etc. ? Is there a chance that it causes many undesired conflicts ? Thank you.
