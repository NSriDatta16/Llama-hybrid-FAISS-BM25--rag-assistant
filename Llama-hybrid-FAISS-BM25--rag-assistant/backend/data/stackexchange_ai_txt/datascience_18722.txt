You could simply implement the class_weight from sklearn : Let's import the module first from sklearn.utils import class_weight In order to calculate the class weight do the following class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', np.unique(y_train), y_train) Thirdly and lastly add it to the model fitting model.fit(X_train, y_train, class_weight=class_weights) Attention : I edited this post and changed the variable name from class_weight to class_weight s in order to not to overwrite the imported module. Adjust accordingly when copying code from the comments.
