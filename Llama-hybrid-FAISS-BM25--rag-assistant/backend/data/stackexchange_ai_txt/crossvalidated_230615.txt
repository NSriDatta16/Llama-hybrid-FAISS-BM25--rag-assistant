Interpreting different outputs from beta regression

I have the following data structure: Percent-"yes" Average-score Region 70% 0.03 A 66% 0.07 B 57% 0.09 C 85% 0.06 D .... etc I have aggregated data by regions. The outcome variable is Percent-"yes" (indicating the percent of people answering "yes" for a survey question) and explanatory variable is Average-score (indicating the average of a score by all the people in that region). The statistical model used is beta regression using logit link function. The beta-coefficient for Average-score is 0.06. I interpret it as " For 1 unit increase in Average-score, there is a 0.06 units increase in log-odds of Percent-"yes" ". A colleague told me the 2 bolded elements in the statement are wrong, I have a tough time figuring out why that is the case despite exhausting all my reference material. Any insights or material I can check out to figure it out?
