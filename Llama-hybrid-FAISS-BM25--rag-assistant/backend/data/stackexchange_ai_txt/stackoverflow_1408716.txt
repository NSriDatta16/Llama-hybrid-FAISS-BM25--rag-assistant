Might I ask why you want to store this in a struct? Is it being sent across a network? As far storage goes, compilers (or linkers, I'm not sure) can store the same string in one place in the data section if the same exact string is used more than once so using the macro isn't a bad thing. Personally I would do something like this: const char *GetSoftwareVersion (void) { return "Version 7.0.1"; } If it is for a plugin-like DLL architecture, the function version is the most appopriate (such as the following: const char *pluginVer = dll->GetSoftwareVersion(); // where GetSoftwareVersion is of type: typedef const char *(* GetSoftwareVersionProc)(void);
