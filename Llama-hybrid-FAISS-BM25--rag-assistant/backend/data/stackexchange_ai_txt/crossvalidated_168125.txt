This is a question that any statistician has when building models when prediction is the objective. You can try many transformations of the dependent variable (log seems reasonable if you deal with positive values) and the independent ones until you find something succesful. Sound like lots of combinations, especially when you have many variables. Or you might try to include variable interaction terms. GLMs are a good way to create regression models when you assume a specific link function between your dependent and independent variables. The most common one is the binomial link function (logistic regression) when you want your estimation to be a probability (from 0 to 1), but not suitable for your case of course. For you case try a GLM that performs poisson regression using a log link function as a starting point. I expect it to be similar to your model when you log-transformed your dependent variable (but it's not exactly the same). https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat504/node/169 If your independent variables are correlated then a regression tree could be more suitable as it accounts automatically for interactions and automatically picks the variables that best predict your dependent variable. http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cart.html For any method you use you can always check prediction by plotting actual values vs. predicted, so to spot where you underestimate/overestimate.
