Changing CR/LF output type in Visual Studio

I have a c# project in my Visual studio 2008 which when built, outputs a bunch of files in a temp directory for other programs to use i.e. JsTestDriver, JsCoverage, etc (all a bit Unix-related). Trouble is, everytime when the files were generated, they seem to contain weird return carriage/line feed which upsets the programs that would use them next. What I'm currently doing is manually create a notepad file, rename it to a different name, then copy and paste the entire content of the generated file (and save) to solve this problem. This is, of course, tedious and not something I enjoy doing (ultimately I want this whole process to be automated). So my question is: how do I get Visual Studio to output the correct/proper CR/LF so I no longer need to go through the manual process? If the above is too vague, I'll be happy to clarify. Thanks in advance.
