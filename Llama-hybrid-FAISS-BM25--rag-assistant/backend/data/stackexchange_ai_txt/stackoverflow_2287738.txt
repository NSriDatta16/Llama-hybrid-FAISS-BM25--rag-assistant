I use the code below and it works. Telling you the truth I did not undersyand yet properly all the header that I send, I still did not have the time to investigate, I found explanations in: Sources: http://www.opendesigns.org/forum/discussion/1437/php-download-counter/#pgbottom http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?t=115815&highlight=PHP+download+counter http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php#83384 anyway it works: /* TODO: still to be read and better understood. */ //no caching (I don't uderstand what is this part useful for) header("Pragma: public"); //? header("Expires: 0"); //? header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); //? header("Cache-Control: private", false); //? //sending download file header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream"); //application/zip can use application/octet-stream that is more generic it works because in now days browsers are able to detect file anyway header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"" . basename($file_serverfullpath) . "\""); //ok header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); //? header("Content-Length: " . filesize($file_serverfullpath)); //ok readfile($file_serverfullpath);
