Your data is a classic example of data where there is more noise than signal and therefore unpredictable, no matter what ever data mining /time series approach you use, it is going to give you poor predictions unless you know a priori by domain knowledge what $caused$ the level shifts and outliers. Also techniques like arima and exponential smoothing needs equally space time series which you do not have in your example. That said two reasonable approaches: Model it deterministically, again this needs knowledge of outliers Use last value for all future prediction ( this is simple exponential smoothing)
