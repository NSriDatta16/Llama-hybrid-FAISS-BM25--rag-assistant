When should I opt for IsolatedStorage versus AppData file storage?

I've recently discovered the IsolatedStorage facilities in .net, and I'm wondering when I should use them for my application data versus when I should use (e.g.) Application.LocalUserAppDataPath . One thing that I've noticed is that Application doesn't exist outside of a winforms app, so it seems that IsolatedStorage might make sense for a class library that needs some specific storage, especially if that library might be used by both a web app and a winforms app. Is that the only distinguishing point, or is there more to it? (As a rule, up 'til now, I've made the app provide a file stream to the library when the library might need some sort of external storage--- in general, I don't like the idea of a library having some sort of state external to the caller's context.)
