best articles about organizing code files in C

Can you recommend me what should I read/learn in order to make a well organized code in C? One of the things I want to learn is the principles of splitting project in .h and .c files, what goes where and why, variable naming, when to use global variables ... I am interested in books and articles that deal with this specific problem.
