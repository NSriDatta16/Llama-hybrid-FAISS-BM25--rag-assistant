linear mixed model with response variable with many zeros

My response variable is accuracy (0 or 1) with 10 trials per subject. I thought about treating the response variable as a percentage and logit-transforming it to deal with its boundedness so that the predicted values were sensible, but this doesn't deal with the non-normality of the errors due to a large number of zeros in the data (i.e., About 25 of 83 subjects have only zeros (i.e., their accuracy rate was 0%). So now I am thinking about using a mixed logistic regression (i.e., generalized linear mixed model via glmer() in R with family = binomial("logit") and accounting for dependence among observations by modeling intercepts for subjects. Is GLMM an adequate way to deal with the zeros? Is there another more appropriate model I could use that isn't overly complicated? Also, any suggestions for how to approach this in R? Edit: Here are my data (which if I were to run a GLMM I would convert back to long form): zz Edit 2: clarity
