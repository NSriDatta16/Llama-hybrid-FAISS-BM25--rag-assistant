I suggest another method (it helped me, maybe it will help someone too). The method is following (assuming that you have Xcode3.0 installed): 1) rename .pbproj to .xcode 2) using muCommander ( http://www.mucommander.com/index.php#download ) navigate to the .xcode folder. Inside the folder you will find 3 files. *.mode1, *.pdxuser, *.pbxproj (where * is some user name). 3) now replace the *.mode1 and *.pbxuser user name given with yours (ex. johndow.mode1 to myusername.mode1) 4) after that replace .mode1 with .mode1v3 (ex. myusername.mode1 to myusername.mode1v3 ) 5) select myusername.pbxproj and hit View[F3] button (located in the bottom left corner of the mnCommander screen) and locate this lines (the very top lines): archiveVersion = 1; classes = { }; objectVersion = 39; objects = { Replace 39 with 44 (the number depends on Xcode version installed; you can find out yours by creating a new project and locating the same lines in it's *.pbxproj ). Close and save the edited document. Thats all! Now try to open the project with Xcode. Some optional steps. Must be taken after you've opened and closed the project with Xcode (after completing the previous section). 6) still in the same document scroll down and locate this lines: CFBundleShortVersionString 0.5.0 CFBundleSignature ???? CFBundleVersion 0.5.0 Replace 0.5.0 to 1.0.23 or any other number starting from 1.0.0. The number corresponds to your product version. 7) now locate this lines: OSBundleLibraries com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily 1.4 com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily 1.3 com.apple.kernel.iokit 1.1 Replace each anynumber to the version number installed on your system. You can find out the version by typing in " kextfind -bundle-id com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily "(where com.apple. . .* is the key you are looking for) in the terminal and hiting enter. You will get somthing like this: /System/Library/Extensions/IOPCIFamily.kext Now copy the line you get in the muCommander locations bar. Select version.plist and hit View[F3] button. Locate the number in: CFBundleVersion 2.6 This number is what you've been looking for. 8) locate the " MODULE_VERSION = 0.5; " line (there must be several instances). Replace 0.5 with 1.0 where 0.5 is a first two digits of 0.5.0 (1.0.23) 9) locate the " compatibilityVersion = "Xcode 2.5"; " line and replace the " 2.5 " with " 3.0 " (which is the Xcode version) The end.
