Xcode Error: "Buildfile: build.xml does not exist! Build failed"

I am trying to use Xcode 3.2 for java tool development. My project has no problem building and shows it built the file build.xml fine and also shows up in file folder fine. When I try to run the .java file, I get the error: "Buildfile: build.xml does not exist! Build failed". Running "ant -find build.xml" in Terminal produces "not found". I believe the problem is that I need to point to my own build.xml location, but I have no idea how to change which directory it looks for this file. Any help is greatly appreciated. -nick Mac OS 10.6, Xcode 3.2.1 - method to create app: Organizer>New from template>Java Tool
