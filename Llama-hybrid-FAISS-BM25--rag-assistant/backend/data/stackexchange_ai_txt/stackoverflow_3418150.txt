Strictly speaking, you can't tell whether the user chose "Run In Terminal" after clicking on the script, or fired up a terminal and ran the script from there. But the commands below should help you, especially [ -t 2 ] . if [ -t 1 ]; then echo "Standard output is a terminal." echo "This means a terminal is available, and the user did not redirect the script's output." fi if [ -t 2 ]; then echo "Standard error is a terminal." >&2 echo "If you're going to display things for the user's attention, standard error is normally the way to go." >&2 fi if tty >/dev/null; then echo "Standard input is a terminal." >$(tty) echo "The tty command returns the name of the terminal device." >$(tty) fi echo "This message is going to the terminal if there is one." >/dev/tty echo "/dev/tty is a sort of alias for the active terminal." >/dev/tty if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then : # Well, there wasn't one. fi if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then xmessage "A GUI is available." fi
