Your journal reviewers seem ... confused. Multiple linear regression will not solve the problem of having a single value for each set of factors. In fact, linear regression and ANOVA are mathematically the same. In matrix form, both are given by $Y = XB + e$ . If you average all the years for each pool, then you no longer have repeated measures, and this lowers your N to 9 (the number of pools). Either you do RM-ANOVA or you average for each pool, but you can't do both. In addition, RM-ANOVA makes unrealistic assumptions, including sphericity. A multilevel model would be better. Also, you have five independent variables. That's too many for the amount of data. Finally, your last paragraph is troubling. If you have low power, then a finding of a non-significant effect is not very meaningful, because only a very large effect would be significant. HOWEVER, if you find small effects, then that may be meaningful. Small sample size does not bias the estimates, it just makes them imprecise. I think what I would do in your situation is multilevel models with one IV for each model. But you may need to hire a statistical consultant to help you with this. (Not me, I'm retired).
