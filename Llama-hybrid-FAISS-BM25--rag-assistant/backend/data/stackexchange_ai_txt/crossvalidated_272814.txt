I'd be cautious about over interpreting Google trends. Here's naive bayes (blue) vs. k-means (red) . What does it mean? I can make up a story that common variation is due to machine learning classes that teach both naive bayes and k-means. But that's just an educated guess, not an answer. I really don't know. And unless we start surveying people who search for "naive bayes" I don't see how anyone can positively answer this either.
