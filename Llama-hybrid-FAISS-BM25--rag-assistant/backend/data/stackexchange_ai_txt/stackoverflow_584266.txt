It sounds like you need your agent to issue notification (Does anyone still use Observer / Observable ?) to your interface that cleaning has begun and finished. Your interface would, respectively, call setEnabled(false) and setEnabled(true) when it receives those notifications. EDIT: The idea is to decouple the manipulation of the menu from the execution of the agent. I.e. what happens if you introduce another way to initiate cleaning, aside from the menu item? You probably still want the menu to be disabled in that case.
