Ok. I know it has only been a few minutes, but I have found the answer. Writing it down here cleared it in my head. Here's what worked for me in case it helps anybody else: First, I added the Loader image as a child to the class like this: public function loadImage(url:String):void { imageLoader = new Loader(); imageLoader.load(new URLRequest(url)); this.addChild(imageLoader); // IMPORTANT! this.mouseChildren = false; this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, pickUp); this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dropIt); } And then I only had to add the class to the stage, not the loader: this.addChild(myItem); Back to the class, I added this: public function pickUp(event:MouseEvent):void { trace("Pickup"); this.startDrag(false); } public function dropIt(event:MouseEvent):void { this.stopDrag(); trace("X = " + event.target.x + " Y = " + event.target.y); // Just to help me } Et voila! It worked!
