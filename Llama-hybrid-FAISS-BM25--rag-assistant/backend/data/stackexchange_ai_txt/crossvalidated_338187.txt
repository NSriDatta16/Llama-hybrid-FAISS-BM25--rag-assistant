I suggest taking a look at Merton’s credit-risk model that came out in the 1970s:-- "The Merton model is an analysis model – named after economist Robert C. Merton – that is used to assess the credit risk of a company's debt. Analysts at brokerage firms and investors utilize the Merton model to understand how capable a company is at meeting financial obligations, servicing its debt and weighing the general possibility that the company will go into credit default. This model was later built out by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes to develop the Black-Scholes pricing model." “Merton Model.” Investopedia, 8 Nov. 2006, www.investopedia.com/terms /m/mertonmodel.asp.
