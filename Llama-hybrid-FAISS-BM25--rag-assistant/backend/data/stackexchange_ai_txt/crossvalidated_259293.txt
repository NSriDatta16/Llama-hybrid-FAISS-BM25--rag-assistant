Doing a logistic regression on a $2 \times 2$ table, why does R yield a different odds ratio than by hand-calculation?

Suppose today I have a $2 \times 2$ table I would like to analyze through logistic regression. The table tells us how many people responded to treatment vs control for headaches. Headache No Headache Treatment 2 10 Control 0 8 I did this in R and found the following output: Call: glm(formula = cbind(c(2,0),c(10,8)) ~ as.factor(c(1, 0)), family = binomial()) Coefficients: (Intercept) as.factor(c(1, 0))1 -24.92 23.31 Degrees of Freedom: 1 Total (i.e. Null); 0 Residual Null Deviance: 2.19 Residual Deviance: 2.397e-10 AIC: 6.434 Now, I understand that the intercept of $-24.92$ is nothing more than the odds ratio when my independent variable is equal to $0$ . In other words, its the log of the number of people in Control & Headache divided by Control & No Headache. Hence, it should in theory be equal to: $$ log\left(\frac{0}{8}\right) = -\infty $$ But this obviously is not the case. How is R computing the intercept in this case?
