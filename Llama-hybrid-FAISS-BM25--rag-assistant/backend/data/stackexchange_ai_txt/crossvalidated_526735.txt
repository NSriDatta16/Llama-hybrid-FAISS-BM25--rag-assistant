Correlation between categorical and continuous variable

I would like to calculate the correlations between ambient light measurements and the daytime. The ambient light is measured by a smartphone light sensor and is a continuous variable (basically, it is not completely continuous because the light sensor provides integers but I'm averaging a sequence of values over a window). The daytime is an integer between 0 and 23. What is the right correlation measure here?
