Usually, when it comes to NLP, dimensionality is a problem. I can think of three ways that you can try and see a clustering structure in such data set: a dimensionality reduction (PCA or SVD), before clustering. This can help "throw" away the lesser important similarities I'd throw in a 2d t-sne to check and see if there is some what of a clustering structure in your data. If the similarity matrix is too big, there are alternatives. Just analyse the plots carefully . If any distinguishable patterns really do rise when t-sne-ing the data, you should be able to find it through other clustering techniques. Other types of clustering algorithms, maybe? I am thinking of DBSCAN or HDBSCAN (check about them, and other clustering techniques here ) where there are different types of assumptions for clustering. I've also heard about bi-clustering can be a good way group data points when it comes to similarity matrices (not on NLP, but on other types of data). Sklearn has a few implementations, but I haven't tried them .
