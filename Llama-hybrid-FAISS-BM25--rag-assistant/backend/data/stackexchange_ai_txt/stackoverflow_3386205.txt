Assuming that your map is Google Maps, they use the Mercator projection, so you'd need to use that for the conversion. Under the Mercator projection, the distance that a pixel represents in meters varies with latitude, so while a meter is a very small distance compared to the Earth radius, latitude is important. All the examples below are javascript, so you might need to translate them. Here is a general explanation of the coordinate system: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/maptypes.html#WorldCoordinates This example contains a MercatorProjection object, which includes the methods fromLatLngToPoint() and fromPointToLatLng(): http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-coordinates.html Once you have converted your (x,y) to (lat,lon), this is how you draw a circle: // Pseudo code var d = radius/6378800; // 6378800 is Earth radius in meters var lat1 = (PI/180)* centerLat; var lng1 = (PI/180)* centerLng; // Go around a circle from 0 to 360 degrees, every 10 degrees for (var a = 0 ; a These two mashups draw a circle of a given radius on the surface of the Earth: http://maps.forum.nu/gm_sensitive_circle2.html http://maps.forum.nu/gm_drag_polygon.html If you choose to ignore the projection then you'd use cartesian coordinates and simply draw the circle using Pythagoras Theorem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#Cartesian_coordinates
