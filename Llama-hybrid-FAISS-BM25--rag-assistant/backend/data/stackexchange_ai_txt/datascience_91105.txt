LDA in Orange Linear Projection widget?

I'm struggling to get an LDA in Orange 3.28 (GUI). Using the good'ol iris dataset, loaded from the dataset widget: The data, as you can see, is loaded as it should and has "iris" set as target (is it the same thing as class by the way, I could not find the info ?) The linear projection widget works for PCA and circular : ... but not for LDA: instead, I get an error to the effect that " y should be a 1d array, got an array of shape (150,0) instead ". What do I do wrong, and how can I get a LDA ? Bonus question: help says that " This widget displays linear projections of class-labeled data ". However I could not find references to "class labeled data" in the manual. The closest I found is the "create class" widget, that creates apparently a new categorical variable based on text. Is this the same as a "target" variable ? The data table widgets refers both to "target with 3 values" (in this case) and allows to "color by instance classes" - is a class same as a target variable, then? If not how is a class defined?
