Determine correct statistical algorithm for mixed-type data

I have a dataset consisting of ~20000 lines and 8 columns. It is a mixture of binary and float data, but one binary variable is the important one and I want to create a model to predict the other variables based on this binary. What confuses me is the mix of binary and float data in order to select the best method. I assume the size of 20000 lines means it can be classified as a relatively small sample. I just want a breakthrough how everyone thinks in order to find the best method(s). I am thinking that classification methods such as SVC should be working best, based on the scikit-learn algorithm cheet-sheet . I am using Python for this. I am using Python for this. Many thanks for your help and guidance! I am new to the field of data science, and am eager to go deeper into this amazing field.
