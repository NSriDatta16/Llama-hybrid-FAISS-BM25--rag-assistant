The first thing that comes to mind is to build up a controller to handle crud operations on the employee model, but instead of returning a viewresult, return a jsonresult or xmlresult (mvccontrib). This effectively turns your controller into a web service allowing you leverage silverlight or jquery for the both ui (say jqueryui) and/or service interaction (jquery/ajax).
