There are a number of non-euclidean distance measures, some of which are specifically used for binary data. Two distance-measures are: 1) Simple Matching Coefficient; 2) Jaccard Coefficient. They have some different strengths and weaknesses. In the simple matching coefficient, mutual absences and presences contribute to the similarity, although the Jaccard coefficient is good for focusing on mutual presences. You can look up those measures for more specifically if you want (Simple Matching and Jaccard are summarized here: http://stat.ethz.ch/education/semesters/ss2012/ams/slides/v4.2.pdf ) If you are using R, the function "dist" in the base package has the simple matching coefficient (referred to as "binary symmetric") and command "vegdist" in the package "vegan" has the Jaccard index. (Edit): I just found something, which, depending on your hardware, might yield some benefit. If you have a NVIDIA multicore GPU (which is fairly common), the package 'rpud' has a function rpuDist() which computes a number of the standard distance metrics using the GPU with great improvement, as shown here: [http://www.r-tutor.com/gpu-computing/clustering/distance-matrix] http://www.r-tutor.com/gpu-computing/clustering/distance-matrix I haven't tested it, and with a dataset your size there might be other bottlenecks, but it might be worth having a go at it. Also, it appears that this, and another package (gputools) are only available on Linux, so that is another limitation... Hope that helps!
