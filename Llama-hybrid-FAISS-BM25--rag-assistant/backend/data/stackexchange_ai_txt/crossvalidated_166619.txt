Cross correlation influenced by self auto correlation

I have two stationary time series ts1 , ts2 , I wanna find the cross correlation ($\textrm{CCF}$) between them. As a result, it show a significant correlation on lag 0, and 1 days. However, it also shows significant auto-correlation on 1 day lag inside each time series. I doubt the cross correlation between two time series are influenced by the $\textrm{ACF}$ inside each time series. Could anyone help? Should I use prewhitening like mentioned here ? However, I am doubting that turning the data into white noise will lose some valuable information which also reflect their correlation.
