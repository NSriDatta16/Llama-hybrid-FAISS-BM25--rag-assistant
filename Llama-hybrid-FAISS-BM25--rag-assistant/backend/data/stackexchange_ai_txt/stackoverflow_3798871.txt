The reason it's not an address constant is because it's an address on the stack, and that location depends on what is above it in the call stack. Something can't be a constant if its value isn't known until run time. It's not a variable either, which is why you can't increment it. It's just the name of a storage location, which happens to be an offset on the base pointer. numbers[0] is a valid l-value, but numbers is not.
