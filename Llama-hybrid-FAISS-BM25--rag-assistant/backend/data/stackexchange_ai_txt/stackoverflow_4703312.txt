Including an XML file in an XML/XSL file

So currently I'm doing some XML-> XSLT-> (HTML5/CSS3) work. Right now I have a menu.xml file, and I'd like to include it in either the XSL file or the XML page. I've done lots of searching, but I'm unable to find a straightforward answer. So, how do I include an XML file in to another XML file or in to a XSL file? Edit: By include, I mean referencing/loading it from another file, not copy and pasting it or simply embedding it.
