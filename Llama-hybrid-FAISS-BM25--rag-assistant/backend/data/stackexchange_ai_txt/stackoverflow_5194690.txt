Storage of values?

I have a database with 4 tables. Each table has 1 column. 3 of the tables will typically hold only around 8-12 values, the other maybe 100+. The values are basic, color, city, etc. The user clicks a button, up pops a list with values they can select, delete or add. It seems like a lot to have a table for ~8 values. I was wondering if there was a better way to store this data given that values need to be able to be added, deleted and the number will be dynamic.
