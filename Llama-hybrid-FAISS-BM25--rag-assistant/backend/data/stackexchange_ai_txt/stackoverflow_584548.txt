You need a code signing digital certificate from a certificate authority like Comodo or VeriSign. It's debatable how useful it is, though, because it only replaces this scary-looking warning with a slightly less scary warning (yellow alert vs red alert) that says "Publisher: " instead of "Unidentified Publisher" and still tells the user only to run it if they trust you. I'm somewhat doubtful that the average user really notices the difference between the two warnings.
