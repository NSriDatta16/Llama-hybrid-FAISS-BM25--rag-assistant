I can speak from experience as I have worked on serious ASP.NET/MVC web sites (e.g. .5 million unique visitors and 11 million visits per month, etc.)... My recommendation is to not try to save the state of the actual widgets on the page, rather save the user’s data entry into a staging repository (you custom session provider, or whatever) with enough metadata about the state of the user within the process*). For example, if I were coding a long process insurance coverage application (which I have): Real data: name, phone, gender, dependants, created date, modified date, application status = ‘in progress’, etc... Metadata: last step completed = 3, etc... Ensure you metadata is application version resilient…for example, if user comes in and completes 5 of 10 steps on day 1 and on day 2 the app is changes to only have 4 steps, what happens for the returing user: error (you should be fired if you answer this); heuristics on completed data (best option), static mapping of old to new (iffy). Then again, I have always found more success when a user can be transient within a process until ultimate submission time. My two cents.
