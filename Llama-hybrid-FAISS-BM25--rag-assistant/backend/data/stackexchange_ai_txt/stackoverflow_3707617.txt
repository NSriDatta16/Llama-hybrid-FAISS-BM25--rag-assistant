"Center of Mass" between a set of points on a Toroidally-Wrapped Map that minimizes average distance to all points

edit As someone has pointed out, what I'm looking for is actually the point minimizing total geodesic distance between all other points My map is topographically similar to the ones in Pac Man and Asteroids. Going past the top will warp you to the bottom, and going past the left will warp you to the right. Say I have two points (of the same mass) on the map and I wanted to find their center of mass. I could use the classical definition, which basically is the midpoint . However, let's say the two points are on opposite ends of the mass. There is another center of mass, so to speak, formed by wrapping "around". Basically, it is the point equidistant to both other points, but linked by "wrapping around" the edge. Example b . O . . a . . O . Two points O . Their "classical" midpoint/center of mass is the point marked a . However, another midpoint is also at b ( b is equidistant to both points, by wrapping around). In my situation, I want to pick the one that has lower average distance between the two points. In this case, a has an average distance between the two points of three steps. b has an average distance of two steps. So I would pick b . One way to solve for the two-point situation is to simply test both the classical midpoint and the shortest wrapped-around midpoint, and use the one that has a shorter average distance. However! This does not easily generalize to 3 points, or 4, or 5, or n points. Is there a formula or algorithm that I could use to find this? (Assume that all points will always be of equal mass. I only use "center of mass" because it is the only term I knew to loosely describe what I was trying to do) If my explanation is unclear, I will try to explain it better.
