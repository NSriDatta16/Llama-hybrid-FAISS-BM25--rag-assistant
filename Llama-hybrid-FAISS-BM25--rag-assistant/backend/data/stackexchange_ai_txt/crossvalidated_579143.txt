Underfitting and Overfitting at the same time?

I am using a Logistic Regression Classifier on the Airline Cancellation dataset . Please note that the training set was undersampled (in order to balance classes) while the test set was left as it was. Can you help me interpreting these results? log loss F1 score Accuracy Recall Specificity Precision AUPRC AUROC run_type 0.654 0.622 0.622 0.624 0.621 0.621 0.656 0.666 Train 0.647 0.050 0.619 0.623 0.619 0.026 0.031 0.665 Test Specifically, the training and test losses are both high, so I would say that I'm using a too simple model -> underfitting. However, the metrics: F1 and AUPRC (that are the one I'm considering because of the imabalance setting) are higher in training set than test set -> overfitting?
