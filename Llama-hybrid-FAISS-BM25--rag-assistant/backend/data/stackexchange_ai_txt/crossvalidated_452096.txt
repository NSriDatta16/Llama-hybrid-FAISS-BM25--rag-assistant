Modelling count differences on irregular lattice

I have the following dataset. I have a time series over an irregular grid where for each position in the grid, there is a variable that for each point in time counts the cumulative difference between positive events (+1), neutral events (0) and negative events (-1). In other words, at each point in time the events that can happen are an increase in the count, a decrease in the count, or not change in the count. It is a process for discrete time points, in discrete space and with discrete values. It has the following simplified form Position_1 Position_2 Position_3 ........ [1,] -1 1 -1 [2,] 0 2 -2 [3,] 0 3 -1 [4,] 0 3 -2 [5,] 0 4 -3 [6,] -1 5 -4 [7,] -2 4 -3 [8,] -3 3 -3 [9,] -3 4 -3 [10,] -4 3 -2 [11,] -3 4 -1 [12,] -3 5 -2 [13,] -3 5 -2 [14,] -4 4 -2 [15,] -4 4 -3 . . . . where each column represent a position in space and each row a point in time. The data also presents seasonality. The neighborhood structure is well known and defined across spatial points, and the temporal dependence structure can be assumed to be first order Markovian. Are there methods to model these sort of spatio-temporal series, and are any implemented in R? I have looked into spatiotemporal processes for counts, but they assume that the random variables at each position take only positive values, i.e. counts.
