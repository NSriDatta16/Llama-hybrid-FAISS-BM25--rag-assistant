Two options: Define a new product type that extends the Virtual product type in Magento, and then use a custom Item Renderer for Checkout and Cart that doesn't output any html. Here's a useful tutorial for that process. Define a new boolean product attribute called "cart_visibility" or something like that, override DOCROOT\app\design\frontend\base\default\template\checkout\cart\item\default.phtml in your own theme and test for that value before outputting the item's attributes e.g. on line 28: getCartVisibility(){ ?> Don't forget to close the brace at the end of the file obviously.
