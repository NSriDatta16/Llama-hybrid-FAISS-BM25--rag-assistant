Stick that feature in your regression like you would any other feature. Logistic regression makes no assumption that the features have a particular distribution. I suspect this misconception comes from the same confusion that people have about OLS linear regression. Since the distribution of that feature for each $y$ category is not just a shift in location, you might benefit from using some nonlinear functions of this feature, such as a spline, but the distributions are so different that I expect this feature to give considerable discriminative ability on its own.
