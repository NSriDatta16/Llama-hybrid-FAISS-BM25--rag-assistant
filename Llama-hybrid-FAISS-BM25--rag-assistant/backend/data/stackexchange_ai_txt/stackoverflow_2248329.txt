When you're using the Unit testing framework to do integration tests, you don't really have a DI or a unit testing problem. What you have are integration tests that leverage the high-powered unit testing framework. Since they are integration tests, they're different in kind from unit tests. The "stand-alone-ness" doesn't really count anymore. The best way to get integration test settings that vary from user to user is to get them the same way the final application will get them. If you're working in Java, you might have a properties file. In Python, we have special Django settings files for integration testing.
