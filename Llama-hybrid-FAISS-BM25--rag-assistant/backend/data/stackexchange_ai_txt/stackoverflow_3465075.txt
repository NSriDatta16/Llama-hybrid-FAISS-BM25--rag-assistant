I think you will have to make some changes to the structure for webstart deployment (possibly package it as a jar or set of jars), also the launching will be done via JNLP, by webstart and not Run.sh. Additionally you will have to sign your deployment if you need permissions to write to the disk. See the FAQ for webstart here Also check out the developer guide on how to deploy using webstart
