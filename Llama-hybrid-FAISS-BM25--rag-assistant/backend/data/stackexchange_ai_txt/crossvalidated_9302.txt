Commonly, a time series is said to be $I(0)$ if the time series itself is stationary (no need to differentiate it to obtain stationarity). The Wikipedia page you mention says that not all $I(0)$ time series are stationary. I didn't know this and I think that indeed many authors do not make the difference. The paper from Engle and Granger (1987) says that all $I(0)$ are stationary. Two times series $X^1_t$ and $X^2_t$ are said to be cointegrated if $\exists n,d>0$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $X^1_t \sim I(n)$ $X^2_t \sim I(n)$ $X^1_t+\beta X^2_t \sim I(n-d)$ See Engle, Granger (1987) http://www.ntuzov.com/Nik_Site/Niks_files/Research/papers/stat_arb/EG_1987.pdf If you reach $n-d=0$ indeed your linear combination of time series is stationary.
