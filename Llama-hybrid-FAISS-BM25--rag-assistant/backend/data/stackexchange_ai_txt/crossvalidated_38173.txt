First, if the measure of performance is really numeric and was classified into high vs. low by someone, it would be better if you could get the original measure. You could then do linear regression using that measure as the dependent variable and the two factor scores as independent variables. You might want to include the interaction between them, as well. If "high" and "low" are all you can get, then you can do something very similar except you will need to use logistic regression rather than linear regression.
