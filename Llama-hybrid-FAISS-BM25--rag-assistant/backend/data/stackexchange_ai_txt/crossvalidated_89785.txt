Simulate predicted probabilities after a logistic regression

I'm generating predicted probabilities (propensity scores) in Stata using the predict command. The basic structure of my code looks like this: logit depvar indepvars predict ps // Gives Pr(depvar = 1 | indepvars) predict s, stdp // Gives the standard error of the prediction The predicted probabilities/propensity scores are obviously estimates with an error distribution around them. What I would like to do is use the results obtained from the predict command to simulate some plausible values for the predicted probabilities/propensity scores. Any advice on how I might proceed? Thanks in advance.
