Regarding the Single and the Double Dot within Directories

Whenever we use the command: dir --> in Windows and dir -a --> in Unix We see 2 kinds of dots: . .. Appear in the directories. Now in APUE by Stephens Rago, it says these are filenames and some books say these are directories. What are these Dots about anyway? Please provide an answer w.r.t. Windows as well as Unix if possible.
