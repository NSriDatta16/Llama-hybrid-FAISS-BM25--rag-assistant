Does this article use an inappropriate chi-square test or some other test of significance?

I am trying to understand a result from an academic article analysing paragraphs of text. It reports a significance of p In the text, the author reports that any of the features of interest was more likely to occur than no feature of interest: 48 paragraphs with features, 12 features without, p There is a table that reports the occurrence of all the features across multiple genres of text. I cannot replicate the calculation for degrees of freedom displayed here and a chi-square test seems inappropriate for such low values. (The variables have been anonymized but the values are unchanged.) What significance test might have provided the p How could the chi-square value for the table have been calculated? Is there an obvious justification for using a chi-square test with such low values?
