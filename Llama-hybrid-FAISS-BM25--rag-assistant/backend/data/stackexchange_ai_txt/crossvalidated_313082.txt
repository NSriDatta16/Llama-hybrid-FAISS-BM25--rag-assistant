1 If by order of inputs you mean the ordering by the time of observations of subjects, then, the answer is, of course, NO, you cannot randomize the time of observations. Otherwise, your data would not be called time series, then you wouldn't need to bother about time at all. It's highly unlikely to be the case for EEG, in my opinion. Usually, you can randomize the order of subjects. 2 Skipping observations can be a problem. In time series analysis there are models such as state space models (SSM) where skipping/missing observations of this type is not a big issue because of the way it is handled. For instance, in SSM you model the unobserved state and observed measurement. When you skip the observed measurement, the unobserved state still keeps updating. You can estimate the state, then infer would would have been the measurement too. On the other hand, sometimes skipping observations is a common practice. For instance, in finance we often collect trading indicators only during the business days skipping weekends and holiday. It is a common practice to treat the changes from Mon to Tue the same way as changes from Fri to Mon. It depends on the problem at hand. So, you have to think about whether this would be appropriate for your case. If it is not then maybe you need to tweak the formulation of your model so that it explicitly takes care of the skipping data. One way to do this would be calculating the difference between Mon and Fri then scaling it to one day difference by dividing by 3. This way each observation will represent one day change, although Mon observation will have more noise in it than Thu or Wed.
