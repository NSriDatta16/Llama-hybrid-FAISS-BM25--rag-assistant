Use a normalised colour histogram. (Read the section on applications here ), they are commonly used in image retrieval/matching systems and are a standard way of matching images that is very reliable, relatively fast and very easy to implement. Essentially a colour histogram will capture the colour distribution of the image. This can then be compared with another image to see if the colour distributions match. This type of matching is pretty resiliant to scaling (once the histogram is normalised), and rotation/shifting/movement etc. Avoid pixel-by-pixel comparisons as if the image is rotated/shifted slightly it may lead to a large difference being reported. Histograms would be straightforward to generate yourself (assuming you can get access to pixel values), but if you don't feel like it, the OpenCV library is a great resource for doing this kind of stuff. Here is a powerpoint presentation that shows you how to create a histogram using OpenCV.
