You should go for a pretrained network for feature extraction. The pretrained network will generate features that are useful for classification, and in your case, it will most likely help your classification, as you have very small amount of data. You should make sure that the data that the model is pretrained on (e.g. ImageNet) does not differ too much from your own dataset. For example, a model pretrained on digits will not help you in MRI scan classification. On the other hand, Autoencoders are not suitable for this type of task. The extracted features from the Autoencoders bottleneck is a compressed representation of the original image (think something like a zip archive). This is useful for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection tasks, but not for feature extraction.
