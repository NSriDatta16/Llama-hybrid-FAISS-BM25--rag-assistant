I'd have to clear unused files every so often. That's true, however I think this is the only sensible solution. Naming conventions are hacky and finicky to manage over time, and trying to keep track of the form submission status over a short period of time is asking for trouble (what if they upload the image, leave their desk for an hour, come back, submit the form.. ie, what is a sensible timeout?). A simple cron task to clear unused files would be reliable and safe, and very easy to implement compared to changing your upload and storage strategy.
