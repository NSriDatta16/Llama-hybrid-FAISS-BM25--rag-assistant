If the data are rates : that is number of successes divided by number of trials, then a very elegant method is a funnel plot. For example, see this (apologies if the link requires a subscription--let me know and I'll find another). It may be possible to adapt it to other types of data, but I haven't seen any examples. UPDATE: Here's a link to an example which doesn't require a subscription (and has a good explanation for how they might be used): http://understandinguncertainty.org/fertility They can be used for non-rate data, by simply plotting mean against standard error, however they may lose some of their simplicity. The wikipedia article is not great, as it only discusses their use in meta-analyses. I'd argue they could be useful in many other contexts.
