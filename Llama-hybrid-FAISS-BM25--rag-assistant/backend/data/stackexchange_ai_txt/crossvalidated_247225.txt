What test shall i use to see if one disease has any relation with other

I am using data from this website (data is at the bottom of the page) for a case-study. For the sake of question lets stick to any of FluWatch sheet say FluWatch-Alberta. I am coming up with a question of my own, i.e., if one disease has any relation with another one. What kind of statistical technique should I use here? What i have thought so far The data is nominal so correlation wouldn't work Should I do some sort of cross classified observation? (I just read it somewhere not sure what it is) Or I am on wrong track and I can just do correlation/regression to check if disease A is related with disease B
