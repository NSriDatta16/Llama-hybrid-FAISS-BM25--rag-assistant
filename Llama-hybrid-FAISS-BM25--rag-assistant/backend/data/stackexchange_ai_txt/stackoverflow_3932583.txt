Speech recognition language model

I would like to integrate speech recognition into my Android application. I am aware google provides two language models (free form for dictation and web search for short phrases). However, my app will have a finite number of possible words (maybe a few thousand). Is it possible to specify the vocabularly; limiting it to these words, in the hope of achieving more accurate results? My immediate thoughts would be to use the web search language model and then check the results of this against my vocabulary. Any thoughts appreciated.
