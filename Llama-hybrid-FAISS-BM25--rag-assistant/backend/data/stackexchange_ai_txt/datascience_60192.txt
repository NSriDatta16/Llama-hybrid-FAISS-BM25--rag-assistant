When to normalize or regularize features in Data Science

How can I know when I need to use normalization and when regularization of features. I know that when I have big difference between min and max values in some feature / column that i need to scale data, also if I use SVM or KNN or Clustering i need to scale the data. But how can I know when to normalize and when to regularize the features? How can I know that if I have for example 200 features and 10 000 rows? Is there any way that I can plot my data and see what can I use?
