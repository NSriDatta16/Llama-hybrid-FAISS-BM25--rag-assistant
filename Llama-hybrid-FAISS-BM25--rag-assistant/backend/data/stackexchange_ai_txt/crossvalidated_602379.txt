Extract the functional mapping between input and output from a machine learning model

A lot of ML models, such as neural networks, are Universal Function Approximators. But when evaluating ML models, we use usually metrics, such as MSE or accuracy, to assess the performance of a ML model. Is there a convenient way to "create" an approximation of the function after having trained a ML model, with for example SK-Learn? E. g. if the data generating function is 3x³+0.5y²+1z+0.2xyz or whatever, I wonder if I could rebuild the function more or less from a trained ML model. I know that this is feasible for very easy functions with e. g. simple neural networks or SVMs. I know that this procedure has some caveats in higher dimensions (function will probably never the correct function (especially if relevant variables are missing), it is difficult with high dimensional data and potentially difficult to interpret, ...). Nevertheless, I see scenarios where being able to present an approximation of the functional mapping could be beneficial beside assessing predictive performance.
