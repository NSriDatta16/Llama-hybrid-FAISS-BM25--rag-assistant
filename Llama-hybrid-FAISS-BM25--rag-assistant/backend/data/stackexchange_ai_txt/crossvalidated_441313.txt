In GANs, why converging the discriminator to probability 0.5 does not make the generator to change its good learned weights?

It is said that the discriminator part of GANs converges to probability 0.5, meaning that when it gets an instance generated by generator, it says that it is a fake instance by probability equal to 0.5. I expect that it says it is a real image (i.e., the probability of being fake is zero). Otherwise, the generator tries to change its learned weights to fool the discriminator, and it would destroy the generator. What is wrong with my explanations?
