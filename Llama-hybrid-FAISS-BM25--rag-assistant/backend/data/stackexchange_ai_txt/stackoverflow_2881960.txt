I've found out what was wrong. It appears that the upgrade from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010 removed the profile option ( /PROFILE ). What was needed to be done was to go to Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Advanced -> Profile and change this settings to Yes ( /PROFILE ). Now I get code coverage for the C++/CLI project.
