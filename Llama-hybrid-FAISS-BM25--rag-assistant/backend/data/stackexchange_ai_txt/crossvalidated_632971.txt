Not a terrible idea, but you need to take account of decision-necessity, analysis-time-cost, and analysis-knowledge-requirements Hypothesis testing is useful in binary decision problems where one encounters a decision that needs to be made between two alternative courses of action --- e.g., should I take this drug or not? This is the reason we need to discretise in certain circumstances. Indeed, any time we are presented with a decision problem involving a countable number of alternative options, we need to discretise our analysis to make a decision (the binary decision problem being a special case of this). As to the idea that you could just let people discretise their own subjective prior/posterior beliefs using Bayesian analysis, that is easy for us, but hard for others. Even for scientifically-literate users who have a sound knowledge of Bayesian analysis (and could therefore perform the required analysis), there is a substantial time cost to the process of eliciting one's own prior beliefs into probabilistic form, applying Bayes' rule to get a posterior distribution, and then discretising this distribution over the space of the relevant hypotheses. Moreover, in many circumstances it is necessary for scientifically-literate researchers to be able to communicate the evidence for a particular course of action to non-scientifically-literate users who want to make a decision. Telling the latter, "Oh, just use your subjective probabilities and apply Bayes' rule to make a decision" is not particularly helpful to them, whereas being able to summarise the evidence in a single cut-off number that the researcher has already computed for you is perhaps more helpful. $^\dagger$ Whilst I think you have missed these elements of the problem, your position is one that would have some merit if it were applied purely amongst a group of scientifically-literate users with sound knowledge of Bayesian analysis, and if this group does not mind incurring a time cost for getting results each time they read a study. The latter could be ameliorated to some degree if the researchers presenting results provide useful automated tools for eliciting priors and rapidly computing the posterior probabilities over the hypotheses, but even then there would still be an extra time cost. Amongst a group of skilled Bayesians, a methodology like the one you are presenting would probably be a reasonable way to present evidence. $^\dagger$ I can already hear the objections: people are terrible at interpreting p-values so is this single value really that helpful? Well, if they can't interpret a p-value correctly, what do you think their chances are of successfully eliciting their own prior beliefs in appropriate probabilistic form, then applying Bayes rule to update, and then discretising back to a final posterior probability for the hypotheses of interest?
