Dynamically generated javascript not executing in Chrome or IE, works in Firefox

I'm using the google maps API with GWT to create a tabbed infowindow with tweets inside one of the markers. the source of the tweets is dynamically generated. heres the java code: HTML recentTweets = new HTML( " "+ " "+ " "+ " " ); I have identified the problem, but I need a workaround. What happens is that the script will be executed in firefox, while IE and Chrome will, for some reason, avoid running it. Here is the html that is generated: stephencolbert if i copy this code into a plain html file and run it in google chrome, it will work. if i open in IE, it will work, but only after i give it permission to run active content. if i open in firefox, it works fine without any problem. does anyone know how i can get this code to work without asking for permission in all the major browsers?? Thanks!
