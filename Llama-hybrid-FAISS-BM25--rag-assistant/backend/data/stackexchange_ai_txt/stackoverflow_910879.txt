comp.lang.javascript is full of hardcore zealots. That's not all bad. I think the libraries have gotten better as a result of all the sniping. For example, this is from the jQuery 1.3 release notes: "No More Browser Sniffing. The final major feature of this release is one that you probably won't ever see or deal directly with but it's an important change that'll help to make jQuery last longer and with less bugs: As of 1.3, jQuery no longer uses any form of browser/userAgent sniffing internally - and is the first major JavaScript library to do so." I'd argue that the major libraries, and especially jQuery, are now so entrenched that developers of browsers actually have to adapt to jQuery, rather than the other way around. If you release a browser that fails in common jQuery operations, people will think your browser is broken.
