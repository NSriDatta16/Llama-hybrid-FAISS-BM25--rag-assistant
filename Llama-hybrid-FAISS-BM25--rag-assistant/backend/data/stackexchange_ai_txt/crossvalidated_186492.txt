I think your question is very interesting, but I am not familiar with "SVM model selection". Generally, we can extract the features from the original data instead of using data directly. One way to do that is PCA (principle component analysis). Compare with the Regression, the regression model selection provides several criterial like AIC, BIC to select the model. I think those criterial are essentially to tradeoff the fit performance and computation(also like overfit). Hopefully, it can help you.
