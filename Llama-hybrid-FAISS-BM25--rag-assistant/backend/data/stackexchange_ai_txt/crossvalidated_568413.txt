Non-parametric test for proportions data

I am analyzing some behavioral footage and am not sure what an appropriate non-parametric test would be for proportion data? Specifically, I'm looking at visit durations at a feeding station and the proportion of time spent foraging or vigilant of the total visit time. The foraging proportions are in the realm of 0.5-0.9, whereas the vigilance proportions are closer to 0-0.5. I want to test the differences before and after the addition of an odour treatment.
