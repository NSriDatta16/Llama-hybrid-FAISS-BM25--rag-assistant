fit() , always initializes the parameters like a new object, and trains the model with the dataset passed in fit() method. Whereas partial_fit() , works on top of the initialize parameter and tries to improve the existing weights with the new dataset passed in partial_fit() . It is always good to save the model in persistent storage (say pickle file), for later use or for further training.
