Bayesian inference for Beta distribution after an uncertain outcome

Normally, when we have $$p\sim Beta(a,b)$$ and an observation of $x=1$ (''success'') from a Bernoulli trial with ''success'' probability $p$ , the Bayesian inference on the parameter value $p$ is $$p|x\sim Beta(a+1,b).$$ And the expectation about the next Bernoulli trial becomes $$\frac{a+1}{a+b+1}.$$ What I'm curious for myself is what happens if we only observe noisy outcomes? For example, when the actual outcome is ''failure'', we sometimes observe ''success''. Say this kind of error happens with probability $0.3$ when ''failure'' happens. So, when we observe ''success'', it may not really mean the real outcome is ''success''. On the other hand, if we observe ''failure'', it's an accurate observation as ''success'' always produces ''success'' signal. If this is the case, what should be the correct Bayesian inference after observing a ''success''?
