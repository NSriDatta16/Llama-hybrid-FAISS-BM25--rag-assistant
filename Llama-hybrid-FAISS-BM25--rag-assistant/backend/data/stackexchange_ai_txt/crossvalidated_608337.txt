It's a model with a single hidden layer, plus the input and output layers, with all nodes connected from one layer to the next. That's the simplest case of multilayer perceptron (see eg Wikipedia ). For a long time there was a bit of tendency in statistics to consider only the single-hidden-layer case of neural networks, until deep convolutional networks such as AlexNet showed that more layers could really matter in practice. For example, even the second edition of Elements of Statistical Learning (from 2008), by definitely computation-friendly authors, restricts itself to a single hidden layer.
