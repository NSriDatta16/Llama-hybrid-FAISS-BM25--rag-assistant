Is Probabilistic Reasoning In Intelligent Systems a pre-requisite for Causality?

After having read Book Of Why and Causal Inference In Statistics - A Primer , I was reading Causality - all by Judea Pearl. Yet I found that there were quite some points which I was not understanding. Particularly, Markov and Bayesian networks, axiomatization of probabilistic system using information relevance axioms, etc. However, having followed the references given to Probabilistic Reasoning In Intelligent Systems by Pearl, they were much more clear. Hence, is Probabilistic Reasoning In Intelligent Systems , or parts of it, a pre-requisite of Causality ? If yes, which parts might be good to go through?
