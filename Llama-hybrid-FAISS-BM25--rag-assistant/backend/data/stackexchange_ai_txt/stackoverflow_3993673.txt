You can get time zone selects with the appropriate methods: time_zone_options_for_select time_zone_select Similarly, there's date_select for dates. Storage: If the timezone is specific to the user and doesn't change, then store their time zone in their user record and set it when you load the current_user. Rails will convert times to/from UTC and always store UTC in the database and do the automatic convert to that default timezone for you (including daylight savings!). Easiest way to do it. use_zone(zone) lets you override the default zone for a block, so you can accept a form value and set it with that function and set your value in that block. UPDATE: I wrote up some Rails timezone examples as a blog entry.
