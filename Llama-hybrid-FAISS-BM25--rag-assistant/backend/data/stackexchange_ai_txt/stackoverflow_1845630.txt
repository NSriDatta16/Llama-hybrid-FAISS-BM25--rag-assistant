iPhone Crash Catching Options on Published Apps

I am wondering about embedding the CrashCatcher framework ( http://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter ) in a production app. I have written some code that will upload a crash report directly to a server. And, my intent on this was to have quicker access to crash reports and not need to go through Apple/iTunes to get them. Does anyone know whether or not embedding the CrashCatcher framework is likely to pass the application review process? And, if it does, is it likely to cause any problems or conflict with the crash catching mechanisms that Apple has built into iTunes/iTunesConnect? Thoughts?
