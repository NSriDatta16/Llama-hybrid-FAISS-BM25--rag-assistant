Best means to store data locally when offline

I am in the midst of writing a small program (more to experiment with vs 2010 than anything else) Despite being an experiment it has some practical use for our local athletics club. My thought was to access the DB (currently online) to download the current members and store locally on a laptop (this is a MS sql table, used to power the club's website). Take the laptop to the event (yes there ARE places that don't have internet coverage), add members to that days race (also a row from a sql table (though no changes would be made to this), record results (new records in 3rd table) Once home, showered and within internet access again, upload/edit the tables as per the race results/member changes etc. So I was thinking I'd do something like write xml files locally with the data, including a field to indicate changes etc? If anyone can point me in a direction I would appreciate it...hell if anyone could tell me if this has a name, I'd appreciate it.
