Redrawing a single rect for a line fragment in NSTextView

We have an NSTextView that needs to have single line fragments redrawn on certain events. Essentially, it is an outline. So when a particular line gets the message "tab out", we want to move the rect containing the glyphs rather than just inserting the tab key. Any ideas of how to accomplish this? Thanks!
