Vim FTP Plugin for IDE-like behavior

I have gVim (with: NERDTree, minibufexpl). Right now, I can edit files locally with IDE-like feel with NERDTree for a file explorer and minibuf for tabs. However, I am used to editing files on dummy server I have set up at home. I use Zend Studio to edit files through FTP. Is this feature available in Vim? If so, does it "integrate" well with NERDTree? I would like to browse my FTP directory using NERDTree. Thank you, Wenbert
