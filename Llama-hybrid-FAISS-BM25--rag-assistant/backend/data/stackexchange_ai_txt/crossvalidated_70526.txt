Books on statistical ecology?

I know this question was asked before: Reference book for ecological studies but it is not what I am looking for. What I am looking for is if anyone could recommend a good book (or a canonical reference) on statistical ecology? I have a very good understanding of statistics so the book could really be at any level. I would be using the book to teach myself more about the application of statistics in ecology than anything else so even an introductory book with good/interesting examples would be much appreciated. Also, my research tends to be geared towards Bayesian statistics so a book incorporating Bayesian statistics is even better!
