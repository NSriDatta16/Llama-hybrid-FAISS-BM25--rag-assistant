Why autocovariances could fully characterise a time series?

I read in John Cochrane's Time Series for Macroeconomics and Finance that: Autocovariance can fully charaterize the time series [joint distribution]. I do not fully understand the connection between covariance and joint distribution here. Can someone please explain that?
