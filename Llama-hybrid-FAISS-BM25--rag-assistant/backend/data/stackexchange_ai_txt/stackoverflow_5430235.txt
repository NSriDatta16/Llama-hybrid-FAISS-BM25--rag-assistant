Common Practice Amongst Large Websites When Linking to External CSS Files?

Lets say I have 10-20 webpages same template different content area do I use One stylesheet or a main stylesheet for the template and separate stylesheets for each additional webpage? Also what do large corporate websites do (foxnews,google,cnn)? If you have a source or article I would really appreciate it. Thanks
