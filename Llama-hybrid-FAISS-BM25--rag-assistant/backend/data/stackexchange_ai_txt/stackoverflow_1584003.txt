You can do it this way using INSTR: SELECT * FROM users WHERE INSTR(LOWER(last_name), 'z') > 0; INSTR returns zero if the substring is not in the string. Out of interest, why don't you want to use like? Edit: I took the liberty of making the search case insensitive so you don't miss Bob Zebidee. :-)
