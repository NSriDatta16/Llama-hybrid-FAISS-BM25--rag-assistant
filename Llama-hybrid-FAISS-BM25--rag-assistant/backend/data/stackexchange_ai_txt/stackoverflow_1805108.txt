MindTouch is an open source Wiki / CMS system with C# core, PHP to serve up content, and a scripting language called DekiScript. The back end code is very solid and you can integrate it with other ASP.net solutions, as you can get at the content via the C# API. It also has database connectors for SQL, MySQL and Oracle, as well as a very nicely XML based document storage system which again is exposed via the C# API. Currently they are working on a schema-less data store for CouchDB style functionality.
