Point at a given Run flow document wpf

I've got a FlowDocumentPageViewer with dynamic content. The flow document is made of paragraphs, each run in the paragraph contains a word. I'm trying to navigate to a given run, so I got the method which will return me the run I want. But once I got this Run how can I navigate to it, with automatic page change? For example I select the last run in a page, the next run is in the next page. How do I navigate to the next page from there? I had a look at the TextPointer but I'm not sure this will help here. Thanks for your help, Boris
