Implicit in the comment is that the test is of a null hypothesis that the value is zero. It is possible to test other null hypotheses, but “is it zero or not” is a common question to have and common to test. The point estimate (the $-14$ ) will almost always be within the confidence interval (I suppose a bootstrap confidence interval has some chance of excluding the point estimate, even if that chance is outrageously small), so that is a poor criterion of statistical significance.
