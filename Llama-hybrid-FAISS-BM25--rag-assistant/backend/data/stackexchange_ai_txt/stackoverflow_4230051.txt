I believe this is the easiest way: https://plugins.jquery.com/overlaps/ Here is another one, in German: http://www.48design.de/news/2009/11/20/kollisionsabfrage-per-jquery-plugin-update-v11-8/ I'd give those a try. --UPDATE-- I can't really spend anytime on it right now, but i can when i get home if no one answers but you;d do something like: setInterval(function(){ //First step would be to get the offset of item 1 and item 2 //Second would be to get the width of each //Third would be to check if the offset+width ever overlaps //the offset+width of the 2nd //Fourth would be, if so, do X or set a class... },10);
