You are correct, Fully Connected (FC) layers have no concept of dimensionality. However, if I wanted to use a FC layer passing into another layer which had specific dimensionality requirements, I would simply use FC to create the correct number of samples (e.g. 32x2=64 samples) and then reshape the output into the correct dimensionality. A quick Keras example: ... # some layers, probably a Flatten() included fc_out = keras.layers.Dense(64)(previous_layer) fc_out_reshaped = keras.layers.Reshape([32, 2])(fc_out) ... # now you can do 1D conv, or RNN, or whatever you want
