My advice would be to go for a simple scrollbar. That's far more foolproof. By trying to implement the cool drag-and-scroll feature you risk with a lot of buggy behavior in dozens of edge-cases none of us can even imagine. If you really want to detect clicks in whitespace, you could try attaching to the onmousedown / onmouseup / onmousemove events for the page itself. JavaScript events bubble nicely, so you'll handle the whole page at once (unless it has some JavaScript in itself, in which case you're screwed anyway). These events supply both the mouse X/Y coordinates and the element that was clicked. Then you can check for padding of that element (careful with inline elements) and figure out if it's in the padding or not. You do not need to check the margin because clicking there will instead originate the click in the parent element. Although the effect you get this way is a lot of scattered "drag-zones" that the user will have to hunt for in order to scroll the page. I doubt this will sit well with your users. Better then make the whole page "draggable", but then you will loose the ability to select text. Or do like Acrobat, which only allows grabbing in the considerable padding area of the page itself (then you should make sure that there is a considerable padding area). Which in my eyes is not much better than a scrollbar. :P
