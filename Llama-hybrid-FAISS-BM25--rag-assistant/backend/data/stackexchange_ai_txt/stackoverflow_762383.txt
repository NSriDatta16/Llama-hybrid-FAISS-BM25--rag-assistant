Just put the grid panel inside a canvas rather than directly into the window - this will then give it X/Y co-ordinates. You can then implement the drag/drop behaviour using a custom attached property such as detailed here ( http://www.deepcode.co.uk/archive/2008/11/16/using-attached-properties-to-compose-new-behaviour.aspx )
