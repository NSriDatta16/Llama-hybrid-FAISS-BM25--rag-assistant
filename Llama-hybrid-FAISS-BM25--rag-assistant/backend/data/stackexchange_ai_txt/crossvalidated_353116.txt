Average precision vs precision

Using sklearn.metrics in Python, I calculated average precision (with average_precision_score) and precision (with classification_report) while testing model metrics. However, I got different answers (0.89 vs 0.93, respectively). I read the documentation for both and know the equations are different, but I was hoping to get an intuitive explanation about the differences between the two and when to use one over the other.
