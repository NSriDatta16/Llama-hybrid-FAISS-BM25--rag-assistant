Time series vs Cross section data doubt

I have been reading Basic Econometrics by Gujarati and I came across certain inconsistencies. In the chapter, Population census has been mentioned as a time-series data, and further, in another paragraph as cross-section data too. In the MCQs after every chapter, Population census has been marked as Cross-section data only. I wonder - under which category does Population Census fall? My own opinion is that it falls under Cross section data as data is collected only at one point of time. What is the actual answer?
