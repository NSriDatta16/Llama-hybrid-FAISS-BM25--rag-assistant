Just forget about code coverage. It's just a number and must not be the focus when testing code. Scenarios must be the focus and then, high Quality API. I know that this could sound rhetorical bullshit, but you must change your mindset from code coverage to scenarios: are you testing a lot of scenarios which your API is intent to handle? Code coverage will be useful to detect that you are missing some scenarios and if you write a lot of good scenarios you will have a near 100% coverage, but again, it is just a number and must not be your focus. Kind Regards
