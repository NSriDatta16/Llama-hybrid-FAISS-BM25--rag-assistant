I would venture a guess here that you are doing the conversion in C# code as part of an ASP.NET website. Converting to local time converts to the local time of the machine where the code is actually executing. Thus, when you convert to local time, you are converting to the local timezone of your server machine, not the client machine. To convert to the client local time, you need to know the local timezone of the client machine. Unfortunately, the standard ASP.NET HttpRequest does not include that information (mostly because the HTTP protocol does not specify a standard way for the client HTTP agent to pass its local timezone to the HTTP server). Multiple people have come with various solutions about this problem; here's one recent blog post about Handling TimeZone Information In ASP.NET that can help you.
