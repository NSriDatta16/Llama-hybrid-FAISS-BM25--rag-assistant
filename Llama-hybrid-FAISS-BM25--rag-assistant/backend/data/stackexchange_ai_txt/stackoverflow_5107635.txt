With Windows 7 they introduced patches that are being applied using .msu files (MSU == Microsoft System Update). One way is to enumerate the keys on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Packages and then check the (string) value InstallClient for the "WindowsUpdateAgent" . You can apparently use the Windows Update Agent API to read it independent of the registry location.
