I fully concur with the last paragraph of @AlexC-L's answer which is in essence a paired comparisons method. I have a feeling, though, that you do not want to look at the raw differences $\delta_i = \beta_i - \gamma_i$ . The $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ are presumably estimated by regression and are affected by uncertainty: does $\hat\beta_i=0.8$ with standard deviation of 0.6 imply higher persistence that $\hat\gamma_i=0.5$ with standard deviation 0.1? I would think the second more indicative of persistence than the first, which is not even significantly different from zero. The choice depends on your problem, but I think you might at least consider to take not the raw estimated coefficients, but rather the coefficients measured in standard deviations when you compute the differences.
