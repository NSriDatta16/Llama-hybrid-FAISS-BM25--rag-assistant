There's nothing wrong with not using Core Data if you don't feel that it's appropriate for your application, or if you're just not comfortable with it, or if you're more comfortable with something else. So if using SQLite directly makes a lot of sense to you, go for it. That said, if you're looking at Core Data as a drop-in replacement for SQLite, you're going to have trouble. When you use SQLite, you deal in tables and rows; when you use Core Data, you deal with objects and relationships. The Core Data framework maps those objects and relationships onto SQLite's tables (or some other persistent storage), so if you're translating objects back into tables in your head then you're sorta missing the point.
