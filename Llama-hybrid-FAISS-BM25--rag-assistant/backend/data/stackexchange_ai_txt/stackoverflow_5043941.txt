First - you still have an "#pragma end critical" which should be removed. It isn't causing a problem, but it is incorrect. Second - as I said in the other question you posted, you might have to think about how you are parallelizing the code to see the speedup, so just replacing the other pragmas with task pragmas may not speed it up. Third - you haven't put the tasks into a parallel region, so you are not running in parallel at all. And you can't just add a parallel region around the tasks or you are going to be doing the same tasks multiple times.
