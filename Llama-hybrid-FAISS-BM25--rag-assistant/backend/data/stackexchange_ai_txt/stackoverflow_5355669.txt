You cant do this with pure CSS, but can be done with JS, A note on the XHTML Strict Doctype - its crap, use Transitional, The XHTML Strict DTD forces you to do stupid stuff like use JS to use target="_blank" and other unnecessary not-niceness, I am all in favour of self closing tags as well as quoted parameters but the stuff in XHTML Strict makes me rage. Okay, moving on. The Javascript you want is: var input = document.getElementById('blah'), wrap = document.getElementById('wrap').offsetWidth; input.style.width = (wrap - 36) + "px"; http://jsfiddle.net/Mutant_Tractor/My2Qn/
