QoQ is certainly the easiest way to do it, but don't forget your CFQUERYPARAM: SELECT * FROM Rc.programs WHERE programid = You can also reference an individual column/field of a query as an array, and search through just that column using array functions, including arrayFind() (which might just be in recent versions). arrayFind( Rc.programs.programId, YOUR_ID_HERE ) If that's not fast enough you could always build some sort of data structure or index in memory, and keep it around in an Application-scope variable if such is appropriate. But is your database really that slow? Reducing the number of queries executed by a page is almost always a good thing, but for average, uncomplicated queries you probably won't be able to beat the speed, caching, etc of your DB server.
