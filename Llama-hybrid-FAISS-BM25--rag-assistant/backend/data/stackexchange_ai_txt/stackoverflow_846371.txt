I think PowerShell is ideal for this task because it is optimized for this sort of system information retrieval. WMI is exceptionally easy to use from PowerShell as opposed to C# IMO (and I'm a C# dev by day). Heck, let's see how easy this is from PowerShell: #1,2, 3 and 4 PS> Get-WmiObject Win32_LogicalDisk | >> Format-Table Name, VolumeName, FileSystem, Size, FreeSpace -auto Name VolumeName FileSystem Size FreeSpace ---- ---------- ---------- ---- --------- C: NTFS 160038907904 100353536000 D: E: F: PDC2008 NTFS 160039239680 40155922432 V: Vista NTFS 250056704000 33944559616 #5 PS> dir -r | where {!$_.PSIsContainer} | Measure-Object #6 PS> dir -r | where {!$_.PSIsContainer} | >> Format-Table Fullname, Length -auto And PowerShell can handle #7 easily via its ability to use the .NET Framework. For an example of fseek style programming in PowerShell check out this tail-content script starting around line 139.
