How to prevent tree items from being dragged into themselves?

I have a flex tree with dragMoveEnabled = true. I want to find out, when an item is dragged into itself or it's children. I'd like to use DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE) in the tree's onDragOver handler, but can't find out how get this to work. I'm using an ArrayCollection of nested objects as dataSource for the tree.
