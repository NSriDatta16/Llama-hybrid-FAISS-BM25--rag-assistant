This problem is precisely the reason why templates were developed for C++. The approach I've used once or twice in C is to have the value field be a void*, and cast the values thereto on insertion and cast them back on retrieval. This is far from type-safe, of course. For extra modularity, I might write insert_int(), get_mystruct() etc. functions for each type you use this for, and do the casting there.
