Use version control and a folder structure to prevent too many files from all being in the same folder. There is nothing more painful than waiting for Windows Explorer to load something because there are 1,000+ files in a folder and it has to load all of them when the folder is opened. A convention on naming variables and methods is also good to have upfront if possible so that there isn't this mish-mash of code where different developers all put their unique touches and it painfully shows. Using design patterns can be helpful in organizing code and having it scale nicely, e.g. a strategy pattern can lead to an easier time when one has to add a new type of product or device that has to be supported. Similar for using some adapter or facade patterns. Lastly, know what standards your forms are going to uphold: Is it just for IE users or should any of IE, Firefox, or Safari easily load the form and look good?
