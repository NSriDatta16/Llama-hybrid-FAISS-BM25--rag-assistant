How is it possible for the arithmetic mean of a distribution to be off-center?

This is a question I recently saw on a test: "Consider the following statement: More than 65% of the residents of Los Angeles earn less than the average wage for that city. Could this statement be correct? If so, how? If not, why not?" The answer I put was that this statement could be correct because the mean isn't always centered perfectly, and nothing else (and I actually got full credit for this). After the test, however, I've had trouble understanding how the mean isn't always centered perfectly, because it evenly sums all the values and divides it by the number of values in the distribution. I think it could have something to do with skews and outliers, but I'm not completely sure. Can somebody please explain this to me?
