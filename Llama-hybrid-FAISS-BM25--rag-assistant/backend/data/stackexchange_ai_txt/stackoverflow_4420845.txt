MATLAB (and its toolboxes) include a number of functions that deal with feature selection: RANDFEATURES (Bioinformatics Toolbox): Generate randomized subset of features directed by a classifier RANKFEATURES (Bioinformatics Toolbox): Rank features by class separability criteria SEQUENTIALFS (Statistics Toolbox): Sequential feature selection RELIEFF (Statistics Toolbox): Relief-F algorithm TREEBAGGER.OOBPermutedVarDeltaError , predictorImportance (Statistics Toolbox): Using ensemble methods (bagged decision trees) You can also find examples that demonstrates usage on real datasets: Identifying Significant Features and Classifying Protein Profiles Genetic Algorithm Search for Features in Mass Spectrometry Data In addition, there exist third-party toolboxes: Matlab Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction LIBGS: A MATLAB Package for Gene Selection Otherwise you can always call your favorite functions from WEKA directly from MATLAB since it include a JVM...
