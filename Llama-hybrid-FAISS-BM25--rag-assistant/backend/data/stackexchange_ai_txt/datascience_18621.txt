It really depends what you want to achieve, what your data look like and etc. SVM will generally perform better on linear dependencies, otherwise you need nonlinear kernel and choice of kernel may change results. Also, SVM are less interpretable - for e.g if you want to explain why the classification was like it was - it will be non-trivial. Decision trees have better interpretability, they work faster and if you have categorical/numerical variables its fine, moreover: non-linear dependencies are handled well (given N large enough). Also they train faster than SVM in general, but they have tendency to overfit... I would also try Logistic Regression - great interpretable classifier) To sum it up - the rule of thumb is try anything and compare what gives you best results/interpretation.
