Comments: If the prior distribution has support $[.1,1],$ then the posterior distribution has support contained in or equal to $[.1,1],$ so the posterior distribution could not be any ordinary (two-parameter) beta distribution. Also, if one tries to use a normal prior for a binomial success probability then it has to be truncated to have support $[0,1].$ Such a truncated normal prior is not conjugate to a binomial likelihood, so the posterior has to be computed by numerical methods. Moreover, there are inferential applications relating to the prevalence of a disease (which must lie in $[0,1])$ where fragmentary information from medical screening tests in which traditional (non-Bayesian) inference can lead to point and interval estimates of prevalence with nonsensical values outside of $[0,1].$ However, a Bayesian approach with a beta prior must give point and interval estimates within $[0,1].$ One example is given here . [In this particular application, a Gibbs sampler is used to find the posterior distribution.] Note: Undeniably, $\mathsf{Beta}(1,1) \equiv \mathsf{Unif}(0,1)$ is a "flat" prior distribution for the binomial success probability $\theta.$ However, technically there is controversy whether this distribution is noninformative . The Jeffries prior $\mathsf{Beta}(.5,.5)$ has been proposed as a more nearly noninformative prior distribution.
