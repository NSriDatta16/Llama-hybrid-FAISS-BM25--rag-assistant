My understanding is that unless the Canvas contains one or more DisplayObject children, it will always report its width and height properties as 0, regardless of the percentage sizings you may have applied to it. You could always add an empty dummy DisplayObject to the Canvas, but that wouldn't be very elegant. Depending on how you've planned to implement your custom grid, it's possible you'll have to rethink the design...
