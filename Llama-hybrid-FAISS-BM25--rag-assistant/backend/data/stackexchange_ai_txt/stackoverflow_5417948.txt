If the object is always darker than the background, you should use a simple threshold method with one parameter to set it: (Everything brighter than threshold is BG, the rest is FG). If that is not the case, have a look at watershed algorithms. I think the free OpenCV library (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) from Intel includes an implementation. These also need very few parameters: seeding points to start the segmentation, so the user could just click on the foreground object and then again set interactively set a threshold until the whole object is selected. This is mostly like the "Magic Wand". If that still isn't enough maybe "snakes" and "level-set" approaches are for you. The user could draw a rough curve around the object and the algorithm tries to find the actual exact border. These algorithms are especially designed to find optimal separations between fore- and background depending on whatever property you define and they can be controlled with few parameters (usually 2 or 3), which should still be easy enough for most users. I doubt Intel has an implementation for those, but I used this one some time ago: http://vivienmallet.net/fronts/ and it was very nice and open source, so you can easily adopt it to your needs. My suggestion is to start with OpenCV since it contains a LOT of different approaches, that are sufficient for most simple problems. Cheers!
