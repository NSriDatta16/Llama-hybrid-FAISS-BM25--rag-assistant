Based on the documentation floc and fscale do the following: floc : hold location parameter fixed to specified value. fscale : hold scale parameter fixed to specified value. So you are fixing the location and scale parameter, respectively. But the way you fix them, it is not surprising that no beta distribution can be fitted to the data. Your fixation $(\mu, \sigma)=(0,1)$ suggests that your data are centered around 0 with an average dispersion of 1, and thus can become negative. Your observations, however, are in the interval $[0,1]$ , and so the solver may be unable to converge based on the initial restriction. One solution would be indeed to get rid of both arguments. However, if you want to have comparable location and scale parameters for some reason, you may choose a more plausible fixation, e.g. $(0.5, 0.25)$ .
