Usage of the HTML Table "summary" attribute

The specification of HTML4.01 ( http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#adef-summary ) states that the table summary attribute should contain "... a summary of the table's purpose and structure ..." and the examples given support that usage. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 ( http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H73.html ) says the the summary attribute is "to provide a brief overview of how data has been organized into a table or a brief explanation of how to navigate the table" WCAG 1.0 ( http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#table-summary-info ) says something similar and again the examples show the usage as describing the purpose and structure of the table. On the other hand, the Illinois Center for Information Technology Accessibility iCITA ( http://html.cita.uiuc.edu/nav/dtable/dtable-rules.php ) describes best practice for the attribute as "should describe the content of the table or the conclusion the author intends to convey through the data in the table" I doubt that iCITA have picked this out of the blue, and that there are other HTML books and guides that advise a similar practice. In many ways, such usage makes more sense to me, since judicious use of the thead and th elements along with the scope and headers attributes should be sufficient to describe the structure of the table to a non-sighted user, whereas there is no other way for a non-sighted user to gain the gist of a complex table to match the same level of information a sighted user could obtain via a quick scan of the table. However, I am loath to diverge from the well-researched advice of the WCAG. So, my question is: If you put anything in the summary attribute of data tables, do you enter purpose, structure, content description, conclusion, and/or something else, and why? Reasons based on feedback from real users of this attribute are particularly welcome.
