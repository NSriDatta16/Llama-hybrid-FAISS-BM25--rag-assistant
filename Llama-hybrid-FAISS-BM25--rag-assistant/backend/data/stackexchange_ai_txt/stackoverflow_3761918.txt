Set Default Visible Div in Dropdown Menu

I found a useful script that makes divs visible and hidden using a dropdown menu. The only problem is that all the divs are initially hidden, and I'd like the first one to be visible by default. Here's the script: Untitled Page Choose One... first second third This is paragraph 1. This is paragraph 2. This is paragraph 3. Thank you.
