To fix this, see this blog post by Aaron Stebner: Your app is probably being detected by the PCA (Program Compatibility Assistant) as a non-Vista (pre-Vista) installation application. You will need to add an embedded manifest and set a requested execution level There is a previous stack question on this topic as well with some alternative work-arounds (noob, I can only post one link at the moment). You should be able to find some information on Vista-aware installation applications and be able to resolve this issue, but the info above has worked for me in the past.
