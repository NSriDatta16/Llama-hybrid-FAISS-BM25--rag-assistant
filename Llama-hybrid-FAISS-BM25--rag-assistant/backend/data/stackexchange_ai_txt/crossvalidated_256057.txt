You have a distribution of "Average Monthly Elec. Usage" for London. Each point in your distribution represents a unique household in London. CLT can only be applied in two ways: CLT on a specific household's usage: If all days were same , and you randomly sampled N days to get mean of their usage values for a single household, the distribution of these mean values would be a normal distribution, OR CLT on average-usage in London-households: if you randomly sample N households from all the 2000 you have, then, the distribution of sample-mean would follow said normal distribution. Now using the SD value for the distribution of sample-mean, and N (sample-size), you can estimate the true distribution mean and confidence interval.
