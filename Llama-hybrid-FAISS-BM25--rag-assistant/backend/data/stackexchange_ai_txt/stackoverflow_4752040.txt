applescript to copy folders into Xcode?

I'm having some trouble copying folders into XCode projects with AppleScript. Without Applescript I drag the folder into Xcode. I've used a similar Applescript handler, as the one shown below, to copy libraries into XCode using "wrapper.library" for the file type. Below I am using "wrapper.folder" to try to copy a folder into XCode and it isn't working. on addFolder(fname, fpath) tell application "Xcode" tell project "Unity-iPhone" set my_targets to targets set s_target to item 1 of my_targets set compile_phase to compile sources phase of s_target set link_phase to get link binary with libraries phase of s_target tell root group set a to make new file reference with properties {full path:fpath & fname, name:fname, file type:"wrapper.folder"} add a to link_phase end tell end tell end tell end addFolder Does anyone have any ideas on what I am missing or how to write an Applescript to copy a folder into XCode?
