How to properly perform an ANOVA, single values for each participant or average values?

I have a question on how to "prepare" data for an ANOVA. Imagine I have 20 subjects and each subject has to eat 10 waffles, 10 pancakes, 10 eggs, 10 sausages. This is repeated 3 times with different "eating techniques" (Each subject actually eats 3x40 objects then). This is just a weird example, just imagine they could eat infinitely without drawback. I always measure the time it takes to eat a single object. I want to find out if the eating techniques have significant influence on the time to eat an object. How would I "feed" this data to the ANOVA? Would I take all single values (time to eat an object) which would result in F(2,740) or the mean values (average time to eat all objects) for each subject F(2,17) ? Sorry if this is a rather dumb question, I am new to statistics and never had a university course about it.
