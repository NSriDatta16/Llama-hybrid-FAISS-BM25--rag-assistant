Here is an illustrative implementation for simulating draws from a N(0,1)-distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a random walk kernel with Laplace distributed increments. Hence, $P=1$ here, as we only simulate a univariate series. $f(y)$ is the standard normal density here, that is, the density from which you aim to generate draws. You take these as they are and do not average. $q(x,y)$ is the transition density, i.e., the probability of being in a new state $y$ given that the chain currently is in state $x$. Of course, in practice you would never simulate from a standard normal in this fashion! library(MASS) library(VGAM) A
