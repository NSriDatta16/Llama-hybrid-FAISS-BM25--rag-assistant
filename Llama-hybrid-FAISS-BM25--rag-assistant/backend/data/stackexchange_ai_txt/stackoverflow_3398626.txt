Can't require mage.php from an interactive shell

I would like to try some code snippets (about to make a script) which uses Magento's models and classes. The problem is that I get the following error: fdr@fderose-gtrade:/var/www/globaltrade$ fdr@fderose-gtrade:/var/www/globaltrade$ php -a Interactive shell php > require './app/Mage.php'; Fatal error: Class 'Mage' not found in /var/www/globaltrade/app/Mage.php on line 31 Line 31 of Mage.php is the following: Mage::register('original_include_path', get_include_path()); Does anybody have an idea about what could be the cause? Thank you!
