SQL Session State & Javascript Error

I've switch session storage to SQL server via: and now I'm getting the following error in this code var eventArgs = new Sys.WebForms.EndRequestEventArgs(error, data ? data.dataItems : {}, executor); Sys.Observer.raiseEvent(this, "endRequest", eventArgs); if (error && !eventArgs.get_errorHandled()) { throw error; } Microsoft JScript runtime error: Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManagerServerErrorException: An unknown error occurred while processing the request on the server. The status code returned from the server was: 500 If I leave session as the default rather than SQL Server it works fine. One further point, I can add items to the session OK - this seems to be occurring when the page is reloaded - maybe some kind of AJAX issue? In terms of setting up SQL Session storage I did this: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317604 The app works fine when I run it. Thanks in advance. Jim EDIT - In the application log I can now see: 'System.Web.UI.WebControls.ListItem' in Assembly 'System.Web, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' is not marked as serializable. ... and true enough, I am adding a list item to the view state. But why does this work OK - except when storing session in SQL?] Thanks again! Jim
