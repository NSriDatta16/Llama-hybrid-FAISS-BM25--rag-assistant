Training a random forest with an imbalanced dataset with ranger, which parameter to use for weights?

I would like to train a random forest and I got an unbalanced dataset which could look like this: class number of observations weight 0 20 1 1 10 2 2 5 4 In order to take the dataset imbalance into account I would like to use weights. The r package ranger (p. 16) has got the three parameters sample.fraction , case.weights and class.weights and I am not sure which one is the correct to use with the weights. I would also be interested in an explanation when to use the other two parameters. I guess the parameter sample.fraction would be the right to use here. Is this correct?
