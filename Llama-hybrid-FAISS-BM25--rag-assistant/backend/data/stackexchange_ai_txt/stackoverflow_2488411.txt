So long as the images come from the same server at the stylesheet, using relative URIs should be sufficient. From the CSS Spec : In order to create modular style sheets that are not dependent on the absolute location of a resource, authors may use relative URIs. Relative URIs (as defined in [RFC3986]) are resolved to full URIs using a base URI. RFC 3986, section 5, defines the normative algorithm for this process. For CSS style sheets, the base URI is that of the style sheet, not that of the source document. There's an interesting essay by Bert Bos (one of the authors of the CSS spec) about variables in stylesheets. You can read it here .
