Fair Ranking of Ratings Based on Number of Votes

I'm attempting to take a list of products and rank them according to rating and votes. This is tricky! Lets suppose product A is rated at average 5.6 at 310 votes. Product B is average 7.3 at 10 votes. Product C is 3.4 at 1 vote. Product B has hardly earned a winning place with 10 votes, but product A is lesser rated with a much bigger voting base, showing it's persistence. Product C shouldn't be ranked poorly just because one (possibly ignorant) user is pissed at it. Maybe it's new to the market - much newer than product A . I was hoping to find the most reasonable "modifier" to get them to rank according to earned position. Perhaps just a small modifier? Votes/Rating to distinguish them?
