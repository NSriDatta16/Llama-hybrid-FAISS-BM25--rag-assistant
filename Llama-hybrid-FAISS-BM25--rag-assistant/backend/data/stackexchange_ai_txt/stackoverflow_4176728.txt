Plotting statistical data, preferably using gnuplot

I have a number of numerical datasets that I've computed averages, medians, deviations, minima and maxima from, and I'd like to visualize them (on Linux, without X, to an image file). I've seen gnuplot's functionality for plotting error bars, but I have a couple of problems with them: My datasets are packed rather tightly together along the X axis, and gnuplot's error bars take up a bit too much space along the X axis; and I've only seen it be able to plot a minimum and a maximum together with a data point in between (presumably for an average), and I see no good way of fitting the median and deviation into that model. Does anyone know of a way to get around those problems in gnuplot? Or is there, perhaps, a better program than gnuplot altogether?
