How do I specify a Bayesian Beta binomial model, with predictor variables, for R2jags?

I want to have a beta-binomial Bayesian model, with R2jags . I understand I need something like this: for (i in 1:N) { y[i] ~ dbinom(p,n[i]) p ~ dbeta(a,b) } Now suppose I have 2 types of subjects in my observations y, and I want to know whether 'type' makes a difference to p. I imagine I need some way to make a and b depend on my covariate 'type'. How is this done?
