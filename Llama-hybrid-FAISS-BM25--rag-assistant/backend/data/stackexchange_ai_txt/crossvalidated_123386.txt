Hashing functions in NLP

I have been reading a lot of papers about nlp which use the hashing trick, and I came across a lot of sentences like : "We take k hashing functions to hash words or bi-grams". And after that they never mention what functions they use exactly, and without open implementation I can't check on my own. Is there some convention about hashing function that I'm not aware of (meaning the k-functions should be obvious for the reader), for example is there any canonical hashing function which makes the reference optional ? Or is this a critical design problem which is intendedly (or not) avoided ? Or finally is this a choice without much impact on the result (I think this is unlikely).
