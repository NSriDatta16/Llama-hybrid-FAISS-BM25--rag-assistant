The code you've written above is correct, I just tested it then and successfully loaded a URL. I'm not sure what you've declared in your header file but you should have something like this: //usual #import(s) #import @interface myAppDelegate : NSObject { WebView *myWebView; //other instance variables } @property (retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet WebView *myWebView; //other properties and methods @end As @pulazzo says, you also need to connect your code with the control defined in Interface Builder. To do this, in Interface Builder, you need to find your application delegate class, right-click (or control-click) on it and find myWebView in the list of outlets. Drag from the circle on the same line as myWebView onto your web view. I don't think my explanation is much chop so you'll probably have a lot more luck reading the Interface Builder Quick Start Guide on the Apple developer site. In your implementation file, you need to implement the getter and setter methods for your new property, myWebView . You (probably) don't need to do any customisation to this so you can just use @synthesize : @implementation myAppDelegate @synthesize window; @synthesize myWebView; //your function etc @end
