How to store objects and arrays in HTML5 localStorage?

Ok, I have to use the localStorage to store an object, and an array. However, whenever i set something, it stores a string value instead. For example: var x = [1,2,3]; localStorage["x"] = x; console.debug(x); //[1, 2, 3] console.debug(localStorage["x"]); //"1,2,3" and objects: var o = {foo:1}; localStorage["o"] = o; console.debug(localStorage["o"]); //[object Object] console.debug(o); //Object \ foo: 1 \ __proto__: Object (\s are line breaks) How do you store objects and arrays within localStorage. Also, what is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage and document.cookie? thanks.
