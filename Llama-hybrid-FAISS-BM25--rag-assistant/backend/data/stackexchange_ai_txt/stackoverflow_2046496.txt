In the end I just got fed up with all the mucking around in Flash, and decided to build the preloader (only) in Flex, embedding the game SWF in the preloader and loading it with SWFLoader. (This is based on Myk's suggestion.) I still get to have a single SWF at the end, with Flex's more robust preloading system handling the preloader display. I didn't use the full Flex Builder in the end; I just compiled the Flex stuff with mxmlc from the free Flex SDK. Here's my mxml file (I don't really know what I'm doing with mxml, so please someone tell me if this approach is wrong): ( CustomPreloader is a simple class that extends mx.preloaders.DownloadProgressBar .) What I like about this approach is that I can now do whatever I like over on the Flash side; I can stop worrying about what frame classes are exported on. One concern I have is that the game possibly seems to be running slightly slower now. Are there performance issues when using SWFLoader? Is there a more speedy alternative?
