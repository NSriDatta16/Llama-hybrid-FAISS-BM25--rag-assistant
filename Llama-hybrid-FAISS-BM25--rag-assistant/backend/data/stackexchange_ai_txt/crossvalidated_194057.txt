Frequentist tests focus on falsifying the null hypothesis. However, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) can also be done from a Bayesian perspective, because in all cases NHST is simply a calculation of P( Observed Effect | Effect = 0 ). So, it's hard to identify a time when it would be necessary to conduct NHST from a frequentist perspective. That being said, the best argument for conducting NHST using a frequentist approach is ease and accessibility. People are taught frequentist statistics. So, it's easier to run a frequentist NHST, because there are many more statistical packages that make it simple to do this. Similarly, it is easier to communicate the results of a frequentist NHST, because people are familiar with this form of NHST. So, I see that as the best argument for frequentist approaches: accessibility to stats programs that will run them and ease of communication of results to colleagues. This is just cultural, though, so this argument could change if frequentist approaches lose their hegemony.
