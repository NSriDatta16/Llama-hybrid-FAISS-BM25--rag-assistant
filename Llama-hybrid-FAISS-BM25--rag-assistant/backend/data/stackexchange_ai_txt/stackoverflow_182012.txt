It depends on many factors; particularly read/write throughput and performance sensitivity of the database. Databases tend to be kinda sensitive things and are often very fragile to general purpose access from arbitrary other systems when they are finely tuned for production use in a specific system; so often folks replicate the database to another read-only slave database that can be then used for doing integration work & querying and so forth. You can then use triggers/polling/JMS based on whatever you need without impacting the original database. Depending on the database replication technology used; you can then often install triggers in the replica database (which can afford to get a little behind from the master from time to time) - to minimise impact in the production database
