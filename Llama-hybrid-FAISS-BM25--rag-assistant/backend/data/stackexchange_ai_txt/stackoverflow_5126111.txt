If you want to extend Microsoft's Windows SNMP agent, you have to use unmanaged languages. There is little possibility to use managed languages, as Microsoft prefers WMI to SNMP and would not make any change to current SNMP agent. You may consult a commercial .NET SNMP agent vendor to see if they already implement all necessary objects you need. As far as I know, open source/free .NET SNMP vendors do not have that much resource to implement those.
