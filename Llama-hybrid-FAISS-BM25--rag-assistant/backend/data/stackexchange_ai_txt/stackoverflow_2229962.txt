With regards to the IPV6_DONTFRAG bareword issue, it looks like Perl checks for barewords at compile time, not run time, as documented here . Eval is a construct to swallow runtime errors, so it won't help you here. It's like trying to handle a syntax error in C++ by sticking the offending code in a try/catch block.
