Did you at least try the user agent idea I mentioned in your last question? I'll paste it here again if you didn't. ini_set('user_agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9'); And you're going to be pasting that at the top of your script file. You can also change this in your php.ini file under the user_agent setting. The only thing I can imagine that would be different between your server and your local machine is that the server is identifying itself differently. The other thing here is that YouTube could be blocking your server/web host from requesting videos. If you're on a shared host and somebody tried to do this stuff before, Google could have cracked down on it and blacklisted the IP of your host. Downloading FLVs from YouTube is against the terms of service, so they may very well have done this. Hope this helps (again).
