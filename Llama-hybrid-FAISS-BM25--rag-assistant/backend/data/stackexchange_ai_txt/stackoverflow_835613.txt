WCF: How can I programmatically recreate these App.config values?

I have a WCF service that works ok if I create the service without specifying any binding or endpoint (it reads it from the generated values in the App.config when I registered the WCF via Visual Studio). I have a simple method that returns the service reference: return new SmsServiceReference.SmsEngineServiceClient(); This works ok (because the values are read from the config). However, I'd like to have some of these values in a Database (the URI for example) and would like to do something like this: Binding binding = new BasicHttpBinding(); EndpointAddress endpointAddress = new EndpointAddress( "my.uri.com/service.svc" ); return new SmsServiceReference.SmsEngineServiceClient(binding,endpointAddress); This doesn't work. It throws an exception when I try to use the service reference. I suspect that this is because my App.config has more information that the two lines up there are not providing (obviously). The question is, how can I replicate the following App.Config values programmatically? Here's the fragment of my App.Config: (the URI has been altered to protect the innocent).
