jquery with xml/html data behaves different in internet explorer

I have collected form data into a hidden field as the html fragments generated from textarea/tinymce sandwiched between section elements. This is stored into database as php/htmlentities encoded. When retrieved and examined with jquery, count of elements varies for same data between Internet explorer (reports more elements) and other browsers like firefox, chrome (reports 4 elements as expected) and so the dependent operations go haywire. sample data is below. html data generated by tinymce instance 1 html data generated by tinymce instance 2 html data generated by tinymce instance 3 html data generated by tinymce instance 4 I have checked for clash/interference because tinymce. It can be safely ruled out as same code is working in firefox/chrome. Can some one help me fix this, Please? With regards.
