Large BF-value in two-way within-subject ANOVA but non-significant interaction using frequentist approach

A two-way within-subject ANOVA revealed a non-significant interaction (p = .067). A Bayesian analysis conducted using anovaBF() in R on the same data revealed extreme evidence against the null (BF = 110622). Is this possible? Edit: Priors were computed based on Rouder et al. (2012). The same Bayesian analysis conducted on response time data revealed normal BF-values and abnormal (above) BF-values for the error percentage data. I suspect the BF-values of the error percentage data are erroneous since they are not normally distributed (i.e., a high proportion of cells containing 0% errors in the sample).
