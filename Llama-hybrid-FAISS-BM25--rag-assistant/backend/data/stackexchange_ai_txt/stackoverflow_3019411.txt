Paperclip and Amazon S3 Issue

I have a rails app running on Heroku. I am using paperclip for some simple image uploads for user avatars and some other things, I have S3 set as my backend and everything seems to be working fine except when trying to push to S3 I get the following error: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records. Thinking I mis-pasted my access key and secret key, I tried again, still no luck. Thinking maybe it was just a buggy key I deactivated it and generated a new one. Still no luck. Now for both keys I have used the S3 browser app on OS X and have been able to connect to each and view my current buckets and add/delete buckets. Is there something I should be looking out for? I have my application's S3 and paperclip setup like so development: bucket: (unique name) access_key_id: ENV['S3_KEY'] secret_access_key: ENV['S3_SECRET'] test: bucket: (unique name) access_key_id: ENV['S3_KEY'] secret_access_key: ENV['S3_SECRET'] production: bucket: (unique_name) access_key_id: ENV['S3_KEY'] secret_access_key: ENV['S3_SECRET'] has_attached_file :cover, :styles => { :thumb => "50x50" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => ":class/:id/:style/:filename" EDIT NOTE: The ENV['S3_KEY'] and ENV['S3_SECRET'] are environment variables in heroku which i have tried even using my keys directly and it still doesn't work Note: I just added the (unique name) bits, those aren't actually there--I have also verified bucket names, but I don't even think this is getting that far. I also have my heroku environment vars setup correctly and have them setup on dev
