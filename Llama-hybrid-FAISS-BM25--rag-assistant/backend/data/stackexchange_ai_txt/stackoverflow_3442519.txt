Should I use nested if .. else statements for a series of less than comparisons in PHP

I need to do a series of comparisons with an integer in PHP, returning a different string depending on the result and I am wondering if an if..else block is the most elegant method. The code looks like: if( $total Which works, I just don't think it's very pretty. If I was doing equality checks then I would use a switch block.
