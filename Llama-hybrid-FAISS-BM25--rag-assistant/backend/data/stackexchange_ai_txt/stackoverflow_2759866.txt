How to detect user agent in WCF web service

How can I detect the user agent in a web service? My web service is implemented using a WCF webservice with basicHTTPBinding. It will be a post from some SOAP clients. I wish to know the user-agent from the clients. I shall like to see some sample code for this. I am using a WCF based web service and in the svc.cs, I tried to catch this.Context.Request.UserAgent . But it gives the following error: this.Context.Request.UserAgent 'MySoapService.MyService' does not contain a definition for 'Context' and no extension method 'Context' accepting a first argument of type 'MySoapService.MyService' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) I also tried System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.UserAgent and it says: 'System.Web.HttpContext.Current' is null Edit note: I tried to activate the ASP.NET compatibility mode. I added in the config file and added [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Required)] on the top of the class that implements the service interface. Then using System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.UserAgent gives me the user agent as desired.
