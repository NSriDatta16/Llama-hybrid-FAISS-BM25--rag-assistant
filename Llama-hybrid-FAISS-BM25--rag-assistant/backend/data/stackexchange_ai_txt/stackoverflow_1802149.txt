specific context menu per UltraTreeNode

I have a problem using Infragistics UltraTree control. I need a way to add a specific context menu to an UltraTreeNode. I saw that there is a contextMenu property for the UltraTree, but I need a unique one per each node. what is the best way for doing this in C#?
