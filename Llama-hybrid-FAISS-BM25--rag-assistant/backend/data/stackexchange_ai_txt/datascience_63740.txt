Much later I found what I was actually looking for: Entity Embeddings Basically I add contextual information to the neural network where I state if the field was missing is therefor zero. I split up each field into 3 categories per field: zero, non-zero, missing, because there are multiple patterns in the data within the fields, that I am not always aware of. I found this solution by reading this paper: Outlier Detection for Multidimensional Time Series using Deep Neural Networks (DOI:10.1109/MDM.2018.00029)
