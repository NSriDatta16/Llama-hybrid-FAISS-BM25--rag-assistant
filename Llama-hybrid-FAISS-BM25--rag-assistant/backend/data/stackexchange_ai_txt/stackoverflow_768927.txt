I suppose the 'intended' pattern would be to use SQl Express on the desktop and use merge-replication to the server. I don't expect that you can use SqlCe on the desktop as the 'server' end for the Sync framework. Amongst others, SqlCe is single user and that won't do for the SyncAgent. Even if it might seem workable in your situation. What might work is to have the Mobile sync with the server and the desktop with the server too. But i realize that doesn't solve your connection problem and may make the copy on the PC superfluous.
