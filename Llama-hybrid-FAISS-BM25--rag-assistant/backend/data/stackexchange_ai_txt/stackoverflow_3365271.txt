Standard URL Normalization - Java

I would like to ask if there's any Java package or library that have the standard URL normalization? 5 Components of URL Representation http://www[dot]example[dot]com:8040/folder/exist?name=sky#head scheme: http authority: www.example.com:8040 path: /folder/exist query: ?name=sky fragment: #head The 3 types of standard URL normalization Syntax-Based Normalization Case normalization – convert all letter at scheme and authority components to lower case Percent-encoded normalization – decode any percent-encoded octet that corresponds to unreserved character, such as %2D for hyphen and %5 for underscore Path segment normalization – remove dot-segments from the path component, such as ‘.’ and ‘..’ Scheme-Based Normalization Add trailing ‘/’ after the authority component of URL Remove default port number, such as 80 for http scheme Truncate the fragment of URL Protocol-Based Normalization Only appropriate when the results of accessing the resources are equivalent For example, example.com/data is directed to example.com/data/ by origin server
