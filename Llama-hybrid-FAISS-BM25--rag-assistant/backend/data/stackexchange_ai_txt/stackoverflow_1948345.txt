The GC does multiple passes. It looks for unreachable objects and when it finds them checks if they have a finalizer. If there is a finalizer, then it puts them into a separate finalizer queue and if not, cleans them up. So on first pass, it doesn't actually call any finalizers, it just organizes objects based on whether or not they have finalizers.
