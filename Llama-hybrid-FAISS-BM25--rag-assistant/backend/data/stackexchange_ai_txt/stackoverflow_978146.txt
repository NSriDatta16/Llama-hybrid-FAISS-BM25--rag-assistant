How to install a custom desktop application database to SQL Express?

I have a WPF desktop application that uses a custom database for storage. I need to prepare a setup project (from Visual studio 2008) (full setup, not ClickOnce). I can add the to the list of prerequisites to the application and it does install during the setup of the application. My question is: How can I run a script during the setup to create the database that the application needs? OR how can I restore the database to the client machine during the setup? Another related question, what would happen if already exists on the client machine? How to detect the instance name and connection data? And then how to be able -if needed- to change the Connection string used by Entity framework to connect to that database? Thanks, Ed
