Django avatar util problem

I've got a django project working on a development server(ubuntu) that we have been working on for a good while. I'm trying to install it now locally on my mac book pro. I'm relatively new to the Django environment (10 years in LAMP). I tried installing all the relevant packages e.g. south, django-registration etc. I'm having a problem with django-avatar I think though. When I try run the server I get the following error. I'm not sure where to go from here to fix the problem. any tips and general education would be greatly appreciated. $ python manage.py runserver Validating models...
