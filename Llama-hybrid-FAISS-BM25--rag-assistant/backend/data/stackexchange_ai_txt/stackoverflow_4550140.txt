Yes, appendTo modifies the DOM. But when you do "view source," what you see is not a version of the current state of the DOM, but a re-retrieved (or cached) version of the original HTML source code (and thus, something stale, not live). To see changes to the DOM, you'll need to use a tool that does that: With Firefox, use Firebug's HTML tab (the name is a bit misleading). With Chrome or Safari, use "Dev Tools"'s "Elements" tab. (Dev Tools is Ctrl+Shift+I in Chrome; on both browsers, though, it's available from the wrench menu in the top right-hand corner. You may have to enable it in the preferences.) With IE, use the free version of VS.Net. With Opera, use Dragonfly's (View | Developer tools | Dragonfly) DOM tab. In Chrome, Safari, and Opera (at least ), if you right-click an element, there's an "Inspect Element" option on the context menu that opens up the built-in tool directly; I think recent versions of Firebug do the same on Firefox.
