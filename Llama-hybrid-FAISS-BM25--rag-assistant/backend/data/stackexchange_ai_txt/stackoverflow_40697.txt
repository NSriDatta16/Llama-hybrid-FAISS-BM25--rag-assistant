Having a single exit point reduces Cyclomatic Complexity and therefore, in theory , reduces the probability that you will introduce bugs into your code when you change it. Practice however, tends to suggest that a more pragmatic approach is needed. I therefore tend to aim to have a single exit point, but allow my code to have several if that is more readable.
