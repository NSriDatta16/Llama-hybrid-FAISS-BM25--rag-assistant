Your question is so broad that the answer is: it depends. Still, to give some more useful answer I'll indicate what I think are common in Research. Storing of data is very often done in text files. When doing statistical analyses you mostly work with a collection of one type of vectors. This can be seen as a table and written in csv format. The reason thins are often stored in plain-text, is because simply every tool can read them and it is easy to transform them. About analyzing, this is a bit harder to be specific. If it is 2 dimensional, make a scatterplot. If it is high-dimensional, do PCA and see where the first principal components exist of to discover important variables. If you have time data, plot it. This is all so general that to be useful you have to really indicate better what your data is.
