Using blocking in propensity score analysis?

I'm considering blocking my analysis dataset on one or two key variables prior to a standard sub-classification propensity score analysis. For example, if my dataset (which contains member level pre- and post-treatment period hospital utilization outcomes) is blocked on the # of hospital ED visits during the pre-treatment time period: 0, 1, or 2+ visits, then sub-classification based on propensity scores would be conducted on both the treatment and control groups within each block. The overall Average Treatment Effect (ATE) could then be calculated as a weighted average of the ATEs within each block. Is this a valid approach to PSA to improve the balance of treatment and control members being compared?
