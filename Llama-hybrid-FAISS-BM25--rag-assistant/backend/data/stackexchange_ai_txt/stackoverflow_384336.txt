Using Python Web GET data

I'm trying to pass information to a python page via the url. I have the following link text: " " % (str(r[0])) on the complete page, I have this: import cgi def complete(): form = cgi.FieldStorage() db = MySQLdb.connect(user="", passwd="", db="todo") c = db.cursor() c.execute("delete from tasks where id =" + str(form["id"])) return " Task completed! Click here to go back! " The problem is that when i go to the complete page, i get a key error on "id". Does anyone know how to fix this? EDIT when i run cgi.test() it gives me nothing I think something is wrong with the way i'm using the url because its not getting passed through. its basically localhost/chris/complete?id=1 /chris/ is a folder and complete is a function within index.py Am i formatting the url the wrong way?
