Generating data from eleven Gaussians, following a description from a paper

I am reading the paper by Mika et al. Kernel PCA and de-noising in feature space and in the 4th page I am reading the following In the first experiment (table 1), we generated a data set from eleven Gaussians in $R^{10}$ with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$ in each component, by selecting from each source 100 points as a training set and 33 points for a test set (centers of the Gaussians randomly chosen in $[-1,1]^{10}$). Now I am trying to reproduce the above dataset in Matlab, but I am confused because it should be (as I understand it) like this mu = zeros(10,1) sigma = diag(0.2*ones(10,1)) % one of the 11 gaussians r = mnvrnd(mu,sigma,15) This will give me a 15x10 matrix from which I'll randomly choose 100 for the train and 33 for the test (unique cases). Then I'll repeat for another case (a change in $\sigma$. In the end I'll have a matrix $X\in R^{133\times 11}$ for the train and and $R^{33\times 11}$ for the test. However I am confused by the last sentence " (centers of the Gaussians randomly chosen in $[-1,1]^{10}$). ". Does this mean that the Gaussians don't have mean 0 . Additionally, is the above reasoning correct?
