Train an SVM with only a single example per class?

Suppose I am doing multi-class classification (for example on MNIST), but I only give a single labeled example of each class. So like the training set has only a single 0, a single 1, a single 2, and so on, and then I examine accuracy on a held-out test set. I assume it wouldn't do very well. But is this even possible ? I know this wouldn't be so useful, but I'm just interested in what's happening behind the scenes when I do this. I know that many algorithms can do one-shot learning, but I've never heard of SVM doing this, and can't find much on what would be actually happening if you did this. I also know about Exemplar-SVMs , which seem similar in principle but still aren't really what I'm talking about. Any help?
