Change nil's to zeroes in elisp

I'd like to ask - what is the function doing nil conversion from nil's to zeroes in elisp? I'm a newbie and I think I am inventing the wheel with my code: (defun chgnull (x) (if (null x) 0 1)) (mapcar 'chgnull '(1 2 nil)) Search through Emacs sources by keyword "to zero" and such haven't shown anything relevant.
