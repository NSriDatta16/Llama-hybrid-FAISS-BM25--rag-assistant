Programming tips with Japanese Language/Characters

I have an idea for a few web apps to write to help me, and maybe others, learn Japanese better since I am studying the language. My problem is the site will be in mostly english, so it needs to mix fluently Japanese Characters, usually hirigana and katakana, but later kanji. I am getting closer to accomplishing this; I have figured out that the pages and source files need to be unicode and utf-8 content types. However, my problem comes in the actual coding. What I need is to manipulate strings of text that are kana. One example is: けす I need to take that verb and convert it to the te-form けして. I would prefer to do this in javascript as it will help down the road to do more manipulation, but if I have to will just do DB calls and hold everything in a DB. My question is not only how to do it in javascript, but what are some tips and strategies to doing these kinds of things in other languages, too. I am hoping to get more into doing language learning apps, but am lost when it comes to this.
