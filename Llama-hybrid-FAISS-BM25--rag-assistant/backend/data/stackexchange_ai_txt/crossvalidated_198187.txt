You are right, oftentimes logistic regression does poorly as a classifier (especially when compared to other algorithms). However, this doesn't mean logistic regression should be forgotten and never studied as it has two big advantages: Probabilistic results. Frank Harrell (+1) explained this very well in his answer. It allows us to understand the impact an independent variable has on the dependent variable while controlling for other independent variables. For example, it provides estimates and standard errors for conditional odds ratios (how many times larger are the odds of $Y=1$ when $X_1 = 1$ instead of $2$ while holding $X_2,...X_p$ constant).
