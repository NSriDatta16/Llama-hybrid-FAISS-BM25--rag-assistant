Just to clarify what Maerlyn is saying - what you're describing is impossible. The website can only access cookies from its own domain. When you go to facebook.com, your facebook cookies are sent to that domain. When you go to google, your facebook cookies are NOT sent there. There is no way for Google to look at your Facebook cookies. Even it uses iframes. Period. This is a security feature. So, I suggest you look at other ways to design your software system. For example, if the website you're embedding has an API, I'd use that. Or do a back-end service synchronization to pull in user information. In any case, you need the consent of the other service / other domain to do this.
