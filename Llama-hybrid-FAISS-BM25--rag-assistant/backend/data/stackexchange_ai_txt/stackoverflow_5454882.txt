As your question is tagged "C++", I assume that your program works on local computer. Each browser has its own format of "history storage". You will have to work on different formats if you are targeting the major browsers, e.g. Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc. For example, Firefox and Chrome stores its history in a SQLite database, while IE stores in a binary file named "index.dat".
