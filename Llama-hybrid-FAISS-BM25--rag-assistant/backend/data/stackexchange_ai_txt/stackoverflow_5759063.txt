Rails Logic in controllers?

I am always reading about keeping Controllers thin and doing all logic in models. While this makes senses to me for interacting with databases, what about situations where there is no need to for database interactions? I have a fairly complex module in my app that interact with several different third party APIs. I use ajax calls to my controller, where all the data is gathered from the APIs and then organized. Then it is displayed via the corresponding .js.erb or .html.erb files. Is this the proper way to handle this kind of situation? I'm new to rails and don't want to get into habit of doing things wrong.
