How do you convert an XSLT 2.0 date duration to a string?

I am using some code to subtract one date from another using XSLT 2.0: This works, however it leaves me with an answer of P2243D, which I assume corresponds to a "Period of 2243 Days" (which is correct in terms of the math). Since I only need the number of days, not the P and the D, I know I could use substring or something similar, but as a newbie to XSLT, I'm curious if there is a better, more elegant way to do this than simple string manipulation.
