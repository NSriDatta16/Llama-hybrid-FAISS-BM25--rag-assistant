Thanks Remover. This is close to what i needed, but in the end, since the knob object is passing an event to a controller class, i needed a way to measure value from the rotation...ie: 340* is 94% at CClockWise. Anyway, i ended up resolving this using the method above and passing the currentValue to a delegate. The delegate would then take that method and with it's own private float, compare if the value is higher or lower than the last value received: //delegate uses a private value to measure from last call back #pragma mark UIKnobViewDelegate - (void)dialValue:(float)value { if (lastValue == 0.00) { lastValue = lastValue; } if (value from there, our controller can do anything it likes
