Estimating P(C|A,B) from P(C|A) and P(C|B): Bayes Rule? Bayes Net? Classifier?

Doing some ecommerce analytics, I want to understand click propensity broken out by different features present in users' profiles. In this scenario, it's easy to test click propensity $p(C)$ broken out by any single feature, but it becomes difficult to test multiple features at once. This is to say, for features $A$ and $B$, I could have good sample sizes to estimate $p(C|A)$ and $p(C|B)$, but not necessarily for the joint probability $p(C|A,B)$. So, I'd like to estimate $p(C|A,B)$ from more easily measured quantities. I can easily test $p(C)$, $p(C|A)$, and $p(C|B)$. I can also easily query how often different features occur or co-occur among users, this is to say I can easily query $p(A)$, $p(B)$, and $p(A,B)$. How can I relate $p(C|A,B)$ to these quantities, and what assumptions do I make about the interactions and dependence between events? So far, I can use Bayesian updating to make some progress: $p(C|A,B) = \dfrac{p(A|B,C)p(C)}{p(A,B)}$ $ = \dfrac{p(A|B,C) p(B|C) p(C)}{p(A,B)}$ Then by applying Bayes to the $p(B|C)$ term in the numerator: $ = \dfrac{p(A|B,C) p(C|B) p(B)}{p(A,B)}$ Or the more canonical form: $ = \dfrac{p(A|B,C) p(C|B)}{p(A|B)}$ This has a lot of the quantities I can easily find, but the $p(A|B,C)$ term is still a pain. There doesn't seem to be a way to manipulate it that doesn't have all three events occurring in the same $p(...)$. Second part of the question: Can a Bayes Net be fruitfully used to model this probability? The features among users are not explicitly causally related. Or, is this just a strange way of thinking about a classifier with response $C$ and predictors ${A,B}$? In this case is there a classifier that might perform well given the difficulty of testing the response against multiple features at once? What assumptions would it be making?
