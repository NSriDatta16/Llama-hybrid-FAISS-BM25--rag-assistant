Characteristics of some popular statistics books

I'm trying to pick a book to learn out of for the advanced undergrad/early grad level. I've heard of several popular books (in alphabetical order): Casella, George and Roger Berger. Statistical Inference . DeGroot, Morris and Mark Schervish. Probability and Statistics . Rice, John. Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis . Wackerly, Dennis; William Mendenhall and Richard Shaeffer. Mathematical Statistics with Applications . Wasserman, Larry. All of Statistics . ... Others I may have missed ... What are the characteristics of these? I am especially interested in Substantive focus Prerequisite knowledge Depth of coverage Focus on intuitiveness or on mathematical rigor Clarity of explication
