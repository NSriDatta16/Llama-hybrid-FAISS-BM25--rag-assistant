To start: You've declared the input as "brand_id[]", so you are looking for $data['brand_id'] , which should be an array. In the commented code, you appear to use that data, but your current code only looks for $data['expert_id'] , which doesn't seem to be the same thing. Even if you change that line to $data['brand_id'] , keep in mind that it is an array , so you'll need to be cognizant of that in queries. You've got a bunch of logic in the controller that doesn't belong there. In an MVC app (of which Magento is a canonical example), most of that SQL logic (as well as the createdtime/updatedtime stuff) belongs in the model (probably expertbrand/expertbrand ). It's not clear how you defined expertbrand/expertbrand . Is this an EAV model? What is its definition? This is most likely the root of your problem, as you have to tell Magento about your EAV model for it to save like that. Please fix those things (and clarify on the model code) and we can debug further if necessary. Thanks, Joe
