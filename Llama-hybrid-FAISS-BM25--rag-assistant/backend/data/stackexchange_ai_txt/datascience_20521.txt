Sliding window time series data with Python Pandas data frame

I have data that looks like: 1495573445.162, 0, 0.021973, 0.012283, -0.995468, 1 1495573445.172, 0, 0.021072, 0.013779, -0.994308, 1 1495573445.182, 0, 0.020157, 0.015717, -0.995575, 1 1495573445.192, 0, 0.017883, 0.012756, -0.993927, 1 1495573445.202, 0, 0.021194, 0.012161, -0.994705, 1 1495573445.212, 0, 0.019638, 0.013718, -0.994019, 1 1495573445.222, 0, 0.019440, 0.010803, -0.994476, 1 1495573445.232, 0, 0.018112, 0.010849, -0.993073, 1 1495573445.242, 0, 0.020157, 0.011154, -0.994644, 1 1495573445.252, 0, 0.020340, 0.010040, -0.995804, 1 1495573445.262, 0, 0.017792, 0.009857, -0.996078, 1 1495573445.272, 0, 0.020538, 0.010239, -0.994858, 1 This is accelerometer data where the data frame columns are labeled "Time stamp" , "Time skipped" , "x" , "y" , "z" , and "label" with the index set to "Time stamp" . The sampling rate is around 100Hz. How should I create a sliding window in this case? I came up with this: def sliding_window(data, window_size, step_size): data = pd.rolling_window(data, window_size) data = data[step_size - 1 :: step_size] print data return data I doubt this is the correct answer, and I don't know what to set window_size and step_size given that I have a 100Hz sampling rate.
