How to determine whether a classifier like adaboost is weak?

I run the cross-validation experiment for a given data set, and tried two different approaches: one is based on SVM, another is based on SVM plus Adaboost. But the confusion matrix for two experiments are exactly the same. I am confused on how to explain this kind of result. Adaboost is supposed to start with a weak classifier, but how to determine whether a classifier is weak?
