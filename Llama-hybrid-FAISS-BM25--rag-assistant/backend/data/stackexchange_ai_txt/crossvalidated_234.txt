Say you have a cloud of N points in, say, 3D (which can be listed in a 100x3 array). Then, the principal components analysis (PCA) fits an arbitrarily oriented ellipsoid into the data. The principal component score is the length of the diameters of the ellipsoid. In the direction in which the diameter is large, the data varies a lot, while in the direction in which the diameter is small, the data varies litte. If you wanted to project N-d data into a 2-d scatter plot, you plot them along the two largest principal components, because with that approach you display most of the variance in the data.
