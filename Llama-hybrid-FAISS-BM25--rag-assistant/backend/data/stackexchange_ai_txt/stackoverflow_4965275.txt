According to this Enterprise FAQ page on Apple , you can't distribute on the App Store using an Enterprise account. The firm will have to also get a "regular" iOS Developer account: I am enrolled in the iOS Developer Enterprise Program. Can I distribute my applications on the App Store? The ability to distribute applications on the App Store is available to developers who enroll in the iOS Developer Program as an Individual or a Company. The iOS Developer Enterprise Program only allows you to distribute your applications to employees or members of your organization through Ad Hoc distribution. If your company is enrolled in the Enterprise Program but would also like to distribute your application(s) to customers via the App Store, you will need to enroll in the iOS Developer Program as an Individual or as a Company.
