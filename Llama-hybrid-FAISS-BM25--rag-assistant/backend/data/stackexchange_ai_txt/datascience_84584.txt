How to represent genre or artist name in a neural network

I am writing a music recommendation system using machine learning. I'm attempting to make sense of ensemble networks to allow the system to learn from both the content-based features, as well as the global 'meta' features, such as the genre, year, artist etc. However, I do not know how I should represent the genre and artist information. Making them integers would imply some sort of order. If Kanye West is 24, what should 25 be? 26? Or is there something fundamentally wrong with my approach?
