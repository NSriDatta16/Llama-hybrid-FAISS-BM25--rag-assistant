The classifier would not necessarily be a logistic regression(it would be an SVM or some other classifiers), but it would be simpler to illustrate the issue using just logistic regression. What is the output should I look at? I thought you mean logistic regression. The output would just be a float between 0 to 1 or two floats complementing each other(we use this type here, but they are equivalent) and adding up to 1. You can refer to this answer . You can see from the picture below that the blue and red nodes form a binomial logistic regression model . Is that mean if I input a picture (either Cat and Dog), I can know the picture (is cat or is a dog) by looking at the output? Yes. The CNN or any other encoders is just for extracting features. The last layer of a CNN is just like the input of the logistic regression. The fully connected layer depicted below is what I mean the last layer of the CNN, and the output as depicted is what you want. In your case, there would be just 2 floats(each red node is a float number). Each red node stands for a class and they add up to 1 and you choose the one with the biggest number . In your case, if 0 indexed node represents cats and 1 indexed node represents dogs(you train it to do that with such labels) and node 1 is bigger than node 0(in the inference mode) we can say that the input of the model would be a dog. A simple and typical CNN binary classifier . Hope this removes your doubts.
