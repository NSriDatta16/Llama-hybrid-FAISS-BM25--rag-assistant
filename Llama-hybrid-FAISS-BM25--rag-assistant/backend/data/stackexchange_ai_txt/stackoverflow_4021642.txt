One thing I would point out from a performance perspective is that depending on how you pass parameters to a method, passing lots of parameters by value will slow the program down because each parameter has to be copied and then placed on the stack. Using a single class to encompass all of the parameters would work better because a single parameter passed by reference would be elegant and cleaner, and quicker!
