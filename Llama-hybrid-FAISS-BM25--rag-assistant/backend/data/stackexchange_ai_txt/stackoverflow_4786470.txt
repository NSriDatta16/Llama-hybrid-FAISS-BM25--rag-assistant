How do I get a handle to the TreeWidgetItem being dropped in PyQt DragNDrop?

I am trying to handle a drop event on a TreeWidget from itself by overriding the dropEvent method. Ultimately, I need to get a handle to the TreeWidgetItem being dropped. So far, the only useful information I get from the event regarding the dropped item is a QByteArray that seems to contain text from the item being dropped, except that it's poorly formatted with lots of spaces and a bunch of non-printable characters. Any help would be greatly appreciated. edit: Here is the code, as asked, but I'm really not doing anything special, I'm literally just reading the only type of data contained in the mimeData of the drop event. It sounds as though I'm going to have to override the Drag event?? And add some type of identifier to allow me to get a handle back to the original QTreeWidget?? def dropEvent( self, event ): data = event.mimeData().data( 'application/x-qabstractitemmodeldatalist' ) print data
