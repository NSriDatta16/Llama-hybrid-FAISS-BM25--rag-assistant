As nduplessis said, UIGestureRecognizer will do it. It should be able to differentiate between dragging the map and performing the swipe gesture, so you should be fine. Creating and adding the gesture recognizer: UISwipeGestureRecognizer *swipeRight = [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(swipeRightAction:)]; swipeRight.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionRight; swipeRight.delegate = self; [mapView addGestureRecognizer:swipeRight]; Reacting to the gesture: - (void)swipeRightAction:(UISwipeGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { //Switch views...(do this however you have been switching views) [mapView.superview addSubview:wikipediaView]; [mapView removeFromSuperview]; }
