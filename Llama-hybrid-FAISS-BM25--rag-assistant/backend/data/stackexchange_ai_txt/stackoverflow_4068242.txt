The best datatype to store hours is the one designed for it - TimeSpan . It has methods that allow you to add/subtract/convert it. As for storage in a database, it really depends on what you are using this for and what kind of resolution is required. I would use the time datatype - as it will hold the range: 00:00:00.0000000 through 23:59:59.9999999 However, if you need to hold more than 24 hours in this field, you may want to consider a tinyint or int holding the number of minutes (assuming that is the maximum time resolution you require).
