What's the diff between VSS 6.0 and VSS 2005?

We've been using VSS 6.0 since time began, but yesterday I nabbed VSS2005 off of our MSDN subscription, it wouldn't let me install it off the ISO through Daemon Tools (not sure why, but I submitted error report to MS...). I noticed it had a program files directory right on the ISO, so I just copied the folder onto my hard drive. Well, I opened up the client and behold, a glamorous version of VSS 6.0 connected to the exact same DB. Anyone know if I'm going to destroy everything by using it?
