A buffer is a contemporary collection of location where a huge amount of data is managed or disassembled. This may be basic for interaction with a set of collection device that needs huge blocks of information, or when data must be given in a many way than that in which it is made, or rarely considerable when less blocks are not sufficient. The advantage is here even if the buffered data are stored to the buffer in one time and get from the buffer once. A cache , on the other side, thinks that the data will be get from the cache more one time than they are written on them. Its aim is to less the accesses to the underlying stock. Buffer is a programmable cache managed by the operating system in the main storage and is used to have the most necessary data from disk, so that they don't have to be gotten again from the memory. This feature is available by the operating system. While cache is in real a hardware that the CPU uses to reduced the effective memory access time.
