How to identify the storagecard removed notification of smartphone devices

I am using windows mobile device, i want to know how to get notification if the storage card is removed from the device.I have DLL it has all the imported methods which send messages if the card is added or removed, but this case works fine if the DLL is in the device memory.If the application is installed in storage card, then DLL will be in Card as soon as card removed,the DLL goes out and i will not get any information from the phone that card removed or some thing like that.i am developing application in c#.DLL code is in C++, its quite tough to port it to C#,i tried to make DLL as .lib and use in c# project,but in c# we cant use .lib files also.that is the problem. we cant load DLL to main memory like .exe file.. so i m in trouble.. can any one let me know how to come up with this. Thanks
