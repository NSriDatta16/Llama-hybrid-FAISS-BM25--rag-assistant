Getting an Average over Multiple Collections in LINQ

I have a collection of collections, all the child collections have the same number of elements. The parent collection does nothing other than hold the child collections. [0] [Child_0] [ID: 1] [0] [Child_0] [Amount: 4] [0] [Child_1] [ID: 2] [0] [Child_1] [Amount: 7] [1] [Child_0] [ID: 1] [1] [Child_0] [Amount: 2] [1] [Child_1] [ID: 2] [1] [Child_1] [Amount: 4] [2] [Child_0] [ID: 1] [2] [Child_0] [Amount: 5] [2] [Child_1] [ID: 2] [2] [Child_1] [Amount: 3] For my output I don't care about the parent collection. I just want an anonymous type of ID and average of amounts, so for the above it would be ID Avg 1 3.66 2 4.66 Language of the response does not matter. Thanks.
