Use the javascript libraries that come bundled with your JSF2 implementation (as required by the spec). Here are the API docs: http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/2.0/docs/js-api/index.html The jsf.ajax.addOnEvent solves your problem of "adding some javascript to all ajax postback responses": This function must accept a reference to an existing JavaScript function. The JavaScript function reference must be added to a list of callbacks, making it possible to register more than one callback by invoking jsf.ajax.addOnEvent more than once.
