Anomaly detection in time series data

Hi I have a large data set of objects, each containing a list of the same attributes. The data is arranged in a time series so that the value for an attribute for an object is indexed by its time. I want to model each attribute and perform some kind of anomaly detection. I also want to see which other attributes have similar patterns where the anomalies occur i.e. if they are correlated or dependent on each other. Once I have a model, I wish to use it on a test set to predict anomalies for an object before they occur. Any recommendations on how to approach this?
