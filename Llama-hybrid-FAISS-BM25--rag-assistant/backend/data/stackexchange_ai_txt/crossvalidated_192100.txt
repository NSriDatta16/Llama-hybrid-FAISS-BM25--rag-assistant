When to use regression trees/forests?

As I was looking for a fine regression algorithm for my problem. I found out one can do that with simple decision trees as well, which is usually used for classification. The output would be something like: The red noise would be the prediction states of such a tree or forest. Now my question is, why at all to use this method, when there are alternatives, that really try to figure out the underlying equation (such as the famous support vector machines SVM). Are there any positive / unique aspects, or was a regression tree more a nice-to-have-algorithm?
