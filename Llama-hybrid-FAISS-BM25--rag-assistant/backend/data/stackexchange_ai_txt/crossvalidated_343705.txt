This may be a late answer but I will try to answer it however. In pages 117-130 of Raudenbush and Bryk (2002) , as you rightly mentioned, the slope as outcome model has been represented as $$ MATHACH_{ij} = β_{0j} + β_{1j} SES + r_{ij} $$ $$ β_{0j} = γ_{00} + γ_{01}(SCHTYPE) + γ_{02}(MEANSES) + u_{0j} $$ $$ β_{1j} = γ_{10} + γ_{11}(SCHTYPE) + γ_{12}(MEANSES) + u_{1j} $$ This translates to a a 2 level HLM model that can be written in lmer as lmer(mathach ~ sector + meanses + ses + sector:ses + meanses:ses + ... The authors explain the significant coefficients in Page 128 which are nothing but the interaction effects coefficients. I came across a webpage that describes Bayesian meta-regression where they model the slopes of the hierarchical model, which is what you had in mind perhaps.
