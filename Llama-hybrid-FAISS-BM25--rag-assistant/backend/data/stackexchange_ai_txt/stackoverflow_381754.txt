I'm not sure why everybody else is posting ASP.Net solutions when you specifically said you're using ASP "classic." Something like this should work. I didn't write the code; I found it elsewhere. But the MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP object is what you want to use if you don't want to purchase something commercial. function getHTML (strUrl) Set xmlHttp = Server.Createobject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP") xmlHttp.Open "GET", strUrl, False xmlHttp.setRequestHeader "User-Agent", "asp httprequest" xmlHttp.setRequestHeader "content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" xmlHttp.Send getHTML = xmlHttp.responseText xmlHttp.abort() set xmlHttp = Nothing end function You might need to add some error-handling code to that for use in a production environment. I believe that object throws errors if it gets a 404 or timeout error. You'll need to "trap" them ASP-style (yuck) by setting On Error Resume Next before the .Send and then examine the ASP error object to see if there was a problem. Good luck!
