Embed indentifier within an Email

I am trying to embed an ID into an email so that when a recipient replies to an email that my system sends out, my system can pick it up and match the two together. I have tried appending a custom header, however this is stripped out when the user replies. I have tried embedding an HTML comment within the email, but outlook does not seem to keep comments when a reply email is created. Worst case scenario, I can manually try and match the sent and received emails by time span or have a visible tag within the message body. Does anyone know of a more elegant solution? Thanks in advance
