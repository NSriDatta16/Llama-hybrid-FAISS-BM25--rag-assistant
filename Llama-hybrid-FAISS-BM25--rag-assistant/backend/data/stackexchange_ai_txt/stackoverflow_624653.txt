Is Monostate the good cousin of the evil Singleton?

Singleton is definitely one of the most misused and abused patterns out there. Many of us have been infected with Singletonitis at one point or another. Curiously, its close cousin Monostate is less famous and less used. What is your opinion of Monostate? Good or just as evil? Is it a better alternative to using Singleton? Would you also discourage its use as you would with Singleton?
