This sounds to me like an over-dispersion problem. 1. For the Poisson, you can "prove" than the distribution approximates the Normal given the right values of $\lambda$ and $n$ . 2. It's quite common (I think McCullough and Nelder said safer to assume as default) that count data IRL have variance bigger than mean, and there is a whole world of over-dispersion models to use. You can use a form of the Negative Binomial (for example) to model your data which respects the discrete non-negative property of your data, but doesn't restrict you to having variance equal to the mean. One way of thinking about the Negative Binomial is a Poisson with a the location parameter $\lambda$ assumed to follow a Gamma distribution. I think (more by accident than design) I've tended to assume a log-Normal distribution for $\lambda$ whenever I've done this kind of modelling, but the nice thing about the Poisson-Gamma in a Bayesian framework is you get a nice simple (well, analytically tractable) posterior distribution. That sounds perfect for your problem.
