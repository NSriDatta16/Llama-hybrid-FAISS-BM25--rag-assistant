Scaling and centring in PCA of compositional data

I am following this review's approach for PCA using compositional data. It involves computing the centred log-ratio (CLR) transformation of the compositional data, and then running PCA on the resulting matrix (a "log-ratio analysis" apparently). I use prcomp() in R for the PCA, and it is not clear to me whether and how I should set the center and scale. parameters. The dimension of my compositional data is large (over 100 components), and they all have similar magnitudes. How would one choose whether to centre and scale such data? Thank you
