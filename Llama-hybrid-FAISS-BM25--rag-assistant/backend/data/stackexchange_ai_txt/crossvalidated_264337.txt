Random forest is generally a better model if the goal is for prediction. In other words, we'd want to reduce the variance of the model. For example, the built-in OOB validation error rate is handy and can be efficiently implemented. However, we prefer a single decision tree if the goal is for exploratory analysis. We often just want to understand how the data is related in a tree hierarchy structure.
