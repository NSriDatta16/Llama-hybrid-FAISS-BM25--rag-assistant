UITabBar without labels (like Tweetie 2/Twitter for iPhone)

I'd like to build an app with a tabbar in the style of Tweetie 2/Twitter for iPhone (that is, images with no labels). I can't see a way to do it with normal UITabBarController/UITabBar, and my current thinking is that it's actually a UIToolbar with a custom view controller that is pushing and popping views from an array to simulate the UITabBarController's default behavior. Is this the approach that you all would recommend, or is there something more elegant that I'm overlooking?
