How to delete a checkbox when it is ticked?

I have a template that displays the list of items. It has one checkbox to each item. I want to be able to remove an item from a checkbox when a checkbox is ticked. So I would need a button that deletes an item once a checkbox is selected. Here is my template. {% for item in items %} {{item.tiptop_id}} {{item.alternative_id}} {{item.title}} {{item.type}} {{item.format}} {% endfor %} I would need probably know what to write in my views as well I guess. Edit: Not sure why it is still not deleting. check out my views. My edit order form. It is quiet huge. I thought the delete function would do the trick. Anyway take a look. def edit_order(request, order_no): # Alot of code here if request.method == 'POST': form = forms.OrderForm(request.POST, instance = order) if form.is_valid() and save_item is not None: form.save(True) request.user.message_set.create(message = "The order has been updated successfully.") return HttpResponse(" window.opener.location = window.opener.location; window.close(); ") if status is not None and contact is not None and save_status is not None and delete_item is not None: try: for id in status_items: item = models.StorageItem.objects.get(pk = id) delete_item = item delete_item.delete() current_status = models.ItemStatusHistory(item = item, contact = contact, status = status, user = request.user) current_status.save() except: pass request.user.message_set.create(message = "Status successfully changed for {0} items".format(len(status_items)))
