Prediction interval, forecast error for a function of a forecast

I have two variables $X$ and $Y$. For each variable I created a forecasting model (using time series) and estimated $X_{t+1}$ and $Y_{t+1}$ and the prediction interval and the error for each. I have another variable $Z=f(X,Y)$, so $Z_{t+1}=f(X_{t+1},Y_{t+1})$. How do I calculate the prediction interval and the error for $Z_{t+1}$?
