django embedding user id into URL template best practice

I'm building a navigation menu in my django app, and one of the options is "My Account". There are different roles I have for users, but in order for them all to view their profile, I use a generic URL such as http://mysite/user/ /profile. What's a Django best practice for building this url using templates? Is it simply something like: My Account Or is it: My Account Not entirely sure what the appropriate syntax for using the url template tag is. Here's what my URLconf looks like: (r'^user/(?P \d+)/profile/$', user_profile) What's my best bet?
