determine constant for biweight (bisquare) function

In robust statistics a biweight (bisquare) function is defined as follows $$\rho \left( x \right) = \gamma\left( {1 - {{\left( {1 - {{\left( {\frac{x}{c}} \right)}^2}} \right)}^3}} \right){{\bf{1}}_{\left| x \right| \le c}} + \gamma{{\bf{1}}_{\left| x \right| > c}}$$ For an n-dimensional random variable the constant $\gamma$ can be determined using the consistency equation and c is given by the quantile of ${\chi}^2_{1-\alpha,n}$ $$ E\left[ {\rho \left( \|X \|_2\right)} \right] = n$$ If $X$ is standard n-dimensional multivariate random variable then we need to solve the following to get the value of $\gamma$ $$\int ... \int_{\textbf{R}^n} {\rho \left( {\sqrt {{z^ \top }z} } \right)} {\frac{1}{{{{\left( {2\pi } \right)}^{n/2}}}}\exp \left\{ { - \frac{1}{2}{z^ \top }z} \right\}}\,dz_n\,dz_{n-1}\,...dz_1 = n$$ This integral can be solved numerically for low dimensions or by simulation by simulating variables from a standard multivariate normal distribution, calculating the average loss using the bisquare function and setting up an optimization problem to minimize the absolute difference between the average loss and dimension n. However, I am also interested in evaluating the integral analytically or atleast make the integral more tractable to solve. The idea I have is that, the sum of squares of normal random variables has a chi-square distribution. Hence a transformation such as, $k = {z^ \top }z$, where k is chi-square random variable can collapse the integral to a univariate integral. Can someone point an example on how to convert a multidimensional integral to univariate integral or point out what the integrator and limits of the new integrator in the transformed space should be.
