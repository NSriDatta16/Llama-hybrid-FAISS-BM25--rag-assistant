How to end the user session and make sure that the user is logged out?

I am new to .aspx and now the thing is since i am doing a web enabled project, I have this login from an user. I drag dropped the login template and then used the Session["Authentication"] = username.Tostring(); to store the current logged user's info and so. Now i even used a hyperlink "Logout" at the top right corner and then made it transfer to Login page. ( If this is wrong way of transfering Please Let me know, I am Learning all by internet).. Now if on running the web , i can easily login , but when i logout through hyper link "logout" it will take me to the Login page again, but if i press the back button of the browser it again transfers the control to the data page and i can again perform the data operation's. I used this Session["Authenticate"] = null at the page load of the login page so that only at the login button click the user can enter again by Session["Authenticate"] = username.Tostring(); Then i used a check at each page load of the data pages if(Session[Authentiacte"] == null) Server.Tranfer("LoginPage.aspx"); This didnt solve my problem, Please can anyone give a hint or a link or a tip to improve my way of logout? I strated this project without any knowledge of the .net or aspx and i am still learning everything, please bare my doubts thankx in advance..
