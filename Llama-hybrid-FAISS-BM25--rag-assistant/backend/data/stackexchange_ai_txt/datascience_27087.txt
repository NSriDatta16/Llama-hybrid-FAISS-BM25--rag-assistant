If in case 1 there would be one template for organizing information on CVs then you can go for regex, but in order to have really helpful tool for real world CV you have to train ML solution. Just type in google "cv example" and you will see that people use different words and have different order of information and different formatting (formatting could be eliminated from problem scope). You can use regex but it will be enormous and I doubt that you will outperform some NER solution. In case 2 it's common chat bot case so it's question of whether on not use ML to implement chat bot (spoiler - use ML)
