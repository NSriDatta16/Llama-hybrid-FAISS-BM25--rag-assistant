I don't believe that there are any "canned" objects in C++ which are equivalent. The STL vector is not the same thing. That is essentially a dynamic array for storage of any value types whereas the vector that you're referring to is class with added member functionality, typically seen used in XNA graphic applications (in my experience at least). You are on to something with your recognition of the fact that Vector2/3/4 are data structures. You could very easily store the values of the W, X, Y, Z components in your own structure, but the added member functions provided with the Vector2/3/4 object would need to be added by you.
