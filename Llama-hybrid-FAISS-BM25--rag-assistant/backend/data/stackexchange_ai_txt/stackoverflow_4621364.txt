Strange problem publishing a fresh Ruby on Rails 3 application on localhost (Apache, Passenger and VirtualHosts)

I recently created a new Ruby on Rails 3 application locally on a Mac OS, named "test". Since I use apache2, in the private/etc/apache2/ httpd.conf I set the VirtualHost for the "test" application: ServerName test.pjtmain.localhost:443 DocumentRoot "/Users/ /Sites/test/public" RackEnv development /Sites/test/public"> Order allow,deny Allow from all # SSL Configuration SSLEngine on ... ServerName test.pjtmain.localhost DocumentRoot "/Users/ /Sites/test/public" RackEnv development /Sites/test/public"> Order allow,deny Allow from all Of course I restart apache2, but trying to access to http://test.pjtmain.localhost/ I have this error message from: FIREFOX Oops! Firefox could not find test.pjtmain.localhost Suggestions: * Search on Google: ... SAFARI Safari can’t find the server. Safari can’t open the page “http://test.pjtmain.localhost/” because Safari can’t find the server “test.pjtmain.localhost”. I have other RoR3 applications setted like that above in the httpd.conf file and all them work. What is the problem (maybe it is not related to apache...)? Notes : 1. Using the 'Network Uility' I did a Ping with the following result: ping: cannot resolve test.pjtmain.localhost: Unknown host and I did a Lookup with the follonwing result: ; > DiG 9.6.0-APPLE-P2 > test.pjtmain.localhost +multiline +nocomments +nocmd +noquestion +nostats +search ;; global options: +cmd .com. 115 IN SOA dns1. .com. dnsmaster. .com. ( 2010110500 ; serial 10800 ; refresh (3 hours) 900 ; retry (15 minutes) 604800 ; expire (1 week) 86400 ; minimum (1 day) ) 2. In /private/etc/hosts I have this code: ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting. Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1 localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1 localhost fe80::1%lo0 localhost 3. I am using Phusion Passenger 4. Since I not changed nothing to the new "test" application, I expect to see the default RoR index.html page: 5. It seems that in the 'Console Messages' there is any warning or error 6. After run 'dscacheutil -flushcache', the 'dscacheutil -statistics' response is: Overall Statistics: Average Call Time - 0.000304 Cache Hits - 5311 Cache Misses - 6113 Total External Calls - 5654 Statistics by procedure: Procedure Cache Hits Cache Misses External Calls ------------------ ---------- ------------ -------------- getpwnam 1496 149 1645 getpwuid 749 11 760 getgrnam 157 28 185 getgrgid 76 7 83 getservbyname 2818 15 26 getservbyport 0 3 3 getprotobyname 1 1 2 getfsent 0 0 2 gethostbyname 14 2816 13 gethostbyaddr 0 116 116 gethostbyname_service 0 0 2817 _flushcache 0 0 2
