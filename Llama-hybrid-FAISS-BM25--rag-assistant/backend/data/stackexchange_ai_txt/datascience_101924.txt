There are few good startups and open sources that offer solutions for ML monitoring (I actually work at a startup in the field). You can find here a few comparison tools to compare between some of them according to different features. I recommend the airtable by Ori on the top of the list, and mlops.toys (This is an open-source created by some of my colleagues so maybe I'm biased, but I love it). The MLCompendium is, in general, a good source for information in many subjects in the ml field. I really can't recommend the best tool for you because it depends on your exact needs : Do you look for monitoring on the way as part of a full pipeline tool, or some super-advanced tool specifically for monitoring to expand your existing pipeline? Do you work with Tabular data? NLP? Vision? What is the frequency of your predictions? Do you need to monitor all your data or just a segment of it? etc... In addition, this short blog post a colleague of mine wrote on Concept Drift Detection Methods may help you as well. You can find many more articles on the subject in the link to the MLCompendium I attached above.
