classification of multiple outcomes with categorical and continuous predictors

I have a dataset which consists of mainly categorical predictors (n=7) and also some continuous ones (n = 3) and a binary outcome variable. I have previously made a classification model using logistic regression. This model performs well with an AUC on a testing set of 67%. I have the option of breaking down the binary outcome into multiple outcome categories and I have reason the believe that this will increase prediction accuracy. This final model will also have to be implemented in excel (though I build my models in R). From reading Introduction to Statistical Analysis by Trevor Hastie, and from this article: https://help.xlstat.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2062225-discriminant-analysis-in-excel-tutorial?b_id=9283 it appears that Linear Discriminant Analysis is the clear choice. However, from this post: Can we use categorical independent variable in discriminant analysis? it appears that LDA doesn't handle categorical input variables. The best multi-class classification algorithm would probably by a neural network, however that would be too difficult/impossible to implement in excel. What approach can I take to build a multiclass classification model based on categorical and continuous predictors? Thanks
