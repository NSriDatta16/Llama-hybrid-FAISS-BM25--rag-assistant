I'm assuming you'll be deploying your code via a WSP; if not, using a tool like WSPBuilder is a great starting place that allows you to get rolling without forcing you to learn all of the intricate details of solution package construction. You should leverage the SPWebConfigModification type from within a custom SPFeatureReceiver . Normally, the FeatureActivated method of the SPFeatureReceiver would be coded to write the changes out to the web.config files impacted by your activation. Those same changes would then be retracted in the FeatureDeactivating method. The nice thing about the SPWebConfigModification type is that SharePoint takes care of determining which web.config files should be modified -- across servers and across extended web apps. I hope this helps!
