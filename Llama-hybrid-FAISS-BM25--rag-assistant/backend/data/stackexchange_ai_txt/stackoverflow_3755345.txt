Once I did the same thing pulling data from XLM to SQL trough SSIS package. Here is basic steps. Make DTS package In DataFlow select source connection XML and fill up form abaout source and VXD (structure) file Then make destination connection Pull green line from Source to Destination You need to pay attention to VXD is right format, so SSIS can read data preply. Somewhere in my office desktop I still have source of that SSIS Package, first thing in morning I am going to try find that and share here. Also If is source of your XML is public please post here so we can try make one for you. Aru You preferred more to do this task usin C# or integration service ?
