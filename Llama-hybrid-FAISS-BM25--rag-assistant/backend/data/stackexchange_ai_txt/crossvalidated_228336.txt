Comparing two distributions with zeros (X=ordinal, Y=count)

I am more or less familiar with the stats. However, recently I ran in the following problem. Problem: I would like to compare two distributions that are zero inflated (to some extend). The two distr. y and z I would like to compare with look as follows (I am using R code to illustrate the issue): y z As you can see, the counts are quite huge and in the variable z we have two zeros. The bins can be described as follows: x which reflect a likert-scale from 0-7. Hence, if you would plot the count in a histogram, the x-axis would be of ordinal nature. Using a chi-square test: t chisq.test(t,correct = TRUE) gives me the following output: Pearson's Chi-squared test data: t X-squared = 73707, df = 7, p-value suggesting that the two distr. are sign different to each other. Now, I learned that a chi-squared test is only useful, if there are no zeros in any of the bins, nor the number of observations should be at least 5 per bin. Hence, a chi-squared test shouldn't be the right procedure to go for. In some books, a fisher's exact test is suggested in this case, though this fails as the counts are too large. If you plot the two distributions: p p p p p p p p you can see that they are quite similar in shape. Now comes the issue, what test is the right way to go here? Is the chi-squared test still appropriate to use? In some other books and also here ( http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/statguidefiles/conting_anal_alts.html#Zeroes ) it is suggested to use a logistic regression model in this case, as the X is ordinal. However, I have no experience with this kind of analysis, and would very much appreciate it, if there would be someone to show me the right R code (if possible, based on my example) and help me to understand and interpret the outcomes. Thanks a lot in advance for your help!
