How to proper evaluate the PDF of a Beta Distribution?

On page 40 of "Think Bayes - Bayesian Statistics Made Simple", Allen evaluates the PDF of the Beta distribution as def EvalPdf(self, x): return x**(self.alpha-1) * (1-x)**(self.beta-1) I understand the formula used but I'm trying to better understand the 1 subtracted from the alpha and beta parameters. Allen defined the prior as B(1,1) so I'm assuming the -1 refers to the definition of the prior, but why is it necessary to exclude that? Since we're evaluating the PDF, shouldn't we use the posterior as it is (with the 1's from the prior included)?
