This is not a standard way to obtain a posterior distribution in Bayesian inference (see Comment by @whuber). However, what about this, for the first part? "Prior" is $p \sim \mathsf{Beta}(3, 4).$ "Data" is that $p > 0.$ "Posterior" is $\mathsf{Beta}(3, 4)$ truncated to $(1/2, 1).$ k = 1- pbeta(.5, 3, 4) curve(dbeta(x,3,4)*(x>.5)/k, 0, 1, lwd=2, n = 10001, ylab="Density", main="Posterior") abline(h=0, col="green2") An alternative hint, in a more standard Bayesian setting, that $p > 1/2$ might have come from $n = 100$ binomial trials with $x = 70$ successes. In that case, the posterior would have been $\mathsf{Beta}(73, 34),$ plotted below.
