How to divide feature set for selection and training

I have training data with 260 observations that have a total of 7 classes. Each observation has 120 features. I applied feature selection based on the Bhattacharyya Algorithm and got the top 40 features for each class. I have two questions. I have done the feature selection on the whole set of observations and will do the training on some part of the data set (50%) and testing on the left out part of the data set. Is this method okay? Or should feature selection also be performed only on the training data? Also once I have the top 40 features of each class how do I provide an SVM the selected feature set that has say, features 1,2 and 5 are important for class 1 and feature 1,2 and 6 are important for class 2. I am using matlab as an implementational tool. Thanks in advance.
