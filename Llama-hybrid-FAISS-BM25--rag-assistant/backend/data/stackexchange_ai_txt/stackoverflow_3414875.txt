Entity framework 4 - Base entity mapping 2 tables as base class for 2 derived entities possible?

I have the following scenario that is causing me problems around the mapping fragments referring to same Id columns. This is what im trying to achieve not sure its even possible! Essentially I want to have a common way of accessing content, and as needed a specialisation of blog and article. I have the Contents entity working with the "IsBlog" boolean discriminator hand coded into the edmx. Trouble is as soon as I try to derive article and blog I have 4 "id" columns mapped. Ive tried using a non-boolean discriminator with no joy. I've tried multiple discriminators again with no success. I would really appreciate anyones input as to if this is even possible with EF4! Thanks Phil
