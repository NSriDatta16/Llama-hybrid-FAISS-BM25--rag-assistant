I don't think you are supposed to provide the .lib in the pragma comment, but, I think the real problem is that you are calling the comment by path. Add the path to your lib search paths, and then just use a #pragma comment(lib,"fmodvc") You are SUPPOSED to be able to use a path in this comment, but are you sure the ..\ path you are using is the correct path during link time? Also make sure you are NOT compiling with the /nodefaultlib... Let me know if this still does not work. I've used this type of pragma a lot, with great success... But, now that I'm pretty much trapped in the C# world, I don't get much time to even program in C++ anymore...
