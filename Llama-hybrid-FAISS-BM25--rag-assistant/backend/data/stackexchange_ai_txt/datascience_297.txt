As in @damienfrancois answer feature selection is about selecting a subset of features. So in NLP it would be selecting a set of specific words (the typical in NLP is that each word represents a feature with value equal to the frequency of the word or some other weight based on TF/IDF or similar). Dimensionality reduction is the introduction of new feature space where the original features are represented. The new space is of lower dimension that the original space. In case of text an example would be the hashing trick where a piece of text is reduced to a vector of few bits (say 16 or 32) or bytes. The amazing thing is that the geometry of the space is preserved (given enough bits), so relative distances between documents remain the same as in the original space, so you can deploy standard machine learning techniques without having to deal with unbound (and huge number of) dimensions found in text.
