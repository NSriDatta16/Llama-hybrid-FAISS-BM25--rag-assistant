Resources about different Computer Science fields

I am going to begin my final year at university this September so I need to do a project for my dissertation. I had a look at the list with the projects suggested by the uni last year and I don't find any of them THAT interesting. That, combined to my "love" for "theoretical" computer science as a whole got me into thinking that it would be nice to spend the last month of my summer holidays researching some of the cs fields in more depth. So far at university, regarding the more "theoretical" side of computer science we have mainly looked at searching and sorting algorithms, string matching, game theory, design patterns for software engineering and maze solving algorithms. Next year the syllabus includes bioinformatics, compilers and machine learning. I have an idea about all of these but nothing incredibly detailed (ie, we didn't do algorithms design at all). So, I was thinking, instead of either picking a project from the list or picking a project that a hobbyist could do as well, why not study about a few fields of computer science and brainstorm in the process? I would really appreciate it if you could point me to available resources (books, ebooks, pdfs, online communities, etc) about the fields below, or even suggest new fields to be explored. Note that I only want to understand what they are about, not mess with technical issues, yet. The fields: Web Semantics Algorithms (analysis, design, etc) Machine Learning Evolutionary Computation Game Theory Other (???)
