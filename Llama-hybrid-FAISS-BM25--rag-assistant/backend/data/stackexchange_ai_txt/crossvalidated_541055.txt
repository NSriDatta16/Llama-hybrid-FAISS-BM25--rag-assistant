Maybe you a looking for the local variant of Pesaran's CD (cross-sectional dependence) test? Have a look at the literature cited in the R package plm for function pcdtest (pcdtest has an argument W to define a spatial property), e.g., on the web here: http://rdocumentation.org/packages/plm/versions/2.4-1/topics/pcdtest : Baltagi BH, Feng Q, Kao C (2012). “A Lagrange Multiplier test for cross-sectional dependence in a fixed effects panel data model.” Journal of Econometrics, 170(1), 164 - 177. ISSN 0304-4076, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440761200098X .
