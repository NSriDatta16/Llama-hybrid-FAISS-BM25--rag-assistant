I would use the DAGSVM approach, which constructs a tree of pairwise classifiers. If you have only 100 patterns per class, but tens of thousands of classes, a lot of the pairwise classifiers will have no training data and hence not every possible pairwise classifier will need to be constructed. However, more importantly, it is hard to consider a problem with such a large number of classes, where the classification is not in some sense hierarchical. A better approach would be to first construct a classifier to classify each pattern into broad categories (representing a set of related classes) and then iteratively refine patterns withing each broad category to identify the finer distinctions between classes.
