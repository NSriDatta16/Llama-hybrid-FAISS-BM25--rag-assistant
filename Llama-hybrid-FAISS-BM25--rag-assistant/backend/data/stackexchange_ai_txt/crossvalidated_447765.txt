You can use generalized linear modeling (GLM) to handle outcome variables that are not normally distributed. For your case, with ordinal BMI categories variable, you can use a special case of GLM called ordinal logistic regression. This website has examples on how to do this in STATA, SAS, SPSS, Mplus, and R. To handle the grade-level predictor variable, I would recommend just treating these as separate categories (e.g., use dummy coding ). There are approaches for modeling the ordered nature of categorical variables, but this seems overkill for an internship project and only three categories.
