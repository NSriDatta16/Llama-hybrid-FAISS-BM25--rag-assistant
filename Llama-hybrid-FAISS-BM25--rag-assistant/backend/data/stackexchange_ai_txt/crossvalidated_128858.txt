One possible interpretation of the logistic regression model is to state that there is an underlying score $$ y^*_i = x_i'\beta + \epsilon_i, $$ with the observed variable being $$y_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1, & y^*_i > 0 \\ 0, & y^*_i \le 0\end{array}\right.$$ This would be the way logistic regression would be introduced in social sciences , as opposed to biostatistics. In this formulation, $\epsilon$ follows a logistic distribution, which does have the variance of $\pi^2/3$. Mixed models stick an additional random effects term into the equation, and introduce the double subscripts, making it $$ y^*_{ij} = x_{ij}'\beta + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}, $$ where $u_i$ is assumed normal because the normal distribution is something that everybody understands. The variance of $u_i$ is estimated by your mixed model package (although without the standard errors; Douglas Bates has a pretty strong stand on it). So the total variance is then $\sigma^2_u + \mathbb{V}[\epsilon] = \sigma^2_u + \pi^2/3$. In your somewhat more complicated model, you just need to add all the variances of the variance components. It seems weird to me that the strongest effect that you have is that of the interaction, with the magnitudes of the main effects being smaller. See if this makes sense in your application. Also, Laplace approximation is at best a starting point; you need to increase the number of integration points to get accurate estimates of variance components.
