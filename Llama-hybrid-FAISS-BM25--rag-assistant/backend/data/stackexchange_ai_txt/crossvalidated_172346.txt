Caret: PCA preprocessing and partitioning train and test data

My training and test data are in two distinct .csv files: credit I'm using Caret's preProcess=c("center", "scale", "pca") methods in the training phase. logitBoostFit How is PCA applied to the test data in the predict phase? logitBoostClasses If I concatenate both files into one and partition one file into training and testing, so that the scaling, normalization, mapping of categorical to numerical is consistent don't I violate the principal of separating training from test data?
