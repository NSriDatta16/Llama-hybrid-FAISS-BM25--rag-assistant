xgboost won't fit any linear trends to your data unless you specify booster = "gblinear" , which fits a small regression in the nodes. The reg:linear objective tells it to use sum of squared error to inform its fit on a regression problem. Linear regression with gradient boosted trees is unaffected by any feature scaling as long as the rank order of the feature doesn't change.
