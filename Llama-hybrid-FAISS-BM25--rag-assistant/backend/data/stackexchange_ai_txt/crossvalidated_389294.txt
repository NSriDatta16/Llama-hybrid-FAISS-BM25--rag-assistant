We will only be able to give you very general advice. Are there any strong drivers, like promotions or calendar events, or seasonality, trends or lifecycles? If so, include them in your models. For instance, you could regress sales on promotions, then potentially model residuals (using exponential smoothing or ARIMA). There are software packages that do a reasonably good job at fitting multiple time series models to a series. You can then simply iterate over your 2000 series, which should not take much more runtime than a cup of coffee. I particularly recommend the ets() function in the forecast package in R. (Less so the auto.arima() function for weekly data. At least skim a forecasting textbook, e.g., this one . It uses the forecast package I recommend above. What is your final objective? Do you want an unbiased forecast? Then assess point forecasts using the MSE. Will your bonus depend on the MAPE? Then this list of the problems of the MAPE may be helpful. Do you need forecasts to set safety amounts? Then you need quantile forecasts, not mean predictions. (The functions in the forecast package can give you those.) If you have more specific questions, do post them at CV.
