There is legitimacy to each stance. Your data science professor is right because it is routine to use a model to make a prediction about an individual. For instance, I am writing this answer on an iPhone that keeps trying to guess which word I will type next. Your research methods professor is right because there is an entire conditional distribution to consider. While we might call $\hat y_i$ the predicted value, that is just the expected value (or median or some other quantity, depending on what exactly we do) of an entire distribution of plausible values for the individual. This is a standard argument in pop-culture statistics: the statistic means nothing to the individual, and it is true that an individual can wind up above or below average, not right smack on the average. Cross Validated has an interesting question on this very topic that I believe has some relevance to this question. Then again, this leads to a defense of your data science professor. Yes, $\hat y_i$ is just the expected value of an entire conditional distribution, but if we believe our loss function to quantify what we value, then that is exactly the prediction we should make to minimize the pain we experience from having results that are not perfectly accurate.
