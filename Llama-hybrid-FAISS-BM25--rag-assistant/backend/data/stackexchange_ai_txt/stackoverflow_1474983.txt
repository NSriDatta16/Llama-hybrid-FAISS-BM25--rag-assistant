Will WF 4.0 make me Obsolete

I saw a post on Oslo about making us obsolete. I just happened to listen to the latest Deep Fried Episode with Brian Noyes. They were talking about SharePoint and Windows Workflow and how the "dream" of Windows Workflow is to let mere Business Analyst Drag and Drop their way to a functioning service. I am a newbie dotnet developer, and afraid that by the time I get to Consulting "Level" my skills would be obsolete. Should I abandon learning basic skills and just learn how to work with Frameworks and Packaged applications such as SAP, SharePoint, BizTalk. Am I wasting time trying to learn Expression Trees and Func of T's?
