JQuery DatePicker bundled control can't be included in other controls

I've been tasked with implementing a Date/Time selector for several areas of our web project, and instructed to use a control that another developer created as part of it. The control I'm working on is supposed to allow the user to choose a date from a calendar, choose a format for the display of that date (from several pre-defined formats, or with a simple text override) and optionally a time string (which is really just freeform text). The control I was instructed to use is documented here: http://www.west-wind.com/WebLog/posts/213015.aspx , and uses the DatePicker from jQuery. After I implemented my control and tested it, I began integrating it into the pages which needed Date and/or time inputs. In my testing of those implementations, I discovered a bug: when I include multiple copies of my control on a page, only the first one gets the jQuery calendar. The others are not tied to it. I have tried some of the methods suggested in a seemingly-related question (titled 'duplicating jquery datepicker'), such as calling the '.datepicker()' function on the west-wind control (which renders a textbox) via the $("css-selector").datepicker() syntax, and ASP.NET is guaranteeing unique IDs for all the text boxes. So, in summation, it looks like this: Now, the strange part: When there are multiple copies of the west-wind control on the page, without the other user control containing them, they work correctly. Other than the jQuery control, my control has nothing unusual about it: simply labels, textboxes, panels, and dropdowns. Something about bundling the West-Wind jQuery control into a user control seems to be breaking it. Any advice? I've been banging my head against this for a while, hampered by my poor javascript skills and limited exposure to jQuery. As pointed out below, it's hard to say without the HTML. I've included it below. // // // Date en-US fr-CA fr-FR es-ES es-MX Choose your display format: Choose a date first Or enter your own text Date en-US fr-CA fr-FR es-ES es-MX Choose your display format: Choose a date first Or enter your own text //
