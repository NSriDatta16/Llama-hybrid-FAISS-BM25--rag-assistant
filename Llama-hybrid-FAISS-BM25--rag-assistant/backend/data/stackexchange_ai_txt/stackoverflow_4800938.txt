lucene to add extra boost on first occurrence of term

i'm working on a system which will using apache lucene to analysis and rank a group of web page content, from different source, the problem what im facing now was, the result always show a group of pages came from the same source first, when the source had more that 1 pages having the better weight. is that possible for me to use lucene option to further refine the result, so only the first occurrence for the source with be listed, while the remaining will be drag down to the end of the result list, so at least user can see different result from different source first, instead of seeing a full list of the content from the same source at the first few pages....
