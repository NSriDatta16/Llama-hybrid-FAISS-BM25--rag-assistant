It would work, it would just be awful. Think using a flat table in a database, because thats exactly what you'd be doing. Instead try creating a schema that can describe a schema in a way that your application can understand. There would still be considerable code involved however, although if done correctly you could mimic as much as a SQL database. Of course, core data is built on top of SQL (or other storage types but thats not my point), but basically you'd be creating a layer to mimic something two layers down which would just be silly.
