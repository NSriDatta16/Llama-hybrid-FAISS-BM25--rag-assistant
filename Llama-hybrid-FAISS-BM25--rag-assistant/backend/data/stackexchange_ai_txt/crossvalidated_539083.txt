I dont know anything about machine learning, except that it is a popular topic nowadays. You seem eager to apply machine learning techniques to this forecasting problem, but I think some good old fashioned econometric time series analysis is suited for this problem. Your question is about what method to use, but a method as I understand it should be seen in light of some model. So I dont think it is possible to suggest a method when there is no model. I would say that given you only have historical data on endogenous variable(s) with strong autocorrelation I would think applying (V)ARMA(p,q) type models is the way to go. Maximum likelihood estimation is typically the method to determine the model parameters given your data.
