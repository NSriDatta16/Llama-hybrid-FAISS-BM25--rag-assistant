Need a WPF rendering tip

I want to make a WPF Grid in which users can drag and drop controls from one cell to another and when the user is dragging I need to draw tips on the screen, like arrows. It's as if the tips were in ANOTHER LAYER in the screen. That is, they are not drawn IN the grid I mentioned. The problem is: I don't know how to OVERLAP a "transparent" canvas over my Grid so that I can draw on it. Do you experienced guys have some tip? THANKS.
