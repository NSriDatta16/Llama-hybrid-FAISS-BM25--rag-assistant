Personally, I find it's a huge benefit. Even with a central repo, a DVCS changes the flow from "edit code, update from central, commit" to "edit code, commit, push to central". Among other things, that means that conflict resolution is far less stressful. It can also encourage development in smaller chunks, since you don't have to push after every commit. If your team is OK with it, that means your individual commits might leave the app in a strange state, as long as it's working when you finally push to the central repo. If they're not OK with that, as long as you're using git (or patch queues for hg , IIRC), you can still do dev in the same style, but then condense all your smaller commits into one larger commit that is complete before you push it to the central repo.
