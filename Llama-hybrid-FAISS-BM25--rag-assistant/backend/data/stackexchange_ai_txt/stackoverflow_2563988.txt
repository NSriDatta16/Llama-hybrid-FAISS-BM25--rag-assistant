Have you considered using SQL Server Compact Edition ? It has plenty of .NET support The versioning of the schema and the ability for new versions of your application handling old schemas would be entirely in your control. Versioning of SQL Server Compact should be somewhat seemless beyond your application using features in a newer version that did not exist in the older version. You have the most of the SQL syntax available to you for querying. Obviously from the name, this version of SQL Server was designed for embedded systems which can include applications that want to avoid installation of SQL Express or the full blown version of SQL Server. Now, this would have the same issues as SQLite in that the data structure, from what you have told us, could get complicated, but that will be true even if you roll you own binary format. Btw, it occurs to me that you haven't clarified what exactly is meant by "sizeable". If "sizeable" means close to or more than 4 GB, obviously SQL Compact will not work nor will a host of other database file formats. EDIT I notice that you have added SQL Compact Edition to your list of "too heavyweight" list after my post. SQL Compact requires only 5MB of RAM and 2MB of disk storage depending on the size of the database. So, the problem cannot be that is heavyweight. Now, as to the second point of claiming the data structure would be pretty complicated. If that is true, I suspect it will be true of any relational database product and rolling your own binary format will be even more complicated. Given that, you might look at non-relational database products such as mongodb .
