Estimating width of logistic prediction interval from value of fitted coefficients only

On page 1530, left column, of a study by Redline, Tishler, Schluchter, Aylor, Clark and Graham (1999) ( ungated version ), one reads: Because there is uncertainty regarding the optimal cutoff values of BMI that identify obesity in children, analyses also were repeated for BMI as a continuous variable. This demonstrated that for each increase of 1 kg/m² of BMI above the mean, risk of SDB increased by 12%. Use of BMI, rather than obesity defined as a binary variable, did not alter the results of the multiple adjusted logistic regression analyses presented in Table 4. So based on the fit from the paper above (obtained from a sample of size $n$), all other things being equal, for an increase of 2 kg/m² of BMI above the mean, the risk of SDB is expected to increase by a factor of $\approx 1.12^2$. My question is, what is the expected variation around this expectation? Can an approximation to the width of the prediction interval be deduced from just the numbers given above (e.g. the slope of the variable being changed): the paper gives no other information about this logistic fit (in particular no standard errors around these estimates). I can see that the formula for the distribution of predictors in logistic includes the s.e. of the regression coefficients. But, conditional on $\pmb x$, $y$ is binomial distributed with parameter estimated by $\hat{p}(y|\pmb x)$ so I was wondering whether there was a way to obtain the $\hat{\mbox{var}}(y|\pmb x)$ from $\hat{p}(y|\pmb x)$ alone.
