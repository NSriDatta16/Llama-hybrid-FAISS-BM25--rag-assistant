You can phrase this in a slightly more general way: you need to compute $\sqrt M x$ for a vector $x$ and a matrix $M$ , and it's easy to multiply vectors by $M$ but not easy to store $M$ explicitly or do e.g. a Cholesky decomposition of $M$ . There are methods to solve this problem -- take a look at the references below. Pleiss, G., Jankowiak, M., Eriksson, D., Damle, A., & Gardner, J. R. (2020). Fast matrix square roots with applications to Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.11267. Allen, E. J., Baglama, J., & Boyd, S. K. (2000). Numerical approximation of the product of the square root of a matrix with a vector.
