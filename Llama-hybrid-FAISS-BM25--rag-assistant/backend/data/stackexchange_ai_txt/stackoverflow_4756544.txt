Which scripting language is better for embedding in multi-threaded C/C++ application

Considering the following requirementes: Must be supported on Windows. Preferably works also on other platforms. Must support multi threading. By that I mean that the engine can work in parallel in multiple threads. Readability is important. License must be compatible with closed-source projects. I like Python for its readablity. I am also have more experience with Python than other scripting languages. However CPython is not multi-threaded, and IronPython requires hosting the CLR and a compatible language (C++/CLI or C#).
