Unique identifier of an UIView object

I am having a following problem. When a certain touch occures on a UIVIew, I want to store this UIView's unique identifier (like let's say objectID) so that when I reopen my app again I can check if in the visible UIViews there is the one UIView with the unique ID from the storage. I do not want to store the tag values as object ids because they may not be unique and they are manualy set up. I need to get a unique identifier that is automatically assign by the system. Any ideas hot to get it?
