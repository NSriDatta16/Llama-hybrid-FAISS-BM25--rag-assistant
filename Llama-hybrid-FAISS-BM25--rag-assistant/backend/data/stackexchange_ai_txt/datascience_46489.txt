In PCA, every principal component a eigen vector?

In pca, we convert predictors into principal components for dimensionality reduction. My assumption is every principal component is a eigen vector with eigen value as sum of squared distance of orthogonal projection of data points or vectors on it.. Is my assumption correct. If not pls clarify
