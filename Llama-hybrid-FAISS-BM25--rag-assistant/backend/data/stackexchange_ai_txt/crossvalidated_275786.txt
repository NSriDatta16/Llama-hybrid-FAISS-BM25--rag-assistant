As someone who works for a bank in a quantitative role, I disagree with the other answers. Stochastic processes are very important. A good knowledge of stochastic processes allows you to understand the intuition behind many of the other classes you mention, especially time series models. It is also a differentiater (in my experience a good knowledge of stochastic processes is rare). I would take Stochastic Processes Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning Linear Modeling: Theory and Applications
