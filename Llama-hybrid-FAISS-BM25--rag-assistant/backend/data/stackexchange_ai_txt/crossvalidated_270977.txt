This is because if a filter is successful in extracting a useful feature from a small portion of the image, we would like to extract the same feature from other parts of the image. This is related to this fact that we would like to extract translation-invariant features from the image, that is we want to extract features from the image which do not change when the objects in the image are moved to another place in the image. This is not specific to the CNNs but is the common paradigm in machine vision.
