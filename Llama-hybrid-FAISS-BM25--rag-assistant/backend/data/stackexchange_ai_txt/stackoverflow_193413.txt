I don't know of a Java library itself, but there is a Ruby library called Hpricot that does exactly what you're looking for. In conjunction with the Ruby implementation on the Java platform, JRuby , it should be relatively straightforward to call Ruby methods from your Java code (using BSF, JSR-222 Scripting APIs , or an internal API ). Are you using Coldfusion 8? Coldfusion 8, being based on Java 6, supports JSR-222 Scripting APIs "javax.scripting". Take a look at this blog entry on embedding PHP within CFML . You should be able to do the same with Ruby . There is ZIP file example code linked from this blog posting, and if you crack open the CFML, you'll see a good example of embedding Ruby within CFML. Although it might take a bit of work to make all the pieces work together, but with a bit of investment, it should give you the robust parsing/CSS selector querying that you're looking for.
