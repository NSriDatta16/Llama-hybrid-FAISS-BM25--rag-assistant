Estimating causal relationships is hard. You can't expect to be given an easy test that can be applied the same way regardless of your data and works reliably. The Granger causality test can't offer you that for time series, even if some people sell it that way. Well designed randomized controlled trials are very helpful. In their absence, you better have substantive knowledge to guide your modelling. If you want to understand causal inference, I recommend starting with a book like Morgan and Winship's . Though I'm sure there is good material on this site and elsewhere online.
