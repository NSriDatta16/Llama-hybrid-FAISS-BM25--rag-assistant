Hmm, one idea comes to mind. For various categories in your product have a " search agent ". e.g. Lets say you have following categories (or modules) in your app: Preferences People (both people and company) Reporting Tags (This is a good option to for searching. Tag most entities in your app) Each of these will have a search agent. These search agents will register with the universal search widget's backend (You can have an options on where to search. This panel will show when the user clicks on advanced search. By default the search will be "entire app") Upon the search the widget will ask each of these to search in their own category and then collate the results. Of course there could be other ideas. This is just one of them. You will have to think about its pros and cons, like how will it impact your DB, etc.
