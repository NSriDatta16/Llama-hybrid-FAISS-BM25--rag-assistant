Android- Providing Alternative Resources not working?

I feel as if I'm missing something. In my application, I decided to provide alternative drawable resources and alternative layout files. My structure is as follows: res/drawable-hdpi/filename.png res/drawable-mdpi/filename.png res/drawable-ldpi/filename.png res/layout-small/layout.xml res/layout-large/layout.xml res/layout/layout.xml I created three different emulators: one with the default HVGA, one with QVGA, and one with WVGA800 It doesn't seem to pick up those alternative resources/layouts based on screen size/density, or maybe i just can't tell? Is there some way, other than using a device for each specific size, to test this? Or am I just missing something important? Another question, how well does Android scale drawables if no alternative resource exist?
