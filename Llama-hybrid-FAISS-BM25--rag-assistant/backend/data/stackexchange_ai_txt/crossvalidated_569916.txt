It may help you to read my answer to Interpretation of plot (glm.model) . In brief, I would not (do not) use those plots for logistic regression. The first question I would ask is: what are you trying to find out? Is a plot helpful for discovering that? What plot might do so? Etc. For example, you mention looking at a qq-plot. For a logistic regression, the outcome is binary; thus, the distribution is the Bernoulli or binomial. The data are not normal, nor need they be. We know this in advance. There could be a case where there is value in looking at the qq-plot, but I'm not sure what it would be in general . With respect to assessing a fitted logistic regression model, one thing you might want to check is whether a linear function of X was appropriate (assuming you used that). In such a case, rather than looking at a plot of the residuals vs X, as I might with a linear model, I might compare the fitted model to something non-parametric, such as a LOWESS fit. To illustrate this idea, consider the example below (adapted from ROC curve crossing the diagonal ): ## data Cond.1 = c(2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.1, 3.1, 3.3, 3.3, 3.4, 3.4, 3.4, 3.5, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.7, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.9, 5.5, 5.5, 5.7) Cond.2 = c(2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.1, 3.7, 3.7, 3.8, 4.0, 4.2, 4.8, 4.9, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.9, 6.0, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.1, 7.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.2, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.6, 10, 10.1, 12.5) dat = stack(list(cond1=Cond.1, cond2=Cond.2)) ord = order(dat$values) dat = dat[ord,] # now the data are sorted ## logistic regression model & LOWESS fit lr.model1 = glm(ind~values, dat, family="binomial") # straight line fit lr.preds1 = predict(lr.model1, data.frame(values=seq(2.3,12.5,by=.1)), type="response") LOWESS = loess((as.numeric(ind)-1)~values, dat, degree=0) # non-parametric fit LOWESS.pd = predict(LOWESS, data.frame(values=seq(2.3,12.5,by=.1))) ## here I plot the data, the model, & overlay a LOWESS fit windows() with(dat, plot(values, ifelse(ind=="cond2",1,0), ylab="predicted probability of condition2")) lines(seq(2.3,12.5,by=.1), lr.preds1, lwd=2, col="red") lines(seq(2.3,12.5,by=.1), LOWESS.pd, lwd=2, col="blue") legend("bottomright", legend=c("model", "LOWESS"), lwd=2, col=c("red", "blue"))
