What is the most complete mocking framework for HttpContext

I'm looking for as comprehensive as possible of a mock replacement and wrapper for the ASP.NET HttpContext in my applications. A comprehensive mock replacement could potentially increase the testability of my ASP.NET web applications substantially, without necessitating migrating every application to more-testable frameworks such as MVC. Some of the features I am most interested in seeing in an HttpContext wrapper and mock framework include: Serialized session storage (e.g., .Session ). Serialized application-scoped storage (e.g., .Application ). Per-request item storage (e.g., .Items ). HttpRequest data, such as referrers, request Uri, server variables, post data, etc. HttpResponse data, such as status codes and content. Local file resolution (e.g. Server.MapPath ) VirtualPathUtility for application-relative URL path resolution, which has a dependency on the ASP.NET runtime. The identity and principal (e.g., .User ) for validating authentication/authorization rules. The AllErrors collection for testing error resolution in HttpModule s and Global.asax . I considered writing my own interface, wrapper, and mock; however, I believe such must already exist. The variety of mock frameworks is a little overwhelming for a first-timer to absorb. What is the most comprehensive HttpContext wrapper and mock that you would recommend?
