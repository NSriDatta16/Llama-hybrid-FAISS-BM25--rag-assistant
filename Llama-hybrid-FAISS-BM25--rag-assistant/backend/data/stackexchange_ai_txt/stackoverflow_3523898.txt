It's a set of extensions to provide C/C++ with the ability to run certain parts of the code in parallel, without explicitly managing (creating, destroying, assigning) threads. It basically abstract you from the complexity of managing threads your self by allowing you to declaratively run certain portions of your code in parallel. A code sample always help: # pragma omp parallel \ shared ( n, x, y ) \ private ( i ) \ reduction ( + : xdoty ) # pragma omp for for ( i = 0; i
