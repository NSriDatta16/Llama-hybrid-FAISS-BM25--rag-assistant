Is it possible to apply PCA to the reconstructed data of ICA?

I have read that it is not possible to verify the variance and order of independent component extracted from ICA. So, I reconstructed the spectra from matrix A and ST(independent component) then apply the PCA to this data. I found that the loadings of PCA have very similar characteristic with the independent component of ICA and I could get the explained variance and their order from this result. I'm just wondering whether what I did is correct or not?
