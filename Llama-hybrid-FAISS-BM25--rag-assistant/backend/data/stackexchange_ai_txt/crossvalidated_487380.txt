Why would you expect to see similar results? Those are different distributions, used for modelling completely different things. First is a discrete distribution, second is a continuous distribution. Answering your question, you are seeking for mode of the distributions. Mode of beta distribution is $\frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha + \beta - 2}$ , so exactly $0.25$ in case of the values you provided. Regarding the comment, in binomial case you were maximizing the likelihood alone. When using Bayesian beta-binomial model, when maximizing it, you are considering also the prior $$ \hat p = \operatorname{arg\,max} \; \underbrace{p(X|\theta)}_\text{likelihood}\,\underbrace{p(\theta)}_\text{prior} $$ so the choice of the prior would affect the result. When using $\alpha=\beta=0$ in the prior, this is an improper Haldane's prior that has all the probability mass over values $0$ and $1$ (see the picture below borrowed from this site ). Especially when the sample size is small , the prior would impact the result. In this case, it will drag the probability mass towards the extremes. To get result that is comparable to MLE, you could choose uniform prior with $\alpha=\beta=1$ .
