Ok, the problem was the layout file was messed up and I had two linear layouts going horizontaly, and therefore the heirarchy wouldnt load them, giving the null point exception. Just a tip for anyone looking at the heirarchyviewer for Android 3.0, the fragment (inside the layoutfile) will automatically take ownership of the first layout tag in its inflated view. So say you have and in your layout file you have In heirarchy viewer, the LinearLayout will appear as viewer, not first_layout, since the fragment doesnt have a default layout, its going to re-id the first layout container in its layoutfile to its own id.
