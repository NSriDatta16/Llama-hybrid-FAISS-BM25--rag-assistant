Multilevel Modeling and Alternatives for Repeated Measures Design

I am conducting a study on the effect of different characteristics of urban space on human physiological response. The study is a "repeated measures" design. For this example, each of 5 participants is exposed to 8 virtual reality urban scenes (in a unique order) for one minute each scene, and their physiological responses are recorded (40 total cases). The example data set is displayed here to show the set up of the repeated measures design, where each participants's heart data is nested within a single HRV dependent variable. Two predictor variables, SIZE (square feet) and SHAPE (ratio), are also displayed, as well as a proposed CONTROL variable to address significant differences in each participant's individual physiology (average of their 8 HRV responses). 3 questions: The HRV data appears to be multilevel (2 LEVELS: individual participant and all participants grouped together). Would adding an HRV CONTROL variable (PHYSIO) allow the use of other models, such as multiple linear regression, and mitigate a need for multilevel modeling? I've seen articles that discuss using a Repeated Measures ANOVA (MANOVA, etc). Would this statistical approach be appropriate for the described study design? Would multilevel modeling be the only appropriate way to analyze this data? Thank you!
