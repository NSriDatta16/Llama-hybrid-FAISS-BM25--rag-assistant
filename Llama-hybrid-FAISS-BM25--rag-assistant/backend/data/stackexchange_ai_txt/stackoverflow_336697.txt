Just to clarify, mmap() in Unix-like systems would not allow you to access files as such; it simply makes the contents of a file available in memory, as memory. You cannot use open() to further open any contained files. There is no such thing as a " mmap() able set of files". Can't you just add a pass that loads all your "templates" initially, and then quickly finds them based on something simple, like a hash on the name of each? That should let you leverage your memory, and get down to O(1) access for any template.
