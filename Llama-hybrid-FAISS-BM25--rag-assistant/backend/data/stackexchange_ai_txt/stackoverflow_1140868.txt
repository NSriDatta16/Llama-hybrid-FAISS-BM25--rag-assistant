My solution was to make subclasses of django.contrib.admin.sites.AdminSite and django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin . I did this so I could display a more descriptive title for each app and order the appearance of models in each app. So I have a dict in my settings.py that maps app_labels to descriptive names and the order in which they should appear, the models are ordered by an ordinal field I provide in each ModelAdmin when I register them with the admin site. Although making your own subclasses of AdminSite and ModelAdmin is encouraged in the docs, my solution looks like an ugly hack in the end.
