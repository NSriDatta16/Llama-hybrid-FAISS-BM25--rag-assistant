Create a large bit field?

I want to create a large bit field in JavaScript that will effectively represent a multi-dimensional array of markers (uses indexing to jump to various dimensions in the physical "1D" structure). Rather than a bunch of numbers, I'm considering how I might use a string as bits, so I can allocate a string of the appropriate length first. Considerations such as data types, Unicode and conversions come into play (also no Unicode support before JavaScript 1.3). However I'm open about other suggestions how to use JavaScript to achieve a large bit field. Update: Just for informational purposes: On average I might be using ~2187 bits/markers (274 bytes), but would like a generic answer than can accommodate many more bits.
