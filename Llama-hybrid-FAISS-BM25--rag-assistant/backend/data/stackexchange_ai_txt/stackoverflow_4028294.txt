Caching of HTML pages

I have included meta tags for Cache-control - no cache and Pragma no cache and Expires in my html page. But still i find the html pages in Temporary Internet Files folder on my system with expires timestamp. If i make another request to server after the timestamp expiration value, the page my browser is going to show is a new page or a cached page from the folder on my system. How to test, whether the page is a cached page or a new page from Server?
