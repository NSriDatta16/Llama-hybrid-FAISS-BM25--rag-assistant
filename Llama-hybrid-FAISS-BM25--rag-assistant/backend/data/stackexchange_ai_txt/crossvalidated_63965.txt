"The data are the empty volume in the tank at the end of each day." The data are time indexed, you have to take this feature into consideration. It is likely that the data are dependent. Someone/Something fill up the tank at some time points or when the tank is close to depletion. I suggest to take a look at Time Series models (e.g. autoregressive models), rather than fitting a distribution to the raw observations, in order to avoid throwing all the features of the data. The estimation procedures recommended in the other answers do not consider possible dependencies of the data and time indexing.
