Not exactly the same as your question, but on a related note, I remember reading an article a while back (either The American Statistician or Chance magazine, sometime between 2000 and 2003) that showed that for any dataset of 2 variables where they are pretty much uncorrelated you can find a way to bin the "predictor" variable, then take the average of the response variable within each bin and depending on how you do the binning show either a positive relationship or a negative relationship in a table or simple plot.
