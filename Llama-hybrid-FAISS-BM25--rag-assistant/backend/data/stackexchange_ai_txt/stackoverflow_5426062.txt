The controller will be created when any Action in a specific Controller is performed. I have a project where all of my Controllers inherit from an ApplicationController and every time that an action is performed, the breakpoint is hit inside of the ApplicationController - regardless of its " current " Controller. I initialize my agent (which works as my context) whenever my controller is created like such: public IWidgetAgent widgetAgent { get; set; } public WidgetController() { if (widgetAgent == null) { widgetAgent = new WidgetAgent(); } } This is obviously not what you need - as you mentioned that you only wanted a single instance each time it was called. But it is a good place to check what is going on each time and to ensure that another instance of your context does not currently exist. Hope this helps.
