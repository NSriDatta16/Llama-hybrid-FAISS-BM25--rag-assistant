Allow Drupal Organic Group Admins delete and edit access to all group nodes

We have a Drupal site that uses Organic Groups to represent companies. I'm looking for a module that will allow us to give edit and delete access to group admins for all posts that are associated with that group. Is there a module that exposes this type of relationship?
