Do other languages have similar ArrayAccess features as PHP?

Long story short, there is a PHP feature called ArrayAccess which allows you to overload the [] operator (among other things I think) for your class, so you could have a custom class MyClass implements ArrayAccess of which $myVariable is an Instance, and do stuff like $myVariable[]=6; or $someVar=$myVariable[78]; After you've defined what it'll behave like. I find this feature rather rather elegant and useful and would like to know whether this is possible in other programming languages . Thank you!
