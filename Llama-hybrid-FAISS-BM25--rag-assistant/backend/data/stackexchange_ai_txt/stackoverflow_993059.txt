Is there a way to do aggregate functions on Google App Engine?

One of the nice things relational databases support are the aggregate functions like count, sum, avg etc. But it seems that if you are using GAE, when inserting or updating a record you must calculate and store the count, sum, avg, etc. values of the whole table. But what if you have many conditional groupings? Given a Person: class Person { @Id Integer age; String city; } If I want the total number of persons and the average age Is it correct that everytime I create, update or delete a person I should also calculate both aggregates and store them as separate columns in the same table. If I also want the total and average values per city, should I store these values for each city also as separate columns in the same table?
