It sounds like you don't want the UIToolbar to overlap your UIWebView. Instead, you want to set their frames such that the UIWebView only extends to where the UIToolbar begins. If you're setting up these two views programmatically, just set the height of the UIWebView's frame to be the size of its parent's bounds - the height of the UIToolbar's frame. If you're doing this in InterfaceBuilder, just drag the bottom edge of the UIWebView to resize it so it stops where the UIToolbar begins, or modify its frame in the inspector.
