Bayesian updating - update probability that measurement is real

I have a sequence of observations, which are either a measurement of 'active' or 'inactive'. These measurements are not necessarily accurate, with false negatives being more unlikely than false positives. One would expect 'active' and 'inactive' to be clustered in the time series if they were real observations, ie. if one measures 'inactive' multiple consecutive times then the probability that it is actually inactive will be high. I would like to use a bayesian updating technique to report the probability that the measurement is active. For example, a consecutive series of active measurements would very quickly update to a high probability that it is active. A consecutive series of inactive measurements would update at a slightly slower rate to a high probability that the measurement is really inactive. For a volatile series of observations that switches from active to inactive, one would expect the probability to be very low. How would Bayes updating be used in this example? Historical observations could be used a prior. For example, the proportion of observations expected to be actually active would be ~80%. The proportion of observations the same state as the previous would be ~90%.
