Categorical ordinal and dummies

I have a feature categorical ordinal variable (i.e. consumer credit score), that I use to predict a target (i.e., apply for a mortage or not) I have two options: process it as categorical, or encode as integer. Process it as simple categorical variable reduces the predictive potential of the variable, as assumes same distance between categories, but 1 (bad) has much more distance to 6 (good) than to number 2. In other hand, if I'm modeling with logistic regression, the coeficients for dummies give a lot more information than the single coefficient if used the var as continuous. So... what would be the best approach? Use it as categorical o continuous? Or use both, encode as continuous numerical (for better prediction) AND factor the categorical and encode as dummies (for better interpretability)? If I must, later, predict with other algoritms (like Random Forest, SV, GBM) should I keep both approximations, or keep only one? Thanks EDIT: Show the freqencies table, as requested: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1353 441 126 77 182 201
