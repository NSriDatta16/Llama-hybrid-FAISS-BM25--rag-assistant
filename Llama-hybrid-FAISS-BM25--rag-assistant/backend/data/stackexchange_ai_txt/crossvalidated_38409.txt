I think this might be a no no independent of the Bayesian school. Jeffreys would want to use noninformative priors. Lindley might want you to use informative priors. Empirical Bayesians would ask that you let the data influence the prior. But I think although each school is making a different suggestion about the choice of prior, they all have an approach that does not mean that you can take the prior and keep tweaking it until you get the results you want. That would definitely be like looking at the data and contnuing to collect data and test until you reach your preconceived notion of what the answer should be. Frequentist or Bayesian it doesn't matter i don't think anyone would want you to play tricks with (or massage) the data. Maybe this is something we all can agree on and Peter's funny poem is really apropo.
