The right way to do radio buttons?

So.. I have been trying to avoid radio buttons at all cost in my web development projects because I just cant figure out the right way to code them. Do you set a label for radio button.. if so, how does that work for screen readers. The way I have been doing most of my forms is by using un-ordered lists. Each input being a list item. I just always run into trouble when doing radio buttons. I can never get it to look right across all browsers.. For example, look at http://usfultimate.com/index.php/hatter/register . Does this structure make sense? Quick structure sample: First Name: Last Name: Email Address: Never Played Unorganized Pickup Organized Pickup or League Play Competative Team Baller Shot Caller Any pointer would be appreciated!
