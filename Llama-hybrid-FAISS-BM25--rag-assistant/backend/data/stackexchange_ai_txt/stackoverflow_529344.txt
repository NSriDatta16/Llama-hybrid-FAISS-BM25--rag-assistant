AQtime will only profile the routines you tell it to profile. Its startup wizard is pretty helpful in terms of helping you configure this correctly; I'd recommend paying pretty careful attention to it, but the general procedure is: Create an area. Configure that area for line or routine profiling. Add source files to the area. In this case, just your one file. Now profile. The general rule is that if you don't tell AQtime to instrument the routine, it will not be instrumented. There is a default area for all code in your application, but it is for routine profiling, not line profiling, only.
