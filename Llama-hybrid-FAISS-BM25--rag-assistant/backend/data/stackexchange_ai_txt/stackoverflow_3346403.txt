Select input element using f.select() of items connected by a linking table (in Rails)

I have a form for an instance of a "project". Each project can have many clients. Each client is a unique pair of organization and individual (contact person). So, Project has a many-to-many relationship with Client. Client has a many-to-one relationship with organization and a many-to-one relationship with Organization. See an image of the model diagram: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/631919/erm.png In the edit page for a project, I'd like to be able to change the organization for each client through a drop down select menu, but I'm having trouble getting the organizations to appear in the select input item. Here's what I have: I know this is wrong, but I don't know how you get a select drop-down menu that I want, which is a select menu with the organization associated with each client as the default selection. Any help?
