The term stratified analysis is usually reserved for an analysis where you divide the data-set into strata using one of your variables and then perform the same analysis within each stratum. So from your description that is definitely not what you did. The term combined analysis is not one with which I am familiar but it sounds more like a meta-analysis which is not what you did either. What you did will normally be reported using the name of the model you actually used, so if you used a multinomial logistic regression that is what you would report (for example, I am not saying you have to do that).
