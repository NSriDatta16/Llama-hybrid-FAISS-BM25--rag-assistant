Drag and Drop file upload in Silverlight 4?

I'm working on re-writing a WinForms application into Silverlight. One use case in the WinForms app allows users to drag TIFF images (of faxes) from Outlook directly onto an "attach an image or fax to this case" control in the WinForms app. Is there a Silverlight 4 control which allows for the same functionality? It's important to realize that saving the file to the local filesystem and then selecting and uploading the file with a standard upload control will not meet the business requirements as outlined in the project.
