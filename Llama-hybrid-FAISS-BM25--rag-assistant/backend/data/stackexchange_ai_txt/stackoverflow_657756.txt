Patch/Merge plugin.properties file in plugin by using fragment

In my plugin de.support.help are the plugin.properties files. These properties files include the strings for the preference page. I want to use this plugin for different customers, but the customer name is inside the properties files. I want to patch the properties files by using the eclipse fragment mechanism. As far as i now the fragment plugin can patch the coresponding plugin at runtime. I do have the file plugin.properties in plugin de.support.help which includes the line plugin.name = Copyright XYZ And i do have the fragemt de.support.help.fragment which includes the file plugin.properties with line plugin.name = Copyright ABC I expect that at runtime the string "Copyright ABC" is shown, but it is not. I had tested the same with java classes a long time ago and i remember that t his was working. The java code from the fragment was placed to the original plugin. Do you have any idea to handle this? Or do i misunderstand the fragment mechanism? Thanks EDIT: When i remove the plugin.properties file from the de.support.help plugin it works as expected. The fragment file is copied into the plugin directory and is used at runtime. Or do i have to patch the somce eclipse class Can_fragments_be_used_to_patch_a_plug
