Your piece of code needs to be a block surrounded by, as desired: braces #region and #endregion in C# #pragma region and #pragma endregion in C/C++ If you can't collapse statement blocks, you need to enable this feature : Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> C/C++ -> Formatting -> check everything in "outlining" (In Visual Studio 2013 it's Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> C/C++ -> View) Then, reopen the source file to reload outlining.
