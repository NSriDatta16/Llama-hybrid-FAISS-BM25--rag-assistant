JET SQL Performance/ SQL Understanding

This is not a problem that needs answering, more of a query on why this is happening. I have a field in one table that is populated with 'Y' Or 'N', and i have a query that simply takes the value of that field and pops into another table The table has approximately 25,000 records in it The query below takes about 25 seconds to run UPDATE ObjectivesApproved INNER JOIN Approved ON ObjectivesApproved.ID = Approved.ID SET ObjectivesApproved.Football = [Approved].[Cri Football Related]; Removing the JOIN operation makes the query take even longer. If however i do the below, the entire operation takes less than 5 seconds, even though it's executing 2 queries UPDATE ObjectivesApproved INNER JOIN Approved ON ObjectivesApproved.ID = Approved.ID SET ObjectivesApproved.Football = 'Y' WHERE (([Approved].[Cri Football Related]='Y')); UPDATE Approved INNER JOIN ObjectivesApproved ON Approved.ID = ObjectivesApproved.ID SET ObjectivesApproved.Football = 'N' WHERE (([ObjectivesApproved].[Football] Is Null)); I'm happy with my workaround, even if it is a little inelegant, but to further my understanding of SQL why might this be happening?
