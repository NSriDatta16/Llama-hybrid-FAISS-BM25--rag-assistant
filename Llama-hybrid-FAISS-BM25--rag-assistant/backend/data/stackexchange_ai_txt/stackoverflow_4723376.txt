Silverlight DataBinding to properties of object

I have a silverlight ChildWindow. When I click on a link it opens this child window and displays some data from my ViewModel. The problem is this isn't updating when the data in the ViewModel is updated. Sample from Popup: ViewModel: private AgentExceptionDetail _agentExceptionDetail; public AgentExceptionDetail AgentExceptionDetail { get { return _agentExceptionDetail; } set { if (value != _agentExceptionDetail) { RaisePropertyChanged("AgentExceptionDetail"); _agentExceptionDetail = value; } } } This AgentExceptionDetail object is populated via a call to RIA-Services. This call is successful and the data is brought back okay. The Binding is actually acting like it's Mode=OneTime rather than OneWay because when I close and re-open the popup the data is displayed but the first time the popup opens AgentExceptionDetail=null, being populated when the call comes back. Is this to do with me raising a property changed event for "AgentExceptionDetail" when the binding is actually looking for "AgentExceptionDetail.Action"? If so is there a way round this?
