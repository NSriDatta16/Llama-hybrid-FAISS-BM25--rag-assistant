One option is to change the label distributions. If you want Others to be proportional to Dog and Cat , you can randomly drop instances that are not Dog and Cat . Another option is to pick a classifier that is not influenced by the number of instances, such as support vector machine (SVM). Yet another option is to use evaluation metrics to examine performance at the individual category level (e.g., precision for Dog , Cat , Others separately).
