Is an geometric approach of support vector machine part of supervised learning?

The support vector machine can be approximated geometrically by enclosing the data of the classes by convex hulls. Then you can e.g. using the Rotating Calipers, you can search the widest band/border between these convex hulls and thus you have the maximum minimum distance between the two classes and can make predictions. That would be a purely geometric approach to solving the Support Vector machine. But would that solution still be classified as supervised learning or is it only a part of computational geometry? Thanks in advance. Are algorithms that solve the k-center problem part of machine learning or computational geometry?
