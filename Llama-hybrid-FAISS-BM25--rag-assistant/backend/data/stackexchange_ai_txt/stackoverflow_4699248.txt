URL fragment in links and ajax redirects in JSF

I found out that methods called by ajax actions in JSF 2.0 can return navigation case and then the page can be redirected. Eg. when I am on page index.xhtml and my ajax call return navigation case detail then the page is redirected. That is great. But now I would like to do only partial redirect in the current page, so I would like to use URL fragment. The desired final URL looks like this index.xhtml#someComponentId . I have tried to do it with appending of #fragment part behind the navigation case but it doesn't work. Is there any way how to make ajax and normal redirects able to use URL fragments, please? Thanks for your responses.
