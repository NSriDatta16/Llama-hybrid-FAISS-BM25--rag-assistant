I would simply reorganize your data so that each subject is in their own row (so-called 'wide-form') with the first column indicating the severity rating for their left hand and the second column indicating their right hand. For example: left right s01 1 0 s02 2 2 .. .. .. Then you can simply correlate the two columns / variables. Since your data are ordinal ratings, you could use the Spearman rank correlation . (There are several other rank correlations you could use, but that is probably the simplest and most conventional.) Your observed Spearman's rho can be tested against $\rho=0$ (no association). In fact, standard statistical software should output the test automatically.
