How to use LAT/LNG as predictor variables

I'm working on geographic data where I need to predict the average income per geo key/zip code. The data I have consisted of more than 30 million unique geo keys in Zip+4 format. As per my understanding, this many geokeys won't be a good predictor so, I converted them into geo points (LAT/LNG). So the data looks like this, LAT LNG Avg_inc 39.829506 105.013535 47374.5 I tried Linear regression, Random Forest, and SGD Regressor on this data but the results are not looking good. Also, I build a BigQuery model for the same but the I am not getting good results. I am so confused now, I want to know how to use these geographic data (LAT/LNG) for any regression/classification problem. Please suggest.
