Finding monthly repeating patterns

I have time series data, collected hourly. I want to find if there are any patterns that repeat monthly. Most articles about this suggest using ACF or Fourier transforms, but that wouldn't work well for say a pattern that repeats every 15th of the month, or say every third weekend of the month. Are there any techniques that would help with this, without writing specific code to search for every possible pattern that repeats monthly?
