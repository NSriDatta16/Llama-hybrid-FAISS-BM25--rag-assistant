Probability distribution in GAN

Here is the general eauation of GAN. I have a problem regarding probability distribution of x and z. $$\min_G \max_D V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)]+ \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_{z}(z)}[\log (1- D(G(z)))]$$ Comparing above and below image we have - $E_{x\sim p_{data}(x)}[\log(D(X))] = \frac1m\sum [\log(D(x_i)]$ which by definition of expectation should be $\sum (p_{data}(x_i)\cdot[\log(D(x_i)]$ where $(p_{data}(x_i))$ is the pdf value at $x_i$ which means $(p_{data}(x_i))$ is taken as $\frac1m$ for all $i$ is taken into account. I am unable to understand why is this pdf value at $x_i$ is taken as $\frac1m$ . Since we do not know the distribution of $p_{data}(x)$ so our best deal is to approximate it but why are we approximating it with $\frac1m$ . Aren't distributions like gaussian distribution more appropriate for approximation. Similarly for $p_z(z)$ .
