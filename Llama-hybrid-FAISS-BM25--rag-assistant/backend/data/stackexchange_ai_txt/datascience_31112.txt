Boruta Feature Selection package

I am using Boruta feature selection (with Random forest) to decide the important features in the below data set. Gender Married Dependents Education Self_Employed ApplicantIncome \ 0 Male No 0 Graduate No 5849 1 Male Yes 1 Graduate No 4583 2 Male Yes 0 Graduate Yes 3000 3 Male Yes 0 Not Graduate No 2583 4 Male No 0 Graduate No 6000 CoapplicantIncome LoanAmount Loan_Amount_Term Credit_History \ 0 0.0 NaN 360.0 1.0 1 1508.0 128.0 360.0 1.0 2 0.0 66.0 360.0 1.0 3 2358.0 120.0 360.0 1.0 4 0.0 141.0 360.0 1.0 Property_Area Loan_Status 0 Urban Y 1 Rural N 2 Urban Y 3 Urban Y 4 Urban Y Please help me in clarifying the below doubts 1) whether I need to convert the all categorical variable into numeric variable (using one hot encoding) before applying Boruta? 2) Whether the NA values would be taken care by Boruta or do we need to remove NA values before feeding into Boruta ? In case of Regression problem, whether the Boruta approach (Random forest classifier -> Boruta) remains the same as in classification problem ? Thank you.
