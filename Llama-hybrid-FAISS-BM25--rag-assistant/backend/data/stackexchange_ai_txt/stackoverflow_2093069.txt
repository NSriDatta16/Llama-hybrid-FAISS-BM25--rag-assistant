Xcode - how to include c library and header file to cocoa project?

How do I add c library to Xcode Cocoa project? Or what is the best option, I don't want to copy them into Cocoa project directory. I have a C project called a which compiles into library a.dylib and header file a.h , the project is located in it's own directory. I want to use this library from my objective-c application in Xcode. How do I add the header file and library to my Xcode project? I can drag the a.dylib into other frameworks but what do I do with a.h ?
