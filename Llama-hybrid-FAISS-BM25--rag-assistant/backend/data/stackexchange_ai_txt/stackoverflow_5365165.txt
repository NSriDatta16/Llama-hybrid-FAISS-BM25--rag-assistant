Developing GUI for program

I have developed a java program as a part of my homework and have to build "really good" GUI for it as is the demand. I would like to know if I can develop a flash based gui and then run my java code behind it since I have learnt flash before ?? Since I have some time constraint I don't think I would be able to implement full dragabble features using swing and java applets. Please do suggest the best way I should complete my GUI in period of 2-3 days. Thanks a lot....
