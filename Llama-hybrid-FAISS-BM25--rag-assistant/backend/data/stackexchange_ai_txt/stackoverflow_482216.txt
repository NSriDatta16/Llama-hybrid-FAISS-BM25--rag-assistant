After some digging around here , I found that you can't call an event from a non-view class. That forum post describes the elegant solution, and also offers a quick workaround: Application.application.dispatchEvent(new CalConnectorEvent(calUser.calConnectors as CalConnector,CalConnectorEvent.LOAD_ONLINE_CALENDAR_EVENT,true)); But check out the forum post- there's a lot of meat in there.
