I don't know of a way to patch a type with an extension method. But it's certainly possible to patch an object via the add-member cmdlet PS> $a = "foo" PS> $a = add-member -in $a -memberType ScriptMethod -name Bar -value { $this + "bar" } -passthru PS> $a.Foo() foobar EDIT Explain the completely and totally readable PowerShell Syntax :) I love PowerShell but it really does come up with cryptic syntax from time to time. "-in": This is short for inputObject and essentially says add member to this "-memberType": There are many different types of values you can add to a runtime object including methods, note properties, code method, etc ... See "get-help add-member -full" for a complete list "-passthru": Take the object that just had a member added to it and push it down the pipeline. Without this flag the assignment would be assigning and empty pipeline to $a . The assignment call is basically ensuring that $a now has the method you added
