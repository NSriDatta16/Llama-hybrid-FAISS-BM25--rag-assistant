Is this adaptive MCMC approach ergodic?

I am aware that adaptive MCMC proposals can be dangerous, as they can affect the ergodicity of the chain and hence potentially invalidate the results obtained. Andrieu & Thoms (2008) (DOI 10.1007/s11222-008-9110-y) suggest that adaptive mechanisms with vanishing adaptation might be a valid way to restore ergodicity. I was wondering if the following adaptive MCMC proposal would suit these requirements for a multivariate Gaussian proposal: Initialize counter c = 0 At every $n$ -th proposal: c = c+1 Estimate a base covariance $\Sigma_{base}$ based on the unique samples in the chain Calculate the acceptance rate $r_{acc}$ in since the last $n$ -th step Adjust a scalar factor $f_{c} = f_{c-1}((\frac{r_{acc}}{r_{target}}-1)1.1^{-c}+1)$ Set proposal covariance to $\Sigma_{proposal}=f_{c}\Sigma_{base}$$ As far as I see, $\Sigma_{base}$ should approach stability as the length of the chain approaches infinity, and the changes in the adaptation factor $f$ obviously approach zero as the chain grows. This seems like a vanishing procedure, but is there something I have missed?
