Everything is a flow Everything really is a flow. Computer programs had always been a flow and will always be a flow containing of theese processes: input -> process -> output The MVC design pattern in fact corresponds with this.. controller -> model -> view Fragmentation You're right. But I think this "issue" might be reduced by a good suppport in IDEs. Config files There's no doubt xml is the best way to express configuration. Flows break encapsulation I would disagree with this. You can make black boxes using flows and then use these black boxes in another flows.
