Your hand-drawn line appears to be roughly attempting to "go through the middle" of the data, and is thus roughly minimising some aggregate of the orthogonal residuals between the points and the curve. This is similar to formal fitting methods like total least squares . In contrast, the line generated for the logistic curve is based on the more orthodox approach of minimising some aggregate of the vertical error between the points and the curve. If you would like a curve that is more like the one you have drawn then you should use a fitting procedure based on orthogonal residuals . There are some discussions of the distinction between fitting methods using orthogonal residuals and vertical residuals here , here and here . In answer to your posted question, yes, it is possible to fit a curve that incorporates prior beliefs about the resltionship between the variables. This is generally done by postulating a Bayesian model with a curve described by some parameters, and setting a prior for those parameters. However, I don't think that is what you need here. Your "prior" belief has clearly been formed from seeing the data, and its divergence from the formal fitted model you have used is essentially due to your visual sense that you should be minimising orthogonal residuals rather than vertical residuals. What you need to do here is consider if that is really what you want. If so, then you should move to a fitting method that uses orthogonal residuals. If not, you have learned an important deficiency of your visual intuition!
