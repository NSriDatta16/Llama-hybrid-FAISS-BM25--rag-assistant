Another cause for this problem can be using too many typed datasets via the designer. or other types that can be instaniated via a designer like lots of databound controls on lots of forms. I imagine your the sort of hardcore programmer though who wouldn't drag n' drop a DS! :D in relation to your problem, Bogdan, have you tried to reproduce the problem w/o your c++ component loaded? If you can't then maybe its this. How are you loading the component? have you tried other techniques like late binding, etc? any difference? Additional: Yes you are right, the other culprits are lots of controls on the form. I once saw this same issue with a dev that had imported a very VB6 app over to .net. he had literally 100's of forms. He would get periodic crashing of the IDE after a couple of hours. I'm pretty sure it was thread exhaustion. It might be worth setting up a vanilla box w/ no addins loaded just to rule addins out, but my guess is you are just hitting the wall in terms of a combined limiation of VS and your box specs. Try running Windows Vista 64bit and install some extra RAM modules.
