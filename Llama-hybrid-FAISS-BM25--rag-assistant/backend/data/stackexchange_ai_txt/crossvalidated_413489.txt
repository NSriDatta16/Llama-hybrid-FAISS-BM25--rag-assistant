Regarding your question about when to impute a specific value vs using a missingness indicator variable, it depends on several factors: 1) The nature of missingness itself: Is the value missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or not missing at random (NMAR)? If the answer is either MAR or MCAR, you are safe with probably imputing the value, although what process you use to impute those values may differ. If the value is NMAR, it may be safer to use a missingness indicator variable. 2) The amount of missingness: This may seem obvious, but if most (or barely any) of the variable values are missing, adding a missingness indicator probably adds little to no value to a machine learning algorithm that is trying to make some prediction. You may consider just not using the variable (column deletion) or removing those instances with missing values (row deletion- this also depends on how large your data set is though, so be careful). 3) Business context: In certain business contexts, a missingness indicator variable may capture not only a systemic problem or issue with how data is collected but actually some real truth about the population being studied. For example, if individuals who fail to fill out a particular subfield for a credit card form are more likely to default on credit cards because they just tend to be careless, the missingness itself would be helpful for an algorithm in helping to predict unsee instances.
