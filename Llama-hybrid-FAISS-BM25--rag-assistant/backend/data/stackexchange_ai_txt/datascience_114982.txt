I am not convinced from that first time series plot that you have exponential data. What you do have is a lot of observations in a small graph space with some unaccounted for periodicity possibly. Before deciding to transform the data, it is meaningful and useful to decompose your series. Decomposition breaks out a trend (upward or downward trajectories), Seasonality (repeated periodic patterns in the data) and the remainder (which you can think of as noise, temporally localized variability) When you look at this tryptic of graphs you will be able to assess better if there is some kind of pattern worth transforming. There is a fantastic book (open sourced) by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos called Forecasting Principals & Practice . It gives really clear suggestions on how to start working with time series data and provides meaningful ways for interpreting plots tests. I would start with understanding your series more completely before rushing to transform it.
