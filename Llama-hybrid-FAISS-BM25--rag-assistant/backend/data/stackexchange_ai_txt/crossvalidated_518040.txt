What is the point of doing cross validation like this?

I have some data and some models that I'd like to cross-validate. Here is my approach. Take my data, which has roughly 10.000 rows. Generate 10 test sets by simulating, with replacement, 1.000 rows from the original data. For each of those 10 sets, fit my models. For each of these 10 fitted models, test them on the full, 10.000-row data set. Take the MSE for each set, and then average that across all 10 sets. That is then my performance metric. Is there something wrong with this approach? Does it work? I was reading wikipedia's page on cross-validation and could not find this exact procedure. Does it have a name? If not, what are is weaknesses?
