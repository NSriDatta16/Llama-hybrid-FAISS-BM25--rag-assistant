Method to show a time series of ~300 values is not stationary

I have a data series with approximatelly 300 values. I want to show that it is not weakly stationary, that is, show as mathematically as possible that its mean or its standard deviation vary with time. What would you recommend? I would like to be capable of implementing it on excel.
