PCA to decorrelate and classify timeseries

I have a labeled dataset where each subject belongs to one of two classes A or B , with A being the majority. Each subject, has 6 independent different time-series, each of length t . I would like to classify each subject as belonging to either class. So, one way to look at it, is that I have 6 independent features per subject, where each feature is a vector in R^ t . Another way to look at it, is as a n x 6*t matrix, where each subject has 6t many correlated features. I want to try PCA on the time-series for dimensionality reduction but more importantly to decorrelate, but am unsure how to proceed. PCA gives me a set of principal (eigen) components and values. What exactly would I apply the PCA on? Do I: separate out my data into 6 different n x t blocks, each one representing one independent feature and PCA on that? How would I classify after having performed the multiple PCAs? What would be my 'features' in that case? The values? The components? PCA on the entire n x 6t matrix and classify in the transformed space?
