You can send packets using WinPcap, it's part of its interface (the basic function is called pcap_sendpacket). In order to generate packets, you can simply write the packets' bytes. What type of packets do you want to send? I have some experience creating packets, but I did that in C# (If you want to do that in .NET, you can create and send packets easily using Pcap.Net ).
