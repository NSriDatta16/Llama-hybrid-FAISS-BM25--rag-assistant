Security: Think first about potential uses a malicious user might have for the hashed password (including comparison with other stored hashes). Caching: Yes there is a meta tag, but you shouldn't use it unless you have to; better to set the HTTP headers HTML authors can put tags in a document’s section that describe its attributes. These meta tags are often used in the belief that they can mark a document as uncacheable, or expire it at a certain time. Meta tags are easy to use, but aren’t very effective. That’s because they’re only honored by a few browser caches (which actually read the HTML), not proxy caches (which almost never read the HTML in the document). While it may be tempting to put a Pragma: no-cache meta tag into a Web page, it won’t necessarily cause it to be kept fresh. from the Caching Tutorial for Web Authors and Webmasters (HTML Meta Tags and HTTP Headers)
