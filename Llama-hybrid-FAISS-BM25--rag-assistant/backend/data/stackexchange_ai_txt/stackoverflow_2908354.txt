VB .NET, but only because VB6 poisoned an entire generation of programmers I work in a VB .NET shop that used to be a VB6 shop, and every person working here who used to be VB6 developers stubbornly refuses to learn anything about .NET. They code as if it’s still VB6, and their apps suck just like VB6 apps did. My boss actively discourages any use of LINQ because she fears it’s too difficult for others to understand, which is true because nobody wants to understand it. I think we would have all been better off if MS just went with C#, which kills me to say because I think curly braces are far inferior to VB’s verbose closing statements.
