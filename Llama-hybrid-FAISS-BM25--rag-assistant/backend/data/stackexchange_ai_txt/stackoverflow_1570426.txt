An average of average values will not return the same result as a single average over all values, unless all the groups averaged have the same number of items. If there are different numbers of employees rawScore each month it will be skewing your results. Consider this example: if we calculate the average of the numbers 1 through 10 the average is 5.5. Calculating the average of the numbers from 1 through 5 the average is 3, and of 6 through 10 is 8. Both groups have 5 items so the average of 3 and 8 = 5.5. However, if you take the first average as 1 and 2 = 1.5, and the second average as 3 through 10 = 6.5, then average 1.5 and 6.5 gives 4. This is skewed because the first group has 2 items, and the second has 8. In addition to this will be the cumulative effects of rounding that Robert Harvey noted.
