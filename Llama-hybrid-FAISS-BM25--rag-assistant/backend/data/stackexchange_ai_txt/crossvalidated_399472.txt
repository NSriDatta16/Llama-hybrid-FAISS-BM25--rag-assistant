In addition to what @Tim says (+1), DNN can exactly imitate CNN, because CNN is a constrained version of some DNN. You're sliding a filter throughout the image for example; but since you're sliding the same filter, you constrain that the weights multiplied with some pixel set will be the same with weights multiplied with another pixel set somewhere different in the image. Also, there'll be zero weights throughout the layer because an output neuron in the hidden layer is affected by only a set of input neurons. So, while your DNN needs to figure out how to do all these (with more parameters), CNN has built-in capability, which explains the efficiency compared to DNNs.
