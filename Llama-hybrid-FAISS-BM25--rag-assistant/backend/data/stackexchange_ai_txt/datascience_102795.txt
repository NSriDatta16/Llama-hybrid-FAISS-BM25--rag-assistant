XGBoost for a binary classification where features are of different types

I have a dataset of "questions in an exam" that contains features such as: QuestionLength (float) averageTimePerQuestion (float) hasMedia (boolean, represented as 0 or 1) averageOfHardWords (float, lots of NaNs) otherScores (float, some NaNs) etc. I want to predict the column entitled "Difficulty", which classifies each question as "Hard" or "Easy". I tried implementing a classification model using XGBoost but as far as I understood I needed to convert these values as 0 or 1 (Hard vs Easy). I actually followed this example. But it doesn't predict anything because I get a ValueError: unknown not supported . Are there any resources where I can find an example similar to my problem?
