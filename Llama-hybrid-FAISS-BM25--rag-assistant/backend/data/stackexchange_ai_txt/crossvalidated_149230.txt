This sounds okay to me. It seems that there are two stages to what you're trying to do: Show that the dataset is significantly correlated with $c$. Do whatever other machine learning stuff you wanted to do while accounting somewhat for $c$ by stratifying. In order to do 1, I'd probably just run a cross-validated regression of some kind predicting $c$. The output of this will be just some estimate of the effect strength, not any model selection or anything like that. This will verify (or not) your hypothesis that $c$ matters. If you confirm that $c$ is important, you can then run stratified cross-validation for whatever your original task was. I don't see how any information from the test set, or any kind of multiple-comparisons type problem, would come from this.
