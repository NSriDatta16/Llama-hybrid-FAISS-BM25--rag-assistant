Changing text color in Drupal Views admin pages

Hope this is the right place to ask this question. I am new to the forum (and to Drupal!). I am developing a site using Drupal. Am using Zenophile Midnight and have created a Zen sub Theme. This has three columns, each with a black background. I am trying to edit a View but when I open the views/edit node I find when I try to create a Filter the text does not show (presumably because it is black). How can I change this just for these pages and not for the whole site? I know the text is there as I can mark it by dragging over it. Would be grateful for your help.
