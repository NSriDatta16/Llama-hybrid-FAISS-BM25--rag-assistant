How to encode # character in the url + php + Joomla

I am trying to fetch a variable address from my current URL using JRequest::getVar('address') method. But if the address value has a (#) character, the part after the # character is not retrieved. I understand that URI is a combination of query + fragment and the part after a hash symbol is treated as a fragment. I have tried to use urlencode method but it still doesn't solve the problem. Can anyone please tell me how to solve the issue?
