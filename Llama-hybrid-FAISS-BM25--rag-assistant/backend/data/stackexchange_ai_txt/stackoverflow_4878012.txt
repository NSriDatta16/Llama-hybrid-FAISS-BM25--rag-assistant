Reading Guitar Pro files

I was wondering if anybody had heard of a library, preferably a .NET assembly, but Java will do as wel, that allows you to read the data in a Guitar Pro file (.gp3-gp4-gp5) I have this gigantor of a folder with about 50.000 song files, and would really love to write something that can actually archive all these files, for easier searching. And basic information like the tuning of the instruments in the song would be very useful parameters to retrieve from the file and add to the database. I have searched the web but have yet to find anything like this, or a file definition for writing my own parser. Thank you in advance for any information on the subject.
