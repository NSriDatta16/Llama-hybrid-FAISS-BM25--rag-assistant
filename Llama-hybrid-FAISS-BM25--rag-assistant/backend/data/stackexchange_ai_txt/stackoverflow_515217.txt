Visual Studio 2008 SP1 crash when opening MVC View

I have Visual Studio 2008 SP1 and ASP.NET MVC RC installed on a XP SP2 machine with .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. (That's a lot of SP's in one sentence!) I've a ASP.NET MVC project that I can edit just fine with Visual Web Developer Express. But opening a View page in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 makes Visual Studio to crash and vanish without even giving an error message. Now, some bloggers have proposed that either Visual Studio Power Tools of TFS Power Tools could be causing this. However, I have neither installed. Visual Studio can be started with /SafeMode option which solves the issue. But I'd like to know if there's more elegant solution available? Pom
