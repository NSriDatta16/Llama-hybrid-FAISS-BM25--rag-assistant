Probability estimation in a finite set of probabilities

I have the following problem. I have I finite family $\mathcal{F}=\{ P_1,...,P_2 \} $ of discrete probability distributions on the same set $S$ . Now I observe experiments from a random variable X which is distributed as one of the probabilities in $\mathcal{F}$ . I want to compute the probability that $X \sim P_i$ for each $i$ , or an estimate of these probabilities with some thoeretical guarantee. The real problem I have is that I have to keep a belief on these probabilities and take decisions based on this belief, update it as I observe new samples, and change my decisions accordingly. The two approaches I thought are with a Dirichlet-categorical Bayesian model, but it is continuous so the probabilities of single probabilities are 0, or with concentration inequalities, but cannot manage to find a solution.
