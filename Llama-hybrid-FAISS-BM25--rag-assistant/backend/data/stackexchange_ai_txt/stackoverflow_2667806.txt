Consequently, we are being forced to call external web services to access data in our own database. Man, that gotta hurt. As far as services in SOA go, a service is a repeatable logical manifestation of a business task - that means you are not implementing SOA if you are not 'service enabling' business processes. If you are putting some web services to select data out of your data base, all you got is a bunch of webservices, which would slowdown your applications which could have been faster by conventional data access patterns (like DAO) When you equate SOA with Web services there is a risk of replacing existing APIs with Web services without proper architecture. This will result in identifying many services that are not business aligned. Also, service orientation is a way of integrating a business as a group of linked services - so ask yourself is the organization making use of these atomic services to achieve further benefits? Do a google search for SOA anti-patterns and you will find what are the different ways to end up with a pile of web-services instead of SOA.
