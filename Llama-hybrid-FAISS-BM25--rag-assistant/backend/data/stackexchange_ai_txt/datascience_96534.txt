As a general principle for: process the sequence by splitting into smaller, overlapping analysis windows. The window length should be slightly longer than your event of interest. In such a window you can compute features that characterize the event, such a the difference between min and max inside the window. With such features the events shown here should be rather easy to separate out. You can used the labeled data to train a binary classifier on each window, like Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
