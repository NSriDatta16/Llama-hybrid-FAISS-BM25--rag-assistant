Windows Installer has the RemoveFiles table for just this purpose. Unfortunatly the tool you've choosen doesn't expose this ( or many other ) feature. I suggest looking into another tool such as Windows Installer XML. Otherwise you'll be rolling fragile custom action antipatterns to work around the limitation.
