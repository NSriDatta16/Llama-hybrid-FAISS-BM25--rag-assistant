Why is it necessary to "ignore" a level when applying sum contrasts?

I am confused about how sum contrasts are set up. As I understand, if I have some $K$ -leveled factor, I can use sum contrasts to compare each level to the grand mean ( $M_G$ ), effectively testing multiple hypotheses each predicting that some group $i$ of $K$ is different from $M_G$ . In practice (in R ), when I create a contrast matrix for a 4-leveled factor by calling contr.sum(4) , I get: contr.sum(4) 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 -1 -1 -1 then when I invert it using ginv from MASS (adding an intercept column) to get a hypothesis table of mean weights, I get this: ginv( cbind(1, contr.sum(4)) ) 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.75 -0.25 -0.25 -0.25 -0.25 0.75 -0.25 -0.25 -0.25 -0.25 0.75 -0.25 which gives me 3 ( $K - 1$ ) hypotheses, excluding the null. So, the first row (hypothesis) says that the weighted average of all 4 groups ( $M_G$ ) is 0. Then, the second row says that $\frac{3}{4}M_1 - \frac{1}{4}M_2 - \frac{1}{4}M_3 - \frac{1}{4}M_4 = 0$ , or equivalently that $M_1 = \frac{M_1+M_2+M_3+M_4}{4} = M_G$ and so on ( $M_i$ is the mean of group $i$ ). However, there is no hypothesis comparing the mean of the 4th group, or in general the $K$ th group. Why is that?. What if I wanted to specifically compare each group mean to the grand mean in my analysis? I feel like I am missing something obvious here, as most resources I see on that simply mention that there are $K-1$ sum contrasts for a factor with $K$ levels.
