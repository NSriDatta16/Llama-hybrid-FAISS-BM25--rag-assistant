Estimating actual score from small sample when population known

My inclination here is that there's no statistically sounds way of doing this, but I want to verify this. Suppose you have a population P, and you are measuring test scores across the population such that it's normally distributed and the average score is 50%. However the population can be decomposed into a large set of Subpopulations of varying sizes. Now, you want to give a ranking (percentile or ordinal) to these Subpopulations. The problem is that subpopulations with a large N are more likely to have scores near the middle, whereas populations with a small N are more likely to fall on the edges of the bell curve. Is there a way to 'adjust' the scores for the small groups such that they are better able to be compared to the large groups?
