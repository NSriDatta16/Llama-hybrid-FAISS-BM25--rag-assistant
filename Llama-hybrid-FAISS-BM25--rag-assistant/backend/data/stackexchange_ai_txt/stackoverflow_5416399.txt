Javascript in the status page. The simple version would use a call back to run every X number of seconds to request status information from the server with something like http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ , and then update the page accordingly. A more advanced version, which avoids the need to poll every X seconds, would use something like Comet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming )) which would allow the browser to keep a connection open, and for the server to send updates as they occurred. The percent completion in Jenkins is just basically a guess based on how long the current build has been running vs how long recent builds took to complete, so assuming your server side tracks the length of tasks, you could take an average, and compare the length of the current run to calculate the percentage complete.
