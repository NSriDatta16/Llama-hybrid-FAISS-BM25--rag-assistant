No, there is no RF implementation for sparse data in R. Partially because RF does not fit very well on this type of problem -- bagging and suboptimal selection of splits may waste most of the model insight on zero-only areas. Try some kernel method or better think of converting your data into some more lush representation with some descriptors (or use some dimensionality reduction method).
