Login to remote site with PHP cURL

I'm new to using cURL and its hard to find good resources for it. What I'm trying to do is login to a remote site, by having curl do the login form and then send back that it was successful. The code I have doesn't seem to work and only tries to show the main page of the site. $username="mylogin@gmail.com"; $password="mypassword"; $url="http://www.myremotesite.com/index.php?page=login"; $cookie="cookie.txt"; $postdata = "email=".$username."&password=".$password; $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, FALSE); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6"); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 60); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 0); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, $cookie); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_REFERER, $url); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $postdata); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); $result = curl_exec ($ch); echo $result; curl_close($ch); What am I doing wrong. After this is working I want to redirect to another page and get content from my site.
