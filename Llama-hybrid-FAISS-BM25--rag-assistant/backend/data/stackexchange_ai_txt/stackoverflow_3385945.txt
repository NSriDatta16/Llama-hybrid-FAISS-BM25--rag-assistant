I have an editor mask in flash that displays it's movement without hitting enter key

I made a circular mask in 3dsMax, imported into flash as an swf, used it to mask a movieclip. The thing is that when i drag the movieclip to the stage, the mask animates without hitting enter key consuming a lot of ide resources, anyone has an idea of why is this happening? Using Flash CS4
