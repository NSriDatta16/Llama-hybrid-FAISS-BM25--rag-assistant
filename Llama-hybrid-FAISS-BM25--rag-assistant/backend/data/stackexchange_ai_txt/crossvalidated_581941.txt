I coded this in Python and obtained the following results from 1,000,000 runs for each test: Test 1: Stopping when throw >= 50: Average winnings: \$73.07 Minimum winnings: \$35 Maximum throws: 20 Test 2: Stopping when throw >= 87: Average winnings: \$86.36 Minimum winnings: \$-4 Maximum throws: 92 I tested a few stopping values, and stopping after rolling 87 or higher seemed to give the best results: Here's my python code: import random import numpy as np def roll_dice(): return random.randint(1, 100) def stop(num, throw, limit=50): return throw >= limit def winnings(num, throw): return throw - num win_list = [] max_throws = 0 stop_at = 50 for run in range(1000000): for i in range(1, 101): throw = roll_dice() if stop(i, throw, stop_at): break win_list.append(winnings(i, throw)) max_throws = max(max_throws, i) print(f'Stopping when throw >= {stop_at}') print(f'Average winnings: ${np.mean(win_list):.2f}') print(f'Minimum winnings: $ {np.min(win_list)}') print(f'Maximum throws: {max_throws}')
