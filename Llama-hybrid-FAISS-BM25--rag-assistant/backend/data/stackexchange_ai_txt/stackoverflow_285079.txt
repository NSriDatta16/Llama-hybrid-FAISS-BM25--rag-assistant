We actually aim even lower, for about a 7-10% average, but we do sometimes get processing that will spike us to 60%. We measure total CPU every 30 seconds and email a report daily, and if we see a move of 2% away from that average we expect for that day we investigate. It takes time but it's helps me sleep better at night :)
