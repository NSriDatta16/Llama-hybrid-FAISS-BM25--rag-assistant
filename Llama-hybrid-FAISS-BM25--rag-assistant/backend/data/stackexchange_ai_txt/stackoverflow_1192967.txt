I think you simply need to parse through the array keeping a backlog of two elements. As N/2 are equal and the rest is guaranteed to be distinct there must be one place i in your array where a[i] == a[i-1] OR a[i] == a[i-2] iterate once through your array and you have complexity of roughly 2*N which should be well inside O(N). This answer is somewhat similar to the answer by Ganesh M and Dougie, but I think a little simpler.
