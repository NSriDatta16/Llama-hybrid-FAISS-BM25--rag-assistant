Forgive me for totally side-stepping the question, but yesterday I went to eBay and paid US $99 for a 7 inch Android o/s slate PC. Not the world's paster processor, nor with heaps of RAM, but certainly enough to fill in user surveys in the field. I can't believe that your organization can't afford $99 per interviewer to make this problem go away. It's worth suggesting to your boss, at least, isn't it?
