Does adding a grouping variable to a model help or hamper?

Imagine I have a dataset of people where I can find the city and country they live in. The data is such that, given the city, there is only one possible country. For example, given Madrid as a city, the country the person lives at can only be Spain, and if I say London, the person can only live in England. So one can say that the information of which country the person lives in is already contained in the city variable. Given this situation, is it any better to fit a generalized linear model using both country and city variables instead of only city ? Does this change if the model is non-linear? Does it depend on the specific kind of model I use (regression, SVM, trees...)?
