When I was new to JavaScript, after a week I found out that life is much easier with a framework. Anyway, I did not even knew, what exactly they are for; I've got some glue about $() that it's a smart replacement for window.getElementById() , and I assumed that there are some other comfortable methods for other purposes, like AJAX request. I did not wanted to spend lot of time on learning a framework, so I was decided that I will choose that which I fall in love first sight . Then I was spending about a whole month with googling. I have not missed any of the "big names", but I dropped them soon. The main reason of the dissatisfaction was their site, the documentation: after reading a whole page of text, I was yet as dumb as before. What is it for? What they do? What is the input, what is the aim, what is the output? Then, I found DOMAssistant . It's small, perfect, and well-documented. Just take a look on the first paragraph of the opening page, it's a totally clear definition of the JS framework: What is DOMAssistant? The idea of DOMAssistant is to provide a simpler and more consistent way to script against the Document Object Model (DOM) in web browsers. The idea is that everything starts with the element(s) in question, selected through id or CSS selectors, and then perform various methods on it, such as adding or removing classes, events etc. So, I say, if you finally choose another, more fashionable framework, DOMAssistant is a must-to-see. And if you have no need for animated flying windows, it's also a good choice.
