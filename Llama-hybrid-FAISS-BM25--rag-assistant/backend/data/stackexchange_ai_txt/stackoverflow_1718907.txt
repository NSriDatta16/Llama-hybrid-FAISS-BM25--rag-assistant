To answer your items in order: The "proper" way here depends on personal preference, though there are methods that can be easier to maintain and navigate than others. Therefore there really is no all-encompassing "proper" way. Again, this is a matter of personal preference. All of the projects I have worked on professionally have had some fundamental organization based on the type of file. Thus in a given project you would have one directory for resources, one for headers, one for sources, etc. .xib files don't "have" to be anywhere locally on the disk or even located under any special directory in the XCode project. The XCode build system will recognize the .xib file as a resource by its extension, compile it, and put the result in the proper location. (Note that this assumes the file is listed under your targets "Build resources" step. If you find yourself with many source, header, and resource files, I would recommend gathering them all together into three separate folders organized by type. The relationship, then, between the folders is established by the names of the files (e.g., AskPassword.h is related to AskPassword.m is related to AskPassword.xib). For the answer to this question you would have to ask Apple. I hope that helps!
