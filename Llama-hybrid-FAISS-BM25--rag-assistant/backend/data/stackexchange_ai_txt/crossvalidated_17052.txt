How to test a logistic regression model developed on a training sample on the data left out using R?

I have the summary of a logistic regression output in R. I used training data to make the model. How do I test the logistic regression model developed on the training data on the data left out? My naive guess is to create a function then run each test same through that (not even sure how do pull that) but I have to imagine there's a better way.
