The first @hello in your code is called a class instance variable. It's an instance variable of the class object which the constant Hello points to. (and which is an instance of the class Class .) Technically, when you're within the class scope, your self is set to the object of your current class, and @variables pertain to your current self . Boy I suck at explaining these things. You can get all this and much more clarified to you by watching this collection of $5-each screencasts from The Pragmatic Programmers . (Or you can ask for clarifications here and I'll try to update.)
