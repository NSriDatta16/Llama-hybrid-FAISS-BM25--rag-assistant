The run-queue is always changing, so it's almost impossible to get the set of processes in the current run-queue. That said, you can get an approximation by looking at the STAT (state) field of the process list from ps . When running the command below: $ ps aux ...the if the STAT field begins with R , then the process is marked RUNNABLE by the kernel, which on most operating systems means that it is in the run-queue. Here's what a runnable process looks like on my machine: USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TT STAT STARTED TIME COMMAND root 78179 0.0 0.0 599828 480 s003 R+ 7:51AM 0:00.00 ps aux On solaris, you can also use the prstat command and look at the STATE column. The value run indicates that the process is on the run-queue. (Also note that the value cpuN indicates that the process is currently running on processor N. For example: $ prstat -s cpu -n 5 PID USERNAME SIZE RSS STATE PRI NICE TIME CPU PROCESS/NLWP 13974 kincaid 888K 432K run 40 0 36:14.51 67% cpuhog/1 27354 kincaid 2216K 1928K run 31 0 314:48.51 27% server/5 14690 root 136M 46M sleep 59 0 0:00.59 2.3% Xsun/1 14797 kincaid 9192K 7496K sleep 59 0 0:00.10 0.9% dtwm/8 14851 kincaid 24M 14M sleep 48 0 0:00.03 0.3% netscape/1 Total: 97 processes, 190 lwps, load averages: 2.18, 2.15, 2.11
