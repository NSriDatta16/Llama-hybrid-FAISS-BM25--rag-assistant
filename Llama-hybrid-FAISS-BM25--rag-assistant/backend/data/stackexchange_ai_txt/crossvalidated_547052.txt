Why is maximum likelihood estimator suspectible to outliers?

I'm new to statistics and currently learning abot MLE. Some of the papers I read: Robust Graph Embedding with Noisy Link Weights mentioned MLEs are suspectible to contamination in data, but didn't make any further mention about it. So I would like to know the reason for this with clear and detailed explains.
