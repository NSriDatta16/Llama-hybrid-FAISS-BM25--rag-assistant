Where is the “energy” analogy coming from in PCA?

In some publications or materials on POD/PCA, I've encountered sentences like: the first PCs carry most energy , or the first PCs identify the most energetic directions . This analogy to energy seems like it’s coming from some very particular, maybe physics-related usage of PCA/POD. I would like to understand the origins of this analogy, mostly out of curiosity. Example: The sum of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix is defined as the “energy” of the data. A commonly used criterion for selecting the number of modes to keep in a low-dimensional representation is that of capturing a certain percentage of the energy of the data.
