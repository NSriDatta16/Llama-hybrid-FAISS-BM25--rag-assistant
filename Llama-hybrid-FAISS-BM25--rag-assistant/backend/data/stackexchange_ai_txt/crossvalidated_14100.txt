The mean you described (the arithmetic mean) is what people typically intend when they say "mean" and, yes, that is the same as average. The only ambiguity that can occur is when someone is using a different type of mean, such as the geometric mean or the harmonic mean, but I think it is implicit from your question that you were talking about the arithmetic mean
