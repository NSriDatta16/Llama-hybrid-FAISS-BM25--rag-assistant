You can use regression models such as RandomForestRegressor() to solve time-series problem at your own risk . Please remember, regression model will also capture trend and seasonality based on features such as day_of_year, month, and year . However, I be careful before generalizing use of regression models over time-series modes. Regression models may not completely fail on time-series data, but results from regression models may not be as reliable as a statistically correct time-series model. e.g. suppose we have a time series data with a date( YYYYMMDD ) column and a target column e.g. stock_value ( a series of numeric values corresponding to each time stamp). One can use following two approaches: Use time-series ML models such as ARIMA, LSTM ; and forecast the future target values for a given date. Second, one can extract three features from time-stamp column namely day_of_year, month_of_year, and year . Now, you will have four columns including the target. Use 3 new features as independent variable and target as dependent variable. Next, do train_test_split, prepare the regression model ( linear regression, decision_tree_regression, random_forest, or xgboost . In this case, the prediction will be for a given date in future. The model will be able to predict the future values. Remark: In one of my work, I had applied both regression and time-series model on a data with two column namely time-stamp and target. Upon comparing, I found RandomForestRegressormodel gave accuracy of 85.3% and time-series ARIMA model gave accuracy of 85.8% on the test data. Now, this is in no way a substantial gain by time-series model over regression model, nor should on conclude to generalize these findings. I have personally compared accuracy of time-series model and regression model in one of the time-series data. However, I don't have enough evidence to generalize this to those data-sets which have noise; in such cases time-series models are better at removing noise before capturing trend and seasonality leading to their better performance.
