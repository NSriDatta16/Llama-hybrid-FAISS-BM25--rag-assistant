SSRS 2005 Subreporting Performance Concern

I have a report which, when rendered on its own, has the following performance times (taken from ExecutionLogStorage table): TimeDataRetrieval: 6776 TimeProcessing: 142 TimeRendering: 30 When this report is used as a sub-report which is repeated 34 times, the performance of the overall report comes out as follows: TimeDataRetrieval: 9255 TimeProcessing: 187709 TimeRendering: 35 Furthermore, the memory consumption of my IIS process (using ReportViewer web control) goes up by several hundreds of MB. Are these performance issues inherent to sub-reporting or is there something wrong with my report?
