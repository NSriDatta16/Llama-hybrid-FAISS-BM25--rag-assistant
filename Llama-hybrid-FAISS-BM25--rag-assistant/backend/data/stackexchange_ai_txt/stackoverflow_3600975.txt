How to implement an AutoCompleteBox on Windows Phone 7

I have a Textbox on my WP7 GUI, which I would like to Bind to a generic list stored in IsolatedStorage. The aim would be, to supply a feature like the AutoCompleteBox in WPF, which seems to be missing in WP7 Silverlight. I want to provide suggestions based on the entries in the favorites list as the user types in text. Matching would be basic match on string.beginsWith(string foo). Any suggestion on how I could accomplish this? EDIT: Tried Matthieus suggestion, but no luck. Downloaded the library and added all necessary references. Then tried scenario no. 5 mentioned on nikhilk.net . Both TextBox as well as XTextBox give me an error when I try to add either or . Both say: The type (TextBox | XTextBox) does not support direct content. So no luck on that front... other suggestions?
