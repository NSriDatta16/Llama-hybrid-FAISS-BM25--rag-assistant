FANN (Fast Artifical Neural Network Library) is a great general-purpose neural-network library written in C but has bindings for just about any language you might want (C++, .NET, Python, Mathematica among others). Even better, it's open-source and licensed under the LGPL, so I'd imagine that would be fine for you. Neuron.NET is another good alternative if you're using .NET (also open-source), though it's licensed under the GPL. Hope that helps.
