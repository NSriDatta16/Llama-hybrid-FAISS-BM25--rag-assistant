Unfortunately, you can't import a class without it being in a package. This is one of the reasons it's highly discouraged. What I would try is a sort of proxy -- put your code into a package which anything can use, but if you really need something in the default package, make that a very simple class which forwards calls to the class with the real code. Or, even simpler, just have it extend. To give an example: import my.packaged.DefaultClass; public class MyDefaultClass extends DefaultClass {} package my.packaged.DefaultClass; public class DefaultClass { // Code here }
