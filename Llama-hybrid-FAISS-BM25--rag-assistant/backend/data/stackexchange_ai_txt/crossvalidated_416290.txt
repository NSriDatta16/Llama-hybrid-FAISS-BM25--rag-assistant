In a classification task, along with accuracy, it is better to also check the other metrics like sensitivity, specificity, precision, etc. Since, in this case we could overlook a few spams classified as hams over any important ham i classified as spam. So, the threshold of logistic regression should be chosen accordingly. If all other metrics of Logistic regression and decision tree are comparable, then the simplest model has to be chosen, in this case logistic regression, as it is a linear model. I'm fairly new to Data Science, and this is what I feel is to be done. Let me know if I'm wrong or missing something.
