For convenience reasons (such as version control) I'd like to have all the files pertaining to the project under a same path, say, for example, project/src for the source and project/data for resource files. You can organize your source tree as you wish â€” it need not bear any resemblance to the FHS layout desired of installed software. I see that usually the executable goes under /usr/local/bin and its resources on /usr/local/share. (And the truth is that I'm not even sure of this) The standard prefix is /usr . /usr/local is for, well, "local installations" as the FHS spec reiterates. Is there any standard or recommended way to let me just rebuild the binary for testing and use the files on the project/data directory Definitely. Run ./configure --datadir=$PWD/share for example is the way to point your build to the data files form the source tree (substitute by proper path) and use something like -DDATADIR="'${datadir}'" in AM_CFLAGS to make the value known to the (presumably C) code. (All of that, provided you are using autoconf/automake. Similar options may be available in other build systems.) This sort of hardcoding is what is used in practice, and it suffices. For a development build within your own working copy , having a hardcoded path should not be a problem, and final builds (those done by a packager) will simply use the standard FHS paths.
