As cherouvim pointed out in the comments, it depends on the storage engine. MyISAM does keep a count of the table rows, and can keep it accurate since the only locks MyISAM supports is a table lock. InnoDB however supports transactions, and needs to do a table scan to count the rows. http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/12/01/count-for-innodb-tables/
