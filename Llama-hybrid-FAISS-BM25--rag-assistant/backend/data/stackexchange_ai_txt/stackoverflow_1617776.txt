[PHP/MySQL]: Is there a way to store text in Rich Text Format in MySQL table?

I have given en Entry Form to the user to input values that are stored in a MySQL table. There is one column called "Project Details", wherein the user can input upto 200 characters and this column is of type "varchar". Till here everything is fine. The problem starts when the project details contain a number of points that are to be listed on the HTML page as: (1) ......... (2) ......... (3) ......... It is unsure whether the project details is of one line, one paragraph, a simple text or a numbered list. Is there any way to save the project details in rich text format in the MySQL table and when PHP shows the page of my website, the text gets listed as it was pasted?
