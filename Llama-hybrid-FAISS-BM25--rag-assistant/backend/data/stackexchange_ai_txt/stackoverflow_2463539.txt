What to consider if using triggers on tables in a sql-server merge replication

i am driving since some years a sql-server2000 merge-replication over three locations. Triggers do a lot of work in this database. i got no troubles. Now migrating these database to a brand new sql2008, i got some issues about the triggers. They are firing even if the merge-agent does his work. Is there anybody who has some experience with that kind of stuff on sql2008-server? Can anybody confirm that different behaviour to sql2000? Peace Ice
