SVM model training set vs test set

I am trying to train an SVM model using Forest Fire data. I split up my data into a test and training set. I am fairly new to this type of analysis but I'm not sure what role the test data plays or even why it's recommended that the data be split into a training and test set. How do I use the test data to see how good of a fit the trained model is? Data comes from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires In addition, I am using ksvm from library(kernlab) because svm from library(e1071) has not worked for me in the past. Variables day and month are categorical so I treated them as factors using as.factor(day) and as.factor(month) in the ksvm model. forestfires = read.csv("forestfires.csv") # read csv file head(forestfires) summary(forestfires) #build training/ test sample sample set.seed(0508) sample
