Are MongoDB and CouchDB perfect substitutes?

I haven't got my hands dirty yet with neither CouchDB nor MongoDB but I would like to do so soon... I also have read a bit about both systems and it looks to me like they cover the same cases... Or am I missing a key distinguishing feature? I would like to use a document based storage instead of a traditional RDBMS in my next project. I also need the datastore to handle large binary objects (images and videos) automatically replicate itself to physically separate nodes rendering the need of an additional RDBMS superfluous Are both equally well suited for these requirements? Thanks!
