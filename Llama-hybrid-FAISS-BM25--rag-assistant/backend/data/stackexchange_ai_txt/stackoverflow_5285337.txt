Johnson 85 83 77 91 100 Aniston 80 90 95 93 48 Chen 78 81 11 90 73 Gupta 92 83 30 69 87 Blair 23 45 96 38 59 Lamah 100 100 100 100 100 The first three scores are 'Assignments' and the last two scores are 'Exams'. All the names should go into a 1-dimensional array Assignments into a 2-dim array also Exams into a 2-dim array My ultimate aim is to find out the average of assignments & exams for each student.
