Sometimes corner cases are so rare they're not worth testing, yet a strict code-coverage rule requires you test it anyway. For example, in Java the MD5 algorithm is built-in, but technically it's possible that an "unsupported algorithm" type exception is thrown. It's never thrown and your test would have to go through significant gyrations to test that path. It would be a lot of work wasted.
