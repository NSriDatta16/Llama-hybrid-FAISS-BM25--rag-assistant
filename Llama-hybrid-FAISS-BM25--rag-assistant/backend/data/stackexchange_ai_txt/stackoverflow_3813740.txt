Large Model Collections in MVVM

Whilst implementing my first MVVM application in WPF, I've been wondering about the pros and cons of wrapping Model collections in related ViewModel collections to use in the View. In our system we are likely to have several potentially large collections e.g. Order Lines in an Order, and Stock Items which could be selected for an Order Line. At present these are looked up from SQL in the Data Access layer, and then SqlDataReaders are looped around to create a collection of Model Objects. To then loop around the collection of Model objects when creating a collection of ViewModel objects seems like an unnecessary overhead. When there are large collections of Model objects would it be better to expose these directly on the View? Thanks in advance for your help, Mark Edit While reading up on this subject I found this MSDN article from July this year (reviewed by Josh Smith no less) which gives a pretty balanced view of MVVM, and in the 'Collections' section said this: Another problem with collections is determining when or if to wrap each Model instance in the collection within a ViewModel instance. For smaller collections, the ViewModel may expose a new observable collection and copy everything in the underlying Model collection into the ViewModel observable collection, wrapping each Model item in the collection in a corresponding ViewModel instance as it goes. The ViewModel might need to listen for collection-changed events to transmit user changes back to the underlying Model. However, for very large collections that will be exposed in some form of virtualizing panel, the easiest and most pragmatic approach is just to expose the Model objects directly. Thanks very much for the comments so far, trying to limit the amount of data passed into the ViewModel, or using paginated or other suitable controls would reduce problems I'm sure, but I wonder if there would there still be situations where it would be better to simply bind to a collection of Model objects within the ViewModel?
