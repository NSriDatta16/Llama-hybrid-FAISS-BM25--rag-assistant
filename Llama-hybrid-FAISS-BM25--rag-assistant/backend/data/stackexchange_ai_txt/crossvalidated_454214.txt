I guess pid is a patient or person identifier, so you have repeated measures from the same persons. If so, I would include time as well in your model, e.g. glmer(populist ~ wkb + married + age + I(age^2) + time + (1 + time | pid) Regarding your questions: yes, (1 | pid) describes the random part of your model. You have a varying intercept ( 1 ) for each pid , i.e. you assume that your outcome has a different average value for each pid . In repeated measurement / longitudinal design, you may also assume that your outcome varies stronger/weaker for different pid , i.e. you have random slopes as well. That's why I would add time as well. A "Fixed Effects" Model would require some data preparation, e.g. demeaning and removing the intercept. So from a first quick glance, I would say it does not perfectly describe a FE model. & 4. I personally would not use the Hausman-test, nor a fixed effects regression at all. There a some good publications showing that the mixed model is in general better than any fixed effects model. You can find examples that summarizes these discussion a bit here and also some information about the issue of correlated group factors and fixed effects here , and how to address these issues using mixed models. Summary: mixed models can model both between- and within-effects (while FE can only model within-effects), FE models lack information of variation in the group-effects or between-subject effects, FE regression cannot include random slopes (thus neglecting “cross-cluster differences in the effects of lower-level controls (which) reduces the precision of estimated context effects, resulting in unnecessarily wide confidence intervals and low statistical power” ( Heisig et al. 2017 ).
