Getting glmnet to select excatly given number of features?

I am using glmnet for feature selection, given a gaussian dependent variable. Part of my code is like this: lambda_seq How can I use glmnet to select exactly three (continuous) predictor variables (features), from a large set? Three is best for me, given my limited dataset size. Moreover, the chosen predictors should not be correlated much (say, maximum correlation is less than 0.7 for each pair). I guess I can write a loop and change lambda till I get three predictors. But is there something more efficient and elegant? If not, what is the best strategy for getting the optimal lambda (one that gives exactly three predictors) with a loop? To give some more context, I want to formulate a 3-variable model as part of a leave-one-out cross validation loop. Hence, the steps should be automated.
