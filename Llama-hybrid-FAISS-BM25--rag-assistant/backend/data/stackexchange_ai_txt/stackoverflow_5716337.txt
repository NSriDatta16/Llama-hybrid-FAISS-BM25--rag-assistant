Serialize a view model in Silverlight on Windows Phone 7

I have Silverlight application for the Windows Phone. When the app tombstones, I want to store the current view model. First, where do I store the view model? The phone application service (I don't know when this lives / dies) Isolated Storage I am pretty sure that I should store my view model in isolated storage. My problem is, I get an error when I try to put it in isolated storage. The error says: Type 'MyViewModel' cannot be serialized. Consider marking it with the DataContractAttribute and marking all of its members you want serialized with the DataMemberAttribute attribute. My problem is, I have a LOT of members in this view model. At the same time, it has child objects which have members as well. It just feels like this dirties up my code. It seems odd that I can successfully place the view model in the PhoneApplicationService without any problem. However, I only get this error when I try to put it into isolated storage. How do I overcome this? I just want to preserve the view model during tombstoning. Thanks!
