Check out funkload - it's a way of running your unit tests as either functional or load tests to gauge how well your site is performing. Another interesting project which can be used in conjunction with funkload is codespeed . This is an internal dashboard that measures the "speed" of your codebase for every commit you make to your code, presenting graphs with trends over time. This assumes you have a number of automatic benchmarks you can run - but it could be a useful way to have an authoritative account of performance over time. The best use of codespeed I've seen so far is the speed.pypy.org site. As to your requirement for determinism - perhaps the best approach to that is to use statistics to your advantage? Automatically run the test N times, produce the min, max, average and standard deviation of all your runs? Check out this article on benchmarking for some pointers on this.
