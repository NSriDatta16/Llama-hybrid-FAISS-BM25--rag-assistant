In Bayesian approach we treat every parameter as a random variable and define a prior for it. The prior is defined in terms of some parameters, e.g. $\boldsymbol{\beta} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1})$ , where the parameters of the priors are either chosen in advance, or we assume priors for them as well, and estimate them from the data.
