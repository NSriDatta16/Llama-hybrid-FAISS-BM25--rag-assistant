Eclipse 3.x unable to debug tomcat 5.5 with java 1.6.0_14?

I'm trying to launch and debug tomcat 5.5 with a webapp in java 6. I have set up JAVA_HOME in the tomcat's eclipse configuration (in "replace environment" mode) but I get the following error: ERROR: transport error 202: gethostbyname: unknown host ERROR: JDWP Transport dt_socket failed to initialize, TRANSPORT_INIT(510) JDWP exit error AGENT_ERROR_TRANSPORT_INIT(197): No transports initialized [../../../src/share/back/debugInit.c:690] FATAL ERROR in native method: JDWP No transports initialized, jvmtiError=AGENT_ERROR_TRANSPORT_INIT(197) If I launch directly the startup.bat, it works fine. Does anybody managed to solve it? Thanks!
