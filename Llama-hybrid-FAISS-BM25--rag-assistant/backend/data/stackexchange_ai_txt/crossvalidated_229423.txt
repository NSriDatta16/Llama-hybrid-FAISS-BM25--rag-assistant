But if we want to estimate the probability of the model, why don't we calculate the probability of the model given the experiment? Because we don't know how. There's infinite number of model possible, and their probability space is not defined. Here's a practical example. Let's say I want to forecast US GDP. I get the time series, and fit a model. What is the probability that this model is true? So, let's actually fit a random walk model into GDP series: $$\Delta\ln y_t=\mu+e_t$$ where $\mu$ is the growth rate and $e_t$ is a random error. My code below does just that, and it also produces the forecast (red) and compares it historical data (blue). However, who said that GDP is a random walk process? What is it was a trend process? So, let's fit the trend: $$\ln y_t = c t+ e_t$$ where $c$ is the slope of the time trend. The forecast using a trend model is shown on the same chart (yellow). Now, how would you calculate the probability that my random walk model is true? Within MLE we could calculate the likelihood of the drift $\mu$ given the data set, but that's not the probability. Second, and more importantly, how would you calculate the probability that the model is random walk with this drift knowing that it could also be a trend model? It could be any other number of models that produce this kind of dynamic.
