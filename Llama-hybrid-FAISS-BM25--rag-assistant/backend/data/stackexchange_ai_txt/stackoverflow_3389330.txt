With the lines: $data = $authAdapter->getResultRowObject(null,'password'); $auth->getStorage()->write($data); You're writing all the user's information, except the password, which is OK. Where ever you need to access the logged in user's details, you can do something like (updated as per your comment): public function indexAction() { $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance(); if($auth->hasIdentity()) { $userData = $auth->getIdentity(); $this->view->user = $userData; } } in the view file ( index.phtml ) just: echo $this->user->firstname That's it. If one day you decide to change the storage for Zend_Auth from session, to, for example, database, this piece of code will still work.
