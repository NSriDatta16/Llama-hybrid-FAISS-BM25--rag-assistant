I've not used team city, but I think hg command path is probably the full path to your local mercurial executable. For me (on linux) that's: $ type hg hg is /usr/bin/hg On windows it's where the 'hg' executable in your system path was placed by whichever (of the many) windows installers for mercurial you used. Pull changes from sounds like the URL to the repo, so: ssh://username@myhost.something/project or ssh://username@myhost.something//project # note the _two_ double slashes if you're using absolute paths on the server side. Your private key location/specification depends on what you're using for ssh and whether or not you're running ssh-agent, but here's a links that explicitly points from within mercurial.ini, which seems sound: http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/home/wiki/Configuring_TortoiseHg_(Windows)#Pointing-to-you-Private-key
