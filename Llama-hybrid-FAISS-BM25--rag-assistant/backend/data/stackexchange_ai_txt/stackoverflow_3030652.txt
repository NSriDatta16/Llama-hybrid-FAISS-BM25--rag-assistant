Artificial Intelligence project idea

I am looking for a graduation project idea in AI and machine learning field... The idea may require front-end user interface to attract users... I am thinking of how AI and machine learning can help you in daily life..? Any help/hint about new interesting ideas ? Thanks Edit: I am talking about practical ideas that may be used in real life... Not an idea to prove theoretical things... Something like a OS (or an add on in existing one) that adapt with your way of work... or a word processor that helps you collecting information about what you are writing..
