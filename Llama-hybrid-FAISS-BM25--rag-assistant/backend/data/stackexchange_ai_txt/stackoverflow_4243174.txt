Should server/database config files, including passwords, be stored in source control?

I'm looking to hear some best practices... Assuming a web application that interacts with a few different production servers (databases, etc.)... should the configuration files that include database passwords be stored in source control (e.g., git, svn)? If not, what's the best way to keep track of server database (or other related) passwords that your application needs access to? Edit: added a bounty to encourage more discussion and to hear what more people consider best practice.
