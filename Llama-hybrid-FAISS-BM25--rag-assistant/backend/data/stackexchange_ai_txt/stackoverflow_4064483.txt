I shudder to think of the scale properties associated with storing all of the presence you just received from the server back to the server in private storage. Private storage almost always is backed to long-term storage rather than stored in memory, so you're going to grind your server's disk to dust. If you want to store more state in the browser, and insulate yourself from browser version, and you're already using jQuery, then jStore is pretty sweet.
