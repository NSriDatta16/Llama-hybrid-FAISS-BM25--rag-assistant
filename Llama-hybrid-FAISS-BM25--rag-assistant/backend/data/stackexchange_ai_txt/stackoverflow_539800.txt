You are serving your pages as UTF-8, which is good, but at least some of the page is being dragged in from files which are not actually saved as UTF-8. SSI just throws the raw bytes in, it doesn't attempt to recode the includes so that their charsets match the file they're being included into. You need to go through all your html and include files in a text editor and make sure each one is saved as UTF-8. As John mentioned, you can avoid encoding issues by using character references for all non-ASCII characters, but it's a tremendous pain.
