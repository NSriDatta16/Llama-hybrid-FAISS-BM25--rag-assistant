Concepts of Progress and bounded waiting are totally different. Bounded waiting means a process can eventually get the lock/mutex whatever. While progress condition means the process can complete its execution. There is a circumstance called live-lock(corresponding to deadlock), in which two or more processes are organized as a process group, all the processes can acquire or release lock, which satisfy Bounded waiting, but the process group cannot progress(or why we call it live-lock. :-)). Good luck and Regards
