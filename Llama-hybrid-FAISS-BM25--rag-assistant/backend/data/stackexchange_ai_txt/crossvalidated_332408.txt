I think your question is bad explained, what you want is to predict sum_time based on pos, volume and line, it does not matter if some values in line are duplicated, it just a categorical value, you have to one-hot encode it to put in you prediction algorithm. If you want more help give more details about type of algorithm, what line means..... As far as I have understood your question it makes perfect sense, it is just one categorical value, as long has it is a value that you will have in your test set it is ok I do think it is worse to build 3 models, it is more tedious and error prone, I think your model will be able to use the LINE one hot encoded variable to catch the information. The simpler the better. Yes, it is possible to build for example a neural network with 3 output neurons, each one of them predicting a different variable
