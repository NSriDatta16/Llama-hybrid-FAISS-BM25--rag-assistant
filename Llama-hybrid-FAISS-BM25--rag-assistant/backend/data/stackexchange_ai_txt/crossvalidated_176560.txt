I want to do Time series forecasting on daily ATM transaction data

I have a data for ATM transaction on a daily basis and this data represent a seasonal variation in weekend and holidays. data structure like this trans_date tot_amount Weekend Holiday_flag 01/10/2013 164800 0 0 02/10/2013 205900 0 1 03/10/2013 215600 0 0 04/10/2013 228600 0 0 05/10/2013 410200 1 0 I used arima() function in R to forecast the next one month data but I am not getting better forecast. I am confusing to capture seasonal variation in my data. I have to select the ARIMA order from ACF and PACF plot but I have some confusion to capture seasonal order from this graph. So please advise me how can I select the right ARIMA model for my data
