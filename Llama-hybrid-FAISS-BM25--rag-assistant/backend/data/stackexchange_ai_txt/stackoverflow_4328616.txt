Boost C++ Libraries collection I would suggest taking a look at the boost C++ library collection . There are several interesting libraries that deal with concurrent processing, and working on those libraries will drastically improve your own general and cross platform c++ programming skills. Some of their libraries are related to concurrency. The nice thing about boost is that is widely distributed, and is the source of many changes present in the C++0x update to the C++ standard so every contribution can have a huge impact. Accepted Concurrency Libraries - Boost.Interprocess - Shared memory, memory mapped files, process-shared mutexes, condition variables, containers and allocators. - Boost.Thread - Portable C++ multi-threading. - Boost.MPI - Message Passing Interface library, for use in distributed-memory parallel application programming. Accepted Math Libraries - Boost.Graph - The BGL graph interface and graph components are generic, in the same sense as the the Standard Template Library (STL). - Boost.Math - A wide selection of univariate statistical distributions and functions that operate on them. - Boost.uBLAS - uBLAS provides matrix and vector classes as well as basic linear algebra routines. Several dense, packed and sparse storage schemes are supported. Libraries in Development - Libraries Under Construction - A list of libraries currently under development, many of which are concurrency and/or math related. - Review Schedule - Gives you an overview of the development status of many of the libraries.
