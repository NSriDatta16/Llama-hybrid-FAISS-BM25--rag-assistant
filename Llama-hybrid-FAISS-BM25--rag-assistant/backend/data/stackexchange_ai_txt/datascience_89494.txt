In the long-run, tabular Q-learning converges toward the optimal regardless of initialization. However, the speed of convergence may be affected, similarly to an n-armed bandit setting : http://incompleteideas.net/book/first/ebook/node21.html For more on initialization in Q learning, I recommend "Potential-based shaping and Q-value initialization are equivalent" by Eric Wiewiora.
