Hey Morgan, we're building a custom framework in AS3 here at Radical and use the state machine paradigm to power any front end UI activity. We have a state machine setup for all button events, all display events and more. AS3, being an event driven language, makes this a very attractive option. When certain events are caught, states of buttons / display objects are automatically changed. Having a generalized set of states could definitely help de-spaghttify your code!
