The fact is: you don't need to. SOA structure is very complicated to achieve. It requires care and organization style that I believe most companies will not have. (I'm glad if yours has such organization). Tomas Erls talks about Contemporary SOA and Web Service First Generation. WS-I is the traditional web service style such as asp.net web services. Actually this traditional web services doesn't mean any service oriented; And what happens is people build simple web services and call them SOA. Contemporary SOA, I believe, is an entire system structured based on services. Inside this "ecosystem", services would call each other to perform some tasks. SOA analysis is painful and you need care. To build an ecosystem like that, you need to be prepared from the first moment. Engineering service interfaces (contracts) is also paradigm. If you put some Lean Thinking at your belt, you should cut some desire to make state-of-art design. If your system already works, fine! If someone will need integration in possible future which you don't know yet about it, don't do it now. But if your system is born to be consumed, them you think about it. Best
