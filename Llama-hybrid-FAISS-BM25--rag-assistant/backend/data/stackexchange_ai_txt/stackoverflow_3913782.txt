PRISM UserControl and ServiceReference

I'm using MVVM in my project and here is my question. I have a View and corresponding view-model with service reference. This view contains UserControl, which have another UserControl and it also contains nested UserControl. Last UserControl have a method which creates a popup. And in this popup i need service reference from view model. Each user control has own DataContext. Code explanation. View xaml: FunctionsList xaml: Function3 xaml: Function3 code behind contains CreatePopup method, which creates dialog with a UserControl Function3Popup as Content. And Function3Popup should have Service reference. What is the best practice here? I have awful solution to pass reference using binding but it seems discouraging to me.
