The class FrameworkElement contains a public event called "Loaded", so naturally all classes derviving from it (UserControl class) expose it as well. MSDN The question would be : Are you downloading your images ? (This can be after loading of the control Check here ) Or are you embedding your images in the project? They'll be a part of the .xap file that's downloaded when you launch your application. You can add an event handler to that event to execute code when the said event occurrs. Hope that helps.
