First suggest is OK, stop WSDL publication, if you use this at all. But basically you have to implement autentication/authorization mechanism for you application. There should be login method, that check credentials - login/password check http request agent settings - if it is mobile device if two requirements match you authorize this request (by cookie for instance), or return authorization token, which will be input for all API method. If token is OK, API method work.. not - it return 404, for instance.
