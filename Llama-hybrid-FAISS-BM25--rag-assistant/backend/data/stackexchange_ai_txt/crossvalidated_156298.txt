Since this question has a philosophical skew and, as in all things human, de gustibus non est disputandum , here's my take. One approach to modeling this behavior is to employ PLS or partial least squares. Herman Wold, in his book Theoretical Empiricism (1990) laid the foundations for leveraging PLS in industrial applications like yours. PLS has seen wide application to problems seen in, e.g., chemometrics, where there are wide asymmetries in data structure (e.g., large p or # of variables but small n -- sample size). This is because it's a variant of the many dimension reducing techniques.
