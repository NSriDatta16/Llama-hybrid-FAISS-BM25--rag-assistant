You can use readfile : header('Content-type: application/postscript'); readfile('appendix.ps'); You also may want to send a " Content-Disposition " header to hint to the user agent how its intended to be displayed. If you want to suggest to open it in a new window, Ie: trigger a download action: header('Content-Disposition: attachment'); If you want to suggest to display it in the browser if it can: header('Content-Disposition: inline'); Noting of course these are just suggestions and the browser may not play ball or even be able to, but they're handy to have.
