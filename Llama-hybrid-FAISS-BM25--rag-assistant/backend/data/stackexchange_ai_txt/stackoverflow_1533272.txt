Missing frameworks after upgrading to Xcode 3.2

I upgraded to Xcode 3.2 and now can't seem to add a number of frameworks, specifically the media player. A number of frameworks do not show up on the "Add Existing Frameworks Sheet". Per another question I tried setting the "Framework Search Path" to $(SDKROOT)/Library/System/Frameworks but that didn't seem to make any difference. The UIKit.framework that is included by default when I create a new project is in /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS3.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks which I would expect. If I navigate to that directory I see the MediaPlayer.framework and can drag and drop it into my project successfully, but can only build and debug for a device-no suprise there, but not ideal. I uninstalled the dev tools with mode=all and reinstalled Xcode, but still no relief. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
