How to Repaint Microsoft Chart in Access form

I have a subform which sets the RowSource of a Microsoft Chart 5.0 object in its parent form. EDIT: The Row Source Type for the graph is Value List. The graph does not paint itself, however, but any action which would generally generate a repaint (drag another Access window over it, minimize it, loss and regain of focus sometimes) does indeed repaint it. In other words, the graph doesn't show or change automatically. How do I force a repaint of the chart after a subform action? These have had no effect: parent.Referesh parent.Repaint parent.TheChart.Refresh And this does not seem to exist, unfortunately: parent.TheChart.Repaint Using: Access 2003
