Options for read-only binary flat-file storage using Python

I have been tasked with setting up a flat-file SKU database for use on embedded devices with limited storage and processor speed. Basically the data I need to store consists of the following: SKU Description Location Price Qty The file will consist of several million records. The most important considerations are storage space and retrieval time. Records will only need to be retrieved by SKU and it will be read-only, so the file can be sorted by SKU. I would like to access this data with Python. So my questions comes down to this. Are there existing Python libraries that can provide this functionality for me, or do I need to roll my own? If the answer comes down to roll my own, does anyone have a suggestions, or good references for doing so?
