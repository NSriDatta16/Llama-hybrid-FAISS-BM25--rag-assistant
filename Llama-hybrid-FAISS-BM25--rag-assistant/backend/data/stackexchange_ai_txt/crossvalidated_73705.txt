For a random variable $X \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda)$, the probability of seeing a value of $k$ is: $$ P_k = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!} $$ So the probability of selling less than or equal to $5$ products in a given day, where the long-term average is $8$ is: $$ P_{0\ldots5}=\sum_{i=0}^5\frac{e^{-8} \lambda^i}{i!} $$ The probability of at least $6$ is everything other than $0$ to $5$ or $(1-P_{0\ldots5})$ for which you were asked in the first part.
