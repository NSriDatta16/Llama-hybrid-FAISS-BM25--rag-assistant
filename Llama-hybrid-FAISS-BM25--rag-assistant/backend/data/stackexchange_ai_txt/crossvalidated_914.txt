What you are looking for is called regression; there are a lot of methods you can do it, both statistical and machine learning ones. If you want to find f, you must use statistics; in that case you must first assume that f is of some form, like f:y=a*x+b and then use some regression method to fit the parameters. The plot suggests there are a lot of outliers (elements that does not follow f(x)); you may need robust regression to get rid of them.
