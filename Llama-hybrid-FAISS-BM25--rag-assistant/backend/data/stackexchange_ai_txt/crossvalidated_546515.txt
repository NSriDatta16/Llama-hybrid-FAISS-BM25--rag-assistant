Gaussian process for modeling multiple time series

I'm dealing with a time series dataset which contains multiple tracks for a particle, (i.e. for different independent instances, a sensor is observing a particle, marking its position, for varying lengths of time). This is a dataset comprising of independent stacked time series of different lengths. Can I apply a single gaussian process to do regression over this dataset? If so, how do I structure the input data? I am not interested in capturing seasonality effect, as the periodicity is actually an artifact of the data collection. Rather, I want to leverage the multiple tracks to fit a function that can estimate the behavior of the particle over a given trajectory.
