The batch file language hasn't been significantly updated decades. You still can't do a conventional for loop. I suggest looking into PowerShell . It is just as powerful (if not more) than the *nix shell languages, but can also leverage the entire .NET framework. If you use PowerShell, this problem would be as simple as Open file, go to line 13 Parse the line as two dates Subtract 15 days from one date object and add 15 to the next Write the file back out The fact that you're trying to do real programming in a batch file is truly honorable (I would have commited Seppuku ). Try to switch to a more powerful shell language that is more feature complete. Besides, PowerShell is the future of Windows scripting.
