Exponential family in testing and estimation

In the Annals of Statistics paper "Defining the curvature of a statistical problem(with applications to second order efficiency)" by Bradley Efron, he claims the following two statements in the first paragraph. The locally most powerful test of $\theta=\theta_0$ versus $\theta>\theta_0$ is uniformly most powerful in an exponential family. The MLE for $\theta$ is a sufficient statistic in an exponential family and achieves the Cramer-Rao lower bound if we have chosen the right function of $\theta$ to estimate. Can someone elaborate on these two statements as I am a Mathematician who has only a little knowledge of Statistics?
