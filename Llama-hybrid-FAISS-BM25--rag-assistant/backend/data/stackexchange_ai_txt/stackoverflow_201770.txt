X-macros are the best solution. Example: #include enum Colours { # define X(a) a, # include "colours.def" # undef X ColoursCount }; char const* const colours_str[] = { # define X(a) #a, # include "colours.def" # undef X 0 }; std::ostream& operator = ColoursCount || c colours.def: X(Red) X(Green) X(Blue) X(Cyan) X(Yellow) X(Magenta) However, I usually prefer the following method, so that it's possible to tweak the string a bit. #define X(a, b) a, #define X(a, b) b, X(Red, "red") X(Green, "green") // etc.
