A question about Confidence Interval

Recently, I have some trouble with confidence interval. The specific question is as follows: Assuming that the return of an asset $(P_t)$ conforms to a normal distribution, if the average return $(\bar{x})$ and sample variance of the asset $(s^2)$ are obtained through data collection, how to construct the confidence interval of the log return $(\ln \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}})$ ? Since the form of log return looks like a t(1) distribution under the normalization, my idea is to find the similar estimator to estimate. However, I can't manage to find it. Can anyone help me solve this question? Thank you.
