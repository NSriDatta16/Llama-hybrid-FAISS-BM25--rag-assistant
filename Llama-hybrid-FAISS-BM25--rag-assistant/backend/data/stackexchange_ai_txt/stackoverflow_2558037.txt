The name of this anti-pattern ought to be Beware Of The Leopard , after this exchange from HH2G . '...You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anyone or anything.' 'But the plans were on display...' 'On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.' 'That's the display department.' 'With a torch.' 'Ah, well the lights had probably gone.' 'So had the stairs.' 'But look you found the notice didn't you?' 'Yes,' said Arthur, 'yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying "Beware of The Leopard".'
