Fulltext search with PHP and Zend Framework - Lucene?

Hey I am looking for a way to do search in our application written in PHP and with the Zend Framework. The problem I want to fix is that some people write "Windows 95" and others "Windows95" again others "Win 95" or "Win95". I have read that there is the Zend_Search_Lucene Module but don't know if that is the right way to go. Do you have ideas? It should be written in PHP and should scale well so centralized storage would be extremly nice.
