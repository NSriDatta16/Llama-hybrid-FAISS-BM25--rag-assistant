Here are some fragmentary answers based on what you have told us about your data and analysis. If $X \sim \mathsf{Chisq}(\nu = k),$ then $E(X) = k$ and $Var(X) = 2k.$ [See Wikipedia or your text or class notes for some details of chi-squared distributions.] P-value. If you're doing a chi-squared test for which the null distribution is (approximately) $\mathsf{Chisq}(29),$ and the observed value of the test statistic is $X = 31.89,$ then you can use software to find that $P(X \ge 31.89)= 0.3247,$ which would not lead you to reject the null hypothesis. This is the P-value of the chi-squared test. (You would reject at the 5% level if the P-value is below $0.05=5\%.)$ [Computation using R statistical software in which pchisq is the CDF of a chi-squared distribution.] 1 - pchisq(31.89, 29) [1] 0.3247224 Critical value. Using printed tables of chi-squared distributions, you could find the critical value $c = 42.557$ of the chi-squared test, for which $P(X \ge c) = 0.05.$ If the chi-squared test statistic is greater than or equal to $c,$ you will reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. The critical value can also be found using R, where qchisq is the inverse CDF (or 'quantile function') of a chi-squared distribution: qchisq(.95, 29) [1] 42.55697 Graph. Below is a plot of the density function of $\mathsf{Chisq}(29).$ The solid vertical line shows the observed value $X = 31.89.$ The P-value is the area under the density curve to the right of this line. The dotted vertical line shows the the critical value $c = 42.557;$ the area under the density curve to the right of this line is the significance level $5\%.$ curve(dchisq(x, 29), 0, 55, col="blue", lwd=2, ylab="PDF", main="Density of CHISQ(29)") abline(h=0, col="green2"); abline(v=0, col="green2") abline(v=31.89, lwd=2) abline(v=42.557, lwd=2, lty="dotted", col="red")
