I solve my issue in the following way: Instead of trying not to lose the focus of the cell of the datagrid that is being edited, I added the event of drag & drop to the querying mode of the grid; besides, I also found out that it makes more sense and it's more useful, cause the user won't have to double click the cell first (to enter the edit mode) and then drag the field. Simplifying the UI for the client. If somebody is interested, I used the drag & drop manager from CodePlex to implement that behaviour on my Silverlight 3.0 app: Silverlight Drag & Drop Manager
