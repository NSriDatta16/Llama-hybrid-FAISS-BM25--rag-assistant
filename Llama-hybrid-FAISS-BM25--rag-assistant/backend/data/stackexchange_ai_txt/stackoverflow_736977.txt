It could, provided it could guarantee that the server would accept it. This might mean using an OPTIONS request. There are a lot of things that web browsers could do (for example, pipelining) that they don't do. Web browser developers consider the compatibility implications of a change. In a heterogeneous environment, there are a lot of different web servers and configurations. Making a change to the way a client works could break some of them. Perhaps only 1% of servers might accept gzipped requests, but perhaps some of those advertise that they do, but cannot correctly accept it - so users would be denied from uploading files to those sites. Historically there have been a lot of broken client / server implementations - for a long time, gzipped responses were broken in major web browsers (thankfully those are now mostly gone). So you'd end up with blacklists of user-agents or servers (or domain names) where those options were automatically turned off, which is nasty.
