I know other authors have gone to some trouble to make their books available here on stack exchange ... The printed version of our 2002 edition was printed 3 times and sold out 3 times; Springer and Google recently started selling it (book only) as a PDF eBook (no software) on the Springer and Google sites for $79. We are delighted to be able to make the PDF eBook version (2002 edition) available for FREE to stackexchange users at: http://www.mathstatica.com/book/bookcontents.html This is a complete PDF version of the original 2002 printed edition. Although no software is included (neither Mathematica nor mathStatica ), the methods, theorems, summary tables, examples, exercises, theorems etc are all useful and relevant ... even as a reference text for people who do not even have Mathematica . One can either download: the entire book as a single download file ... with live clickable Table of Contents etc, ... or chapter by chapter. iBooks installation To install as an iBook: Download the entire book as a single PDF file Then drag it into iBooks (under the section: PDF files). iPad installation To install on an iPad: First install it as an iBook (as above) Open iTunes; select your iPad; click on Books: select the book and sync it over to your iPad.
