Does dataset training and test size affect algorithm?

I am dealing with a dataset that has a total of 81 records. Out of them I divided it to 54 records for the training and the rest for testing. I noticed a few things: Accuracy is low for given test data set (~ 30%). Accuracy remains same no matter whether I use SVM or Naive Bayes. If I test against 2-3 values accuracy shoots up to 75%. Is this normal or I am doing something wrong?
