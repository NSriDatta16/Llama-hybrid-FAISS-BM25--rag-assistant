How to estimate the not available observation in time series data?

Suppose, I have a 30 seconds time-step observations of sports data, in some of the intervals the game was partially/fully stopped. I'm trying to prep the data for a time series analysis. Is it justified to take it as zero when it was stopped fully? or I have to interpolate the value... Here is the sample of data created without taking DeadBallMin (game paused) into account... ** columns A and B are actual data observed during the time-step. ** Exp_Win_A and Exp_Win_B are monotonic increasing. And assume all the features are uniformly distributed within the time-step. A B Exp_win_A Exp_win_B DeadBallMin 0 1 0 0.891713 1.074992 0.000000 1 0 1 0.893859 1.076465 0.000000 2 0 1 0.930300 1.077941 0.036633 3 0 1 0.932539 1.112289 0.000000 4 0 0 0.934783 1.122372 0.907834 From the above table, in the second row, the game was stopped for 33.67% of the time-step. Question Any suggestions on how to incorporate the 'DeadBallMin' time into Exp_win_A & Exp_win_B while keeping the behaviour?
