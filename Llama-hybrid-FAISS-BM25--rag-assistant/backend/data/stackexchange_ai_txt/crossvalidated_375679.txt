Confusion with covariance

For distributions of random variables X and Y, their covariance can be defined as the difference between the multiplication of X and Y, normalized by their joint probability and the multiplication of X and Y normalized by their marginal probabilities: $$\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y) = \sum_{x,y}p(x,y)xy - \left(\sum_xp(x)x\right)\cdot \left(\sum_yp(y)y\right)$$ From sample data for X and Y, covariance can be defined as how on average X and Y differ from their respective means: $$\operatorname{COV}(X,Y)= \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N (x_i-\bar{x}) (y_i-\bar{y}) $$ According to the second definition, if higher values of Y occur for higher values of X, then the resultant covariance is high. How this translates to the first definition? The first definition says that X and Y will have high covariance when joint probabilities for pairs of values will have higher values than their individual probabilities, regardless of the actual values. I tried with the following values: x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5] And got a surprisingly large covariate value of -6.9 (correlation -.7). I do not understand why?
