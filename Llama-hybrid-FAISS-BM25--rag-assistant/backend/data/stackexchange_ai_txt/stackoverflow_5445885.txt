There is no reason your code shouldn't work . When submitting the form, the submit button is disabled. I checked the headers being transmitted to JSFiddle in the demo, and the form field is indeed being sent (tested in IE and Chrome): POST http://fiddle.jshell.net/josh3736/YnnGj/show/ HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, */* Referer: http://fiddle.jshell.net/josh3736/YnnGj/show/ Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.7,es;q=0.3 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0) Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Host: fiddle.jshell.net Content-Length: 9 Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache test=It+works Your next steps should be: Use something that allows you to inspect the HTTP traffic (my favorite is Fiddler ) to see if your form fields are actually being sent to the server. If they are, it's obviously a problem on your server. If the form fields aren't being sent, there's something else going on in your page. Post more of your code so we can see exactly what's happening.
