The Survey list is a good simple alternative to forms, and can be used without any coding. Enter the "questions" ie. input fields, then attach a mail alert for inserts. The drawback is that you have no control over the layout of the form, it is strictly one row per input field. This makes it perhaps not a good candidate for your large forms. But it is so easy to use that you should take a look at it anyway. If you decide to develop yourself, write a web part, and add it to a WSS page. (Simplest deployment: Inherit from the ASP.Net WebPart class, put in GAC, create a .webpart file in the SharePoint webapp's wpcatalog folder). Re the person who wrote that the learning curve in SharePoint is too steep, I assume that if you're using WSS for your internal web applications you'll discover more needs for SharePoint customization in the future. Learning how to do that is a good investment.
