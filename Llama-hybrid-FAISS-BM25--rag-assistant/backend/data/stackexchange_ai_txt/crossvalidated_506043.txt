What are the assumptions that need to be checked for multilevel logistic regression and for multilevel ordinal logistic regression

I am running multilevel models for panel data on a binary outcome (mixed logistics regression) and on a ordinal outcome (mixed ordinal logistic regression). I am aware that for example with a mixed linear model, the level-2 variances should be normally distributed. What are such assumptions that should be checked for mixed logistic and ordinal regressions?
