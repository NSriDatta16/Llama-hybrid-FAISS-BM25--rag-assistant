Models for nonnegative (incl. zero) positively skewed multivariate time series (trade volumes)

I want to build a Monte Carlo simulation that is based in part on share amounts that are traded in the market for a set of stocks. I need to be able to take into account the co-dependence of trade volumes between stocks. For example, Microsoft might have a high volume day on the same day as IBM. Obviously trade volumes cannot be less than zero and are positively skewed. If I were just looking at liquid stocks like IBM and Microsoft, it would not be so difficult. I would do something like a log transform then fit a multivariate skewed $t$ distribution. The problem is that for small-cap/illiquid stocks, often there will be days that have zero volume traded. And you can't do a log transform on zero. If it were just one stock (univariate) I would look at fitting some kind of mixture distribution where one of the components is a discrete probability of having zero volume. I can kind of see how a mixture distribution can be extended to a multivariate setting, but I've never done something like this before. Is this the right approach? Do you know of any examples/resources I can read on this? Is there a better way?
