Well OP, there isn't a single documented step-by-step guide for 'agile software development' and any procedure that aligns with the manifesto qualifies as agile But I also understand that to get started, there has to be a 'hand-holding'/'by-the book' phase of learning. So I'd recommend that - you take a look at your current development process. Find out the 'waste' activities that sink a lot of time and pick up an agile practice that counters/minimizes the time spent in that activity. e.g. if you're routinely fighting build issues, set up a continous integration server first and set up a stringent check-in pre-screening. Instead of changing everything such that everyone feel lost and alienated, pick up one practice at a time Invest about 2-3 weeks with it..get comfortable with it check if everyone in the team feels that it is helpful. If yes, stick with it, make it part of your new process. Else discard and find and replace with another alternative remedy. In case your entire team is new to agile, I'd recommend (in order of intensity) Practices of an Agile Developer (Andy Hunt, Venkat S., thin book, high value-to-page ratio for newbies) Agile Principles Practices and Patterns (Robert & Micah Martin) Conduct weekly 'Getting Better' sessions for select practices like TDD (beck, astels, et.all), Refactoring (Fowler, Joshua K.), etc that are bound to have huge payoffs. a month or so in.. go for the philosophical books like XP Embrace Change - Beck, Lean Books by Poppendieck, Agile S/w Development - Alistair Cockburn, Peopleware - DeMarco, Lister I'd recommend taking a look at the books listed here
