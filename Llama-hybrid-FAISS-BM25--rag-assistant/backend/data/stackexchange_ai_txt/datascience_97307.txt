Why can a neural network solve XOR if it is not a continuous function?

My understanding is that a typical neural network without any fancy activation functions can only solve problems that can be modelled as a continuous function. If this is the case, why can a standard neural network (1 hidden layer) solve xor? I'm not looking for a solution to xor here but an explanation as to why this is possible with a non-continuous function. Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.
