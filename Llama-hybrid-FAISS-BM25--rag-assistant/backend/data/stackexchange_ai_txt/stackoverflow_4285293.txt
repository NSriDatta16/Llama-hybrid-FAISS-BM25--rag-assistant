You cannot do this by simply using HTML+CSS. You have several options: Use a simple HTML form that submits data to the server and save the notes to a database (you can use PHP and MySQL for this). Form submission can happen through AJAX. This seems to be the right way to me. Use Javascript and save the notes in a cookie (this way you do not tie it to a user but a browser, I don't recommend this) Use benhowdle89's solution, you need Javascript for that too, and HTML5 local storage support is not in every browser right now (still, notes will be tied to the browser, so if I visit your site from a different computer/browser, I won't be able to access them). UPDATE: If you don't want to store notes at all, and only want it for printing, you could check out contenteditable . No need for Javascript here. See: http://html5demos.com/contenteditable
