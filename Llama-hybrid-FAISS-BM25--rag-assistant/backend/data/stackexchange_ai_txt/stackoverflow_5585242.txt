Generating html code for drag and drop

I want to provide an user of my application with a drag and drop feature. Say I have a div container where the user can drag and drop images present within the div to anywhere within the div. Something similar to http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag/demo/basic . But what I need is after the drag and drop has been completed, I want to extract the html code of the container div, so that I can store it and show it to the user at a later point of time, or use it elsewhere for some other purpose. There are a lot of jquery plugins for drag and drop, but I couldnt find any to generate the html code for the dragged elements. What could be the most straightforward way of doing it? Thanks in advance.
