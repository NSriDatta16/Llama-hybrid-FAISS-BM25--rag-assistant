timevarying effects in regression vs state space models

Consider the following regression model: $z_t = \alpha + trend_t + seasonality_t + \epsilon$ $\alpha \sim HalfNormal(1)$ , $trend_t = \mu t$ where as $\mu \sim Normal(0, 1)$ $seasonality_t = \sum_k^K [\nu_k S_k(t) + \lambda_k C_k(t)]$ $\nu_k \sim Normal(0, 1), \lambda_k \sim Normal(0, 1)$ where as $S_k(t) = sin(\frac{2\pi kt}{7})$ and $C_k(t) = cos(\frac{2\pi kt}{7})$ That can be estimated with MCMC sampling which also allows us to incorporate nonlinear parameters if we want to. Why would one want to use a state space formulation of an process instead of adding time-varying effects like above in a model? I see some negatives, it makes it much harder to incorporate nonlinear parameters, we need particle filters.. The positive i see is that the parameters are allowed to vary over time, even if they do this in this case aswell they are not stochastically evolving over time, i assume if we would try to do this with the above approach we would have far more parameters.. is this the sole reason?
