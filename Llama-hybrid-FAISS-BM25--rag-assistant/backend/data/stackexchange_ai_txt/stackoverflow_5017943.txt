How to run and debug C++ application in Eclipse that's started with a script?

I'm trying to use Eclipse CDT on Ubuntu for C++ development. I'm working on a large C++ project that leverages Tcl as a scripting language to kick off and control the application. How can I configure Eclipse to launch the application using shell scripts rather than using a C++ "main" application? The shell scripts launch a Tcl application that in turn calls into the C++ application. Also, is it possible to debug a C++ application using Eclipse and gdb that's started via a script? If so, how does one go about doing it?
