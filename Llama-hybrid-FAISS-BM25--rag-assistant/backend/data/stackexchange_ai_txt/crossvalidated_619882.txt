How to forecast from longitudinal (panel) data

How is longitudinal forecasting usually done? I know a bit about longitudinal (panel) data analyses, but I have not yet forecasted from longitudinal data. I tend to think that building several time series forecasting models is a solution: since we have N subjects in longitudinal data, I think I need to build N forecasting models. Each one essentially becomes a time series forecasting model. The problem is, usually, there are too few data measurements to build a performant forecasting model per subject. Moreover, N can be quite large, so creating, updating, maintaining and using N forecasting models is tedious. I am not sure if there is a way to create one forecasting model for all subjects - but I doubt this is effective. Please advise.
