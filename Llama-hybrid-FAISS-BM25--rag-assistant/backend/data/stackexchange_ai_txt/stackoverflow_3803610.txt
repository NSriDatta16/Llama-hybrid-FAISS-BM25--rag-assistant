Entity Framework Code first development Resources and Documentation

I know EF4 is still in development but as a newcomer to the subject, I need a document, tutorial etc. with EF 4 code first approach. All the info is in EF 4 Team Blog but scattered around different posts. A full coverage would be really nice. Any one knows of a such place?
