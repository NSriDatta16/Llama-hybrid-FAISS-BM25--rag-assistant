How to judge, which random effects to include in a mixed model?

I am currently writing my master thesis about the effect of an insecticide (clothianidin) on the microflora of bumblebees. I received the bumblebees from an experiment with a nested study design. 16 fields were paired according to land use of the surroundings etc. In each field 2 boxes were placed, which contained 2 hives (colonies) each. I was trying to determine if the treatment affects the prevalence of certain organisms including ABPV, N.bombi and Snodgrasella as you can see in this data frame: structure(list(treatment = structure(c(2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("Clothianidin", "Control"), class = "factor"), pair = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L), .Label = c("P01", "P02", "P03", "P04", "P05", "P10", "P11", "P12"), class = "factor"), field = structure(c(6L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 12L, 12L, 12L, 12L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 10L, 10L, 10L, 10L, 13L, 13L, 13L, 13L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 16L, 16L, 16L, 16L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 9L, 9L, 9L, 9L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 11L, 11L, 11L, 11L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 14L, 14L, 14L, 14L, 15L, 15L, 15L, 15L), .Label = c("VR02", "VR03", "VR04", "VR05", "VR06", "VR07", "VR09", "VR12", "VR13", "VR14", "VR16", "VR17", "VR18", "VR20", "VR21", "VR23"), class = "factor"), box.nested = c(12, 11, 12, 11, 23, 24, 23, 24, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 20, 20, 19, 19, 25, 26, 25, 26, 14, 14, 13, 13, 31, 31, 32, 32, 16, 15, 15, 16, 18, 17, 17, 18, 6, 5, 5, 6, 21, 22, 22, 21, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 9, 10, 10, 28, 27, 28, 27, 29, 30, 30, 29), hive.nested = c(24L, 21L, 23L, 22L, 46L, 48L, 45L, 47L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 3L, 8L, 5L, 6L, 7L, 40L, 39L, 38L, 37L, 49L, 52L, 50L, 51L, 27L, 28L, 26L, 25L, 62L, 61L, 64L, 63L, 31L, 29L, 30L, 32L, 36L, 34L, 33L, 35L, 12L, 9L, 10L, 11L, 41L, 43L, 44L, 42L, 15L, 16L, 13L, 14L, 17L, 18L, 20L, 19L, 55L, 54L, 56L, 53L, 58L, 59L, 60L, 57L), ABPV.detected = structure(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), .Dim = c(64L, 1L), .Dimnames = list(NULL, "ABPV.detected")), N.bombi.detected = structure(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), .Dim = c(64L, 1L), .Dimnames = list(NULL, "N.bombi.detected")), Snodgrasella.detected = structure(c(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), .Dim = c(64L, 1L), .Dimnames = list(NULL, "Snodgrasella.detected"))), .Names = c("treatment", "pair", "field", "box.nested", "hive.nested", "ABPV.detected", "N.bombi.detected", "Snodgrasella.detected"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -64L)) I was trying estimate the treatment effect with a model that included pair, field, box and hive as (nested) random effects: library(lme4) ABPV.prev The models of ABPV and N. bombi failed to converge, because I have so many zeros. ABPV was only found in one pair and N. bombi was only found in 2 pairs. Warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.100788 (tol = 0.001, component 2) The p-values of the models did indicate significant treatment effects, but I guess it's pair or field effects that cause the variation... In another forum I read that it can be tested whether the failure to converge represents a real problem using this function.. relgrad ... and it does as the p-value is rather large p=0.1 (for ABPV). I removed some of the random effects and it works and it works e.g. when I remove both hive.nested and box.nested from the model, though increasing the AIC (why?). I also tried to include pair as a fixed effect: library(lme4) ABPV.prev but it produced an error: Error: (maxstephalfit) PIRLS step-halvings failed to reduce deviance in pwrssUpdate My questions are How do I judge which random effects to include and which not? How do I test if it is a pair (or field effect) not a treatment effect that causes the variation? N.B. In the Snodgrasella model it makes absolutely no difference if I exclude, any or all of the random effects. Why is that? Hope you can help me, thanks!
