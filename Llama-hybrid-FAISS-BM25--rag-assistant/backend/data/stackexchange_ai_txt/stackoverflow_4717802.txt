Yes Yes. Either way, when the using block is exited (either by successful completion or by error) it is closed. Although I think it would be better to organize like this because it's a lot easier to see what is going to happen, even for the new maintenance programmer who will support it later: using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) { int employeeID = findEmployeeID(); try { connection.Open(); SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("UpdateEmployeeTable", connection); command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; command.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@EmployeeID", employeeID)); command.CommandTimeout = 5; command.ExecuteNonQuery(); } catch (Exception) { /*Handle error*/ } }
