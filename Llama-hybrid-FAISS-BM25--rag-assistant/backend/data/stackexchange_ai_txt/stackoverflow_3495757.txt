In general, the term "Undefined reference" from a compiler (actually the linker) means that some code fragment is accessing a symbol that the linker could not find. Common causes of these errors: Source file containing the definition is not included in the build process. A source fragment (code lines) were not removed. A header file (class declaration) declares the given method or symbol (which was not removed or needs to be implemented). Incorrect or missing scope resolution operator ( namespace issue). Build process using wrong version of source files (e.g. file not checked into CMS.). Most cases of these errors are not about the C++ reference operator nor dereferencing pointers. Solutions: Code review by independent eye(s). Code inspection tools: Cppcheck, Valgrind, Klocwork, etc. Make fewer changes, compiler more often. Use Test Driven Development . ;-)
