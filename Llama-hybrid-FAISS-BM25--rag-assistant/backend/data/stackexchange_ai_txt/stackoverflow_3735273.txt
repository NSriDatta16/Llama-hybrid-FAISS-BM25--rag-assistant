Unhide cursor in Cocoa screensaver

I’m developing a Mac OS X screensaver that uses WebView. WebView loads flash with a map. I want to let a user move the map and resize it (flash map has appropriate controls). I’ve redefine mouseMoved: method so the screensaver does not exit on mouse move. But the mouse cursor is still hidden. It’s visible only on mouse drag. I’ve tried [NSCursor unhide] but it does not work. How can I unhide it? Thanks in advance.
