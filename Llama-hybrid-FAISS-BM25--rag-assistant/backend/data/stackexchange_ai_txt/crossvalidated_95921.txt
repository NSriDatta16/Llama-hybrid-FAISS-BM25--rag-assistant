Well, no seasonality is not a mathematical tool. However, it can be expressed using mathematical tools. Different data can have different seasonalities, depending on the flow of the data. Seasonality can be an inherent component of the data you are analyzing. Seasonality, if it is part of your data should be included in your model in order to make accurate forecasts. Time series might have a trend component, a seasonal component or both. For instance a model that represents a seasonal event of period 12 (every 12 months) with peaks in June and lows in January and no trend might be modeled as X(t) = s(t) + Y(t) with t being time, Y(t) random noise, s(t) being the periodic function that represents the seasonal component with period 12. Where s(t) could be modeled by Fourier functions. You can look into any introductory book on time series to learn more on forecasting, but let me suggest some good books that use R, which in my opinion makes it easier to understand and learn by doing. For a quick intro check out A Little Book of R for Time Series , it's free! For a more in depth understanding (and somewhat expensive) you can look into one of these: Introductory Time Series with R. Paul Cowpertwait and Andrew Metcalfe Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R. Jonathan Cryer and Kung-Sik Chan Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples. Robert Shumway and David Stoffer
