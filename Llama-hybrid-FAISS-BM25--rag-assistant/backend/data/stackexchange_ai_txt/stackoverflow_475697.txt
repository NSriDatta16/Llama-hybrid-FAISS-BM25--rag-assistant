You need to test a realistic number of iterations as you will get different answers depending on how you test the timing. If you only perform an operation once, it could be misleading to take the average of many iterations. If you want to know the time it takes after the JVM has warmed up you might run many (e.g. 10,000) iterations which are not included in the timings. I also suggest you use System.nanoTime() as it's much more accurate. If your test time is around 10 micro-seconds or less, you don't want to call this too often or it can change your result. (e.g. If I am testing for say 5 seconds and I want to know when this is up I only get the nanoTime every 1000 iterations, if I know an iteration is very quick)
