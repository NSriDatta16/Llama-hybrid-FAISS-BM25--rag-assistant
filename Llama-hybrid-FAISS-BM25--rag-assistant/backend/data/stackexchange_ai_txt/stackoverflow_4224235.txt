I had an issue where hot code replacement itself was not working. We did some changes like making sure that the "build automatically" was checked and unchecking the - "abort build when an build path error occurs". But in my case, HCR itself was not working. I wasnt getting the message as you mentioned. More details are in this link. https://sites.google.com/site/javaerrorsandsolutions/home/hot-code-replacement
