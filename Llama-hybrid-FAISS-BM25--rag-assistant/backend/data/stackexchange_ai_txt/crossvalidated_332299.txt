I think PCA can be viewed in different ways. And we also can think it has no assumptions. It is just a function to map data from high dimensional space to low dimensional while satisfy some properties. (of course, if the data is non-linear, the mapping will not be good.) Therefore, it is perfectly OK to perform PCA on a non-linear data set. And we do not need to verify the linear relationship. After the PCA, check if the results are desirable. Here is an example on non-linear data with PCA transformation, although the answer says it is a bad model, but it may satisfy certain use cases. How to understand "nonlinear" as in "nonlinear dimensionality reduction"?
