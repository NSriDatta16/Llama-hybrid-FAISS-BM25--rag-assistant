you could websockets in conjuction with "flash" websockets because almost all browser have flash on board(average around 96%? => http://www.statowl.com/flash.php ) => https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js . You could use this together with http://code.google.com/p/phpwebsocket/ . Still I am wondering if the performance is going to be any good. If it all possible I would use node.js to do reverse ajax. http://socket.io is a really cool project to do this!
