Logistic regression model manipulation

I would like to understand what the following code is doing. The person who wrote the code no longer works here and it is almost completely undocumented. I was asked to investigate it by someone who thinks " it's a bayesian logistic regression model " bglm I can see that it fits a logistic model, takes the transpose of the Cholseky factorisation of the estimated covariance matrix, post-multiplies this by a vector of draws from $N(0,1)$ and is then added to the model estimates. This is then premultiplied by the design matrix, the inverse logit of this is taken, compared with a vector of draws from $U(0,1)$ and the resulting binary vector returned. But what does all this mean statistically ?
