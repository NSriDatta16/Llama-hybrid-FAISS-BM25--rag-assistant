Computational time of a (fairly complex) GAM with ARMA structure in brms

I am fitting a model for time-series analysis of Wikipedia views with STAN through the brms package. I came up with a pretty good distributional model, which nevertheless requires some 1st order ARMA adjustment, as observations exhibit a slight first-order autocorrelation in time. The model is not the easiest one: it contains two splines for modeling the year and the month effect over the response variable, plus it accounts for a linear change in time of the zero inflation and the shape parameters. The code below is the one I am using on a DELL M4800, running 6 MCMC chains on 6 different cores. > mod The model without the autocorrelation structure works well, although fitting is a bit time-consuming. However, fitting the model with the ARMA structure takes far too much time: after about a week it wasnâ€™t over yet. I would like to ask you: if such of a long timespan for model fitting is normal if there is some gross misspecification that I did not notice in the code if there is something I could do to improve the speed of model fitting. I imagine that some sort of improvement might be obtained by specifying priors, but I have no idea on how this can be done in a nonlinear setting (any documentation would be appreciated). Alternatively, I might run it on a server with a high number of cores: is there a way to split up chains (e.g.4) on a high number of cores (e.g. 20).
