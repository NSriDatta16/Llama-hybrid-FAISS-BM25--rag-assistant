What is the correct model for this experiment design?

I have to analyse the results of an experiment, say, a dependent variable Y, in relation to the different treatments applied. However, I am not sure about the model to use with this experimental design. There are 40 plots of land, organized as 4 rows * 8 columns 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 It seems similar (but different) to split plot experimental designs. Actually, The land is divided into two whole plots => 2 different levels (of the whole plot factor ?) are applied (e.g. levels A1 and A2 from factor A). Edit (2014/10/15): levels of factor A are controlled levels of fertility. I don't know if this information changes anything, as I am not interested in assessing the effect of A over Y. I though maybe A can be considered a blocking factor (some kind of controlled fertility gradient) ? _____A1_____ | _____A2_____ 01 02 03 04 05 | 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 | 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 | 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 | 36 37 38 39 40 Whole plot factor is crossed with a blocking factor B (with 4 levels B1 .. B4) _____A1_____ | ______A2____ 01 02 03 04 05 | 06 07 08 09 10 |B1 --------------------- ---------------------- 11 12 13 14 15 | 16 17 18 19 20 |B2 --------------------- ---------------------- 21 22 23 24 25 | 26 27 28 29 30 |B3 --------------------- ---------------------- 31 32 33 34 35 | 36 37 38 39 40 |B4 The factor of interest, to finish, is factor C with 5 independent levels C1 .. C5. Each of the 5 plots in each combination of A and B is randomly assigned to one of the 5 levels of factor C. ______A1_____ | ______A2_____ C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 | C4 C1 C3 C2 C5 |B1 ----------------------- ------------------------ C5 C1 C4 C3 C2 | C5 C2 C1 C3 C4 |B2 ----------------------- ------------------------ C4 C3 C1 C2 C5 | C1 C3 C2 C4 C5 |B3 ----------------------- ------------------------ C2 C3 C5 C4 C1 | C3 C4 C5 C1 C2 |B4 THIS is the real experimental design that I have problems understanding. As I said earlier, a measure yi of a dependent variable Y is associated with each i=1 .. 40 plot. My question is : How to compare Y among levels of factor C ? Thanks for your kind help.
