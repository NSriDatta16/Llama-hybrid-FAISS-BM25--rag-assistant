You can customize your filename by embedding a formatted [datetime]::now in the file name in PowerShell like so: xcopy /W /Y ACTIVE.DB "ACTIVE.DB.BACKUP.$([datetime]::now.ToString('yyyy-MM-dd'))" If the line feels busy and unmaintainable, you can refactor it to multiple lines: $now = [datetime]::now.ToString('yyyy-MM-dd') xcopy /W /Y ACTIVE.DB "ACTIVE.DB.BACKUP.$now" To get double-click execution, I usually make a batch file that runs the PowerShell command as described here: Set up PowerShell Script for Automatic Execution
