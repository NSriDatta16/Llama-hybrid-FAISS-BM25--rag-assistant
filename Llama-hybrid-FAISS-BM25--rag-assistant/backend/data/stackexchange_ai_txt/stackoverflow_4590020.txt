I think that logically grouping related data together under one key is best, it couples the relevant data with a common parent, it also gives you more wiggle room with regards to key names, so you could have $_SESSION['user']->id opposed to $_SESSION['user_id'] , allows you to have property name context , so you don't have to provide the context in the key name as you would with a user_* key I also think that there is a bigger concept that comes into play here, when you use user_* you are pretty much saying that anything with the key name user_* will be associated with a user. This is not a good way to organize objects IMO. However, when you use a user key and stick all of the associated data underneath it so to speak, then you have a much cleaner top level and a real nested data hierarchy as opposed to a linear one.
