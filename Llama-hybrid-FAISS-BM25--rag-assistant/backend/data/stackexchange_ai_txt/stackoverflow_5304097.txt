db4o Impedance Mismatch

I've built a nice repository layer around a db4o database to store Product objects, which relate to Manufacturer objects in a one-to-many relationship, i.e.: public class Manufacturer { public string Name { get; set; } } public class Product // simplified { public string Name { get; set; } Manufacturer Manufacturer { get; set; } } So far I really like db4o. The problem I have is preventing data duplication without resorting to IDs. When implementing references like manufacturers using SQL Server, my data models would contain a unique ID field, and in turn my Product class would be dirtied up with a ManufacturerID . I imagined that using an object database like db4o would reduce the impedance mismatch between a relational DB and objects, but without IDs, there is no way to tell one object from another when editing it. Is there an elegant way to share a manufacturer between products without duplicating data? Or should I just use a relational DB?
