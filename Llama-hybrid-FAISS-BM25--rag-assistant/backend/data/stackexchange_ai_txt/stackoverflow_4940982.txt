Why does setting autocomplete="on" via a user script still not allow storing of passwords in Chrome?

My goal is to use a Greasemonkey-style user script in Google Chrome to enable remembering of passwords on a specific form that has the autocomplete="off" attribute set. Chrome's developer tools indicate that autocomplete="on" is being successfully set by the script, but this does not have the expected effect of allowing the storage of passwords on the form. Why doesn't this work? Example Chrome offers to remember passwords entered on this test page (Expected): Chrome does not offer to remember passwords entered on this test page (Expected): Chrome's Inspect Element tool reveals a successful modification of the above test page by the user script (Expected): Chrome still does not offer to remember passwords after this modification (Unexpected).
