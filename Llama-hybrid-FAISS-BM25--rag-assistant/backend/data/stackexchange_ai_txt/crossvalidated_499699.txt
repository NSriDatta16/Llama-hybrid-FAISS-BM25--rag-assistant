I would like to know just from the time series if this time series is stationary and how I can calculate the expected value The "just from the time series" is not working. You need to have some idea about the underlying process that generates the time series. For instance, the image below shows a time series that is seemingly trend stationary for $t but differs for $t>0$ . To know whether a time series is stationary requires not just the data, but also some assumptions about a theory for the process that generates the time series. Then you can test whether The data fulfills the properties for stationarity (e.g. use some test to find out whether the process has a unit roots or not) Estimate other parameters of the model (for which there are many different approaches and it depends on your type of time series) Predict future values (extrapolate the model along with estimates of the parameters). Even when the data is not stationary you can still fit a model to it. But it has some problems for some of the fitting methods.
