Unsure about ANOVA usecase/design

I am working on a project where 8 subjects ran with 2 different shoes at 3 different speeds. The way the different shoes at different speeds influence certain gait parameters is being observed (not individual variability). So i wanted to go for a two-way ANOVA. The issue i run into is that if i throw lets say the peak vertical ground reaction force values of all the steps of all subjects with shoe 1 / speed 1 into one pool wouldnt that violate the assumption of independance? Since one step might influence the next; steps from the same subject are likely not independent. What would your take on this be? Can i just look at the steps as independant events or not? The other possibility would be to use a subjects average values over the steps for a certain parameter, but with 8 subjects that would have me end up at 8 datapoints.
