"MVVM doesn't allow code behind and so event handling." Whoops! There's the issue. MVVM discourages code behind, it's true, but only when something can be done reasonably via Xaml. "Thou shalt not code-behind" has never been said by anyone with a clue. Sometimes handling an event is the simplest, best way to accomplish your goal. When that's the situation, embrace it, solve your problem, and move on. Sometimes it isn't even possible to accomplish your goal in XAML. In those cases, throw the view-logic in the view's code-behind and move on. It's far more important to maintain the architectural goals of MVVM (separation of concerns between layers) than it is to strictly abide by rules-of-thumb (such as avoiding code-behind.) If that distinction isn't made, you're missing the forest for the trees.
