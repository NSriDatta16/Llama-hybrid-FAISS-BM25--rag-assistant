Parametric Surface Reconstruction from Contours with Quick Rescaling

I'm looking to construct a 3-D surface of a part of the brain based on 2-D contours from cross-sectional slices from multiple angles. Once I get this shape, I want to "fit" it to another set of contours via rescaling. I'm aspiring to do this in the context of an MCMC analysis (So as to be able to make inferences, so it would be very nice if I could easily compute the volume of the rescaled surface, and the minimum distance between a given point of the distance. (Accurate approximations are fine). What would be a good image reconstruction algorithm that allows for volume and distance to be quickly calculated?
