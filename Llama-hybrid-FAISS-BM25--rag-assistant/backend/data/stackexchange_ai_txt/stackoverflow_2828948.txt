For your particular purpose, a ServiceAccount shall be added to AD; If you ASP.NET application is for a LAN in your organization, you could simply forget about providing Username and Password and only provide the root domain. This way, Active directory will search for Windows authenticated user instead of using impersonnation (this assumes that the user accessing your application has the rights to perform the tasks provided by your application). What exactly does your application need to do? If your application manages user accounts, groups and OU, then you need to use impersonnation only if the user doing these tasks through the application has no rights of managing the AD with her/his regular user account. This, should not happen. So, event for this, if the user has the proper rights, omitting your credentials will only allow AD to search for the current logged on user.
