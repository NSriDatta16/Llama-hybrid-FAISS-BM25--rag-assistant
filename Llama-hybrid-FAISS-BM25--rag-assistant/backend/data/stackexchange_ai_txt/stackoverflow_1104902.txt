Is there a tool for monitoring and annotating SVN checkins?

Is there a tool (preferably web-based) that allows one to monitor an SVN repository (or rather, a subdirectory) to see all checkins and add notes to each one? The ability to filter and format checking messages would be an added bonus. Background: In my current project, we'd like to have a log with verbose and informative data about each checkin to certain modules that are widely used. Unfortunately, it is not organizationally feasible to have a customized pre-commit hook, and so people frequently forget or are too lazy to write good checkin comments. Since checkin comments can't be changed later (right??), this would be the workaround.
