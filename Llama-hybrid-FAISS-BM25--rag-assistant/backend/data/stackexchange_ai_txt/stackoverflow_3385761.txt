SQLite - Is it possible to make a non-integer Primary Key work?

Thanks for reading and hopefully answering, Due to legacy issues and company policy, I am working with SQLite 2.8.17 and have a few varchars as primary keys. But when I run a "pragma integrity_check" , it reports "rowid missing from index" and "wrong # of entries in index" on the tables with the varchar primary key but the returned result is an OK. Extended Constant DB access and usage (about a day of load testing) seems to result in a DB failure ( integrity check returns FAIL) and the only explanation (via .explain ) is the same errors as earlier ( "rowid missing from index" and "wrong # of entries in index" ). Can anyone help? Is there something wrong that I am doing? Thanks.
