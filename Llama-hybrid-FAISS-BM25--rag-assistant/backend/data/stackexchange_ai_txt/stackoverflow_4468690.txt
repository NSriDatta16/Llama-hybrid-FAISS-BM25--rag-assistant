My guess is that you're trying to compile GLSL code using a regular C compiler. It looks like it's supposed to be C code, but it is actually GLSL source - deisgned to be compiled by the OpenGL GLSL compiler, not your machine C compiler. The fragment shader has a pre-defined variable 'gl_Color' which is the output from the vertex shader. The sample you reference has the code inside a shader.frag file, which is referenced by shader.init(). The OpenGL library itself will handle compiling it into GPU instructions for your machine. Put the code in that file, and hopefully the example will work :)
