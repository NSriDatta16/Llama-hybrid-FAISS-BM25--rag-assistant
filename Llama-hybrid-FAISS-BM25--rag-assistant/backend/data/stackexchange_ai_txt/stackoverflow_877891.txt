It's really impossible to know whether or not you have enough tests based simply on whether you have a test for every method and feature. Typically I will combine testing with coverage analysis to ensure that all of my code paths are exercised in my unit tests. Even this is not really enough, but it can be a guide to where you may have introduced code that isn't exercised by your tests. This should be an indication that more tests need to be written or, if you're doing TDD, you need to slow down and be more disciplined. :-) Tests should cover both good and bad paths, especially in unit tests. Your acceptance tests may be more or less concerned with the bad path behavior but should at least address common errors that may be made. Depending on how complete your stories are, the acceptance tests may or may not be adequate. Often there is a many-to-one relationship between acceptance tests and stories. If you only have one automated acceptance test for every story, you probably don't have enough unless you have different stories for alternate paths.
