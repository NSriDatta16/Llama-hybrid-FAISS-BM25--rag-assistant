You are likely to hit practical limits before you hit technical ones. That is, message lengths may have technical limits in the lengths that can be expressed in an int or long, but that's unlikely to be the first constraint you hit. Message lengths up in the Megabytes tend to be heavyweight. Think in terms of a few K as the sort of ballpark you want to be in. A technique used sometimes is to send small messages saying "Item 123435 has been updated", consumers then go retrieve data associated with Item 12345 from a database or other storage mechanism. Hence each client can get only the data they need, we don't spray large chunks of data around when subscribers may not need it all.
