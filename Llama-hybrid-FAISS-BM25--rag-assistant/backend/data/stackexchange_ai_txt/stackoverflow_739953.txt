What about .Net Coverage Validator? It works with all version of .Net and works with both 32 bit and 64 bit versions. http://www.softwareverify.com/dotNet/coverage/index.html A managed implementation of a code profiler is not possible (same for Java as well) as then the profiler would instrument itself. Thus all .Net/Java profilers are native unmanaged code written in whatever language you want (although typically C or C++).
