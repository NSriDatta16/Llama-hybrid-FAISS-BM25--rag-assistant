Is it necessary to convert mixed type features to YoY percent change in order to coordinate with target variable

Let's say I'm trying to build a time series model with the following dataset: import pandas as pd import numpy as np np.random.seed(2021) dates = pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-01', freq='MS') df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=(24, 4)), index=dates, columns=['A_values', 'B_values', 'C_values', 'target']) df Out: A_values B_values C_values target 2020-01-01 0.211957 0.466739 -0.722106 -0.374654 2020-02-01 0.994487 -0.743675 -0.642014 0.505851 2020-03-01 0.324321 0.568620 -0.806211 -0.882857 ...... 2021-10-01 0.940398 -0.168986 -0.339022 0.933428 2021-11-01 0.651798 -0.389200 0.646556 0.113821 2021-12-01 0.437002 0.759874 -0.007980 0.024173 Suppose I will use A_values (which is actual values of a variable), B_values (which is month over month percent change of a variable), C_values (which is year over year percent change of a variable) to forecast target column (which is year over year percent change of one variable). Now my question is should I convert A_values and B_values to year over year percent change to coordinate with the target column's type? If I don't do that, will it lower the prediction accuracy? In other words, could the machine learning algorithm such as XGBoost capture the relationship between MoM pct change and YoY pct change? Note: it's easy to convert the actual value to YoY pct change, meanwhile we lose accuracy as converting from MoM to YoY.
