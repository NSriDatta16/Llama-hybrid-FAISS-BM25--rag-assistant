Is there any method to figure out if a random variable has a sine oscillation pattern?

I have a random variable and wondering if there's a mathematical test to see if it has an oscillation pattern like a sine wave. Data is a time series collected every day and follows a random walk. Presumably, there's no pattern as autocorrelation shows no correlation between different lags. Is it possible to run a test and get the probability of this variable having a sine pattern and what would be the base value for that?
