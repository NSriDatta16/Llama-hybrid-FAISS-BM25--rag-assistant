How would I go about building a model for item selection?

I have 8000 items. They've each been rated on a scale from 1-7. I have ~40 non-mutually exclusive dichotomous properties for each item. I build a regression model with those 40 as predictors of the ratings. My goal is to find the predictors that are most predictive of ratings, and then based on those, choose the 10 items that should be rated highest and lowest. I've tried stepwise regression, LASSO, random forests and best subsets regression. Is there any approach out there that would be better?
