I will try to answer some of your questions by quoting them. How do I train: the answer is usually Stochastic Gradient Descent. Of course that contains many things (such as your objective function, or the regularization method(s)) and parameters to play with. what do I train: you are right, you train the filters. maybe also the biases. .. and others say that you should train the activation function well, for convolutional layers, the activation function itself is a convolution with the filter, so when you train the filters, you train the function. at the very end of the network why not update all? the ones at the end are usually fully-connected layers, so that part is more similar to a simple neural network. so updating the filters correctly is also important. How do I know when I am finished training you can supply a validation data (that is not used in the training) and after each epoch you can feed this data to your network to get the classification (or whatever your final layer is doing) performance to see if (and how quickly) the validation error/objective is decreasing. Usually after some point it will stagnate or start to draw zig-zags around a certain level. That's when you know it's time to stop :) hope it helps.
