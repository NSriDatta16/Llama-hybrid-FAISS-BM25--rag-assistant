Apple distribution certificate upload

I've created a private and public key using keychain as explained in the development portal. However, whenever trying to upload the certificate to get a distribution certificate in the portal at https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/certificates/team/createDistribute.action and pressing "submit" the Safari browser crashes. I tried to upload it also in Chrome, but it never gets to the next pages, and always reloads the submit page. I'm confused... please advise... PS: I had the same problem submitting a developer certificate. I managed to work around it by using XCode's Organizer tool this is great, but unfortunately it doesn't work for submitting a distribution certificate.
