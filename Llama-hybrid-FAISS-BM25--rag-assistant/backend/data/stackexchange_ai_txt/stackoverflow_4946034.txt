Multiple Magento Email Forms & Templates

I need to set up multiple email forms on my magento website. I'm including the forms onto CMS pages. They are: Arrange a site survey catalogue request And the default contact form But you can only select one email template in the admin (system > configuration > contacts). I've got my email templates and included my forms into the CMS pages so I just need them to work.
