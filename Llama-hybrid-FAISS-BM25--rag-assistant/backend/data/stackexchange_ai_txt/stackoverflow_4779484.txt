Voice calling from websites, user responding

I'm working on a system which needs to do the following: (from linux) * Call a user by phone * Tell the user some action is required * Give the user a choice and allow him to select based on his choice: * Then based on the entry, run a command ex: "Your attention is required because something is wrong. To implement solution Alpha, press 1. To implement solution Beta, press 2" (user press 1): "Ok, solution Alpha is now in effect" Of course this needs to be done from a website. I am sure there are services which do this, what are some? Thanks
