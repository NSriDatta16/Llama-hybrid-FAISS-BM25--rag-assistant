If you could provide an example dataset would be good. If I understand your question correctly, you have the mean value, standard deviation and maximum value for every minute and want to find an optimal way to interpolate to second data using this information? Do you need to include the information on standard deviation you have? If not, you can use a simple interpolation, such as with Scipy . Let's assume this is your original data set and the resulting averaged data: then interpolating using only the mean values will result in this looking at it on the original data The code for this is below. If you provide more information on what kind of data you have and what you want to use it for, a more specific answer is possible. FIGSIZE=(10,4) import matplotlib.pylab as plt import seaborn as sns sns.set_style("whitegrid") plt.close('all') import numpy as np import scipy.signal #Create an example dataset T = 100 #Period t = np.arange(1200) y = np.sin(t/T) + 0.4*np.random.rand(len(t)) plt.figure(figsize=FIGSIZE) plt.plot(t,y, lw=1, label='Original Data') plt.xlabel('Time') #Average data MINS = int(np.max(t)/60) tm=np.zeros(MINS); ym=np.zeros(MINS); ysd=np.zeros(MINS); ymax=np.zeros(MINS) for ii in range(MINS): st = ii*60 et = (ii+1)*60 tempy = y[(t>st) & (t
