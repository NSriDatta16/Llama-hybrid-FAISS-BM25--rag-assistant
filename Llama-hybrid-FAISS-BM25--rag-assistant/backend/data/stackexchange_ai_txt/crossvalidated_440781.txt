Binomial response and logit link function in GLM (r)

First I'm a little bit confused with the assumptions of a model with binomial response and logit link function. Since it is basically a logistic regression. Today one of my professors told me that I had to prove normality of my residuals, but of what I know the assumptions are: First, binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary and ordinal logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be ordinal. Second, logistic regression requires the observations to be independent of each other. In other words, the observations should not come from repeated measurements or matched data. Third, logistic regression requires there to be little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables. This means that the independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other. Also these are the plots I have: So basically my question is: what assumptions can I prove/not prove with these plots?
