This post bases on personal experiences which might be specific to my data, so I'm not sure it qualifies as an answer. I suggest to use simulations if possible to assess which method works best for your data. I did this and was surprised to find that tests (regarding parameters in the first level) based on multilevel modelling were outperforming any other method (power-wise), while retaining size even in small samples with few and unevenly sized "clusters". I am yet to find a paper that makes that point, and from how I see this is not really a niche topic and deserves more attention. I think it is fairly under-researched how different methods compare vis-a-vis finite-sample or few/uneven clusters.
