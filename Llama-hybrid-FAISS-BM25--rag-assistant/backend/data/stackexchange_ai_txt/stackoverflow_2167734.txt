there is only one way to effectively diagnose repainting problems - remote debugging. Get a 2nd PC. Install MSVSMON on it. Add a post build step or utility project that copies your build products to the remote PC. Now you should be able to place breakpoints in WM_PAINT handlers, WM_SIZE handlers and so on and actually trace through your dialog code as it performs the size and redraw. If you download symbols from the MS symbol servers you will be able to see full call stacks. Some well placed breakpoints - in your WM_PAINT, WM_ERAGEBKGND handlers and you should have a good idea of why your window is being synchronously repainted early during the WM_SIZE cycle. There are a LOT of windows in the system that consist of a parent window with layered child controls - explorer windows are massivly complicated with listviews, treeviews preview panels etc. Explorer does not have a flicker problem on resizing, so It is celarly possible to get flicker free resizing of parent windows :- what you need to do is catch the repaints, figure out what caused them, and, well, ensure that the cause is removed.
