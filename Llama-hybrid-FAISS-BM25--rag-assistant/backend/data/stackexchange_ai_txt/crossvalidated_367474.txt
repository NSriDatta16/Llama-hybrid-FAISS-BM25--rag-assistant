TL;DR - I'm not aware of specific names being given to different estimators of sample medians. Methods to estimate sample statistics from some data are rather fussy and different resources give different definitions. In Hogg, McKean and Craig's Introduction to Mathematical Statistics , the authors provide a definition of medians of random samples , but only in the case that there are an odd number of samples! The authors write Certain functions of the order statistics are important statistics themselves... if $n$ is odd, $Y_{(n+1)/2}$ ... is called the median of the random sample. The authors provide no guidance on what to do if you have an even number of samples. (Note that $Y_i$ is the $i$ th smallest datum.) But this seems unnecessarily restrictive; I would prefer to be able to define a median of a random sample for even or odd $n$ . Moreover, I would like the median to be unique. Given these two requirements, I have to make some decisions about how to best find a unique sample median. Both Algorithm A and Algorithm B satisfy these requirements. Imposing additional requirements could eliminate either or both from consideration. Algorithm B has the property that half the data fall above the value, and half the data fall below the value. In light of the definition of the median of a random variable , this seems nice. Whether or not a particular estimator breaks unit tests is a property of the unit tests -- unit tests written against a specific estimator won't necessarily hold when you substitute another estimator. In the ideal case, the unit tests were chosen because they reflect the critical needs of your organization, not because of a doctrinaire argument over definitions.
