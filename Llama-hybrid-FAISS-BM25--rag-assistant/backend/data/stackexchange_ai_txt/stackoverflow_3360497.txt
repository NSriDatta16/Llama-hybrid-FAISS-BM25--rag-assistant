Yes - certainly it is possible for an exception itself to raise an exception. However, most (not all) of the framework exceptions are pretty lightweight things with very little internal logic, so the average exception probably doesn't have a lot of scope to generate exceptions itself. Is this a framework exception you are seeing this behaviour with? Can you give us some details? A quick look at the internals of the exception with a tool like Reflector may well help you spot what, if anything, is going on.
