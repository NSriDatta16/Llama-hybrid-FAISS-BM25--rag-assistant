For the sake of completing awareness of "common link lists that are out there", the Qt library defines its own QLinkedList as part of its container classes (QMap, QString, etc.) They support both standard iterators, as well as Java-Style Iterators , which have an easy-to-use syntax: QLinkedList list; list i(list); while (i.hasNext()) qDebug() Update: I posted this answer originally in 2009, to bring attention to the Qt class. In the post-C++11 world, with things like range-based for , you can generally get even better syntax than the Java-Style iterators...without sacrificing performance to do so. So while this was probably worth bringing up for completeness when I posted, today I'd not be likely to mention it. Unless you have some strange reason not to, just use the standard library's singly linked list ( std::forward_list ) or doubly linked list ( std::list ).
