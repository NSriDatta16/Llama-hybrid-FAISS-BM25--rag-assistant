Read some article about in memory Database. @ Randolph Potter idea is an option - you can get the list of tables from the server, and then iterate on the list and load all the tables. I guess you can do that same about FK and relations. you can probably do it automatically using the designer - using drag and drop from the server explorer to a dataset (VS2008), and with a little code load the entire thing into memory.
