Are you sure your dependent variable is as factor? I think the error is because your dependent variable is not a factor. Try str(data96), or summary(data96) to see if trade962a has levels and how many levels. If not, then, just set as a factor. For example: data96$trade962a.f = as.factor(data96$trade962a) Finally, if you wanna run a logistic regression, you should use 'model="logit"', not "mlogit". Mlogit is for multinomial logit. Thus, if your variable is binary, using mlogit may cause the cited error. If so, just use model="logit". If none of the above solve your problem, try to plot your dependent variable to see if the data is all right. regards, Manoel
