You could use an insert trigger . However you should not have a copy of the gender in two different tables - it breaks normalization, requires more storage space and risks that the two copies will get out of sync. Instead you should use a foreign key and join the tables when you need information from both. You can use the username as the foreign key, or the autoincrement id, if you have one.
