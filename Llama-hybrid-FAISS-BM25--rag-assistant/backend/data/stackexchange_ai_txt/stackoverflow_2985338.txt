I was having your problem, and this is how I fixed it. The following steps are a working way to add a library. I had done the first two steps right, but I hadn't done the last one by dragging the ".jar" file direct from the file system into the "lib" folder on my eclipse project. Additionally, I had to remove the previous version of the library from both the build path and the "lib" folder. Step 1 - Add .jar to build path Step 2 - Associate sources and javadocs (optional) Step 3 - Actually drag .jar file into "lib" folder (not optional)
