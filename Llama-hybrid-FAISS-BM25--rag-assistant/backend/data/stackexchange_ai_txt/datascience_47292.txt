If all objects are observed in the same distance and almost same angle, the relative height and width can be helpful features for recognizing objects with similar shape and different size. By this features different methods like GAN algorithms such as CoGAN and BiGAN may help you in this problem. It should be noticed that for recognizing the size of the objects the features play more important role than the algorithms.
