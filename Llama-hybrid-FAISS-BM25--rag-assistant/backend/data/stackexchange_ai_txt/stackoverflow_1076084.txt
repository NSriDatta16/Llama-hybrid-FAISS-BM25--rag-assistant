I hope this does the job. // GetAnonymousCollection() is hard to define... ;) var anonymous = GetAnonymousCollection(); IEnumerable result = anonymous .GroupBy(a => a.AgencyID) .Select(ag => new Agency() { AgencyID = ag.Key, AgencyName = ag.First().AgencyName, Rules = ag .GroupBy(agr => agr.AudiRuleID) .Select(agrg => new AuditRule() { AuditRuleID = agrg.Key, AuditRuleName = agrg.First().AuditRuleName, AvgDaysWorked = (Int32)agrg.Average(agrgr => agrgr.DaysWorked) }) }); By the way, think about using a decimal or float for the average time.
