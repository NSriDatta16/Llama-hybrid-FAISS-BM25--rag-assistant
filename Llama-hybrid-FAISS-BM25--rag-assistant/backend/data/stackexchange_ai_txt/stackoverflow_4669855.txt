It's never been a particularly quick dialog, there's a ton of info buried in it, but a minute is outrageous. The symbol server settings does not affect this dialog, that can't be it. Do watch out for using the Add option, maybe used in a previous project with an exception type that was defined in an assembly that's not there anymore. Maybe on a network share, long delays like that are almost always network timeouts. Get better insight in what's cranking away during this minute with SysInterals' ProcMon utility.
