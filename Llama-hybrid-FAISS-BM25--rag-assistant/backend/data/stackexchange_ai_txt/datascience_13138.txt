What is the difference between word-based and char-based text generation RNNs?

While reading about text generation with Recurrent Neural Networks I noticed that some examples were implemented to generate text word by word and others character by character without actually stating why. So, what is the difference between RNN models that predict text per-word basis and the ones that predict text per-char basis? Do word-based RNN require a bigger corpus size? Do char-based RNN generalize better? Maybe the only difference is input representation (one-hot encoding, word embeddings)? Which ones to choose for text generation?
