Multi-label classification with neural networks: Are correlations between class labels taken into account?

I am solving multi-label classification problem (assigning each image 1 to N labels) and want to use neural network (like in this post). Does this approach take correlations between class labels into account? Or are the predictions for individual labels completely independent (like in the binary relevance approach)?
