Basic Django - Custom Managers

I'm going through the Django book and I'm currently on chapter 10 . I'm having a problem understanding the third line in this fragment of code: class DahlBookManager(models.Manager): def get_query_set(self): return super(DahlBookManager, self).get_query_set().filter(author='Roald Dahl') I understand that this custom manager instance is overriding the superclass' get_query_set method, but why is the super call passing in both DahlBookManager as well as self ? Aren't self and DahlBookManager the same thing?
