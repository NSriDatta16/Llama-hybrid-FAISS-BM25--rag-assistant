Making wxPython GUI launch on a different screen from Eclipse

I currently have a dual-monitor setup with Eclipse on monitor 2. When I run the code that launches the wxPython GUI, I would like for this GUI to appear on monitor 1. Currently, the GUI consistently appears on monitor 2, covering Eclipse, and I have to drag it to monitor 1 every time. Is there a solution to this problem -- either a configuration change I can make in Eclipse or some addition I can make to the GUI code?
