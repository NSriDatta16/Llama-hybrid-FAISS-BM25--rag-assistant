Windows Forms: Highlight destination node in TreeView during Drag&Drop

I created Drag&Drop mechanism for my TreeView. I added DragEnter, DragDrop and ItemDrag methods and everything works fine. But when you are doing D&D with standard Windows controls, destination node is highlighted. Image is worth 1000 words, video probably even more: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlltSiihHPo I mean such highlight effect like you can see in this video on Recycle Bin.
