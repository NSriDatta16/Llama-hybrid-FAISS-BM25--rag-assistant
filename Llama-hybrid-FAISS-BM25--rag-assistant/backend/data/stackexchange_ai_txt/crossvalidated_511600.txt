Here's the Bayesian solution I ended up using for a mixed discrete distribution. I believe this method is called the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. My original question was more general, but hopefully this will be helpful to someone. The discrete probability density at a position $k$ in the mixed distribution $f$ given that it is made up of a mix of discrete density functions $p_i$ , is given by $$P(f_k) = \sum_i P(f_k|p_i)P(p_i),\tag{1}\label{eq1}$$ where $P(p_i) = w_i$ (the mixture weight from the original question). Baye's theorem can be stated as $$P(f_k|p_i)w_i = P(p_i|f_k)P(f_k).\tag{2}\label{eq2}$$ From here we'd like to exclude the term $(p_i|f_k)$ and set up an iterative procedure to solve for $w_i$ . Similar to equation 1 $$w_i = \sum_k P(p_i|f_k)P(f_k),\tag{3}\label{eq3},$$ therefore, substituting equation 2 into 3, we get $$w_i = \sum_k \frac{P(f_k|p_i)P(f_k)w_i}{P(f_k)}\tag{4}\label{eq4}.$$ Then, substituting equation 1 into 4, we get $$w_i = \sum_k \frac{P(f_k|p_i)P(f_k)w_i}{\sum_j P(f_k|p_j)P(p_j)}\tag{5}\label{eq5}.$$ Given that the desired solution ( $w_i$ ) appears on both sides of the equation we can set up an iterative process to estimate $w_i$ so that equation 5 becomes $$w_{r+1,i} = w_{r,i} \sum_k \frac{P(f_k|p_i)P(f_k)}{\sum_j P(f_k|p_j)w_{r,j}}\tag{6}\label{eq6},$$ $$r=\{0,1,..\}.$$ In my particular case I could directly measure $P(f_k|p_i)$ for each $p_i$ (the component distributions were known) so equation 6 was my solution.
