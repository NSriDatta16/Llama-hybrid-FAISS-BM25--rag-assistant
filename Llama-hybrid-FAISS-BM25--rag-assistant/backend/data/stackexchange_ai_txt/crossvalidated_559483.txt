OK, so this should be fairly straight forward. Since the outcome (has trait, does not have trait) is a binary variable, you can use logistic regression with the ancestry variable as a predictor. Because you have a fixed sample size, a better approach is to calculate power but rather to calculate what effects can be reasonable estimated with a specific statistical power. The formula for this is $$ \pm \beta_{j}^{a}=\frac{z_{1-\alpha / 2}+z_{\gamma}}{\sigma_{x_{j}} \sqrt{n p(1-p)\left(1-\rho_{j}^{2}\right)}}$$ Here: $\beta$ is the log odds ratio for the ancestry variable $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the $1-\alpha/2$ quantile of a standard normal. If you use a standard false positive rate of $\alpha=0.05$ then $z_{1-\alpha/2} = 1.96$ $z_\gamma$ is the $\gamma$ quantile of a standard normal, where $\gamma$ is the desired statistical power. If you use a standard power of $\gamma=0.8$ then $z_\gamma = 0.84$ . $\sigma_{x}$ is the standard deviation of the ancestry predictor. $n$ is the sample size $p$ is the marginal probability of the outcome (the sample mean of the outcome ignoring the ancestry variable). $1-\rho^2$ is the variance inflation factor, but since you only have a single predictor you can ignore this. This formula will tell you the log odds ratio you can detect at a given power with your sample.
