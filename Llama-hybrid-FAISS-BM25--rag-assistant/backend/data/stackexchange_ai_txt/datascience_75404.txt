What are some good loss functions used to minimize extreme errors in regression and time series forecasting?

E.g. In detriment of a smaller mean error, I want to have fewer big mistakes I'm working on a time series forecasting task and in some specific cases I don't need perfect accuracy, but the network cannot by any mean miss by a lot. Any suggestions of loss functions or other methods to solve this issue?
