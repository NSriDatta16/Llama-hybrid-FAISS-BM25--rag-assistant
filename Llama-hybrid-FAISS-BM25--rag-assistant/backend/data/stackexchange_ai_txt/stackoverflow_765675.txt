Open ID is a start towards providing an "authentication" solution. (To the best of my knowledge, it has no "provisioning" mechanism, though. You have to trust the external authority to identify an account, then add your site's / app's version of that account using your own devices) If anybody knows of some kind of open "authorization" solution to centralize the management of roles, that would be interesting as well. That sounds like the sort of thing you would do in-house, though, with roles that have a defined meaning in your organization. I'm sure IBM or Oracle would be happy to take a big chunk of change and make something for you, though :-)
