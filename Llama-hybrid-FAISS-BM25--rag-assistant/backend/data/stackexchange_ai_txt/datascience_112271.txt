How do machine learning applications communicate with one another?

My understanding is that if a company creates a machine learning application, they use an API to ensure that applications talk to one another, which is what I found in my initial research ( https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api ). However, is this correct - is there an inner working within the machine learning application that enable two algorithms to connect? And how does this work in practice?
