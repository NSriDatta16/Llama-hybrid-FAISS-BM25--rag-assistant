JQuery sortable, dragging between two lists, cancelling the drop: How to animate?

I have two HTML lists, and am using JQuery sortable to drag between them. This works perfectly. The receive event is raised upon dropping a dragged list item into the second list. In this event handler, in some circumstances I am calling $(ui.sender).sortable('cancel'); which cancels the drop and returns the list item to its original position in the first list. My question is, how can I animate the movement of the list item back to its original position? At the moment the item snaps straight back. Thanks!
