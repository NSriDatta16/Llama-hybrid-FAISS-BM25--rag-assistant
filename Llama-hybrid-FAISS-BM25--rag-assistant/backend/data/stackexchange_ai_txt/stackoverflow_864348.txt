Note that the answer selected is a good one, but I'm looking into doing something similar so I worked overtime on it :) I've put this into an example. Given HTML: Question 1 Answer 1 Answer 1 Answer 1 Question 2 Answer 2 Answer 2 Answer 2 Question 3 Answer 3 Answer 3 Answer 3 Do the following and you'll get your answer. I think it's now the most elegant of all the solutions given, but I would value others input on this quite a bit. jQuery.fn.nextUntilMatch = function(selector) { var result = []; for(var n=this.next();(n.length && (n.filter(selector).length == 0));n=n.next()) result.push(n[0]); return $(result); } $(function() { $('h2~p').hide(); $('h2').click(function() { $(this).nextUntilMatch(':not(p)').toggle(); }) });
