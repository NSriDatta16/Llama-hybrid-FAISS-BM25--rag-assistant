Efficient Estimator from Insufficient Statistic

Suppose that I have a statistic $T(X)$ , and I know for sure that it is not sufficient to estimate a parameter $\theta$ . Is it still possible to have an estimator $\hat\theta(T(X))$ that is efficient (under convex loss), or is there a theorem (something like a reverse Rao-Blackwell) that says this is impossible? You may answer the question under the efficiency definition of attaining CRLB for unbiased estimators or mean squared error averaged over the real line, or if it will help some other performance measure that is more amenable towards answering the question.
