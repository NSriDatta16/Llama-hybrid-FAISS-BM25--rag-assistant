Sending html data via $post fails

I am using the code below which is fine but when I use the code below that in an attempt to send an html fragment to a processing page to save it as a file but I get nothing. I have tried using ajax with processData set to false ads dataTypes of html, text and xml but nothing works. I can't find anything on this so I guess I must be missing something fairly trivial but I've been at it for 3 hours now. This works $.post("SaveFile.aspx", {f: "test4.htm", c: "This is a test"}, function(data){ alert(data); }, "text"); This fails $.post("SaveFile.aspx", {f: "test4.htm", c: " This is a test "}, function(data){ alert(data); }, "text");
