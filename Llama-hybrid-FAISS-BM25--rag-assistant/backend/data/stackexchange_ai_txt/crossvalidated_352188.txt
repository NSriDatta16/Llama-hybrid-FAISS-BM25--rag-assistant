STL decomposition - independence of components

Let's suppose we have 3 vectors $U_1$, $U_2$ and $U_3$ we construct another vector $V=U_1+U_2+U_3$. If $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ and independent, we can expect that $VAR(V)=\sum_{i=1}^3 VAR(U_i)$, right? Now let's look at a more practical example involving time series. We can decompose time series into trend, seasonality and error using STL , so in this case, we can say that the variables $U_i$, are the components extracted via STL decomposition and the $V$ variable represents the original series. Consider the following example in R: set.seed(123) x Can we then conclude that the components (trend, seasonality and errors) are not independent? If so, then why? In the above example, the value is pretty close to 1, but I have seen instances where this value is approximately 0.7, but I'm afraid I cannot share this data.
