High-dimensional dependent binary explanatory variable

I am dealing with a data set containing roughly $n=4000$ binary observations $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ with $p=1000$ binary explanatory variables. I suspect that a lot of these explanatory variables are not relevant to the prediction of the observations. Moreover, it is clear that there are certain groups of explanatory variables that are very highly correlated. What are the usual approaches to deal with these kinds of situation. Indeed, quick simulations show that classical logistic regression and SVM do not work too well. Is there any method that can tackle the identification of these groups of highly correlated binary variables at the same time that the model is fitted to the data. I am looking something in the spirit of the LASSO that can do variable selection and model fitting at the same time.
