What you have written suggests that logistic regression, with attention to diagnostics and residuals, will be your best bet. It can help you take into account nonlinearity in the relationship between predictor and outcome You'll want to test multiplicative effects (interactions), as the thresholds you talk about may be joint thresholds involving multiple predictors. I am concerned, though, by your statement that "The vast majority of observations are not considered harmful and will be discarded from our analysis." In order to explain what causes the events of interest, it is absolutely necessary to know something about the conditions that do not produce it, just as it is to know about the ones that do.
