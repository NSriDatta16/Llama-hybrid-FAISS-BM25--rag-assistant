"probability of a probability": confusion with categorical and real-value random variables

I think I'm having a "probability of a probability" issue but I don't know how to resolve it: Let's say a variable $l_0$ can take values ${A,B,C}$. I have $N$ training samples $i$ from two different populations ($d \in \{0,1\}$) with probability profiles $$p(l_i = A \mid d_i)=a,~p(l_i=B \mid d_i)=b,~p(l_i=C \mid d_i)=c=1-a-b.$$ Until now, I was averaging these probabilities to get $$ p(l_0 = A \mid d_i) = 1/N \sum_i p(l_i=A \mid d_i) $$ and the same for $B,C$. So basically, I only consider the mean probabilities in the training data instead of the entire distribution, which I think might be more appropriate. Now let's consider a different scenario where we only have one category $A$: if $v_{0} = p(l_0 = A)$ is not really considered a probability anymore, but some score, we can assume $v_0$ is normally distributed with $\mu, \sigma$ learned from the training data: $$ p(v_0 \mid d_i) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{d_i}, \sigma_{d_i}) $$ My question is, how can I combine these two scenarios? Ideally I would want my categorical variables to follow a sort of gaussian distribution, but at the same time I would need all my categorical probabilities to sum to 1.
