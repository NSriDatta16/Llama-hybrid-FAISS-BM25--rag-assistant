Custom loss function for XGBoost

I am looking for code to implement a custom loss function instead of just classification error, or cross entropy for gradient boosted classification trees. We are trying to model regime detection in financial markets based on economic indicators. The intended loss function is that if the model outputs a probability of each class of risk as p_low , p_medium , and p_high , then the loss function we are looking for is ( p_low * Returns(portfolio_low_risk) + p_medium * Returns(portfolio_medium_risk) + p_high * Returns(portfolio_high_risk) ) We already have a data frame of Returns(portfolio_i_risk).
