Yes, the two should be equal, although this is dependent on exactly what you mean by a "diffuse prior". If it is truly a prior that does not affect the posterior density, then the posterior distribution is exactly equal to the likelihood function. Therefore, maximizing the likelihood function is equivalent to maximizing posterior distribution. On the other hand, if you just mean a prior that is very diffuse, i.e. $\mu \sim N(0, \sigma = 10,000)$, the maximum likelihood function is not exactly equal to the posterior distribution, and so the MAP will not be exactly equal to the MLE. So even if the diffuse prior is meant in the first sense, the corresponding CI's are still not necessarily equivalent, although this is mostly due to approximations typically used by each method. Often times, MLE-based confidence intervals are based on a quadratic approximation of the log-likelihood function (i.e. the fact the parameter estimates typically approach a normal distribution in large samples). But in the Bayesian world, credible intervals are typically done with MCMC integration of the full posterior distribution rather than quadratic approximations. In smaller samples, this may well make a difference that favors the direct integration techniques rather than the quadratic approximation. In large samples, this difference should be quite small. Not really beyond what was mentioned in 2.
