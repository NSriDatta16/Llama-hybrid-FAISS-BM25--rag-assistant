I agree that OCUnit is a great xUnit tool. Integration with Xcode is solid, and it works well with OCMock. It's also hard to overstate the value of Apple being committed to the code â€” there is certainly room for improvement, but it's solid and still maintained. Xcode also integrates pretty nicely with gcov , a GNU tool for instrumenting code coverage.

(Just ask @bbum about CoreData unit tests...)
