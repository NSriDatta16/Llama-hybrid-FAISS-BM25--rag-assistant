DRY: Advices how to not duplicate code?

Ok here come my question, I have a database with such scheme +-------------+ +------------+ +-----------+ + Object + + car + + computer + +-------------+ +------------+ +-----------+ + id + + object_id + + object_id + + some_col + + max_speed + + CPU_speed + + type + + n_gears + + memory + +-------------+ +------------+ +-----------+ So to summarize when my user input a computer for example, I create a object record, save all shared fields into it and I create a computer record with all specific data for computers being saved. So far so good, here comes my problem by doing so I would have to duplicate every action (and controller methods view for each type of objects). So right now in my Controller, I have those actions: + new-car + new-computer + show-car + show-computer + edit-car + edit-computer + list-car + list-computer So for each type I basically duplicate all the code and change few lines of codes (i.e replacing the car mapper by computer mapper, same for record object). I have to mention the application you the zend framework and is in PHP. I would like to do something more "Don't repeat yourself" and not having to duplicate all the code. Any idea how to it more elegantly?
