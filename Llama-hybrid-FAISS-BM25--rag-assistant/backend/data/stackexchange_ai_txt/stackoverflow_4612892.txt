How to copy access Database file, mdb from program files to Isolated Storage in c#

I am building an IE Addon or Extension using C#. I have created an Access Database MDB file which will be in the Program files. Now at runtime I need to copy this MDB file to Isolated Storage so that I can use it further. As I can't access AppData if Protected Mode is ON in IE. I have seen few code samples which enables me to write files in Isolated Storage, but here I need to copy my database file MDB in Isolated Storage. Please come up with some code. Awaiting your response. Thanks
