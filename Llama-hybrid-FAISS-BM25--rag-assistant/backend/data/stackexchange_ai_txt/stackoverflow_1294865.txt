So really, it's a matter of giving a stack input and then taking out information from that stack as if it were a que. I dont think that you need to pop ALL of the integers off of the stack. Are you allowed to use any other methods for the stack? I mean, based on x86, you can always obtain elements on a stack based on their address. In this sense, you can always get the first element on the que by retrieving the 'first-in' data member which will always be at the first index of the array within the stack data structure (as represented in your prototype). So - since the stack is LIFO and the que is FIFO, use that to your advantage since the que data structure is dependent on the stack data structure. If you can, include a method that allows the retrieval of the first element on 'top' of the stack (which would be the element @ index 0). Make sure that this is ok with your professor first though.
