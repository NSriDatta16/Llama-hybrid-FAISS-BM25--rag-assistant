Magento - Registration on Checkout page and then pay via PayPal

I have issue, after checkout on "checkout/onepage/success" get a user info using "order id", something like: $orderInfo = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->load($lastOrderId); $customerId = $orderInfo->getCustomerId(); Order from user that registrated on Checkout page and then pay via PayPal become a "guest order", and ofcourse in "Model('sales/order')" customer id is null, and in DB this transaction and order looks like a "Guest order" that was made by PayPal account, not from Magento's. Another payment systems working fine with registration on Checkout page, and after checkout I can get customer id. The question is, how to get a "user id" from just registrated users in Magento site throught Checkout page and bought something via PayPal?
