When using overflow hidden - how to center an inner image?

on my homepage I display images in a 100px tall DIV. The images are all over 100px+ so I use a div with the CSS property of overflow:hidden to easily trim off the extra pixels. But the images don't look so good. Is there a way for me the center them vertically? This would make the "trim off" be the same for top and bottom. http://billetagent.eweb703.discountasp.net/Arrangementer.aspx thanks!
