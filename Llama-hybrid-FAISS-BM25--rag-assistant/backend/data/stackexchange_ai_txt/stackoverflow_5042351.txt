Why is my OpenMP implementation slower than a single threaded implementation?

I am learning about OpenMP concurrency, and tried my hand at some existing code I have. In this code, I tried to make all the for loops parallel. However, this seems to make the program MUCH slower, at least 10x slower, or even more than the single threaded version. Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/zyLzuWU2 I also used pthreads, which turns out to be faster than the single threaded version. Now the question is, what am I doing wrong in my OpenMP implementation that is causing this slowdown? Thanks! edit: the single threaded version is just the one without all the #pragmas
