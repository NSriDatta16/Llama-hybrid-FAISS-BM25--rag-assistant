magento - quick search returns all products

After upgrading from 1.4 to 1.5 the quick search returns all products. The advanced search works just fine. I've cleared the cache and re-indexed everything but still nothing. Any ideas why? The search also doesn't apply the minimum query length set in the admin (ie, I can enter nothing and still be shown everything). Switching between LIKE or FULLTEXT search seems to do nothing. I've seen this Magento Search returns All Products but all my plugins are up to date (and I don't have any search plugins).
