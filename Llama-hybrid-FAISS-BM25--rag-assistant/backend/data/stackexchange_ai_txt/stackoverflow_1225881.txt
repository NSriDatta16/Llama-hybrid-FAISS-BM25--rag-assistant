This is because when you bind an event it only binds it to the elements that are in the DOM at that time. So if you add new ones later on they won't be bound to the event you previously attached. Assuming you have jQuery 1.3, it has a built-in function to get around this called live . With it, you can bind an event to all current and future elements. It doesn't support all events, but click it does support. So keeping that in mind, you just have to replace this: $('.link').bind('click', function(e) { With this: $('a.link').live('click', function(e) { (I added the a. to the selector because it is much more efficient to specify the tag if at all possible) If you don't have jQuery 1.3, you should upgrade as soon as possible. If you can't, check out the livequery plugin which achieves the same thing but in a much less elegant way. Alternatively, you can simply have a function to bind the action and call it everytime you load new data in. All things considered, however, jQuery's live is the best way to do this.
