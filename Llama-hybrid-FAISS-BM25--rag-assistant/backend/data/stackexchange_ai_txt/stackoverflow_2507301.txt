Use BeautifulSoup to extract sibling nodes between two nodes

I've got a document like this: I don't want this I want this and all that stuff too But not this and nothing after it I want to extract everything between the p[class=top] and p[class=end] paragraphs. Is there a nice way I can do this with BeautifulSoup?
