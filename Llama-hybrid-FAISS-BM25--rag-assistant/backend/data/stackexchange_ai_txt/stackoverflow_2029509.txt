How to model concurrency in unit tests?

I'm pretty new to unit testing and currently experimenting a bit with Visual Studio's testing tools. My question is how to define assertions about concurrent behaviour in these tests. E.g. given a class BoundedChan implementing a bounded channel, how can I specify tests like " channel.Send will not block" or "If the channel's capacity is exceeded, channel.Send will block until a value is read" Is there an elegant solution to write these assertions?
