Sorting the list and then doing a linear search seems the simplest solution. Depending on the expected composition of the lists you could use a less general purpose sorting algorithm, and if you implement the sort yourself you could keep track of data during the sort that could be used to speed up (or eliminate entirely) the search step. I do not think there is any particularly elegant solution to this problem
