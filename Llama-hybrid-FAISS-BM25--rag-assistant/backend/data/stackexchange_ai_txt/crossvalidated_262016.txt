Normal distribution prior and posterior

Consider a razor company that is testing a new men's facial razor before releasing it for sale. They want it to have a certain performance rating (out of 100) before releasing it. Based on previous trials, the company has an approximately normal $N(70, 49)$ prior distribution of the razor's true performance rating. Now, the company is running a trial that they consider error-prone and will measure the razor's true performance (i.e. the rating from this trial can be modeled as approximately normal $N(x, 25)$. If this trial results in a rating of 85, what is the probability that the razor's true performance rates above 80? I'm not quite sure how to begin with this problem. I think I need to use Bayesian inference and the formula for normal probability densities, but I don't know how to proceed. I think the $x$ in $N(x,25)$ is throwing me off the most––am I supposed to use 85 for that or should I just leave it as $x$ when I'm solving the problem? Any tips would be much appreciated.
