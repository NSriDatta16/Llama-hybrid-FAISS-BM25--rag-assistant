File Can be accessed fwhile running jnlp but cannot be accessed through browser in java web start

I'm trying to access a resource file which is in a jar file deployed in apache web server . The file can be accessed through the jnlp file in the deployed folder while but it is not available through the web start while trying to access from a browser. The code used to access the file using the uri is something like below : File helpFile = new File("/myFile.doc"); myFile is in the application jar deployed in the server.
