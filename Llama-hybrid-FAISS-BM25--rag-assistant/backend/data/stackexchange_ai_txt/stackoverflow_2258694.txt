Here's the scoop: if you're an MSDN Premium subscriber, you may upgrade your account with a special plan that gives you a whole bunch of free resources. See link for details. msdn premium info . I signed up a few weeks ago, and aside from the intimidating form where you must enter your credit card info (in case you exceed the generous compute and storage limits), it's easy to set up, and completely free. I blogged about this as well.
