Do you have to implement it yourself or can you use a library? OpenCv is a huge C library of algorithms in computer vision including edge detection: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/image_processing.html?highlight=canny#cvCanny . If you are doing it for educational purposes, I suggest considering the purchase of a good text on computer vision. Almost any introductory text will discuss filtering with the Gaussian (and the well documented 1d trick) as well as canny edge detection and non-maximum suppression.
