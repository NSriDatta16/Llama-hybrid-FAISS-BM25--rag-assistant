Simulating a logistic regression in R

I'm trying to simulate data for a logistic regression experiment to predict $50$ students pass/fail outcome on a math course from their GRE quant. scores. GRE quant. is known to be normally distributed with a $\mu$ of $153$ and $\sigma =9$ . However, my logistic function results in Inf , I'm wondering how to fix this problem? n = 50 # number of students x = rnorm(n, 153, 9) # GRE Quant. scores of students B0 = 150 # Average GRE Quant. score of test takers B1 = 5 # Capable of increasing prob. of passing math course p = exp(B0 + B1*x)/(1+exp(B0 + B1*x)) # logistic function ????? The problem is HERE y = rbinom(n, 1, p) # pass/fail outcome
