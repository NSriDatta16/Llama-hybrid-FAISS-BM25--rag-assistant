(OLS) Two-way interaction significant but turns marginally significant using robust standard errors

I'm using American National Election Studies'(N=4,219) time series (Sept 2016-Jan 2017) data. I tested a theoretically supported interaction in a fully specified OLS model, which proved to be significantly positive (t=2.12; p=0.034). To correct for heteroskedasticity, I ran the model a second time using robust standard errors. This time, the predicted interaction was only 'marginally' significant (t=1.84; p=0.065). I'm not sure how to go about interpreting this when writing up the results. Should I report the average marginal effects or just conclude that the interaction was insignificant (or 'marginally significant')?
