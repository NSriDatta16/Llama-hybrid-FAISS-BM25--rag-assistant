UDK "Error, Unrecognized member 'FocalPoint' in class ..."

I'm porting a UT3 game to UDK . It uses a large code library and I'm getting this compiler error: C:\UDK\UDK-2010-03\Development\Src\FixIt\Classes\ZController_FireWeapon.uc(129) : Error, Unrecognized member 'FocalPoint' in class 'ZController' ZController extends UTBot. This is the referenced line: Agent.FocalPoint = ObjectOfAttention.Location; (Agent is of type ZController) What happened to FocalPoint?
