Create drag-able panels in Flex like its in netvibes.com

I want to create a news application for my website. My question is how should i create drag-able panels/canvas inside another panel/canvas. What i exactly intend to do can be seen on netvibes.com . The website has different panels of every news group, and this panel could be moved from one place to other, but in a well defined manner. And the other panel take over the place of dragged panel. Is there any component in flex, which can help me make something like that. If i was unable to make my question clear, plz let me know, i will try to make it more clear. Regards Zeeshan
