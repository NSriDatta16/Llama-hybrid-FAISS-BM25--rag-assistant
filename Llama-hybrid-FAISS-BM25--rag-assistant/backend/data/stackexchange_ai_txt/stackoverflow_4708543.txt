I was to post the same question, I've been searching for the same issue since yesterday. UPDATE: I just figured out a way, and I'm not sure if it is the right one. Knowing that I have a MKAnnotation subclass called selectedAnnotation, I simply deselected, then selected that object after I got the new title in the revereseGeocoder:didFindPlacemark function: [mapView deselectAnnotation:selectedAnnotation animated:NO]; [mapView selectAnnotation:selectedAnnotation animated:NO]; for your case your code should look like this : - (void)reverseGeocoder:(MKReverseGeocoder *)geocoder didFindPlacemark:(MKPlacemark *)placemark { NSString *newSubtitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@, %@ %@, %@",placemark.subThoroughfare,placemark.thoroughfare,placemark.postalCode,placemark.locality, placemark.country]; Grocery *draggableGrocery = [myMapView.annotations objectAtIndex:0]; draggableGrocery.address = newSubtitle; self.addressNewGrocery = newSubtitle; // add the following lines [I assumed that draggableGrocery [Grocery class] is a subclass of MKAnnotation] [mapView deselectAnnotation:draggableGrocery animated:NO]; [mapView selectAnnotation:draggableGrocery animated:NO]; }
