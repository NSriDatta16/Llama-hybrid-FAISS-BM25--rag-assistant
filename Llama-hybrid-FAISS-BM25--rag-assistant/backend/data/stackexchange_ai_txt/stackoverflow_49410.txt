Just using JSP is not enough. You should do soimething like JspFragment body = getJspBody(); StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter(); StringBuffer buff = stringWriter.getBuffer(); buff.append(" "); body.invoke(stringWriter); buff.append(" "); out.println(stringWriter); to get inner tags rendered (example is for SimpleTag doTag method). However, in the question's code I see that inner tag is comming from a string which is not rendered as a part of JSP, but just some random string. I do not think you can force JSP translator to parse it. You can use regexp in your case or try to redesign your code in a way to have a jsp like this: Quote this I whould go with regexp.
