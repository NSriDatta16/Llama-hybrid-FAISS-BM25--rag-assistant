There are several ways to do this: Incrementally populate a database, submit by submit Keep all form fields on every page, but hide ( ) the ones that shouldn't show up (as @Trufa suggests in another answer) Accumulate an object that's persisted implicitly in the session (depends on your server architecture) Accumulate stuff in one or more cookies (seems icky by I list it for completeness) If you wanted to be super-trendy, you could accumulate information in HTML5 client-side storage. Of course that'd rule out older Microsoft browsers.
