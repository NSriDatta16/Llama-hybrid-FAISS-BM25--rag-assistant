How to use PHP for large projects?

The question has been asked: No PHP for large projects? Why not? It's a recurring theme and PHP developers--with some cause--are forced to defend PHP . All of these questions are valid and there have been some responses but this got me thinking. Based on the principle that you can write good code in any language and bad code in any language, I thought it worth asking a positive rather than negative question. Rather than why you can't , I wanted to ask how you can use PHP for large projects. So, how do you write a large, complex, scalable, secure and robust PHP application? EDIT: While I appreciate that the organizational aspects are important, they apply to any large project. What I'm primarily aiming for here is technical guidance and how to deal with common issues of scalability. Using an opcode cache like APC is an obvious starter. Cluster-aware sessions would be another. That's the sort of thing I'm getting at.
