Bonita is one of probably many Business Process tools. Like all such tools there are good and bad things. Yes they allow some business processes to be automated by users by dragging and dropping components, or process steps in some sort of GUI. And like systems, say SAP for example, if you fight precisely in the SAP box it can get you going much faster and easier. I've never met any business that fit "exactly" in the SAP box though, and usually there are years spent customizing it. In my experience, the users usually give up on this after a while and want developers to do this for them when they experience something that doesn't quite do what they thought it would. The developers try it out, become frustrated with the limitations or just get overwhelmed by NIH syndrome, and the tool is soon abandoned. Alternatively, and perhaps more concerning, is when you get the true user enthusiast that quite innocently takes down a production database in the middle of the day trying to look at their data in new ways, but without training wheels. YMMV
