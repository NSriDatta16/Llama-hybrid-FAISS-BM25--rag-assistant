Managing a view while another process runs on iPhone

I am having a bit of a problem here, I am let the user upload some video to the server however I am having some difficulties managing a view that I am using to illustrate its progress, I know why the problem is happening and i found a way around it (sort of) here my problem So if one tries to make some code that looks something like this (in a UIViewController -(void)uploadMovie { UIActivityView indicator=new... [self.view addSubview:indicator] [uploader UploadMyMovie:data] } This code wont work, the uploader will lock the controller and will not allow time for the indicator to come on screen in time, i found waiting for a few seconds before calling the uploader works but i took another approach. The approach was to start a new thread for the uploader and have a protocol in which the uploader object informs the UIViewController (or some delegate) when it starts uploading, its progress, and when it finishes uploading. Something like -(void)uploadMovie { UIActivityView indicator=new... [self.view addSubview:indicator] NSThread *thread=... [thread start] } the delegate methods look something like this #pragma mark UploadProgressDelegate -(void)didStartUploading { progressLabel= [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(93, 240, 116, 32)]; ind= [[UIActivityIndicatorView alloc] initWithActivityIndicatorStyle:UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhiteLarge]; ind.center=self.view.center; [progressLabel setTextColor:[UIColor blackColor]]; [progressLabel setText:@"TEST"]; [self.view addSubview:progressLabel]; [self.view addSubview:ind]; [ind startAnimating]; [self.view bringSubviewToFront:progressLabel]; [ind setHidesWhenStopped:TRUE]; [self.view setUserInteractionEnabled:FALSE]; } -(void)progressUpdate:(NSString*)progress { [progressLabel setText:progress]; } -(void)didEndUploading; { [progressLabel removeFromSuperview]; [ind stopAnimating]; [ind removeFromSuperview]; [progressLabel release]; [ind release]; [self.view setUserInteractionEnabled:TRUE]; } This works great and the indicator shows and everything, then i decided to let the user see the progress by adding a UILabel (reflected in the code above), howeverr for this the solution does not work, the label does not display and ofcourse no updates... I was wondering if anyone has encounter this situation and has come up with a solution for it? or if you can possibly see from the code above why the label isnt showing... Thanks
