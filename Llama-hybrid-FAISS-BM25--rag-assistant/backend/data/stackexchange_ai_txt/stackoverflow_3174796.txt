What are the Steps to Upload a Document File from Windows Application to SQL Server DB?

Here are my steps: Created the controls manually by dragging a textbox then a button besides it which i think its not the right way to do it. Example: Any idea which control should i use? 2.The column's datatype (in sql-server) is varbinary(MAX) which will hold the document file. Is this the correct datatype for holding documents? 3.In my application, i will have a temporary variable which holds the uploaded/picked document which then i pass the document to the db. What datatype should i use for this temporary variable (which will hold a document file of type .pdf). I'm using c# Windows Application. Thanks
