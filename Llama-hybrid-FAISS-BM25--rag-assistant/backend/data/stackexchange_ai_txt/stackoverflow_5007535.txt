If data entered in the form (Frm1) is used in your Menu Activity (M1), then obviously you should use bundles and send it between Activities. Else it may be unwanted logic of working with forms data in Menu Activity. Just imagine, that you will create new wonderful Activity before M1 in your app (dashboard or something similar to it). Now you have to pass your bundle to first activity, because else you will lose form's state, when user close Menu Activity. It's not good, anyway. So, if you can encapsulate this logic in Form Activity, I recommend you to make it. You can use SharedPreferences or Singleton storage. If your form's data is strings, numbers and flags - SharedPreferences is easy, good and safe solution.
