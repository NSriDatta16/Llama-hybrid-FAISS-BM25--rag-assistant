Retry mechanism on WCF operation call when channel in fautled state

I'm trying to find an elegant way to retry an operation when a WCF channel is in faulted state. I've tried using the Policy Injection AB to reconnect and retry the operation when a faulted state exception occurs on first call, but the PolicyInjection.Wrap method doesn't seem to like wrapping the TransparentProxy objects (proxy returned from ChannelFactory.CreateChannel). Is there any other mechanism I could try or how could I try get the PIAB solution working correctly - any links, examples, etc. would be greatly appreciated. Here is the code I was using that was failing: var channelFactory = new ChannelFactory(endpointConfigurationName); var proxy = channelFactory.CreateChannel(...); proxy = PolicyInjection.Wrap (proxy); Thank you.
