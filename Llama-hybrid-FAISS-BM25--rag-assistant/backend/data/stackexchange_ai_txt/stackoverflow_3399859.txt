ReportViewer: two text colors, one cell

Is it possible to have 2 areas of text in one cell such that each can have a different color? You can do this in crystal reports but I cannot see a way to do this in ReportViewer. What it is doing is essentially highlighting an important text fragment if it appears in a cell description to draw the users attention. I am fairly new to reportviewer so it for now I am assuming it's my lack of knowledge that is making this difficult. I am using VS2010. Thanks.
