Cross domain PHP Sessions

I am building a site which allows a user to point a CNAME record at my site to run their "profiles", this allows your OWN domain name to load your profile on my site. This is raising all sorts of issues related to sessions. I have seen virb do it. I don't see any of the information that is session based in an iFrame... but there IS an iFrame present on the page. I can get the domain stuff to work, I just lose session data... Any ideas? (Here is an example --Links to Virb-- http://www.agentspider.com/ )
