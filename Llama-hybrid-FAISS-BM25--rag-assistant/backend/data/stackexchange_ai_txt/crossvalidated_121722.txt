If you want to argue that your Random Forest is generating better predictions than your linear model, then you could just show that (for example) your out-of-sample RMSE is lower for your random forest than for your linear model--it's as simple as that. The primary downside of using a non-linear model instead of a plain-vanilla linear model is that, by and large, as your methods become more sophisticated, your resulting models will become more opaque (i.e. harder to interpret). If your goal is pure prediction then this won't matter. However, if you're trying to do some statistical inference then it's a different story.
