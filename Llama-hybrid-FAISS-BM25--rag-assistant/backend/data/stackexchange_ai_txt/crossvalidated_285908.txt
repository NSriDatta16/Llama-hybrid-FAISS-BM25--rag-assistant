I perhaps will just add a little pragmatism here (yet a view from a student, just keeping things simple) and try to explain using very popular language but formally you should refer to the answer provided by Richard Hardy. For GARCH models we normally need to make certain assumptions on the conditional distribution of standardized returns as mentioned above. The most comfortable (for optimization) is obviously Gaussian (note most comfortable). There are numerous variations of ARCH/GARCH models which utilizing t-distributions (with various degrees of freedom, also skewed t-distr) for standardized returns, moreover from pragmatic financial (risk exposure management) view, which probably just adds uncertainty but supports your question, after GARCH "prefiltering" there is evidence that filtered returns are still heavy-tailed (speaking very simple language are best described by Generalized Pareto Distribution tails) for your reference: McNeil, A. J., & Frey, R. (2000). Estimation of tail-related risk measures for heteroscedastic financial time series: an extreme value approach. Journal of empirical finance, 7(3), 271-300. However, I believe it is quite problematic (if not impossible) to specify (and optimize) a GARCH model with GPD tails, there will be numerous questions (note that extreme value theory has its big portion of criticism already, I am not mentioning GPD domain of attraction here), also what would you use for the body domain of your returns and etc.? So, from my limited practical experience GARCH + Normal distribution works quite well for most of the cases, if necessary you can go for t-distribution GARCH, but it should always depend why do need this, what for? If you want Value at Risk Estimation you can for McNeil & Frey (2000) pseudo-maximum likelihood approach and so on. Hope that helps.
