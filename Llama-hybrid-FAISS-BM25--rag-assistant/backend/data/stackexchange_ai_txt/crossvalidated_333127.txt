You fitted an ARIMA(0,0,1) model, that is, a Moving Average model of order 1: $$ y_t = c+\theta\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_t, $$ where $\epsilon_t$ is iid white noise. The expectation point forecast from such a model is calculated by plugging the last residual into $\epsilon_{t-1}$ for the very first prediction, and after that, we plug the expectations into the noise term. Since $E(\epsilon_t)=0$, this means that the forecast will just be $\hat{y}_t=\hat{c}$ after the first forecast data point. And that is quite fine, since your time series does not exhibit much forecastable pattern at all. It is quite consistent with an MA(1) model. Or alternatively with the flat ARIMA(0,0,0) model (that is, pure white noise) that auto.arima() chooses: library(forecast) foo Note that a flat mean forecast may definitely outperform more complex ARIMA (or other) models . Here are a few earlier questions that may be helpful: R Time Series Analysis forecast result always remains same ARIMA converges to mean
