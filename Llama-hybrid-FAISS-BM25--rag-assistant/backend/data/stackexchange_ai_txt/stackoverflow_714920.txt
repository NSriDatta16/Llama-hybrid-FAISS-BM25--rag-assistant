I think that a 5 times speed improvement is not all that important for me personally. It is not an order of magnitude change. Although if you consume CPU power at the scale of Google it can be a worth while investment to have some of your staff work on it. Many of the speed improvements will likely make it into cpython eventually. Getting rid of the GIL is interesting in principle but will likely reveal lots of problems with modules that are not thread safe once the GIL is removed. I do not think I will use Unladen Swallow any time soon but like how giving attention to performance may improve the regular Python versions.
