What's a more elegant rephrasing of this cropping algorithm? (in Python)

I want to crop a thumbnail image in my Django application, so that I get a quadratic image that shows the center of the image. This is not very hard, I agree. I have already written some code that does exactly this, but somehow it lacks a certain ... elegance. I don't want to play code golf, but there must be a way to express this shorter and more pythonic, I think. x = y = 200 # intended size image = Image.open(filename) width = image.size[0] height = image.size[1] if (width > height): crop_box = ( ((width - height)/2), 0, ((width - height)/2)+height, height ) image = image.crop(crop_box) elif (height > width): crop_box = ( 0, ((height - width)/2), width, ((height - width)/2)+width ) image = image.crop(crop_box) image.thumbnail([x, y], Image.ANTIALIAS) Do you have any ideas, SO? edit: explained x, y
