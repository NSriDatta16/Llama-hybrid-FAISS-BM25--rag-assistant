Eclipse CDT 5.0.1 (Ganymede) slow indexer problem

I am trying to use Ganymede CDT to index our large codebase. It is painfully slow, can take a whole night to index the C++ files. Same project takes only 5 seconds to index with exuberant ctags 5.7. Is there some way to find what the root of the problem is and to speed it up? Maybe turn on logging in CDT, or some obscure option somewhere that I missed?
