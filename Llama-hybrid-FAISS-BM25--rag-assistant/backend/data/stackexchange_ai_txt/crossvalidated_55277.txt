Efficient MCMC using the normal approximation of the posterior

I can usually quickly get the normal approximation of the posterior distribution, but I sometimes struggle with setting up an efficient MCMC of the same model. Can I somehow use the results of the normal approximation to improve the MCMC? (I'm thinking about something along the lines of plugging in the approximate SD into the proposal SD of the MCMC.) I use PyMC's NormApprox and MCMC classes, but I'm interested in suggestions using other frameworks as well.
