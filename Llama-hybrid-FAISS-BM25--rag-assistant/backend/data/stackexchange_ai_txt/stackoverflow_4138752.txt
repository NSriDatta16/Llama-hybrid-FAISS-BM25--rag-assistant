Elegant way to share and alter an array between view controllers

I have two view controllers: LocationsViewController , and SettingsViewController . LocationsViewController conforms to the SettingsViewControllerDelegate protocol. That protocol contains only 1 method: // SettingsViewControllerDelegate.h - (void)settingsViewControllerDidFinish:(SettingsViewController *)controller; When my LocationsViewController receives that delegate messages, it dismisses the SettingsViewController that was presented modally. I think this is good code design so far. The problem is the sharing of data between these view controllers. Both view controllers present the same data: an array of about 10 objects (locations). Only the SettingsViewController allows altering of that array. Right now I have 'solved' this in an inelegant way: both view controllers have a reference to my app delegate, and my app delegate has a locations property. SettingsViewController alters that array directly. For example: // SettingsViewController.m [appDelegate.locations addObject:newLocation]; It works, but I'm not happy with it. I understand it's a bad thing to just let your view controllers keep a reference to the app delegate. Any suggestions?
