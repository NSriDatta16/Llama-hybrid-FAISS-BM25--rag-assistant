As you recognize, the real issue isn't whether to plot the data or the model, as the title puts it: it's that the model doesn't do justice to the data. The data suggest an interaction between the treatment group and the shape of the relation of age to the outcome variable, which your original model didn't allow for. If the GAM doesn't work, you might consider treating age as an ordinal predictor variable and include an interaction with treatment group in a logistic regression. With 237 participants and about half making each outcome choice, you might have enough data for this to work.
