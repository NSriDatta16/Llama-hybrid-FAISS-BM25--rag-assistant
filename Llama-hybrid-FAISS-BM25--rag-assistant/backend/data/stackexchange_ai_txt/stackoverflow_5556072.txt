Devise by default uses the BCrypt algorithm, which AFAIK is not decrypt-able. If you need to be able to decrypt passwords, you need to use a different algorithm such as the AES . There is a gem which extends AES support for Devise. Note: I have answered this question in a purely academic interest. It would be recommended you continue to use BCrypt. I encourage you to exercise severe caution, since managing passwords is risky business.
