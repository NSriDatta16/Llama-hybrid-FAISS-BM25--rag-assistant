Im just shooting in the dark as i have'nt seen your code. if you are detecting swipe through the old touchesBegan: withEvent: touchesMoved:withEvent: approach,this might happen as you are touching the cell. With the new UISwipeGestureRecognizer in iOS 4.0, you could handle the swipe so easily. IMHO.add a member variable to your UITableView subclass as BOOL isDeleteButtonVisible and use UISwipeGestureRecognizer to detect the swipe,then in the make the button visible and set the member variable. In the touchesBegan: withEvent: method,check the button visibility by checking the isDeleteButtonVisible member variable and hide it if it is visible. Im just giving you some hints.
