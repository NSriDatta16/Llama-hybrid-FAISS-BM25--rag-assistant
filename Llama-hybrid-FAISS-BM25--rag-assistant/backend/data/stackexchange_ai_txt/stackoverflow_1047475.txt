INSERT and UPDATE statements only operate on a single table at a time. You have 3 tables that need INSERTs. You can definitely INSERT multiple rows into the table in a single shot, and I think that's good to do whenever possible, but you can't put rows in multiple tables simultaneously. Think of it this way. When you query the data you are pulling records from many sources into a single result set. When you modify the data, you are pulling records from many sources to apply changes to a single result set. Also, I hate to say it but there are some things that don't require a super-elegant solution. Your stored procedure just needs to apply some best practices to ensure all 3 INSERT statements happen as an atomic transaction (all or nothing). The end result may be verbose and uninteresting, but it will be quick, effective, safe, understandable, and maintainable.
