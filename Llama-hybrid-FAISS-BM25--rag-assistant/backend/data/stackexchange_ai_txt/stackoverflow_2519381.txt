String parsing help

I have a string like the following: $string = " apples are red... john is a boy.. this is dummy text...... "; I would like to split this string into an array contanining the text found between the tags. E.g something like this: $string = " apples are red... john is a boy.. this is dummy text...... "; $paragraphs = splitParagraphs($string); /* $paragraphs now contains: $paragraphs[0] = apples are red... $paragraphs[1] = john is a boy... $paragraphs[1] = this is dummy text... */ Any ideas? P.S it should be case insensitive, , , should all be treated the same way. Edit: This is not XML, there are a lot of things here which will break the structure of XML hence I cannot use SimpleXML etc. I need a regular expression which will parse this out.
