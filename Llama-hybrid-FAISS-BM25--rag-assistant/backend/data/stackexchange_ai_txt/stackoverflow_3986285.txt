Reorganizing hunks into commits

I have made a major refactoring of some code, and in the process I have commited several times. This has not been pushed to any public repo yet. Before pushing, I would like now reorganize the commits into logical units. The problem is that I want not only to squash commits but to reorganze the hunks into other commits. Just to make it clear, I have commit A with hunks A1, A2, A3, and commit B with hunks B1, B2, B3. I want to checkout the version previous to A and have new commit C with hunks A1, A2, B2 and a new commit D with hunks B1, B3, A3. Thanks in advance.
