do you have a concept of build agents, I do not know much about Hudson. We are using Anthill Pro at work and we have set up an Ahtill Pro agent. The source code is downloaded to the agent and the agent is responsible to run the maven goal for running the tests. It works pretty well for us as the RC machines are not part of the build environment. the tests are responsible to talk to Selenium HUB and get new sessions and do the testing. I hope this helps.
