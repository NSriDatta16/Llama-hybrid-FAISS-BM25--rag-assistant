I have never meddled with this code myself... but the decorators subversive puts on files in your package explorer (the little '>' for uncommited changes) are provided through the org.eclipse.ui.decorators extension point. So for an example, you'd need to import the org.eclipse.team.svn.ui plugin in your workspace (File > import > plugins and fragments) and look at its plugin.xml to find the decorator that does this work (if I am not mistaken, it is org.eclipse.team.svn.ui.decorator.SVNLightweightDecorator). Good luck on this, team APIs are not the easiest to use ...
