Imputation and Distributions

Suppose you impute a variable using a normal distribution with mean 10 and sd 5. Is it better to draw 1000 random samples from this normal distribution, take the average, and then use this to impute this missing value? Or can I just take one draw from this distribution and use this as the value to impute the missing data?
