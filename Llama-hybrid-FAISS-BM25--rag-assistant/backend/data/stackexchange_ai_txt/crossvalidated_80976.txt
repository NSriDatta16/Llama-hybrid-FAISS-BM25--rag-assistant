What classifier to use after performing PCA?

Which is the most used classifier applied once PCA is performed? I computed PCA on my data, and now I have the points projected on a line, I was wondering what is the preferred classifier. Is a discriminant function for the normal density a good choice? Or is it better to use SVM?
