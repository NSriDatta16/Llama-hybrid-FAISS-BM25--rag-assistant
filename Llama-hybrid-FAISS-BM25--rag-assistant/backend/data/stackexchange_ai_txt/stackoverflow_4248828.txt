How can I mix Forms Authentication and Windows Authentication in MVC 2 in IIS 7.5?

I've seen this posted alot that solves the problem if you are running ASP.Net application not a MVC 2 one in IIS 7.5. Would the same solution work using location in the web.config and 2 seperate login pages like it does for asp.net? Do you need to register a new route to do that? I know it would work with 2 seperate applications in IIS, but i want them all in the same application. Any ideas?
