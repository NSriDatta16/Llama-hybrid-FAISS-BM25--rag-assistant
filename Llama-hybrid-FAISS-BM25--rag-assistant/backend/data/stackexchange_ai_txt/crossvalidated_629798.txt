Autocorrelation Problem and adding independent variable

Currently I'm working with time series data and my initial linear regression,: My current model is Yi = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + e after I ran some assumption test there is autocorrelation on my model, and I did some research to avoid autocorellation. One of the way is adding lag independent variable of Y, so my question is how to write my new linear regression model? and did I do the right treatment to avoid autocorrelation? Yi = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + Y(i-1) + e is this correct? thank you
