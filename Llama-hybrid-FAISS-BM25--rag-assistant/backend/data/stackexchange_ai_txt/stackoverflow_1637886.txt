There are attributes you can apply to your properties such as ReadOnly that will stop the designer from setting your property too. I cant find the link at the moment, but there is also a method of telling the forms designer that it should set properties in a certain order. Edit: Ok, not quite what i remembered it as, but i think something like the ISupportInitialize interface. Something like: Public Class Test Implements ISupportInitalise private _numberOne as integer private _numberTwo as integer private _initalised as boolean Public Property NumberOne() as Integer Get return _numberOne End Get Set(value as Integer) if _initalised then 'perform checks here' end if _numberOne = value End Set End Property Public Property NumberTwo() as Integer Get return _numberTwo End Get Set(value as IntegeR) if _initalised then 'perform checks here' end if _numberTwo = value End Set End Property Public Sub BeginInit Implements ISupportInitalise.BeginInit _initalised = false End Sub Public Sub EndInit Implements ISupportInitalise.EndInit _initalised = true 'perform all checks here' End Sub End Class This way all your checking can be disabled until your object is fully initialised.
