Today I spent my afternoon with analysing a NoClassDefFoundError. After verifying the classpath again and again, it turned out that there was a static member of a class that threw an Exception that was ignored the first time . There is your problem! Don't ever catch and ignore Error (or Throwable). NOT EVER. And if you've inherited some dodgy code that might do this, use your favourite code search tool / IDE to seek and destroy the offending catch clauses. Now that I've found this error after hours of trial and error, I'm wondering if there is a straight forward way to find this bug starting from the thrown exception. No there isn't. There are complicated/heroic ways ... like using doing clever things with a java agent to hack the runtime system on the fly ... but not the sort of thing that a typical Java developer is likely to have in their "toolbox". Which is why the advice above is so important.
