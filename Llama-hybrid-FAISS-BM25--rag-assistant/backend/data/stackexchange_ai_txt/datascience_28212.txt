You are much, much too early in your process to even begin thinking about your models. At this stage, you should be thinking about what the data looks like and how much of it do you need. For starters, what are you measuring? What is the answer that you seek? Is it job satisfaction? Likelihood to land an interview? Likelihood to get a job offer? Once you have that, how are you quantifying that? Is it a categorical variable? A continuous variable? Then you would have to decide on the likely list of factors that go into that answer and determine how you're going to get that data. Do you need to run a custom survey? Are there other datasets that you can leverage? You need to think about all of these answers before you're ready for any sort of modeling discussion.
