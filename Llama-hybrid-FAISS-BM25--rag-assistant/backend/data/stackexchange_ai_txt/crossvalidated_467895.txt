It would have been good to have a reproducible example to test and understand better. That said, I'm speaking from the deepness of my ignorance as I'm learning these days, and had exactly the same problem of yours. I ended up finding that in my time series I was having multiple rows with the same timestamp (e.g. [[2020-05-22, 20], [2020-05-21, 10], [2020-05-12, 5],[2020-05-22, 20], [2020-05-21, 10], [2020-05-12, 5]] ). This was due to the presence of another feature to make those entries necessary for other calculation. But it turned out that having those duplicates were creating issues, which I solved by summing up the values before getting the new dataframe digested by both KPSS and ADF. At that point, both of them revealed the non stationarity. Perhaps the OP case is the same. Kudos to the other answer from where I guess I learnt something too.
