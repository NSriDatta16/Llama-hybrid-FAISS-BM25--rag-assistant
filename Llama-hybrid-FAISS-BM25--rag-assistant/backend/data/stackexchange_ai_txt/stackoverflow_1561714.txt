I'am using the pre-build event to copy working web.config to your test project directory. Set the command line of the pre-build event of test project to string like this: copy $(SolutionDir)\YourWebAppDir\web.config $(ProjectDir) /y After that your tests will always run with actual web.config version. Comment to pcampbell's answer : I think if you use the configSource attribute you can just set it to the same path in web.config of your web app and app.config of test project and that makes not necessary to use build events. sorry, I can't leave comments yet.
