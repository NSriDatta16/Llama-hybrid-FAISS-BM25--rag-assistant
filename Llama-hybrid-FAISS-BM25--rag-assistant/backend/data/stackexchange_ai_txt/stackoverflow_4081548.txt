Wpf Binding to Visibility of WindowsFormHost

I have a WindowsFormsHost whose visibility changes from "Visible" to "Collapsed" and vice versa based on certain triggers. I also want to be able to bind this "Visibility" to a variable as I need to be able to look at the Visibility field for certain reasons, and I can't just "look" at it because they're in two different projects (the style which holds this WindowsFormsHost is in basically a resources project). Anyways, I have this: And in the control template parent I have a multitrigger which checks a couple dependency fields and tries to hide the form (and the hiding works). Here's the binding I use for Visibility, "IsVisible", in the class that gets used as the data provider. private Visibility IsVisibleProperty = Visibility.Visible; public bool bIsVisible { get { return bIsVisibleProperty; } set { if (bIsVisibleProperty == value) { return; } bIsVisibleProperty = value; OnPropertyChanged("IsVisible"); } } The setter isn't hit when the property changes. Any clues? I also tried a workaround, to set this "IsVisibleDProp" dependency that resides in the same place as "IsBeingDragged" and "IsWorking", but it never hits the setter either (though I do set the other two programmatically, and IsVisibleDPropis set using the multitrigger). Thanks.
