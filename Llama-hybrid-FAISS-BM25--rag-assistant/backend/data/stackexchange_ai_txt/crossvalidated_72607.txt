Actually, this isn't by most definitions a recommender system, and anything you read in the literature about recommender systems might be geared toward solving a similar but slightly different problem (namely, where the input and output space are the same set). This is, by most conventional definitions, a classification problem, so looking for tags related to Classification might help. In terms of actual approaches: as Placidia mentioned, CART and random forest methods are quite popular right now. Additionally, a classic method is Logistic Regression , which might be worth checking at (I'm not an R user, but I believe R has an implementation of it provided). More than that is tough to provide without a knowledge of what your system is doing and what approaches might be valid. I'd recommend refreshing your basic probability and statistics and thinking about the way that your variables might be related, then taking a look at the classification methods included with R (and their respective Wikipedia pages).
