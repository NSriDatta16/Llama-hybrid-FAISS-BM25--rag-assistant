How to change the startup page of a WP7 Application

I am having an WP7 application in which I need to change the Startup page depending upon if the user is already registered or not. Suppose if user is registered then I need to redirect him to welcome page if not then to register page. I have tried a couple of ways below is my code but it gives me an argument dispose exception. To achieve above feature I wrote Navigation code in my MainPage.xaml constructor. Checked if the User Registration info is not in isolated storage then will redirect to other page. private void IsAgreeed() { try { isoStorage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); if (!isoStorage.FileExists("DataBase/MyPhoneNumber.txt")) { this.NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("/EULA.xaml", UriKind.Relative)); } else { return; } } catch (Exception ex) { Debug.WriteLine(ex.ToString()); } } Above code works properly when I use it first time but if I Close the Application and restart it again it throws exception argument dispose exception. Thanks; nil
