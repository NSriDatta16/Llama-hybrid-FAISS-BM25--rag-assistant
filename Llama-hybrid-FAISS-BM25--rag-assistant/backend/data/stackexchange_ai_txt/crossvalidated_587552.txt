Sensitivity and specificity are not properties of the the test . They are properties of the test and the patient as shown empirically here whenever the disease is not all-or-nothing. In the example given in the link, older patients have more advanced coronary disease that is easier to detect, hence sensitivity of an exercise ECG test must (and does) increase with age. So if age is your "prevalence factor" sensitivity increases with prevalence. On the whole, sensitivity and specificity, which were appropriated from radio and radar operating characteristics, are far less useful in medicine than they seem, and we would do well to introduce probabilistic diagnosis through logistic regression models as done in the linked chapter. In that way one can handle tests with non-binary outputs non-binary diagnostic status multiple correlated tests multiple disease stages/severities (using ordinal logistic regression)
