If you want to learn computer science stuff, learn Scala. That is the computer science language of the future. See if you can learn that one ;) Otherwise, Ruby is a good language to learn if you want to more marketable after your studies, as it's probably the easiest to get a job with afterward. Algorithms and data structures are all well and good too, but don't forget architecture and high-level design. This is really important - to be able to design large-scale stuff that doesn't stink of poor design. Out of the 3 options, Ruby has a lot to show you here. So does Scala. All the languages can do CS stuff, so I don't see how a language will be a detriment. Sure, one language may be more elegant than another, but people used to express CS-level stuff in C and C++ back in the day, so really, you can't go wrong if you're just trying to learn concept and not becoming fluid with a language. Once you know a set of concepts, it's much easier to understand any language that uses those concepts.
