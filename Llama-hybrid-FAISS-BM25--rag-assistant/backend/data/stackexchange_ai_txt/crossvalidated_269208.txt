Which machine learning algorithm may help to explore the importance of contributions of variables to their sum over time?

I have data in the form of a $n \times t$ matrix $X$ where $n$ is a number of variables and $t$ a (large) number of time points. At any given time point the elements of the matrix can be expressed as a proportion of the column sum of all elements at that time point. So, for example, summing all elements in the first column of $X$, $X_{.1}$, yields a sum $S_1$ so that we have $X_{.1}/S_1$ a vector of proportions of contributions of $X_{.1}$ to $S_1$. Across all columns $t$ there are $t$ vectors of proportions that form a new matrix $P$. Here is an example: (X I need a learning algorithm, I guess unsupervised, that tells me for $X$ what are the dominant contributions to $S$. $X$ is too large to do this by inspection. A visual technique may be also an option. An obvious choice may be for example to take apply(P, 1, mean) but it obscurs trends across time. I need a better understanding (low dimensional representation) of what is happening in $X$.
