Do the 10 questions all measure distinctively different 10 things? If possibly not, you could take the questions that measure the same thing and average responses to these questions and analyze group differences in those averages. If you have enough participants you could run a factor analysis or a principal component analysis for the items and use the results to determine which items you average. If you have theoretical reasons to believe some items measure the same thing, you can check their reliability and if that's adequate you can average them on theoretical grounds. If you end up running separate t-tests for the 10 items, use some kind of p-value adjustment because you are running 10 tests on the same dataset.
