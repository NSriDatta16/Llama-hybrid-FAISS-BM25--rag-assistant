Wikipedia's explanation is: Typically, quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other Θ(nlogn) algorithms, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time. Quicksort Mergesort I think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for Mergesort (which is Ω(n)) that quicksort implementations don't have. In the worst case, they are the same amount of algorithmic time, but mergesort requires more storage.
