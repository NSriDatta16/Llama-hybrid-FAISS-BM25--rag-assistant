changing a (subclassed) cell's content on event

I have a Table who's cells are subclassed instances of UITableViewCell. My subclass has touchesMoved, touchesBegan, etc, so what I'm trying to do is alter an individual cell based upon a series of touches that I define. I am successful in capturing the touch sequence, and I can change the frame of the cell, but I can't seem to get the cell's text to change. I've tried various in my subclass, including: CGRect frame; frame.size.height = 300; self.frame = frame; self.textLabel.text = @"meep"; The cell height changes as planned, but the text doesn't. Is there a better way to do this? Am I missing something obvious? Thanks in advance, John
