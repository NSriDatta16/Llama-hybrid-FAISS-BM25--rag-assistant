When the elements of first basis are always positive for PCA?

I am computing the PCA projection matrix of some data. I notice that the elements of first basis vector (corresponding to the highest eigenvalue) are always positive. My data is real and contain both positive and negative values. Can someone please explain the reason and/or point out related literature?
