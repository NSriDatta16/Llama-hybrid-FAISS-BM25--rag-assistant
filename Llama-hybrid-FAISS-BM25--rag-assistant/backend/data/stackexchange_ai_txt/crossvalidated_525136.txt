I decided to make my comments a direct answer: The given standard error formula is correct even under non-normality, provided all the rest of the assumptions (linearity, constant variance, and independence) are all correct. If those other assumptions are violated, then the given formula is incorrect. If you bootstrap in such a way to mimic the correct data-generating process, then you get better standard error estimates. That is a big "if", however, as there are many ways to bootstrap, but only a few ways to do it correctly for the given data generating process. The main purpose of bootstrapping under non-normality, then, when all other assumptions are correct, is to get better (possibly asymmetric) critical values than $\pm t_{1−\alpha/2,n−2}$ , not to get better standard errors. (Assuming, again, that you choose the right bootstrap.) These in turn can lead to better coverage rates (i.e., closer to $100(1-\alpha)$ %) for the confidence intervals.
