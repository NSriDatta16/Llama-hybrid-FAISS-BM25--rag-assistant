Thanks to larsmans for pointing to the right direction. I took the liberty of digging deeper into this. So for future reference, according to sections 6.5.2.4 and 6.5.4 of the C99 standard (http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf): 6.5.2.4 Postfix increment and decrement operators Constraints The operand of the postfix increment or decrement operator shall have qualified or unqualified real or pointer type and shall be a modifiable lvalue .. .. 6.5.4 Cast operators .. .. [Footnote] 89) A cast does not yield an lvalue. Thus, a cast to a qualified type has the same effect as a cast to the unqualified version of the type. Note: This only applies to C. C++ may handle casts differently.
