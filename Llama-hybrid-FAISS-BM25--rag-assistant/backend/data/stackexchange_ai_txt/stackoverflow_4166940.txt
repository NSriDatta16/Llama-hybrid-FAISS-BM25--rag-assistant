PHP loading twice on all browsers, and it's not a missing image

I have been going nuts trying to figure out why my PHP pages load twice. A lot of people have experienced it, and although some people find out a solution, many havn't. I have a clue that may help more people unravel this. I only noticed it when MySQL insert statements inserted 2 entries. When I first discovered it, I thought it was MySQL, but the inserts have different quote numbers which were generated by PHP. So it must have been PHP and not MySQL causing this doubling effect. Sometimes it was more than doubled. I researched heavily, and most people had these solutions: turn on output buffering, and start it, then flush it before and after code you have a missing img src somewhere. Check there are no 404's on the page, be it styles, js, favicon, css images, or img tags. your code has a loop, check your coding as a workaround, use a session force the insert into only firing once. So start a session, do the insert, then delete the session. Restart the session on the following page so it can be inserted again later if needed. But none of these helped. Despite that PHP would load twice, a JavaScript alert would load once. So I decided that the only way around this issue would be a jQuery post, with a bunch of variables shooting through. Not even this worked - the PHP page it posted to had no HTML, and a small number of includes that needed to be present for the database connection. So I thought, as a non-elegant but last resort solution, that I would have to make it only insert if it wasn't within 5 seconds of the last entry and same IP ($_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]) When doing this I noticed that it recorded two different IP addresses! So it inserted twice, same timedate stamp, but different IP address. One was mine, one wasn't. There was a remote IP address somehow in there. I thought my security software must be going a bit too far telling other servers information about my machine, so I ditched my Comodo software, and installed Avast. Removing comodo didn't fix it. I did a scan using Avast, nothing showed up I looked through my software (Widows 7, 32 bit), there isn't much there. Nothing dodgy, no games, and I havn't been going to smutty websites. So U looked to my router (dlink dir 615) to block the outgoing IP - can't, or at least, I don't know how to. I looked around in Avast to do this as well, but can't find this option anywhere. Maybe I should re-install Comodo and see what options it has Still stumped, but at least I made some ground. Advice very welcome!
