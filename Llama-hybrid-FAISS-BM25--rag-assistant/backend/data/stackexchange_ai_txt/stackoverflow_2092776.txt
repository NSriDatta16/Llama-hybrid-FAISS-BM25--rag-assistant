Intercept pasting to a (rich) edit control

I want to override the default behavior when text is pasted into a rich edit control. Specifically, I want to paste plain-text, not formatted rich-text. I guess that boils down to getting the data as a different clipboard format, but I don't know how to intercept the default behavior first. For reference, I basically have: class MyDialog : public CDialog { CRichEditCtrl m_Edit; }; And the relevant DDX_Control(pDX, IDC_EDIT1, m_Edit) set up in the cpp file. Since I don't think CRichEditCtrl has any facility built-in to control paste-formatting, how can I set this up most elegantly? When I Google, I find lots of people manually capturing CTRL+V, etc... which is not only horrible but won't work in languages where the paste key isn't V!
