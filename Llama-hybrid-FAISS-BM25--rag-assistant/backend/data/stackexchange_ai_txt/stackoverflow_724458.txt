A framework is an allegedly cohesive collection of one or more class libraries. The Java and .NET frameworks, for example are made up of hundreds of class libraries. In .NET there is, by custom but not necessarily, a correspondence between assemblies and class libraries. In Java there is a rough correspondence between namespaces and class libraries. Although I have never noticed the phrase " base class library", I would expect such a thing to contain abstract classes intended to be subclassed before use. Framework in the sense of my first paragraph implies completeness within the purview of the library. For example, you would expect an image manipulation framework to contain everything you need to manipulate images, ranging from file format parsers to in-memory graphics operations.
