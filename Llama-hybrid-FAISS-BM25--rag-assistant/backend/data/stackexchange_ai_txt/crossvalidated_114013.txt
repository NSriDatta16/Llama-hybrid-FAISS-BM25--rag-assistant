Given that your sample size is small a good practice would be to leave out the cross-validation section and use a 60 - 40 or 70 - 30 ratio. As you can see in section 2.8 of Introduction to Clementine and Data Mining and also in MSDN Library - Data Mining - Training and Testing Sets a 70 - 30 ratio is common. According to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning lectures a 60 - 20 - 20 ratio is recommended. Hope I was helpful. Best Regards.
