Drag/Drop movieclip event in JSFL? (Flash IDE)

Lately im trying to do some experimental things with JSFL, and i was wondering if it is possible to listener for an event when a component (that i have made) or movieclip is dragged from library on the stage. i want to create something that i'll get a component and drop it on a mc. when the component is dropped on the mc the component will save the mc as a reference in some var. maybe with events isnt the way to go but i have no clue if this is possible or how to do it another way. i hope someone can help me get started thx in advance
