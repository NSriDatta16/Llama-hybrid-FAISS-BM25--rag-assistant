In a singular value decomposition, $M$ is not (necessarily) symmetric or even square; it's a transformation from one space ( $\mathbb{R}^M$ ) to another ( $\mathbb{R}^n$ ). Let's supppose $m>n$ . $M$ can be decomposed into a transformation into a convenient basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ by $U$ , then a projection and scaling by $E$ into a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then a rotation into the target basis in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by $V^T$ . (Alternatively, for the compact SVD, $U$ is $m\times n$ and includes the projection, and $E$ is just the scaling) Also, just as in PCA, it's no loss of generality (and is standard) to organise $E$ from largest to smallest singular value, and $U$ and $V$ represent orthogonal axes of maximal variation in the two spaces. There are various efficient algorithms for giving you just the largest few singular values and corresponding vectors (either Lanczos-type or stochastic algorithms)
