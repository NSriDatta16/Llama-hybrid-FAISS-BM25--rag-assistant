Thom Baguley, an outgoing editor of The British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, published Serious Stats book that you could find useful. It relies on R rather than SPSS, though. I am suspicious of the books that are in their 7th edition. In my teaching experience, it means that the sections and problems were reshuffled so that the students would have to buy the latest edition to generate the cash flow for the publisher and royalties for the authors keep up with the course. Few serious, research level monographs have undergone a second edition by their authors, and any higher number is obviously an outlier. (Kendall's Library of Statistics is a notable exception, but I cannot really think of any other book that I know that would be in its third edition.) In my very strong opinion, Excel is a good tool for statistical analysis only when used by a Ph.D. statistician. Teaching undergraduate statistics with it will likely have disastrous consequences, and teaches little statistics as compared to using a modern package like R or Stata. Just try to produce a standardized residual vs. leverage regression plot in Excel, and compare it to one-liners in these packages. Stat majors would need to know the theory, so they would need to build these plots from scratch, but still using a statistical package rather than copy/paste the formulae around in Excel. Non-major undergrads need to get the feel for data analysis, and Excel obscures it, at best.
