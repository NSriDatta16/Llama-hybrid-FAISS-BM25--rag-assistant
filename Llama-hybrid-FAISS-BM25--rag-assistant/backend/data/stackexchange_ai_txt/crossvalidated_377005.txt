To overfit, or not to overfit, that's the question

Let us say I have a data generation process that is quite stationary and I do not care about arriving at generalizable knowledge but more about accurate predictions. Would it be acceptable in this scenario to overfit a powerful model (e.g. random forest => fully saturated-ish model) by refreshing it daily using all retrospective data and using it to predict next dayâ€™s dependent variable?
