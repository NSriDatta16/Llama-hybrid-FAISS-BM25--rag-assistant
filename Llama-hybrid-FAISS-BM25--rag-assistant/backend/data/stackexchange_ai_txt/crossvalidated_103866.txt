Is our queue processing speeding up?

We have been collecting statistics on a queueing and processing system that powers part of our business. We have multiple servers processing items in a queue. We recently added new servers, and we want to know whether we're processing faster. By "processing faster", I mean something like this: Last week, all of our servers processed a combined average of X files/min during our peak load. This week, all of our servers processed a combined average of Y files/min during peak load. Are X and Y different enough to be statistically significant? The data I have access to looks something like this graph, which shows the number of files processed per second for an hour-long time period. I have access to about 3 months of this type of data. I have a minor in statistics, but I'm 10 years out of school. So please be gentle :-) Thanks so much! Alan
