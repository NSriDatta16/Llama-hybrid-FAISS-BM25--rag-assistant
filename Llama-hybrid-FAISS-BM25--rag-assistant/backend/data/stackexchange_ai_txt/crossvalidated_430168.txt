$P(\text{white ball}|\text{get 6}) + P(\text{white ball}|\text{not 6})$ just summates the probability of obtaining a white ball in the scenario you obtained six with the probability of obtaining a white ball in the scenario you did not obtain six. You can see that this expression is incorrect by two ways. First, it is not a valid probability. For example, if the two boxes had only white balls, this expression would be 2. You might suggest to solve this issue by replacing the summation with averaging: $\frac{1}{2}P(\text{white ball}|\text{get 6}] + \frac{1}{2}P(\text{white ball}|\text{not 6})$ However, here comes the second issue with this expression - you must take into account $P(\text{get 6})$ and $P(\text{not 6})$ . if you just average the conditional probabilities, you implicitly assume that $P(\text{get 6})$ = $P(\text{not 6})=0.5$ . The correct solution using conditional probabilities requires multiplying them with the prior probabilities: $P(\text{white ball}|\text{get 6})P(\text{get 6}) + P(\text{white ball}|\text{not 6}]P(\text{not 6})$ . This solution is equal to your first solution since $P(A \cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)$ .
