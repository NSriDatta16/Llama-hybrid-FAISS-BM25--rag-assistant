Do you know of any "best practice" or "what works" vi tutorial for programmers?

There are thousands of vi tutorials on the web, most of them generically listing all the commands. There are even videos on youtube which show basic functionality. But does anyone know of a vi tutorial which focuses on the needs of programmers ? For example when I program in Perl with vi , moving to the "next paragraph" is meaningless. I want to know which commands seasoned vi users combine to e.g: copy everything inside of parentheses copy a function copy and paste a variable (e.g. 2yw) etc. I am sure there are lots of functions using multiple-file capability, and the maps, macros, reading in of files for template code, regular expression search, jumping to functions, perhaps minimal code completion, or other features that emulate what programmers have gotten used to in Visual Studio and Eclipse, etc.
