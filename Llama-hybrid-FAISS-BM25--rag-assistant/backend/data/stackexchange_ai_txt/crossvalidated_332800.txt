Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA): Mean Function

How does one calculate a mean function in Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) given a data set with an unknown distribution? (A theoretical approach if possible) I am wanting to implement R's fpca.sc function in MATLAB and/or python. Does anyone know how to do this? $$ $$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_principal_component_analysis https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/refund/versions/0.1-16/topics/fpca.sc
