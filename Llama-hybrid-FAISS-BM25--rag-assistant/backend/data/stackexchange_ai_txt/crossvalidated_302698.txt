I think any method to study variable importance is worth a try. This could be as simple as the correlation between features and binary indicator variables for each cluster, or as complex as a random forest. Often people don't do such an analysis, and then won't realize that (e.g., because of inappropriate preprocessing) their clusters only depend on a single variable. So in particular, you should also check which variables do not have an impact.
