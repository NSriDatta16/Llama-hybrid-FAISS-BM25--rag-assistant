More generally, Python has a lot of double-underscore methods. They're there for a reason: they are the Python way of overloading operators. For instance, if you want a new class in which addition, I don't know, prints "foo" , you define the __add__ and __radd__ methods. There's nothing inherently good or bad about this, any more than there's anything good or bad about using for loops. In fact, using __call__ is often the more Pythonic approach, because it encourages clarity of code. You could replace MyCalculator.calculateValues( foo ) with MyCalculator( foo ) , say.
