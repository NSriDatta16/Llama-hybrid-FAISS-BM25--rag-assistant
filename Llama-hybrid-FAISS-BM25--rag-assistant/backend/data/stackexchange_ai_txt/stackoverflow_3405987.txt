In a comment on your previous question you mentioned http://www.gallot.be/?p=85 , which uses a javaagent. It should be relatively easy to modify that code to run the same transformation in a preprocessing step. You would need to extract the CodeLocationClassAdapter into its own toplevel class and call it like this for each of your class files: String name = "com/stackoverflow/Test.class"; byte[] bytes = // read bytes of the classfile from disk ClassReader cr = new ClassReader(bytes); ClassWriter cw = new ClassWriter(cr, 0); ClassVisitor cv = new CodeLocationClassAdapter(cw); cr.accept(cv, 0); // write modified class file OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(name); out.write(cw.toByteArray()); out.close();
