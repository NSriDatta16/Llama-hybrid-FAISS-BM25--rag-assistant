Correct test for measuring pre / post variance for test vs. control

I have a test and control group of URLs, each containing 5,000 URLs, receiving in total roughly similar numbers of visits per day e.g. URL | Group | Day | Visits URL_1 | Test | Jan 1 | 500 URL_2 | Ctrl | Jan 1 | 200 URL_3 | Test | Jan 1 | 100 Or in total: Day | Test Visits | Control Visits Jan 1 | 50,000 | 60,000 Jan 2 | 50,500 | 50,000 Jan 3 | 60,000 | 40,750 Hypothesis : A treatment applied to the Test URLs will increase visits to that group. Result : The mean average daily visits to the Test group increased more than the mean average of the Control group in the post-period vs the pre-period (both 30 days). Question : Which statistical test would best confirm that this is, or is not, statistically significant? Specifically: At least; Are outlier days in pre or post distorting the average variance? Or ideally; Are outlier days, or outlier URLs, distorting the average variance? After much reading and YouTubing I'm pretty confused, I think a 2x2 Mixed ANOVA, will at least meet objective 1, but would appreciate some guidance before going down the wrong path. Thanks!
