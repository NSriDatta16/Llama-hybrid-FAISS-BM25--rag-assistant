It has been my experience with these types of problems that you try a few models and compare RMSE. Based on the initial results you can narrow the models down and attempt to refine these. As for what to alter I would refer you to "Introduction to Machine Learning" 2nd Ed by Ethem Alpaydin. This book explains the what is happening so that you can better guess at what to alter to get better results. Another resource - An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Intro to Statistic Learning PDF
