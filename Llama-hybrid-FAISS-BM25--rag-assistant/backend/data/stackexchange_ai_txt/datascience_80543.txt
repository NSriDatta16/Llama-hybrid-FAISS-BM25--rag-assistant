NLP SBert (Bert) for answer comparison STS

I've been researching a good way to automate short answer evaluation. Essentially a teacher gives a test with some questions like: Question: why did columbus sail westward to find asia? Answer: so he could find a new trade route to Asia through the ocean. Three goals of the Spanish in the Americas were the desire to attain great amounts of riches, to establish claims on as much land as possible, and to colonize as much as possible. With that we have the correct answer and would like to compare that with the students answer and produce a score based on similarity. I know this isn't a reliable replacement for human grading, but for the sake of the example. I've come across this paper and codebase: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers It seems like the ideal method for solving this problem, but most examples are based on scoring/ranking of semantic search. I question whether I'm on the right path, given that I'm just comparing two answers and not a cluster. Anyone with more experience, possibly can provide some guidance?
