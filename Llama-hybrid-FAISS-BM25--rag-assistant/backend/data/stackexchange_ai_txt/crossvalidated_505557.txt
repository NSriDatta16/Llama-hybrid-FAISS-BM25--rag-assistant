I think this can be solved using posterior samples (in a Bayesian model), or, similarly, using Monte Carlo samples from the maximum likelihood parameters and their covariance matrix. I'm 95% sure this is correct, but am always happy to be corrected. First, confidence intervals for the one group case. You already know how to calculate your quantity of interest (let's call it $x(p_0)$ ) given estimates of $\beta_0, \beta_1$ . The arm package provides a simple function, arm::sim ( source code ) that uses the model covariance matrix to draw samples for each parameter such that the sample mean is the ML value, the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles correspond to the 95% CI, and covariances between parameters are preserved. You can thus estimate the 95% CI for $x(p_0)$ by calculating $x(p_0)$ for each sampled pair of values for of the $\beta$ s, and calculating the percentiles. Now, because your groups are independent, you can do this separately for each group, yielding a collection of samples of $x(p_0)$ for group 1, and similar samples for group 2. Subtracting these sets of samples pairwise yields samples from your estimate of the difference, $\delta$ , in $x(p_0)$ between the two groups. The maximum likelihood estimate of $\delta$ is the mean of these samples (assuming they remain Normally distributed -- something I'm not sure of), and the 95% CI can be estimated by taking the percentiles, as before.
