Integration between Project Web Access and SharePoint (Gantt Charts)

I'm a newbie to using Project Web Access and I wondered if someone can guide me by giving links that help in integration of SharePoint site with Project Web Access. What I want to do is to generate Gantt charts inside a regular SharePoint site. I know that there is a standard view to generate charts in SharePoint but I need the more customizable view in Project Web Access.
