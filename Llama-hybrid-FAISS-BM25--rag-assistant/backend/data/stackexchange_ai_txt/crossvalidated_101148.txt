This is a pretty broad question, and hard to answer. Election prediction itself is a science, which requires a lot of experience. The most important thing is to control for bias . Step out of your way, and control the heck for bias. It's not fun. It's as boring as it can get. But unless you have a representative sample , your results will be badly off. If you asked only Twitter users, the results will be completely useless. With elections, even with a representative sample, it's apparently hard to get the prediction error below 1%. Because people don't answer truthfully. Because people are undecided. Because people change their mind suddenly. Because the brain says A, but the gut says B. The prediction error you can't get rid consists of many factors. If you have a very good representative sample (carefully chosen telephone interviews) it will be lower than by doing exit polls (where you can only roughly control demographics by choosing representative locations ). If your poll has many options, the error will be higher than if it is a A/B election. Here are some sources: "The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is about +/- 3% for a typical characteristic from the national Exit Poll and +/-4% for a typical state Exit Poll." http://www.edisonresearch.com/exit_poll_faq.php "That's why the final (not preliminary) exit polls in Wisconsin had a theoretical margin of error of ±4 points, while a telephone poll of the same sample size would have a margin of error of only about ±2 points." http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/outraged-wisconsin-exit-polls-so-wrong "the sample size needed to construct a 95% confidence interval with a 1% margin of error. If the planned proportion is estimated to be 0.51 with a margin of error of 0.01 (under Options set it to estimate a Lower Bound confidence interval), the sample size needed is approximately 7,000."
