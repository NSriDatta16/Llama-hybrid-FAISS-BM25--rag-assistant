Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Container Managed EJB

I'm building a javaee6 application that processes smses. basically smses come in via smpp, to a JMS Queue and then are processed by my application. I'm using glassfish v3, I decided I was going to use EJBs for the business logic. Here is the structure of my application Dashboard Web app - JSF 2, Business Logic - EJB 3, Message Receiver - JMS, Persistence provider - JPA (eclipselink). I have never used EJBs before, I'm currently using the container to manage my Session beans. I just want to know if there are any disadvantages of using EJBs(container managed to be specific) rather than just call basic java classes from the JSF Managed beans. The system I'm building has to be very scalabale. There isn't much complex business logic. is it overkill to be using ejbs?
