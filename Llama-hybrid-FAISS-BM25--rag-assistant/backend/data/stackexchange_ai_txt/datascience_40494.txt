image recognition: fully connected network vs CNN

To recognize handwritten digits, I have a fully connected network, containing only 2 layers: input layer (all pixels of the image) and output layer (0 or 1). I use the simplest linear regression for training and got excellent results. So I wonder if CNNs aren't necessary for this purpose if a double layer fully connect network can do the job well?! For example, I'd like to recognize digit '1'. I use only 4 or 5 images that resemble '1', and other 4 or 5 images that look like anything else. Every time I take~2000 pixels from each image. It turns out this code with this tiny amount of training data can recognize correct and incorrect digits really well.
