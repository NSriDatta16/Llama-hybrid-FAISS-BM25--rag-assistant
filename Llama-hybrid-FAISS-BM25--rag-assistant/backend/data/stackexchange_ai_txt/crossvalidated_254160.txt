As you can see in this paper: http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf Isomap is not as good in separation (in that specific type of cases) as t-SNE. And here is MPCA against t-SNE: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056883&type=printable t-SNE seems to produce the best results for visualisation in 2D. Visualisation is often the ultimate purpose of any data-analysis, so t-SNE is the best method of these three (for these particular cases and applications). It is though to be understood that t-SNE may fail in other cases, but in those cases and the purpose of 2D visualisation for clustering it performs well.
