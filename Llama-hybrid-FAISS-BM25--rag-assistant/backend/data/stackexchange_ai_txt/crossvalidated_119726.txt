It seems to me that you are thinking about making and using a single partition of your data for training and validating your model. It is true that the ability of cross-validation to yield a good model can depend on the quality of the partition, and that a random partition can be poor. I would still use random partitions as @MarcClaesen suggests, but try doing many of them and averaging over them. With enough iterations, the process should work quite well, even if there is no guarantee any individual partition was perfectly representative.
