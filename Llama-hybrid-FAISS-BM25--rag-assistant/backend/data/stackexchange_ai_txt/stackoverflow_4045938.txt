What you made looks allright to me.. I once did this, in java, in much the same way. Getting the average of the 0-255 color values of RGB, to get grayscale, and it looks alot like yours. public int getGray(int row, int col) throws Exception { checkInImage(row,col); int[] rgb = this.getRGB(row,col); return (int) (rgb[0]+rgb[1]+rgb[2])/3; }
