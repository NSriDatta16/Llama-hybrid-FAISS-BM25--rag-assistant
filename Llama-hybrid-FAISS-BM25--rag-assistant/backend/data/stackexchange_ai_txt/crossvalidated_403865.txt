Multiple regression with a odd-numbered Likert items

In the questionnaire, individuals were asked to pick from an odd number of options (5 or 7) how much they agree with the statement (from completely agree to completely disagree). Now, if there where an even number of options, it's be easy to code as 0 or 1. Sadly, here, the median option means "neutral. I'm unsure of how to code this. As I see it, I could: Create two dummies (for and against). Neutral would be if both equal 0. Leave it as is (which complicates the interpretation?). I was wondering if there's a more elegant way to go about it.
