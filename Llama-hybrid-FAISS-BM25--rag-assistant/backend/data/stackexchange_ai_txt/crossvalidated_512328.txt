You are correct; this can be described as a graphical model. I have done a limited amount of work on the topic of antiques in the past. However, you are missing part of the background theory, so your question is “ill-posed.” The antiques business is more complex than what you are describing. At least as important, you are ignoring market segmentation and the rules of competition. There are a variety of types of competition. Economics tends to oversimplify discussions of that unless we are talking with each other. If you are modeling behaviors, then you end up needing a more in-depth discussion. One of the general forms of competition that exists is called monopolistic competition. It is generally presented in contrast to monopoly or pure competition. In pure competition, such as in the market for red hard winter wheat, sellers are price takers. They cannot do anything at all to impact their revenue, so they only control their costs. On the opposite side of the coin is a monopoly. Revenue is totally under the control of the monopolist, and they can maximize their profits. In monopolistic competition, other people offer similar but slightly different things. The seller wants people to pay a premium for the object they have and not treat another object as so close that they want the same price for a similar item at another dealer. That is the first complexity. A dealer offered item $B$ may reject it because they already own item $A$ , and having both on a shelf may reduce the existing premium on $A$ . No antique dealer wants to compete against themselves. The second thing that you are missing is price discrimination. The antique industry, as a whole, uses all three types of price discrimination. Third degree price discrimination, the most common type, segments the market so that each dealer can earn higher profits than if it did not exist. Imagine a town with two antique dealers; one only sells low quality antiques and the other only high quality antiques. Both dealers will make a higher profit than they would if they both sold all types of antiques. Market segmentation is a highly valuable tool to produce higher profits selling the same goods. Indeed, some dealers own both kinds of stores. There is a major retailer that owns two store brands. There is a high degree of overlap in terms of the items sold. They package their goods centrally. If sold in store A, good X will sell for \$5 per unit and in store B will sell for \$50 per unit. Walmart, if offered the chance to sell Lamborghini’s, would decline. It is outside their product line and target audience. Not accepting the object for sale increases their profits. There is a lot more going on as well. Dealers often get their product from auctions. There is an entire theory around auctions, and it would be too challenging to rewrite all of auction theory as it relates to antiques. Nonetheless, auctions provide dealers with both local information about local pricing and with low cost inventory because of how they behave in auctions when compared with the general public. There is a profit-making strategy in auctions that differs from other types of forums. A discriminating dealer may reject an item, not because it isn’t valuable, but because other items, even if of less value, may be sold at so low a price that their margin will be better. Now to your specific question: Assuming we have complete data, we would like to estimate what percentage of ALL of the antiques in the world would a dealer pass-on (including those that they never got to see)? Yes, this can be done, but it isn’t meaningful to ask without further constraining the question. With information on local income and wealth, market segmentation, and so forth, you could do something like a Poisson regression to give you a count of items or a logistic regression to predict the probability for an individual object. Still, for your question to be realistic, it needs to be far better defined. The difficulty is that if you didn’t collect the correct data, you would end up with an “endogeneity” problem. In other words, the object you are predicting alters the items you are using to predict the outcome. The more challenging issue with a complete set of data is removing endogeneity. For example, imagine I sell only type A objects, and everybody knows that. Another seller sells type B objects. The very fact that people know that I sell type A objects may change their behavior. That may change the predictors, so I need to control for who does and does not have knowledge. Possibly, people that know I only sell type A objects may go out of town, figuring as the only seller of A, I will give them a worse price than if they went to a major city. People who are ignorant will go to both sellers and just take my price as a fair price, feeling lucky to sell it to anybody. The buyer and the seller both influence each other. You have to control for that. That is the hard part of this problem over anything else.
