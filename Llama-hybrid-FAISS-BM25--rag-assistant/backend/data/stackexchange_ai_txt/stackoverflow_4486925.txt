Not sure this is it, but here's something to consider: Restlet very carefully and accurately implements the REST architectural style. One of the key REST principles it implements is the uniform interface. In an HTTP-based web service, the uniform interface leverages the HTTP GET, PUT, POST, DELETE (and other) operations the way they were originally intended to. So to create a resource on the server when you assign its resource name, you use PUT. To update that resource, you again use PUT. To read it, you use GET. To delete it, use DELETE. POST is reserved for creating a resource when the server assigns the resource name. So this may somehow be due to a mismatch in expectations. A POST generally has a representation you're sending to the server, but this POST does not. Are you reading in the full request and closing the connection properly on the server-side?
