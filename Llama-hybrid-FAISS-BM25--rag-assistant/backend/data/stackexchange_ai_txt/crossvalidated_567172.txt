t-test random sample assumption violated?

I have a problem similar to the following: Suppose that for six days I ask my friend bob to make a prediction on the average temperature of the following day. Then I ask my friend Alice for the following six days the same. So I end up with a dataset like this: Day friend prediction error day 1 bob b1 e1 day 2 bob b2 e2 day 3 bob b3 e3 day 4 bob b4 e4 day 5 bob b5 e5 day 6 bob b6 e6 day 7 alice a1 e7 day 8 alice a2 e8 day 9 alice a3 e9 day 10 alice a4 e10 day 11 alice a5 e11 day 12 alice a6 e12 Where the errors $e1,e2,...,e12$ represent the absolute difference between the prediction and the actual average temperature of the day. My goal is to test if the predictions of bob are more accurate than the predictions of Alice. I was planning on doing a t-test on the means of the errors. One of the assumptions of a t-test is that data of each group comes from a random sample, in my problem, is this assumption violated? If it is not, What is the reference population of each group? Because of this, I was thinking on performing a Bayesian test instead of the t-test, is this the correct approach? How should I attack this problem?
