Supply extra parameter to autocomplete according to Zend Framework

I have a form with (at least) the following two fields: country club The club is a field that is generated via the ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_AutoComplete Element, that also generates the following javascript code: $("#club").autocomplete({"url":"\/mywebsite\/\/mycontroller\/autocomplete"}); I have a database of clubs per country. What I want is that only the clubs are returned for the (user) given country . This list should be retrieved via a remote (ajax) call. The code for that is: public function autocompleteAction() { $request = $this->getRequest(); $filter = $request->getParam('q'); $country = $request->getParam('country'); $clublist = getClubListBySubstring($country, $filter); $this->_helper->autoComplete($clublist); } I can probably change the above javascript-code, by-passing the generation done by ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_AutoComplete and add an extra element to the URL that gets interpreted as parameter country . But is there a more elegant solution? I've read something about ExtraParams, would that work, and how?
