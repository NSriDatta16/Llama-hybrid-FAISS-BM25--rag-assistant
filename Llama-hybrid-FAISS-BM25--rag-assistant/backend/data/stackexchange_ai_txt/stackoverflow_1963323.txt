My approach would be to create an png image, in the style of the bubble (only useful for a fixed size bubble of course), Subclass UIView, and draw this image into the UIView's Background when it's created, i would also add a UILabel or UIImage depending on what i wanted to do, whether it be display text or an image. If you wanted to do variable size images, you would want to use Quartz2D and draws the rects that you require. While this is more work, if done properly you end up with a more extensible component. Next step is to subclass the UILabel, and add a method that responses to the touchesBegan (UIResponder) method, this will be called each time it's touched. You can then create and display your custom view to the user. Usually i would say create a delegate, however i don't think UILabel/UIView supports this.
