Your training dataset is supposed to be an unbiased representation for your test dataset, otherwise you'd have a problem. Your objective is to train a model that can generalize to a data set that you haven't seen, and that can only happen if what you use for training is approximately what your model will eventually encounter. No machine learning can compensate for bad and invalid inputs. You don't compare Apple and Orange.
