Assuming that your hash function is "good", the best thing to do is to set the initial size to the expected number of elements, assuming that you can get a good estimate cheaply. It is a good idea to do this because when a HashMap resizes it has to recalculate the hash values for every key in the table. Leave the load factor at 0.75 . The value of 0.75 has been chosen empirically as a good compromise between hash lookup performance and space usage for the primary hash array. As you push the load factor up, the average lookup time will increase significantly. If you want to dig into the mathematics of hash table behaviour: Donald Knuth (1998).
