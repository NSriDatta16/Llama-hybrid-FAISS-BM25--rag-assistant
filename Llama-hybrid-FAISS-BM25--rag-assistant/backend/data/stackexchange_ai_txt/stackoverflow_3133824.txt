After quite a lot of testings, I have found some way inside it. If you look very clearly the "saveAction()" method, in the "ProductController.php" page of the "Adminhtml" module, you will find there is a line like " $product->save(); ". If you make some inroads into this "save()" method, you will see that Magento is using some "setData()" method, for the simple product's properties. So if you are using the "price", "weight", "sku", "name", "description", "short_description", ... fields as an 1D array, you just need to add the required properties of the Bundle Product to this array list, and Magento will do the rest. So what I mean is that the array will contain the following elements as simple as that:- Array ( ['name'] => 'simple', ['description'] => 'test', ['short_description'] => 'simple test', ['sku_type'] => 0, ['sku'] => 'simple01', ['weight_type'] => 1, ['weight'] => 12, ['price_type'] => 1, ['price'] => 250, ['shipment_type'] => 0 ) Now you need to pass this array through the " setData() " method, and bingo you go. Just remember that Magento is really beautiful if you believe, otherwise it is as harsh & rude. Hope it helps!
