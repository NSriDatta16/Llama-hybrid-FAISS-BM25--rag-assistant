Is it possible to conduct a coefficient test within a multiple regression?

In an analysis of employment, a difference in means test shows that gender is important. Multiple logistic regression using several specifications robustly identifies a positive coefficient on gender, but the magnitude varies wildly and the p-value is consistently large (.5 I would like to take the average coefficient estimate despite the fact that the p-values are large. I would feel more comfortable with this average if I could somehow demonstrate that, within the context of some model a "p-value with respect to beta" is less than 0.5 instead of showing that a "p-value with respect to zero" is greater than 0.5. As an aside related to motivation: While it is now generally accepted that p-value selection using traditional levels including 0.1 are arbitrary, I am uncomfortable with p > 0.5 as it seems to me to state "it is more likely that the true effect is close to zero rather than close to the estimated coefficient", ie p'(B) > p(B), and I am concerned about included variable bias with such factors.
