I think it depends on how you define agile. Agile is an umbrella term for a bunch of methodologies and practices. In Wikipedia it is defined as such: Agile methods generally promote a disciplined project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability [...]. We practice an agile approach where I work, where the architecture team works in a pretty non-specified agile way and the feature teams use Scrum. By non-specified I mean that there are no strict rules as to how the process is but we use several agile principles. Most importantly development is not done the waterfall way, but iteratively. Throughout the core software development department we use continuous integration and a lot of automated testing. Daily stand-ups are by definition a practice used by the feature teams, but also sometimes for the platform team, depending on the situation. The platform team has an open weekly presentation of what they did. Also, user stories are not only used for the feature teams, but also sometimes for the platform team, when responsibilities overlap and a product requirement turns out to be a more general platform requirement. So, yes, I think agile is possible for platform teams, as long as the circumstances (i.e. management and/or product requirements) allow it. What you use and how you use it is up to you.
