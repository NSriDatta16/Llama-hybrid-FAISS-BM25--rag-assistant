I don't have a VS2005 keybinding scheme as I personally prefer a Brief-style scheme. However, to import "it", as far as I know (at least on Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede) use File -> Import -> General -> Preferences where "it" is a .prf file which has been saved out using File -> Export -> General -> Preferences.
