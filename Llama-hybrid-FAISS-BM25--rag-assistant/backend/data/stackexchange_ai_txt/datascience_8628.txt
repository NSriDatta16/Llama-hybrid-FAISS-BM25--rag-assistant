Separate the operational and the training scenarios. The operational scenario is the one in which your classifier will be measure on. This is where you should perform well. Use should have a dataset that is representative of this scenario. The training scenario is whatever you are doing in order to build a classifier that will perform well on the operational scenario. Many time the datasets in both scenarios are of the same nature so there is no need to distinct them. For example, you have some online store so you use for training past usage in order to perform well on the future usage. However, while training you can use a different dataset than a one that represents the operational scenario. Actually, if you sleep, dream of a classifier, validate it on your operational scenario (this step should be done after waking up), you are just as good as after going the usual machine learning path. The distinction between operational and training scenarios becomes important when the dataset is imbalanced. Most algorithms won't perform well on such a dataset. So, don't hesitate to use two datasets - You can use a balanced dataset for the training. Once you are done, validate your classifier of the operational dataset.
