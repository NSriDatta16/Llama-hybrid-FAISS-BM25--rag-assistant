$R^2$ change and $F$-change (etc.) are just some of the many names for a nested model test. You can find some information on it and one version of the formula in my answer here: Testing for moderation with continuous vs. categorical moderators . In R (or any other software), you fit a full model with all variables, and a reduced model without the variables you want to test. (If you drop more than one variable, they are tested as a set, not individually, i.e., you get a single p-value for all of them.) Then you perform a nested model test. m1.full = lm(all_ART~Neuroticism*Agreeableness+Attentional.Control, data=stp2_sub2, na.action=na.omit) summary(m1.full) # this will give you the F value for the full model, if you want it m1.red = lm(all_ART~Neuroticism+Agreeableness+Attentional.Control, data=stp2_sub2, na.action=na.omit) # I switched * to + summary(m1.red) # this will give you the F value for the reduced model, if you want it anova(m1.red, m1.full) # this performs the nested model test
