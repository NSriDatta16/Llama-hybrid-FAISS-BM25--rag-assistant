Random forest vs Random Forest tuned with caret

Looking for some help please. I have used the randomForest package extensively and have been happy with its performance. I am currently writing a journal paper investigating match outcomes in sport, predicting the outcome of matches from 33 performance indicators. I need to use caret to produce the randomForest package as I wish to use Lime to explain outcomes in a testing data set. Lime can't accept a model from randomForest, only from a randomForest wrapped via caret. When I use random forest I get a prediction accuracy of approx 76% on the training data set, when I tune in caret I get an accuracy of 100%. Is this sort of improvement common? Or am I making a mistake? Would be really grateful is somebody could check my code. My data set is named model.data # Create model with default parameters control
