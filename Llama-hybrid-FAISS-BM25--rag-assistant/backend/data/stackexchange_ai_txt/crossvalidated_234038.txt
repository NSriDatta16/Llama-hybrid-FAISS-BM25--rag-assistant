In your analysis with three groups $\beta_1$ captures the average relation of age and $y$ in the three groups. In you second analysis with only one group $\beta_1$ captures the average relation of age and $y$ in that group. If the relation between age and $y$ is different across your three groups, you will have different estimates for your two analyses. You need to include the interaction between your indicators and age in your first regression if you want to recover the estimates of your single group regression.
