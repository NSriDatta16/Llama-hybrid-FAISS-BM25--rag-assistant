Administration. I had to schedule multiple day-long downtimes to perform upgrades from 6 to 7, and to move the semi-massive (159GB) VOBS from an older server to SAN storage. With a system like git or svn+svk, this could be done overnight, nearly automagically, with no impact to users - they'd never notice. They couldn't push changes upstream, but they could continue to work. With ClearCase or raw SVN, they are at the mercy of the repository server. ClearCase UCM is a great tool, I like it and think something can be done to add like functionality to SVN/mercurial/git/bzr - not that you can't implement it with hook-scripts, but that's a custom one-off for each site. UCM is so prevalent, everyone does it, but almost no-one tracks it in the repositories. :-/
