I think your problem here isn't so much MVC as an understanding of the way website coding works. The big push in web design is something called separation of content from presentation . The idea is that all of the information on your website (such as paragraphs, headers, lists, etc) should be separate from how it's displayed to the user. This approach has a lot of advantages: You can display the same information differently to different users. For instance, if I access your website from a laptop, the page can look different then if I access it from a mobile phone. If you need to make a change to the way your page looks, you only have to change the styling of your page, not the actual page itself. Your page can have multiple different styles, or skins, applied to it. You can have one style work across an entire site. This prevents you from having to restyle every page you make. With today's web, content is usually handled by HTML and styling is done by CSS. For a look at how powerful CSS can be (and an example of what I'm talking about), check out CSS Zen Garden . You're using MVC, which generates HTML, but CSS should still be the way you handle layout. I'd recommend starting with W3 Schools' lessons on HTML and CSS . Good luck.
