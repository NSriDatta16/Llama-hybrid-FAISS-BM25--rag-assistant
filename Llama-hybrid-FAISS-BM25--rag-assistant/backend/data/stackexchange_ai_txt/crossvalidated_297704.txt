Logistic regression for propensity analysis

I have a basic question as I am new to Data Science. I have a typical problem where I need to estimate the effect of an intervention between experimental and control groups. I read propensity matching is the way to go to compare 'like' candidates and people use Logistic regression (LR) to calculate propensity scores. My basic question is, isn't LR a supervised machine learning technique? What will be my training data for LR? In other words, how can LR predict the probability of being assigned to either groups just based on some properties about the candidates?
