How to encourage myself to switch to ORM?

I'm working with a legacy project of my team-mate (.NET/Oracle). The project is not yet completed, it's under construction and far from production. He followed a "traditional way" to access data, which is creating stored procedures and then use database driver to call them. I want to follow a "modern way" to access data: use an ORM to abstract and access data. The switch will not cost much, in terms of time and money. The problem is, he is much more experienced than me, and he's kind of hate ORMs (he didn't explain why, but he said that it's confusing). I'm on my own now, but i'm not encouraged enough to switch to an ORM. Then, should I switch to an ORM or not? if yes, please encourage me. EDIT: I don't know why someone need to close this question. I'm not encouraged enough because I'm not sure which way is better. You can convince me, that ORMs make me develop faster, less errors, or stored procedures are faster,... whatever. I want to ask from you, which are, IMHO, experienced programmers (than me, and also my team-mate). My team-mate got his reason to use stored procedures, and many programmers have their own. I need to know why they think that (stored procedures are considerably good or they just want to use something similar with them, etc...) Thank you so much.
