My first thought is that starting Magento in the context of another PHP file, but without all the fixins that Magento provides when bootstrapping itself, seems risky. The path of least resistance is, with very few exceptions, do let Magento be Magento and do its thing, the less hacking the better. With that in mind, is it possible for you to set up a Magento controller/action and invoke this data from there, or even consume it remotely (e.g. using file_get_contents )?
