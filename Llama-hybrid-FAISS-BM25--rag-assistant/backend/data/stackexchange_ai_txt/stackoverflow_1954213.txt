WCF Service polling hangs

I have 2 wcf services, 1 which polls the other service at regular interval.The service2 is hosted in no. of machines with the same configuration. My problem is that whenever the poller service gets restarted, even though the service2 on other machines runs fine, i am not getting the response from those services (basically it gets timed out - getting SYSTEM.TimeOutException ). If I try to access the same service (service2) from some temp application (without restarting the service2) it gives response. If I restart the service2, than it works fine, the service1 (poller service) gets the responses from all hosted services (Service2). Dont know what is causing problem. Regards, Chirag
