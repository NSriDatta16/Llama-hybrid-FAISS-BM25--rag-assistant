Ways of finding associations in time series

I am trying to develop a logic to identify association between different time series for association mining. I have a lot of series and need to find whether or not the association exists. I figured two ways to do this: Constructive: try to find relation in given two series. Destructive: try to prove that relation does not exist. Are there any existing mathematical parameters to identify such relations? if not, any suggestions?
