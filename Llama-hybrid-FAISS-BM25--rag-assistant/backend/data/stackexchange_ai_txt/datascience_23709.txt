Can we use machine learning to generate a text output based on the input strings

Problem : Generate a text output based on input strings which will be combined using a number of rules. Example : Feature1 Feature2 O/P Rule 1 Enum_Domain Priority /Enum_Domain/Priority Rule 2 Enum_Domain.EnumData Name /Enum_Domain/EnumData/Name Rule 1 Trunkgroup Gateway /Trunkgroup/Gateway Rule 2 GatewayGrp.Gateway IP /GatewayGrp/Gateway/IP This is a simple programming problem, but is there any machine learning algorithm that can learn these rules and generate the output based on the two inputs.
