How to choose between IKVM static and dynamic modes?

I'm deploying some Java libraries in my .NET application. Should I convert the Java libraries into DLLs with ikvmc, or should I use the dynamic features to do the conversion at runtime? I expect that using ikvmc would cut down on initial load of the application. Does anyone have any experience to verify this? On the other hand, my build process will be considerably simpler if I went the dynamic route. Theoretically, up-front conversion could also catch conversion errors earlier. However, my test coverage should mitigate this issue. Also, I imagine that ikvm could cache dynamically-converted assemblies on disk somewhere, so that only the very first load (maybe part of setup) would be slower. I've seen nothing in the ikvm docs to indicate that this is the case, though.
