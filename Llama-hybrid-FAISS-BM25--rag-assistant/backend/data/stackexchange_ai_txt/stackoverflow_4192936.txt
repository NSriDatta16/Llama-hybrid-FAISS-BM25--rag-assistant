Offline api references and recommended online ones?

I want to find an offline good reference on the jsf components. I'm currently learning about jsf 2.0 from core jsf 2.0 book + glassfish + cdi. I've found the online version such as download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17802_01/j2ee/javaee/javaserverfaces/2.0/docs/pdldocs/facelets/index.html and www.jsftoolbox.com/documentation/help/12-TagReference/index.jsf , but so far i've been unlucky to find the offline versions of the api doc. Could anyone share offline versions of it, and maybe share other good jsf 2.0 references ? Thank you !
