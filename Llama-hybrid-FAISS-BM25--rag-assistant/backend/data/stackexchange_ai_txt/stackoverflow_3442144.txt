Automatic Streetview transition in Google Maps v3

If you go to http://maps.google.com and zoom in until Google runs out of map the viewer automatically transitions to Streetview-mode (at least if Streetview is available at the location you zoomed in on). I'm mucking around with the Google Maps v3 API. Is there a way to replicate the map-to-streetview effect here? I can enable Streetview just fine by putting streetViewControl: true in the mapOptions , but the user still has to manually drag the stickman onto the map to get Streetview going.
