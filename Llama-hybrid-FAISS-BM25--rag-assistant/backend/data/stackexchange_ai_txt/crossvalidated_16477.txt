PCA, like wave transformations, is an orthogonal transformation. It tries to rotate data to maximize certain metric (i.e. the variance). Interestingly, if the data is sufficiently random (isotropic), no rotation will help to enlarge variance. In this case, PCA will basically turn to a wave transformation.
