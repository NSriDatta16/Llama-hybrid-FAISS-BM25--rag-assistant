Android Listview: Problem with its height, while dragging up

Sorry for not having proper title to the question, I have a list view that can implement drag and drop. It implements two directions, up and down. In down direction I have just given more height (60dp normal , more height is 120dp). The list item contains a textview and an image view. The problem comes up when I drag up, I want to pass the same list height but instead of default behavior [List item grows downwards....] the list item should go upwards and it must have same 120dp height. This is what happens [Downwards direction] ========================= TextView [*this denotes the height is 120dp downwards*] ========================= This is what I want.[Upwards direction] ======================== [*this denotes the height is 120dp upwards*] TextView ======================== How can it be possible?
