Get user's non-truncated Active Directory groups from command line

I often use the net user command to have a look at AD groups for a user: net user /DOMAIN This works well, however the group names are truncated to around 20 characters. And in my organization, most group names are much longer than this. Does anyone know of a way to get non-truncated AD groups through the command line?
