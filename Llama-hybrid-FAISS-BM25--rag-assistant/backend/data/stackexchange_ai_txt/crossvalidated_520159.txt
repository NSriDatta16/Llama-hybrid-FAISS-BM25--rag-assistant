A confidence interval can be used whenever you estimate a population parameter and there is uncertainty involved and takes the form $\text{estimate} \pm \left(\text{critical value} \times \text{standard error}\right)$ . So instead of a point estimate you report a range over which you believe the parameter's values can lie (centered at the point estimate). For example, if you want to estimate the weights of people in a city, you could sample $1000$ people and take the average weight to get a number. But if you wanted a range you would create a confidence interval. It doesn't have to be $95\%$ . Other popular choices are $99\%, 90\%$ . But if we found that the mean weight in the sample was $120$ pounds and a $95\%$ confidence interval was found to be $(115, 125)$ , we'd say that we are $95\%$ confident that the true population mean lies in this interval. That is if we created a lot of $95\%$ confidence intervals, about that percentage of them would contain the true population mean. A $90\%$ confidence interval will always be narrower than a $95\%$ confidence interval.
