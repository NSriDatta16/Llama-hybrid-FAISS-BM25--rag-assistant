I have the same problem in my app when I requested info from twitter. In my case I didn't need to preserve those credentials, so I simple erase them using the next code: - (void) eraseCredentials{ NSURLCredentialStorage *credentialsStorage = [NSURLCredentialStorage sharedCredentialStorage]; NSDictionary *allCredentials = [credentialsStorage allCredentials]; //iterate through all credentials to find the twitter host for (NSURLProtectionSpace *protectionSpace in allCredentials) if ([[protectionSpace host] isEqualToString:@"twitter.com"]){ //to get the twitter's credentials NSDictionary *credentials = [credentialsStorage credentialsForProtectionSpace:protectionSpace]; //iterate through twitter's credentials, and erase them all for (NSString *credentialKey in credentials) [credentialsStorage removeCredential:[credentials objectForKey:credentialKey] forProtectionSpace:protectionSpace]; } } I hope it works for somebody :)
