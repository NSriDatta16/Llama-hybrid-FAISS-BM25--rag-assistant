With lme4, is it possible to weight group-level random effects by similarity?

I'm creating a model with two group-level random effects: district (factor) and age (factor) and a response, vodka (consumption of vodka). My data looks like this: age Vodka district 1 50 1 1 40 2 1 50 3 1 60 4 2 30 1 2 15 2 2 30 3 2 10 4 3 20 1 3 5 2 3 13 3 3 8 4 4 8 1 4 3 2 4 2 3 4 6 4 I'm realize I can pool my random effects with lme4 with a formula like this: Vodka ~ 1 + (1|district) + (1|age) But what I'm wondering is, is there a way to pool across the group effects in such a way that if you are in age category 1, more weight is given to group 2, and then less to group 3, and then less to group 4? Likewise, if you are in group 2, more weight is given to groups 1 or 3, and less to group 4. Etc.. If you are in group 3, more weight is given to groups 4 or 2, and less to group 1? In other words, is it possible to assign a function for the random effects weighting that puts more priority on age groups with a closer factor dummy variable? A bit more context per @robert.long: The age groups correspond with age ranges. Age 1 is 18-34; Age 2 is 35-45, etc. So my prior belief is that vodka drinkers of similar ages should have more pooling when calculating the group-level random effects than ages that are further apart.
