The trimDirectiveWhitespaces is only supported by servlet containers that support JSP 2.1 and after, or in the case or Tomcat, Tomcat 6 (and some versions e.g. Tomcat 6.0.10 don't implement it properly - don't know about the others). There's more information about trimDirectiveWhitespaces here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jsp-21-136414.html and here http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/trim_spaces_in_your_jsp1
