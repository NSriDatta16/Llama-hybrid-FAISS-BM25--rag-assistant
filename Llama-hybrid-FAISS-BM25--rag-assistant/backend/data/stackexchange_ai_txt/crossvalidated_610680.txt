Logistic regression assumes a particular functional form for the conditional probabilities $P(c|\mathbf x)$ ( $c$ being the class index). Under the Naive Bayes assumptions with some further restrictions ( $x_i|c$ are independent, gaussian distributed with the same variance), the conditional probabilities $P(c|\mathbf x)$ happen to have the same functional form. So you can view Logistic regression as a generalized model, of which this specific instance of Naive Bayes is a special case. Of course this can also viewed as one of the motivations for choosing this particular functional form.
