Proceeding with various methods for news recommendation

I am beginner in ML (i have done only Andrew Ng's ML course) and i have to work on news recommendation. I went through this paper which mentions different methods used for news recommendation (at 7th page) and most of them are using some sort of probabilistic methods ( bayesian networks, latent dirichlet allocation, naive bayes model, probabilistic matrix factorization models ). Also, some news recommenders are based on multi-armed-bandit problem (e.g. yahoo's front page). I have zero knowledge about these methods. I am very confused regarding what should be my next step. Right now, i am planning to go ahead with a very basic hybrid approach (with collaborative filtering and content based filtering). But it seems like i will have to explore these fields very soon, so what will be a good strategy (and resource) to explore these fields?
