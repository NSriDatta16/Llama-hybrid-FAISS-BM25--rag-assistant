You've not provided an awful lot of information for us to go on (such as the full code you typed and the full output), but the output is telling you that the effect of your predictor variable statistically significantly reduces the hazard of the average observation of experiencing the event (whatever that may be). If this isn't enough of an answer, you'll need to say more. I'd suggest that reading a good primer on how to interpret the statistics of survival analysis models wouldn't go amiss. One such is Paul Allison's second edition of "Event History and Survival Analysis" (07-46) published by Sage in their QASS series this year.
