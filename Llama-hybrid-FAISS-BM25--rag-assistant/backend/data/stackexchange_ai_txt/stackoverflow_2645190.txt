This looks like a system for organising OS directories or manila files in cabinets than a data model. So the question is, what is the value of this two-tier structure? Are there any attributes or functions attached to the higher tranche (121XX, etc)? If not, this becomes a mere display issue and should be handled as such. On the other hand, I don't see any real harm in implementing (121XX, 01) as a composite business key and using a surrogate key as as the primary key. There is one snag to watch out for: if the sales pick up you may reach 100K orders, at which point the order number will click over to six digits. In most flavours of database the natural sort order would be: 100XX 1000XX 101XX
