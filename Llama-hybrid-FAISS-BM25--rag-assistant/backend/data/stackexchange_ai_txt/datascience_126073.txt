I found an overview paper from 2020 summarizing it nicely: The encoder and decoder are key components of NMT architectures. There are many methods to build powerful encoders and decoders, which can roughly divide into three categories: recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods, convolution neural network (CNN) based methods and self-attention network (SAN) based methods https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666651020300024
