You do not convert an existing view controller into a navigation controller. Even though UINavigationController is a subclass of UIViewController, it's task is the management of other view controllers, not the management of views themselves. You don't swap them out one for the other. Instead, you set UIViewControllers to be controlled by the nav. To add a nav to a project in IB, open the xib and drag over a UINavigationController. Then set the navigation controller's rootControlller property to the existing UIViewController. And you're done.
