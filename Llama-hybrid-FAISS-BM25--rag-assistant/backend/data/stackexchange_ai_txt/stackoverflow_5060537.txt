Insert custom image into Magento Invoice or Packingslip PDF using Zend Framework

I am trying to insert a new image into my Magento invoice or packing slip, and I have found this code: (from /app/code/core/Mage/Sales/Model/Order/Pdf/Abstract.php) protected function insertLogo(&$page, $store = null) { $image = Mage::getStoreConfig('sales/identity/logo', $store); if ($image) { $image = Mage::getStoreConfig('system/filesystem/media', $store) . '/sales/store/logo/' . $image; if (is_file($image)) { $image = Zend_Pdf_Image::imageWithPath($image); $page->drawImage($image, 25, 758, 170, 860); } } //return $page; } I have made a copy in my local folder of /app/code/core/Mage/Sales/Model/Order/Pdf/Shipment.php which is the file i am trying to modify. I have tried various methods to point to a file i have on my server (not uploaded through the admin, just via FTP) but i can not get it to point to another file - it just refuses to create PDF or does nothing... this is where I am at so far: $image = Mage::getStoreConfig('system/filesystem/media/Chris-Sig.gif'); if (is_file($image)) { $image = Zend_Pdf_Image::imageWithPath($image); $page->drawImage($image, $x, $y, $x+30, $y+15); } Any ideas?
