E4X Add CDATA content

Basically I need to define a node name and its CDATA content using variables. var nodeName:String = "tag"; var nodeValue:String = " "; Naively I thought this would work : var xml:XML = Outputs : In a previous version of the script designed for FP9 I bypassed the problem by using : new XMLNode( XMLNodeType.XMLNodeType.CDATA_NODE, nodeValue ); // ... but this doesn't seem to work in FP10, and I have the feeling the method is somehow depreciated anyway. Anyone an elegant solution for this ?
