You will need to know the differences between dataframes, matrices and lists. Also the differences between the R vector data types (logical, character, numeric, factor, list) and language types (formula, expression, function, call) and the situations under which they will be coerced to the next level in their type-hierarchies. (R is loosely typed and has a fair amount of invisible coercion.) Various data-mining and text-mining packages have different conventions as to types of their expected inputs (and outputs). This is where @Glen_b's comments apply. The typical new user of R generally fails to read the Usage section of the R-help pages which are generally very specific if you pay attention to the various R object types. If using pandas, you may be able to easily transfer results from dataframes to the Python equivalent. The extraction and assignment operators ( "[" , "[[" , and "$" ) will require some careful study. There are a bunch of gotchas. (Avoid using attach and "$" if you can. Anything that can be done with "$" can be done with "[[" .)
