Refactoring a mod_rewrite depending if query string exisits

RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} lang_opt\=E RewriteRule /lc/courses.asp english-resource [R=301,NC,L] RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} lang_opt\=F RewriteRule /lc/courses.asp french-resource [R=301,NC,L] RewriteRule /lc/courses.asp english-resource [R=301,NC,L] A link comes in 3 flavors /lc/courses.asp /lc/courses.asp?lang=E /lc/courses.asp?lang=F Is there a more elegant way to deal with these 3 variations of a link. I have quite a few of them and 5 line of mod_rewite per seems excessive. Thanks
