If you have 1 sample per cluster as input , then you are not facing a clustering problem , but a classification one, where your training dataset is comprised of 1 sample per class. With the setup you described, the most direct approach would be 1-nearest neighbor, that is, k-nearest neighbors algorithm with $k=1$. I think any other machine learning classification algorithm you may try on your training dataset would probably end up with the similar results as 1-nn. Anyway, if you don't have have a test dataset, you cannot assess the correctness of your model .
