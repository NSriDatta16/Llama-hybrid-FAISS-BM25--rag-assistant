Create a batch to automate HTTPS GET requests

how can i create a batch that can send HTTPS requests ? byfar i used Fiddler Request Builder so i can send requests like: GET https://website.com/index.aspx?typeoflink=**[HERE-VARIABLE-FROM-FILE]**&min=1 HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* Referer: https://website.com/index.aspx?chknumbertypeoflink&min=1 Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Host: website.com Connection: Keep-Alive Cookie: cookieverrylongstringD%FG^&N*MJ( CVV%^B&N*&*(NHN*B*&BH*&H But i have to mannualy change the variable NOT GOOD... So the script would send many Requests and just changing the [HERE-VARIABLE-FROM-FILE] variable The variables are textnames in a file (one variable per line) if this could be done in a batch file or vbs or jscript or anything! Thanks in advance! adam
