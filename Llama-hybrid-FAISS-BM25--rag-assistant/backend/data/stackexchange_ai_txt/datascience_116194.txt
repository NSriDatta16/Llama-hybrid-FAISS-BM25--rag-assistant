Might I suggest? Logistic Regression or Logit Logit is appropriate when your feature variables are numeric, logical, and even oridinal. And, You have a binary response variable, T/F (0,1) Logistic regression can produce a simple 'explanatory' probabilities of success or failure. The probability cut-off can be adjusted to be more or less inclusive, depending on your need. Logit also gives Odds for a situation or, more accurately, log-odds. The odds can give a nice indication of the models worth or utility. For example, If the odds are 1:1 or 5:1 in favor of 'True', that to me is easy to see. Logit can be used for feature selection. It is also a great first step because it will help you determine the independent variable's importance. This could easily help one if you have to choose another variable to add or not. Given the nature of your question, Logit Regression is 'one of the first' models that any data analyst learns. For text variables, sometimes a simple replacement of x -> c(0,1,2) is all you need. ;))
