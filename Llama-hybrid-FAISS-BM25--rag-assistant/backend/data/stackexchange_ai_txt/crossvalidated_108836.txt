By the way the LLN is described in your case, the assumption is that all $X_i$ have the same expected value (you have $Ε(Χ_i) = \mu \;\;\forall i$). So, no, $E(X_i)$ cannot resolve to many different values, it is the fixed $\mu$. Then the statement is that the sample average converges to the common expected value. This generalizes: for random variables with different expected values, we have $$\frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nX_i \xrightarrow{p} \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nE(X_i)$$ Needed conditions differ, you should look them up. And, no, you do not add "samples" (i.e. realizations) of the random variables, you consider the sum of the random variables themselves (which are real-valued functions). And this is the whole "point" of the law : the average sum of functions converges in probability to the average sum of numbers.
