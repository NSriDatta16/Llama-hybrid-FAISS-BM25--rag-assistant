lars and glmnet operate on raw matrices. To includ interaction terms, you will have to construct the matrices yourself. That means one column per interaction (which is per level per factor if you have factors). Look into lm() to see how it does it (warning: there be dragons). To do it right now, do something like: To make an interaction term manually, you could (but maybe shouldn't , because it's slow) do: int = D["x1"]*D["x2"] names(int) = c("x1*x2") D = cbind(D, int) Then to use this in lars (assuming you have a y kicking around): lars(as.matrix(D), as.matrix(y)) I wish I could help you more with the other questions. I found this one because lars is giving me grief and the documentation in it and on the web is very thin.
