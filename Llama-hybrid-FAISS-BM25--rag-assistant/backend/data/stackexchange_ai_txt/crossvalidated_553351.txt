Error in forecasting using ARIMA with multiple regressors

I'm trying to do a multivariate time series forecasting using dynamic regression. The data was collected for 148 weeks with two main variables- Shipment Qty(dependent variable) and Net.Production.Qty(independent variable). The training data is first 118 weeks and the test data is remaining 30 weeks. First, I'm going to forecast the Net Production Qty- test set 30 weeks information using Arima with Fourier term Second, I'm going to generate the Fourier values and best fit model for Shipment test data set Third, I'm going to forecast the Shipment Qty using Net.Production.Qty forecasted values(test set 30 weeks) and Fourier values of Shipment data set as co-variates. P.S. I have edited my input data here to contain only 26 weeks with test data as 13 weeks. And this is the error I get - Error in forecast.forecast_ARIMA(bestfit.Shipment, xreg = cbind(final.prod,c: Number of regressors does not match fitted model Could anyone please help me resolve this error? library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) library(lubridate) library(ISOweek) library(feasts) library(fable) Shipment.df structure(list(YearWeek = c("201901", "201902", "201903", "201904", "201905", "201906", "201907", "201908", "201909", "201910", "201911", "201912", "201913", "201914", "201915", "201916", "201917", "201918", "201919", "201920", "201921", "201922", "201923", "201924", "201925", "201926"), Shipment = c(418, 1442, 1115, 1203, 1192, 1353, 1191, 1411, 933, 1384, 1362, 1353, 1739, 1751, 1595, 1380, 1711, 2058, 1843, 1602, 2195, 2159, 2009, 1812, 2195, 1763), Production = c(0, 198, 1436, 1055, 1396, 1330, 1460, 1628, 1513, 1673, 1737, 1274, 1726, 1591, 2094, 1411, 2009, 1909, 1759, 1693, 1748, 1455, 2078, 1717, 1737, 1886), Net.Production.Qty = c(22, 188, 1428, 1031, 1382, 1368, 1456, 1578, 1463, 1583, 1699, 1318, 1582, 1537, 2118, 1567, 1961, 1897, 1767, 1603, 1666, 1419, 2186, 1621, 1677, 1840)), row.names = c(NA, 26L), class = "data.frame") Shipment.df % mutate(isoweek = str_replace(YearWeek, "^(\\d{4})(\\d{2}) $", "\\1-W\\2-1"), date = ISOweek::ISOweek2date(isoweek)) Shipment2.df date $date) Shipment.train.df date >= "2018-12-31" & Shipment.df $date mean Shipment4.df $aicc aicc) { bestfit.Shipment
