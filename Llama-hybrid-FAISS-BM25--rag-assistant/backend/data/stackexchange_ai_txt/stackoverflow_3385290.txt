The fact that: ParameterExpression parameter = Expression.Variable(typeof(object)); Is defined after all the body should be the clue; essentially, you simply aren't even looking at the object you pass in; you are only looking at instanceParameter , which is (in your code) simply an unassigned variable. Basically, drop the final parameter declaration, and don't declare instanceParameter as a variable: Expression finalExpression = Expression.Block( new[] { resultVariable }, targetFragments); MyType2 result = Expression.Lambda >( finalExpression, instanceParameter).Compile()(instance);
