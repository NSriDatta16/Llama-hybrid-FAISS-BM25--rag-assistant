Are .NET languages really making any kind of dent in consumer desktop applications?

Do you write consumer desktop applications with .NET languages? If so what type? My impression is that most consumer desktop applications are still native compiled applications in C, C++ and the like. Whilst .NET languages are growing in up take and popularity, do these new breed of applications ever break out of the enterprise & web domain to become high street consumer applications? For example look at your desktop now? how many applications are written in .NET languages, Firefox? Microsoft Office? Thunderbird? iTunes? Microsoft Visual Studio? My company develops high end CAD/CAE applications we leverage new technology but our core development is still done with C++.
