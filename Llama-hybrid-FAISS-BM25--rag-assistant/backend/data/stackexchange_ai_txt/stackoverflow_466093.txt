As in Josh's answer, by adding the following lines to your code should make it work: book_count++; if(tolower(fgetc(stdin)) == 'y') { if((book_shelf[book_count] = (Book *)malloc(sizeof(Book))) == NULL) { printf("Cannot allocate memory for Book"); exit(1); } return getUserInput(s); } else { return; } However, I encourage you not to use the recursive function for getting input. Recursive can lead to difficulties in debugging. You may consider using normal loop instead. Note: I'm assuming the book_count is global variable which has been initialized to 0
