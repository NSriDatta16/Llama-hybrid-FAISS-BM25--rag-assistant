Is a hypothesis test useful if our null hypothesis is not the true value?

Assume we are testing if the true average weight of milk cartons is 100g. We may specify $H_0: \mu = 100$ and $H_1: \mu \ne 100$ . Let's assume the true weight is 102. In the course of testing we may calculate metrics, such as the type 1 error for example. This is the probability that we reject a null hypothesis given that it is true. But isn't this a non-sensical number if the true $\mu$ isn't the same as the null in our test? And given that this is the likely situation in the real world, what information does a hypothesis test really give us if we do not correctly specify the null hypothesis?
