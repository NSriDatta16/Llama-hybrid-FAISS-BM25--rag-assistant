What is the best way to save my POJOs into Jackrabbit JCR?

In Jackrabbit I have experienced two ways to save my POJOs into repository nodes for storage in the Jackrabbit JCR: writing my own layer and using Apache Graffito Writing my own code has proven time consuming and labor intensive (had to write and run a lot of ugly automated tests) though quite flexible. Using Graffito has been a disappointment because it seems to be a "dead" project stuck in 2006 What are some better alternatives?
