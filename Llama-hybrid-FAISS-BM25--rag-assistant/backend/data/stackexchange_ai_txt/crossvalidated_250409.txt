Explanation on the dependent variable in a logistic regression

In logistic regression, I often see this picture: And according to literature, the logistic regression is performed as $$\ln \left({\frac {p(x)}{1-p(x)}}\right)=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}x,$$ I would like to ask on the calculation of $p(x)$. If $p(x)$ equals 1 (0) as in this picture, the odds ratio $\ln \left({\frac {p(x)}{1-p(x)}}\right)$ would be undefined. From my understanding, the correct translation would be $p(x)=\hat{p}$ when $Y=1$ and $p(x)=1-\hat{p}$ when $Y=0$ (where $\hat{p}$ representing the relative proportion of 1s in the sample). Is this correct?
