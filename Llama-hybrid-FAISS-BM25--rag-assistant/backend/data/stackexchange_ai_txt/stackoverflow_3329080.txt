Is there a way to inherit properties from multiple classes in C#?

Possible Duplicate: Multiple Inheritance in C# In the following example, I want the Shirt to automatically inherit the properties of both the Material and Pigment classes. Is this even possible in C#? public class Material { public enum FabricTypes { Cotton, Wool, Polyester, Nylon } public FabricTypes Fabric { get; set; } public Color Color { get; set; } } public class Pigment { public enum PigmentQualities { Fine, Average, Poor } public PigmentQualities Quality { get; set; } public Color Color { get; set; } } public class Shirt : Material //, Pigment { public Shirt() { Fabric = FabricTypes.Cotton; Color = new Color(); //Quality = PigmentQualities.Fine; } } I'm having a hard time furnishing a better example, but this is essentially what I'm trying to do. I realize I can create interfaces, but those won't automatically inherit the properties. See, because I don't want to have to manually punch in all those properties every time I create a class that is similar to Shirt .
