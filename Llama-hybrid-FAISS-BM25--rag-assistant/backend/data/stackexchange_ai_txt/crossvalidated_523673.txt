Based on an answer I got from the author, it appears that the transformation does not add any bias by itself to the learning process of a machine learning pipeline when the training ans test sets are independent. The transformed values are not however as straightforward to interpret as the original values, thus it is suggested to plot the transformed values against the original values for better interpretation (as also available in the package vignette ). The reason is that the transformation does not preserve the scale of the original data as it is also discussed in https://github.com/petersonR/bestNormalize/issues/1
