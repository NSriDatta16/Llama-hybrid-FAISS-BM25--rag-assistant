Which formula to use for logistic regression with different predictors?

I'm doing a logistic regression with "Choice" (Yes or No) as dependent variable and 3 different predictors, including reward, demand (5 level each) and condition (0 or 1) and their interaction, as well as the participants ID as a random effect (it's a between-group design, so a single ID per participant). Based on literature, I found two different formulas that were used in similar analysis. Now the thing is that both formulas give different results. Formula 1 tells me that there are 2 significant interaction effects, whereas formula 2 tells me that there is only 1 significant interaction effect. Since my interpretation depends largely on the interaction effects, I am uncertain which formula to use and which result to report. These are the formulas I've been using 'Choice ~ 1 + Reward x Demand xCondition + (1|ID)' and 'Choice ~ Reward x Demand x Condition + (1 + Reward + Demand + Condition|ID)' I used both codes in R and Matlab, it's alway the same results. I'd appreciate every help of you people!
