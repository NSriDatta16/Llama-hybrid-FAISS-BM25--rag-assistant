How to make forecasts for a time series?

I am not that familiar with the analysis of time series data. However, I have what I think is a simple prediction task to address. I have about five years of data from a common generating process. Each year represents a monotonically increasing function with a non-linear component. I have counts for each week over a 40 week cycle for each year. The process starts, the function begins at zero, increases rather quickly over the first half of the function, slowing over the second half before leveling during the last five weeks. The process is consistent across years with small differences in rate of change and volume across the segments from year to year. $$ y_{1}=\{0, N_{t1}, N_{t2}, ... N_{t39}, N_{t40}\} $$ $$ \vdots $$ $$ y_{5}=\{0, N_{t1}, N_{t2}, ... N_{t39}, N_{t40}\} $$ Where $N_{tx}$ equal the count at time x. The goal is to take $N$ at $tx$ (or better $t0$ to $tx$, or the slope to that point) and predict the $N$ at $t40$. For example, if $N_{t10}$ is 5000 what is the expected value of $N_{t40}$ for that year. So, the question is, how would you model such data? It's easy enough to summarize and visualize. But I'd like a model to facilitate predictions and incorporate a measure of error.
