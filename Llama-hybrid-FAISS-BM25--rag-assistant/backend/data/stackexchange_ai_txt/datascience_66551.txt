How to process Dicom Images for CNN?

I am building a disease classifier. I have Dicom scans for many patients. The scans have different slice thickness, and different scans have different number of slices. However, the slice thickness for a single patient's scan has the same thickness for all slices. For example: Patient1's scan : 100 slices of 2mm thickness Patient2's scan : 500 slices of 1mm thichness The number of pixels for each slice is 512 x 512, so currently the shape of nd array containing the information for Patient1 is 100*512*512 Patient2 is 500*512*512 I want to pass all patients information into a CNN. Do I need to resample the slices and make it uniform for all patients (like 512*512*n ). If yes, how to do it, and what should be the value of 'n'?
