Can I use one conjugate prior for samples from two normal distributions with same variance but different mean?

I have got a set $\{Y_t\}$ of observations consisting of two subsets $\{Y_{t,1}\}$ and $\{Y_{t,2}\} \subset \{Y_t\}$ with $\{Y_{t,1}\} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma^2)$ and $\{Y_{t,2}\} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2,\sigma^2)$ i.e. different means but the same variance (resulting from a regime switching model). I know the means and want to draw a sample of $\sigma^2$ in a step of a MCMC estimation. In the case of $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ I would have used the conjugate prior of the Inverse Gamma distribution (see [1], "Normal with known mean"). Can I use a conjugate prior in the case of $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ as well? For example by setting $\beta = \beta_0 + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=0}^n(Y_i - \mu_{I_i})^2 $ ($I_i$ being the correct indices according to the observations)? Or will I have to use Metropolis-Hastings to get my sample of $\sigma^2$? Best, Matt [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#Continuous_distributions
