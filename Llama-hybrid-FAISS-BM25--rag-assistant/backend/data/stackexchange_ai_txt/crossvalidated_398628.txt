In addition to user3658307's comprehensive answer I'd like to mention Generative Adversarial Networks (image to image translation GANs specifically) - they should come in handy if you can give them enough training data. The advantage over OCR-based methods would be simplicity - you don't need to build any pipeline, the method learns the transformation end-to-end. Image to Image translation aims at recovering transform that maps images from one domain to second one - this looks exactly like your problem - in fact, I think it's not a difficult one (other examples cover generating images of cats/items from sketches, which seems harder). I encourage you to visit the method authors website . It contains many examples as well as links to implementations.
