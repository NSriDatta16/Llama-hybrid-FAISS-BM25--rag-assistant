I agree with Ivanbgd's answer, with the addition that you may then want to consider extensions to the basic GAN architecture, such as those which attempt to enforce a bijective mapping from the generated domain to the target domain e.g. CycleGAN, DiscoGAN, which are typically aimed at reducing the problem of mode collapse . Without this your GAN may learn to create one butterfly-esque image very well, and that is it. It doesn't look like you are suffering from these issues yet but may be worth considering in the future. Below is a Github repo for a project I worked on to implement such GANs to achieve style transfer, which may be of interest to you. The basic GAN implemented in the project uses the CNN architecture outlined by Ivanbgd, in TensorFlow. https://github.com/ZacKeskin/GAN-Factory
