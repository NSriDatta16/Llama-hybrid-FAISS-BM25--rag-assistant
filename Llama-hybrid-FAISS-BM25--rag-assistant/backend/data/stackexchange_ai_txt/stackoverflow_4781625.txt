Real World Haskell has some insights about this in the Monad Transformers chapter: In an ideal world, would we make a break from the past, and switch over Prelude to use Traversable and Foldable types? Probably not. Learning Haskell is already a stimulating enough adventure for newcomers. The Foldable and Traversable abstractions are easy to pick up when we already understand functors and monads, but they would put early learners on too pure a diet of abstraction. For teaching the language, it's good that map operates on lists, not on functors.
