Detrending for a large dataset consisting of many group time-series

I have a huge dataset consisting of many individuals (~20000), each with a month of daily data. I am thinking of detrending those individual time series that are non-stationary but visually inspecting each time series for a trend before detrending them is going to be very time-consuming. My questions are: Is it appropriate to detrend all the time-series without inspecting them? And what happens if one detrends a time-series that is already stationary?
