Binary classification machine learning

I have data set (30,000) mapping people to incomes( some number) each instance has 15 features so as age, education. I would like some advice/pointers as to the best machine learning classifier for my task. To be implemented in Java to train. I have three main choice decision tress, navie bayes or a perception but am not sure which would best fit my problem. Any java implementations i could be pointed in the direction of would also be great. Thanks
