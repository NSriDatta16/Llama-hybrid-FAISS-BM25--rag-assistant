In addition to Ben's answer, the subtle distinction between statistical models and machine learning models is that, in statistical models, you explicitly decide the output equation structure prior to building the model. The model is built to compute the parameters/coefficients. Take linear model or GLM for example, y = a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 Your independent variables are x1, x2, x3 and the coefficients to be determined are a1,a2,a3. You define your equation structure this way prior to building the model and compute a1,a2,a3. If you believe that y is somehow correlated to x2 in a non-linear way, you could try something like this. y = a1x1 + a2(x2)^2 + a3x3. Thus, you put a restriction in terms of the output structure. Inherently statistical models are linear models unless you explicitly apply transformations like sigmoid or kernel to make them nonlinear (GLM and SVM). In case of machine learning models, you rarely specify output structure and algorithms like decision trees are inherently non-linear and work efficiently. Contrary to what Ben pointed out, machine learning models aren't just about prediction, they do classification, regression etc which can be used to make predictions which are also done by various statistical models.
