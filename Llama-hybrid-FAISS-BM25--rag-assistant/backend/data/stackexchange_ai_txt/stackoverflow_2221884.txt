Flex, Cairngorm and XML-RPC

I'm new to Flex, and Cairngorm so bear with me... I need to integrate a Flex application with a Magento site. I prefer to do it with XML-RPC instead of web services because of speed and our other applications integrate via this method. I'm using the as3-rpclib to do the XML-RPC communication. I can get things to talk, but timing is a real problem. I'm getting confused with Events, Services, Singletons, etc... I (think I) want to have a singleton spin up the XML-RPC object, login and get the token and store it in the singleton. Then the delegates can get the service and call the Magento methods. Thoughts??
