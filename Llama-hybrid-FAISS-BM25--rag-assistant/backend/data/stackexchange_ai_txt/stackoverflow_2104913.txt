I'd use the Glow Filter idea TBH... But where is that mask coming from? Depending on that answer I have two ideas: If it's coming from user input , as in, a user is drawing a shape WITHIN the flash app, then it's pretty easy: You would record an array of points while the user was "drawing" the shape. Then you create and draw two movie clips One with a fill that would be the mask. And another with an outline that would be the outline to go over the mask. If it's coming from outside the flash app , it's possible , but it would be slower than dirt . You could: Take the mask movie (assuming it's all black) and convert it to a Bitmap object. Then step through the bitmask object, pixel by pixel, to determine the outer points of the object. Then the not so easy part (LOL): Then step through all of the points and reorganize them so the they're all next to the two closest points to them in the array. Then you could create a new movie and draw the points as lines on that movie, placing it in a layer above the mask.
