Drag and Drop along a diagonal line?

Are there any examples of a drag-and-drop solution in which the elements being dragged can only move along a slanted line? For example, constrain an element's draggability so that it can only be moved along a 30ยบ line, or 10ยบ, etc. Most examples I've been able to find only constrain the dragged element's area to either a vertical or horizontal line, or to within a larger parent div. Possibly related: Drag along a diagonal line no further than 100px, or along a curve.
