First approach is usually penalized if you are using some sort of ORM or automatically generate your DAL ( SubSonic? ).You will retreive the Image column (and it's data) everytime you pass arround a DAL object (or a collection), so normally I would use scenario 2 (or 3) From the SQL perspective either scenarios will work about the same depending on your storage engine (ISAM, InnoDB,etc), but even there the benefits and diferences between scenarios are minor.
