After a lot of help here and some more research, we finally came across the answer. To solve our issue we did the following: No longer inherit from ServiceComponent (This is ok, since we are not actually leveraging any specific COM+ features) Utilized the following commands to install the component, which must be done in order: gacutil /i "C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ASPTest*name of dll*" regasm /tlb "C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ASPTest*name of dll*" This process eliminated the original errors and also had the added benefit of being able to replace the dll while IIS is running.
