Is there a machine learning framework that supports partial evaluation ie can return a function?

Is there a machine learning framework that supports partial evaluation ? For example: We train on [model, year, km, ..., colour, price] . Today we call get_prediction(model, year, km, ..., colour) It returns the value of price , ie a number (or a probability for a label). Say I would like to call get_prediction_function(model, year, ..., colour) It should return a function price(km) . (That function returns a number.) Essentially we are pulling out a dimension or two. In theory of course it gives us nothing, it just postpones some calculation. (In practice this small specialised object is very useful in some production applications.)
