From my knowledge it decomposes the time series to a seasonal component as well since you specify it, that the seasonality is 4. Moreover, you could check the seasonality with 4 using the TStools (seasplot() function), it will provide you with a p-value of how significant is that seasonality, which seems more informative than a TRUE or a FALSE.
