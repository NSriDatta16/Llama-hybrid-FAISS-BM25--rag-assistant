Your approach would be equivalent to a standard ABC-MCMC method (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09650 ) where the summary statistic is just the full data, i.e. $S(y) = y$ . The biases induced by this procedure are fairly standard, namely: The approximation error of replacing the true posterior by the ABC posterior, and The Monte Carlo error of using MCMC to approximate the posterior.
