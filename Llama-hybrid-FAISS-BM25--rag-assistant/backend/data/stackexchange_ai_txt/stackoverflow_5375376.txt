How to implement IDropTarget in an CSharp Application and register it for file types?

I'm implementing a small tool in C# which works on files. Because I'm lazy I want to register my tool on the file types in the registry to be able to simply open all my files from the explorer. Currently I am using HCR\MyFile\shell\open\command to specify the calling command line to my program with "%1" for the current file. This works fine for single files, but oviously not when selecting multiple files. I found out that my application should implement IDropTraget to get multiple files, but I don't know how to do this. How to my CSharp "application" implement IDropTraget ? How to I then register my application in the windows registry for the file types correctly to get it called? I am relatively new to the whole COM stuff. I "used" it several times now, but I never wrote a COM-class by my own. Is there an example or tutorial? (I searched, but found nothing, at least I recognized nothing in this direction) Thanks!
