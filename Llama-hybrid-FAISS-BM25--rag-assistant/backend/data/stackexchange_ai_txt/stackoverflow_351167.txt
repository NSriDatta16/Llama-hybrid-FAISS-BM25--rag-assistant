Verbosity and readability often go hand-in-hand. Lately I've come to fear the word "Elegant", because it generally translates into "Fun but less immediately readable" Of course the person writing the code always says "Well it's MORE readable to me because it's shorter/more elegant. that's crap. It's always easier to read something more explicit unless you have so much trouble reading that it takes you two hours to get through a Dick and Jane novel. Note that I'm not talking about redundancies, just being explicit and spelling out your desires. As a programmer it's much MUCH more fun to write elegant expressions, but I've found myself looking at the "elegance" of others and even my own "elegance" after a while and I'll change it to something more explicit, readable and reliable when I realize that although it was fun to write, I just spent more time reading/debugging it than it took to write in the first place. On the other hand, DIM is just stupid :)
