I use EE daily. All the differences I can detect are in the form of extra modules in "app/code/core/Enterprise", class names start with "Enterprise" instead of "Mage", some are encoded with ionCube. There is an "enterprise" theme too but it is very similar to "modern". The rest of Magento is the same as the Community Edition so your extension will likely work on both equally. However you cannot claim compatibility without testing it, that would be irresponsible. It is possible you have overridden something which is then later re-overridden by the other edition. You probably don't want to buy a years licence just for that so you'll have to ask for volunteers, the best places are Magento's forum and chat . Failing that you could advertise on one of the many freelance programmer sites for someone who is in a position to help, that will be cheaper than a whole copy of EE. Lastly there is the issue of registering on Magento Connect. So far only aheadWorks have the privilege of appearing in the "Enterprise Ed." section. (The "Professional Ed." section isn't even active yet.) You may not get a chance to list your extension there although you can always explain the salient parts on your own website.
