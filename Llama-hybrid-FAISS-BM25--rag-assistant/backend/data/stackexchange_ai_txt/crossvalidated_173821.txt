Let's recall the program we are trying to solve when running a SVM. $$\text{maximize}_{\alpha} ~~ \alpha^T1-\alpha^TQ\alpha$$ $$\text{subject to:} \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_iy_i=0,~0\leq \alpha_i\leq c$$ Where the labels $y_i$ take values in $\{-1,1\}$. Without going too deep in the details, SMO works updating pairs of multipliers $(\alpha_i,\alpha_j)$ several times. Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_iy_i=0$ before the update. If you just moved only one of the $\alpha$, this constraint would be violated, since the $y$ are non zero. Edit. Details. Say $\alpha_1'=\alpha_1+\epsilon$ is the only updated $\alpha$. The linear term in the constraint: $\sum_{i=1}^N \alpha'_iy_i=\epsilon_1y_1$ and is non-zero any more. Some more information can be found here : http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/68391/smo-book.pdf
