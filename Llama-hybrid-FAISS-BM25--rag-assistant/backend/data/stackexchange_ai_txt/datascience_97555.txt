How to model a 3D graph into a vector so that I can feed it into a classification algorithm?

I have a 3D graph like below: Ref: google images It has 2 angles as X and Y and the Z axis is amplitude value (Each 3D graph is representing a pixel). I want to model this into some useful data structure like a graph or a vector considering some parameters extracted from the above 3D graph, so that I'll be able to feed it into a classification algorithm. But, I'm unable to extract all the local minimas/maximas, or slopes. How do I do it using in python? I'm not exactly asking for code (libraries and code will be definitely appreciated) but rather the methodologies used. Can I use Machine learning to extract certain parameters from the graph? I'm really new to this and I don't even know how to exactly frame the question, so I do apologise for low quality question. Please point me towards something so that I can look and read from there.
