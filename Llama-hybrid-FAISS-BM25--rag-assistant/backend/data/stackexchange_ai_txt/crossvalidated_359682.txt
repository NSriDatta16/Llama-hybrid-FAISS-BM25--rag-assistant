Answer : If you use Statsmodels' SARIMAX, then you are using the first specification you listed: regression with ARMA (or more generally SARIMA) errors. Details : Although it may not be so clear because of the generality of the mathematical notation that is used, this is what is described in the statsmodels documentation ( https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html ): "In terms of this model, regression with SARIMA errors can be represented easily as: $$ \begin{split} y_t & = \beta_t x_t + u_t \\ \phi_p(L) \tilde \phi_p (L^s) \Delta^d \Delta_s^D u_t & = A(t) + \theta_q(L) \tilde \theta_q(L^s) \zeta_t \end{split} $$ " in your case, we have the following restrictions: $u_t \equiv n_t$ (just a notation difference) $\tilde \phi_p(L^s) = 1$, $\Delta^d = 1$, $\Delta_s^D = 1,$ and $\tilde \theta_q(L^s) = 1$, since you don't have seasonal or differencing components $A(t) = 0$ since you don't have any trend components $\beta_t = \beta$ since the regression coefficients are not time-varying $\phi_p(L) = (1 - \phi_1 L - \dots - \phi_p L^p)$ is the autoregressive lag polynomial $\theta_q(L) = (1 + \theta_1 L + \dots + \theta_q L^q)$ is the moving average lag polynomial
