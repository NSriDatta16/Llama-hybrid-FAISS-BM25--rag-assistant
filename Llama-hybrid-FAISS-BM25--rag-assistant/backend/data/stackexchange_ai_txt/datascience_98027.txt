Finding if an outcome is predictable

Suppose we are asked to predict something given a set of features, how do we know if that target is actually predictable ? That is, how do we know if there is actually some relation between the dependant and independent features or there are some patterns in the data which could be exploited by a machine learning algorithm? What if the target outcomes are just random? How do we test for this relationship before we start building ML/DL models?
