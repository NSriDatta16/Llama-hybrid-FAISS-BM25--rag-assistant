If you are writing a program for fun or to learn about encryption, great, explore and learn. If you are using a major language there are lots of available libraries free to use that will do encryption properly for you. I'd highly recommend leveraging one of these libraries if you are doing this as a professional endeavor. If you are looking to learn more about encryption start with the book Applied Cryptography from Bruce Schneier its old but will give you a good base understanding and you can find newer texts from him or other reputable authors to build upon that knowledge. He has a site at http://www.schneier.com/
