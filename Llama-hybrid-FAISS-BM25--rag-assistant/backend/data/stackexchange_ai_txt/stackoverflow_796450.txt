round number to nearest 0.2 with PHP

I'm creating this rating system using 5-edged stars. And I want the heading to include the average rating. So I've created stars showing 1/5ths. Using "1.2" I'll get a full star and one point on the next star and so on... But I haven't found a good way to round up to the closest .2... I figured I could multiply by 10, then round of, and then run a switch to round 1 up to 2, 3 up to 4 and so on. But that seems tedious and unnecessary...
