Use keypress instead of keyup/keydown because the latter two do not accurately protray the keycode ( reference , see last paragraph). You can reference the altKey ctrlKey and shiftKey boolean properties of the event object in this case... $(document).keypress(function(e) { var key = String.fromCharCode(e.which); var alt = e.altKey; var ctrl = e.ctrlKey var shift = e.shiftKey; alert("Key:" + key + "\nAlt:" + alt + "\nCtrl:" + ctrl + "\nShift:" + shift); }); Also, you can use String.fromCharCode to translate the key code to an actual letter. You can't trap multiple keys aside from combinations with Ctrl, Alt, and Shift. You simply can't do it in a single event. So throw the a+s+d+f idea out the window. Note: Obviously there are certain key combinations that are used by the browser. For instance, Alt + F usually brings up the File menu in Windows. Ctrl + N usually launches a new window/tab. Do not attempt to override any of these combinations. Here's a live demo for your testing pleasure.
