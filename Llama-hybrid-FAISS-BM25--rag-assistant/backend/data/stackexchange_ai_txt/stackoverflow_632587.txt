How to communicate with .NET 3.5 SP1 bootstrapper

I'm building a custom Windows installer package for my .NET 3.5 SP1 WPF application. I want it to detect what version (if any) of the .NET framework is installed on the client's computer, and then automatically download it from Microsoft if they don't have it. Now, I've read about the .NET bootstrapper and even seen it in action in a ClickOnce installer I made. It seems to do just what I need. The problem is, I don't want to use ClickOnce. I'm partial to NSIS. So essentially I'm looking for some documentation on how to communicate with or integrate the bootstrapper in some way so I can leverage it inside my own installer. But I'm not finding much. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Steve
