The CRAP formula is: var complexity = ...; //cyclomatic complexity of a method var coverage = ...; //test code coverage for the method var crap = Math.pow(complexity,2) * Math.pow(1 â€“ coverage/100,3) + complexity; So, you need to calculate the cyclomatic complexity and calculate the test code coverage (or here ).
