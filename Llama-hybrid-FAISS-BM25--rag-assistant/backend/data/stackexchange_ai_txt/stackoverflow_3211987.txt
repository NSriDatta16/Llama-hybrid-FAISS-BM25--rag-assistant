Unfortunately, adding the javaee-(web)-api as a dependency doesn't give you the Javadoc or the Source to the Servlet Api to browse them from within the IDE. This is also the case for all other dependencies (JPA, EJB, ...) If you need the Servlet API sources/javadoc, you can add the following to your pom.xml (works at least for JBoss&Glassfish): Repository: jboss-public-repository-group JBoss Public Repository Group https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/ Dependency: org.jboss.spec.javax.servlet jboss-servlet-api_3.0_spec 1.0.0.Beta2 provided I completely removed the javaee-api from my dependencies and replaced it with the discrete parts (javax.ejb, javax.faces, ...) to get the sources and Javadocs for all parts of Java EE 6. EDIT: Here is the equivalent Glassfish dependency (although both dependencies should work, no matter what appserver you use). org.glassfish javax.servlet 3.0 provided
