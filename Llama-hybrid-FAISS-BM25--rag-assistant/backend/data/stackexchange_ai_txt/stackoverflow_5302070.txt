Load testing against web application installed in VM

As everyone knows fixing hardware specs for webapp installation point for loading testing is as important as finding good metrics to address the testing purpose. However, the reality is there isn't an available physical machine that i can leverage with, which forces to find alternative solution - a virtual machine. Fortunately, my company uses vmware (ESXI) and I am grateful that I can have access to it. But when I attempt to create a VM for myself, it seems that I am not even able to tell the actual hardware spec. of the VM I was going to create, so it's kind of hard to map back to the kind of physical machine i am simulating for. Does this really matter to load testing? Word of advice will be appreciated Thanks
