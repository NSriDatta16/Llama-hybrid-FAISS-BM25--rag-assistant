The structure changed in 7, the field is keyed by language first ("und" by default which means "undefined"), then you can follow this example: // Array of Image values $images = $node->field_images['und']; //If you don't know the language, the value is stored in: $node->language // First image $image = $images[0]; // If you need informations about the file itself (e.g. image resolution): image_get_info( $image["filename"] ); // If you want to access the image, use the URI instead of the filename ! $public_filename = file_create_url( $image["uri"] ); // Either output the IMG tag directly, $html = ' '; // either use the built-in theme function. $html = theme( "image", array( "path" => $public_filename, "title" => $image["title"] ) ); Note the usage of the uri instead of the filename for embedding the image in a page because the File API in Drupal 7 is more abstracted (to make it easier to integrate with CDN services).
