How to find the number of clusters when more than one datasets are aggregated as one?

Suppose 3 datasets has 3 ,7, 4 clusters in their respective dataset. When I aggregated them as one dataset what's the safest number of cluster to choose as perimeter for kmeans or any supervised clustering? Already tried by considering average(3,7,4) but not giving me near to good solution as the dataset can vary with dimensions, number of samples etc.
