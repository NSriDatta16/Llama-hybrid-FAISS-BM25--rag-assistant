jQuery with quicksearch plugin performance problems

I'm using the jQuery quicksearch plugin to search for items in a table of data. Very slick and works fantastically well when there are a reasonable number of rows. (Reasonable number: Less than 200 rows with 10 columns which an average of 20 characters per cell.) When I increase the number of rows performance drops off and it becomes unusable. I have 2 questions: Are there any tips/tricks to improve performance of this plugin or something that I may have misconfigured to make it perform poorly? What are the alternative jQuery plugins that I might consider to replace this one given that I anticipate having many rows in the table?
