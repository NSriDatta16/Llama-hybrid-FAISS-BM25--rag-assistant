Should we normalize test data by choosing maximum and minimum value of training data?

I'm training my CNN network with one model's data whereas i'm testing it with another model's data. I perform min max normalization on each sample. And every samples ranges [-1,1]. My question is that while performing min-max normalization we pick minimum and maximum value in each sample's features. For the test data should I choose minimum and maximum of each sample Or should I normalize it with the minimum and maximum value of training data?
