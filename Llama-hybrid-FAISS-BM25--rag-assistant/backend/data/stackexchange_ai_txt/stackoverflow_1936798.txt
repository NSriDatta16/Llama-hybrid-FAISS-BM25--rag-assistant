ListView Headers Don't Show Up

I am doing a windows mobile application 6.1. I dragged in a listview and went to columns and added columns to my list view. When I run the listview they do not show up. I then tried to add them through C# code on page load with the follow code. ColumnHeader header = new ColumnHeader(); header.Text = "gkgag"; header.Width = 100; header.TextAlign = HorizontalAlignment.Center; listView1.Columns.Add(header); this does not work either. Why don't they show up?
