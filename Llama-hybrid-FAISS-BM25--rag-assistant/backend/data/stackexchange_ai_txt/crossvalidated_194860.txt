It depends on the network. In a convolutional neural network, or any sort of network without full connectivity between layers, it will matter. But in a standard fully connected network it will make no difference at all, even when doing image classification. The reasoning behind this is that the output of a neuron is the sum of its inputs multiplied by the weight connecting them. If you change the order of the numbers in a sum you still get the same answer. Now what WILL matter is consistancy. If you have the order of your inputs as "a c d b e" for one training example, it will have to be the same for all other training data.
