I believe one of the tools from the JiBX suite would do the job. I guess no-one have meant them to be used at runtime, probably once only, but still I don't see anything that would stop you from embedding it into your runtime code. BTW, I don't quite follow why do you want a class to be generated at runtime. If you generate a class at runtime how is it different (or what value it brings when compared to) than plain Map property map?
