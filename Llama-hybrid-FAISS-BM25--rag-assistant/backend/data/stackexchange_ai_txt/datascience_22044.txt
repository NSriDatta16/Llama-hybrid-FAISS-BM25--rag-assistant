Avoid neural networks for weekly sales data. There simply is not enough data points to make it work. The technique works great with image or video data (it can recognize numbers, or cat videos) but you need something in the neighborhood of 200,000 data points to train your network. Imagine the cost and complexity of getting 200,000 weekly data points (that is something between 3,000 and 4,000 years of collecting).
