Even with Webforms, the Design view is pretty useless. It's nowhere near the wysiwyg editor you're envisioning for even a relatively simple website design. While you can technically drag-and-drop components onto the page, they usually bear no resemblance to the rendered html. If you want to design website with either ASP.Net framework, you'll need to be comfortable writing markup. The upside of this is that the MVC framework makes the markup side of things greatly simplified.
