As a pragmatic approach to handle dual character of an ordinal variable,(categorical and continuous) is a calibration. Otherwise. it will be complex to work with a set independent standards due to levels from an ordinal variable. So the continuous dependent variable needs to be re-scaled to one chosen level from the ordinal variable. After calibrate it from all levels to one chosen level, there is a re-scaled set as if the dependent dataset is based at one level. The categorical character of the ordinal variable can be disregard. Then a regression is possible with the re-scaled set with "ordinal" variable as continuous variable. Any conclusion from regression can be translated back by "un-scaling".
