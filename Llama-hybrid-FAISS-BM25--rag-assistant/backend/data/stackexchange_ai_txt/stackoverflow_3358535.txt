ASP.NET MVC & JQuery UI Drag Drop - Does anyone know how to store/retrive the panel state?

I have used the Telerik RadDock in the past, and although it's pretty good, it is a little bit clunky and bloated. One nice feature is the ability to save the state of a page (all dock locations, etc) in the database and recover them at a later date. I'm wondering if there is a way in MVC and jQuery to save the state of the jQuery UI Drag Drop panels. Basically each user would be able to edit their own "dashboard" and place items wherever they want, and the state gets saved to SQL Server under their profile for later re-use. Thanks in advance
