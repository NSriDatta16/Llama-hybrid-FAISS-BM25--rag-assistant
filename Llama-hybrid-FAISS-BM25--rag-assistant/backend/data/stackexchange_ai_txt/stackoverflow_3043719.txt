As others have said, the memory allocated for PHP is blown away and re-initialized for every request - so any data which you want to persist beyond a single request needs to be stored eslewhere. That also means that you have a significant overhead loading it back into PHP variable(s) to service requests. If you're trying to write Java programs using PHP then you're not going to get very far. Its not a failing of PHP - if you try to write C programs in Java or Lisp programs in Forth then you'll have the same problem. I think it's highly probable that you could solve the problem by refactoring / pushing the data out to a relevant storage medium and querying it effectively. There are some very unusual cases where that is not the case (don't assume this is in any way an endorsement of your methodology). Here the way to solve the problem is to develop a daemon providing a service to client programs - but if you're writing using OO then do be careful about the memory management (you might consider using the circular reference checking garbage collector).
