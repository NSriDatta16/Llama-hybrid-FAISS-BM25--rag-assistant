Neural network with more than one output

I'd like to make an AI learning how to play 2048 game. I decided to try a genetic algorithm, since I don't have any test examples of correct moves. So my AI should choose one from four possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT). I've previously done only a neural network (well, it's hard to call it a "network" actually, it only had one neuron) with two possible outputs, either 1 or 0. This time I'd need to have four. I've come up with an idea to make four output neurons, that instead of 0 or 1 would return a value between 0 and 1. Then I'd choose the neuron with the greatest value and make a corresponding move. Is it a good idea?
