Update Heroku has just announced support for Java. Update 2 Heroku has just announced support for Scala Also Check out Amazon Elastic Beanstalk . To deploy Java applications using Elastic Beanstalk, you simply: Create your application as you normally would using any editor or IDE (e.g. Eclipse). Package your deployable code into a standard Java Web Application Archive (WAR file). Upload your WAR file to Elastic Beanstalk using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, the web service APIs, or the Command Line Tools. Deploy your application. Behind the scenes, Elastic Beanstalk handles the provisioning of a load balancer and the deployment of your WAR file to one or more EC2 instances running the Apache Tomcat application server. Within a few minutes you will be able to access your application at a customized URL (e.g. http://myapp.elasticbeanstalk.com/ ). Once an application is running, Elastic Beanstalk provides several management features such as: Easily deploy new application versions to running environments (or rollback to a previous version). Access built-in CloudWatch monitoring metrics such as average CPU utilization, request count, and average latency. Receive e-mail notifications through Amazon Simple Notification Service when application health changes or application servers are added or removed. Access Tomcat server log files without needing to login to the application servers. Quickly restart the application servers on all EC2 instances with a single command. Another strong contender is Cloud Foundry . One of the nice features of Cloud Foundry is the ability to have a local version of "the cloud" running on your laptop so you can deploy and test offline.
