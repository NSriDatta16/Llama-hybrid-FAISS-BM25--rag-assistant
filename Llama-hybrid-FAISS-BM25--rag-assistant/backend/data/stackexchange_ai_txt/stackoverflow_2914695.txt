How can you write a function that accepts multiple types?

I have a function that should work on int[] and on String[] now i have made the same function with a int parameter and an String parameter however if it has to go this way its a bit copy paste work and doesn't look very organized is there a way to solve this and put these 4 functions in 2? static public void print(String s) { System.out.println(s); } static public void print(int s) { System.out.println(s); } static public void printArray(String[] s) { for (int i=0; i Thanks Matthy
