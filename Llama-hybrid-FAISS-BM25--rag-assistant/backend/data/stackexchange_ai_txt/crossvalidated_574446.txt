Overview. If you use method (1), then you will have no information to make a direct comparison between the two methods of estimation. It is not appropriate to interpret a larger P-value to mean that $H_0$ is "more true." [Under $H_0,$ P-values of exact tests on continuous data are uniformly distributed. However, the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test is based on (discrete) ranks and uses normal approximations when sample sizes are large. The test is calibrated to have correct error probabilities for usual significance levels (say, below 10%), but P-values should be used for deciding whether to reject $H_0.]$ If you use method (2), then you can see how well each kind of estimate performs. Simulated results for sample median vs. sample midrange of normal data as estimates of population mean. To illustrate, consider whether the sample median or the sample midrange is the more reliable estimate of the center $\mu$ of a sample from a normal population. [Of course, we know the sample mean has nice properties. It turns out that the median is generally better than the midrange.] We choose normal samples of size $n = 50$ from normal populations with means $\mu$ in $(30,60)$ and SDs $\sigma=3.$ Then we do paired Wilcoxon (signed rank) tests to assess the properties of sample medians and midranges as estimates of $\mu.$ # fictitious data simulated in R set.seed(2022) mu = runif(50, 30, 60) # various centers for normal samples mean(mu) [1] 45.16524 h = mr = numeric(50) for(i in 1:50){ x = rnorm(50, mu[i], 3) h[i] = median(x) mr[i] = mean(range(x)) } mean(h); sd(h) [1] 45.14566 # average median nearly matches avg of means [1] 8.562685 # SD of medians slightly smaller than SD # of midranges mean(mr); sd(mr) [1] 45.19334 [1] 8.63267 # slightly larger than above. A large component of the variance of medians and of midranges is due to the variety of values of $\mu$ used in the simulation.

Absolute errors for the median tend to be smaller than absolute errors for the midrange. pv.d = wilcox.test(abs(h-mu),abs(mr-mu), pair=T)$p.val; pv.d [1] 0.0003293868 wilcox.test(abs(mr-mu),abs(h-mu), pair=T, conf.int=T) Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction data: abs(mr - mu) and abs(h - mu) V = 1010, p-value = 0.0003294 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.1554304 0.5230677 sample estimates: (pseudo)median 0.3184359 mean(abs(mr-mu)); sd(abs(h-mu)) [1] 0.7289042 [1] 0.3220564 Paring of sample medians with population means and of sample midranges with population means allows us to focus on the smaller absolute errors for medians.
