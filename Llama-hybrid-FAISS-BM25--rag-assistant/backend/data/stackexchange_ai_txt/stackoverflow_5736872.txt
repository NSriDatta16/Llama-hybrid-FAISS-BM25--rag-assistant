Java popup trigger in Linux

I have an application in which you can do a right mouse button press and drag (as well as a left press and drag for different operations). However, when running this on linux, it seems that popup menus are triggered by a mousePressed and not a mouseReleased. This is resulting in every time I press the right mouse button to perform a drag, the popup menus are triggered (unlike windows, where it is mouseReleased). Any thoughts on how to work around this? thanks. EDIT: Posting code Code for popup menu // this is called from mousePressed and mouseReleased if (e.isPopupTrigger() && !e.isConsumed()) { // show the popup menu } This code is what is called on the right mouse press/drag (this is 3rd party code, but it is open source so I can change as needed) // this is called on all mouse events if (buttonAction.mouseButton != 0) { // handle the event }
