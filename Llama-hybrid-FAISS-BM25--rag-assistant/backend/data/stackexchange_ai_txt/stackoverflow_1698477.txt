To support the big character set you need to specify a font file that has all those characters in it. Once you've picked a font file you'll need your application to point to that file. I've found that just putting the font files in your font's directory doesn't work. Try embedding the font too, eg. renderer.getFontResolver().addFont("your_font_file.ttf", BaseFont.EMBEDDED); This link has quite a few font files.
