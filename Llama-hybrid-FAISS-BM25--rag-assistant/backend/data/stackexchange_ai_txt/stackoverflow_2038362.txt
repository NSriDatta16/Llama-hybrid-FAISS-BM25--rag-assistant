If you want to change directories , you should use the CD command. The argument can be either a full path or relative path: cd('c:\matlab\toolbox'); %# Full path to a directory cd('scripts'); %# Move to a subdirectory "scripts" cd('..\TxtInOut'); %# Move up one level, then to directory "TxtInOut" If you want information about a directory , you should use the DIR command. DIR will return an m-by-1 structure of information for a directory, where m is the number of files and folders in the directory. Again, the argument can be either a full path or relative path: data = dir('c:\matlab\toolbox'); %# Data for a full path to a directory data = dir('scripts'); %# Data for a subdirectory "scripts" NOTE: When working on different platforms (i.e. Windows or UNIX), you will have to pay attention to whether you use the file separator \ or / . You can get the file separator for your platform using the function FILESEP . You can also build your file paths using the function FULLFILE .
