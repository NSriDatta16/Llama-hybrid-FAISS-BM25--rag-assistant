I agree with lonesomeday, in that it feels like there's a nicer solution here if you could give us some more context, but that said, I'll give my two cents. You could try something like this: var str = "width=600 height=1200"; $(' ').attr('width'); This means that you're leveraging the HTML parser to get a sensible result out of your string. Update with the info you posted in the OP comments: You want to check this string for the width attribute: In this case, I'd actually strongly recommend using the above approach. var str = " I'll save you the obligatory link to the "Don't use a regex to parse HTML" rant/freakout answer, but it definitely applies here.
