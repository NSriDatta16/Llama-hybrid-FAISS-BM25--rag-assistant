Organize simple form

I want to create a simple page. Page has table with some product information(id,Name,Order, Size etc), page listener, filter form(products from date1 to date2, products size...). what is best way to organize such pages? Also i want to use ajax, but it's not necessary. My vision: PageListener class with method List GetPage(int pageNumber) ProductsViewModel class with List field, current page, page info, so on Filter class. This class i will be able to use for filter and validation data. class Filter { Datetime date1; Datetime date2; int maxSize; int minSize; .... public List FilterData(List data); } One action method with two parametrs ActionResult Show(Filter filter,int pageNumber){} Is it good solution?
