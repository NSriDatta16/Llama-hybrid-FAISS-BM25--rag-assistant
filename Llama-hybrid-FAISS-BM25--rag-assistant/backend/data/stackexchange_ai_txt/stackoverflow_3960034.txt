Pasting text into emacs on Macintosh

I'm on a Macintosh and am using "terminal" for my shell. When I copy text from any window (via mouse drag then right mouse button menu -> copy) and then I paste the text (right mouse button -> paste) into a terminal with emacs running, it doesn't act as a paste. Instead, it is just like entering or typing in text. The problem occurs when the text is indented. Emacs does its auto-indentation on top of that so I get a cascading staircase-like look of text. I just want it to be a true "paste" so that whatever was copied shows up exactly as it was. Any ideas on how to change something to get this to work?
