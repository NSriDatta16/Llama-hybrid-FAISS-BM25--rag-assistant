CSS: achieving TWO-WAY infinite scroll with mouse drag

I'm trying to create an infinite scroll component. I'm using this site as a tutorial, but it seems that I can only get the infinite scroll on one way, because when I add elements to the leftmost side, the scrollLeft property auto-adjusts thus the page gets a quirky scroll, jumping instead of making a smooth movement. Is there any way of achieving infinite scroll both-ways? I don't plan to use scrolling buttons, just mouse drag for moving the scroll view.
