The biggest problem I've found with using the iPod touch (2G) is that it's faster than the iPhone. That's serious if you're working on a game. I've found the iPhone 3G to be around 10fps slower than my iPod, so before submitting the app I'll probably have to shell out for an iPhone anyway. I'm really not looking forward to the sadomasochistic relationship that is your average telco contract.
