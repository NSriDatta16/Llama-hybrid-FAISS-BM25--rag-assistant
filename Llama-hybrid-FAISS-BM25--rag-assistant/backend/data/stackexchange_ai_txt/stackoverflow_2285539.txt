Databound controls "flashing" as they are refreshed

It's a small thing but I was just wondering... Visual Studio 2008, C#. I have a master-detail form with databound controls. When user selects the record in a listbox, all the details are updated in multiple databound controls on the form. As it happens, they kind of 'flash', or blink, when repopulated with new data and it's sort of like an electrical wave going across the form in a fraction of second :) don't know how to explain it better Not a big deal, but still, it looks "shaky" and ugly, so, for the sake of ellegance, I was just wondering whether there is some easy way to prevent it? I thought about calling SuspendLayout and ResumeLayout (on the container control), but what events should I handle? listBox_SelectedValueChanged for suspending it, I guess ... but for resuming?
