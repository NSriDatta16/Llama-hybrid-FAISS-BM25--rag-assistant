You've got HTML markup that's basically explicitly telling the browser to do exactly what you observe it to do. The only thing you can do is apply JavaScript to get rid of the "title" attributes of problematic elements, or (better) don't put title attributes on elements in the first place when you don't want title text to show up. I've had this situation happen to me, as follows. In my web app, I've got a little "What's this?" feature, involving little "[?]" icons that show up near things that may need explanation. You click the little icon and a "help bubble" pops up. It's a pretty common feature. Anyway, the little clickable thingy is implemented as a that's absolutely positioned, and the "bubble" is lexically nested inside that with "position: relative". The clickable icon has its own "title" attribute, but of course when the help bubble is showing I don't want that title to show up as flyover text, because it's just weird. Thus, my JavaScript code that opens the bubble has to stash the "title" attribute of parent elements in jQuery ".data()" storage while the bubbles are open, and it restores the titles when the bubbles close.
