jQuery is slower than plain HTML at rendering. Just as any javascript DOM manipulation is slower then plain HTML files But there is much more to this than just rendering performance. A large table in fancy HTML format may take much longer to download than a compact JSON data query and a little jQuery to format it Just getting a plain HTML fragment via AJAX is never going to gain you anything in total download time. But often it appears quicker from a users perspective since the main page structure loads quicker and then the details are fleshed out The jQuery libraries are cached so they only have an overhead once per session or less
