Is there any model, leave aside logistic regression, that it is not possible to overfit? Overfitting arises fundamentally because you fit to a sample & not the whole population. Artifacts of your sample can seem like features of the population and they are not and hence overfitting hurts. It is akin to a question of external validity. Using only the sample you are trying to get a model that gives you the best performance on the real population which you cannot see. Sure, some model forms or procedures are more likely to overfit than others but no model is ever truly immune from overfitting, is it? Even out-of-sample validation, regularization procedures etc. can only guard against over-fitting but there's no silver bullet. In fact, if one were to estimate one's confidence in making a real world prediction based on a fitted model one must always assume that some degree of overfitting has indeed happened. To what extent might vary, but even a model validated on a hold out dataset will rarely yield in-wild performance that matches what was obtained on the hold-out dataset. And overfitting is a big causative factor.
