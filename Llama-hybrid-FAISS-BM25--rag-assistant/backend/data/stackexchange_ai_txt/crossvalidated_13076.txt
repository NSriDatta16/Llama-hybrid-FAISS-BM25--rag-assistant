Recurrent neural networks: no assumptions on the distributions of $f_i$, distribution of $x_t$ can be modelled via an adequate loss function (sum of squares for Gaussian, sum of differences for Laplace, cross entropy, kulback leibler divergences, ...) rather difficult to implement (need advanced techniques such as Hessian free optimization or Long short-term memory to work well). PyBrain has a LSTM implementation.
