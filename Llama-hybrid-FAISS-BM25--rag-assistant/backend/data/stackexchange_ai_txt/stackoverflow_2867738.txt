tptp/profiling of web-application within eclipse - no data collectors available

I have a problem with tptp/profiling within eclipse. Because at first I had some very strange problems, I downloaded the “TPTP all-in-one package” (tptp.runtime.allInOne.win32.win32.x86-TPTP-4.6.2.zip) and added the stuff I need (Jboss-Tools, etc.) I am using Windows XP SP3, Java 6u20, Eclipse 3.5.2.(, jboss-4.2.3.GA-jdk6) In "Profile Configurations"/Tab "Monitor" I got “IWAT0435E An error occurred when connecting to the host” and in the “Profile on Server” Window in the tab Monitor I got only “pre-JRE 1.5“ as choice. After disabling an enabling the IAC in “Preferences”/”Agent Controller” that IWAT...-problem was gone but now I don't get anything in the “Profile on Server”/”Monitor” tab, but it says “[Monitor] The launch requires at least one data collector to be selected.” After a (clean) restart of eclipse I now get new errors. If I try to launch and profile a normal application I get "Agent Controller is unavailable under port 10002. Make sure that the service is started and the port number is correct under preferences. " and “Profile on Server” leads to "Connection failed on 0.0.0.0" althoug netstat tells me that something is listening on 0.0.0.0:10002 and the Agent Controller local port is set to 10002. Any ideas?
