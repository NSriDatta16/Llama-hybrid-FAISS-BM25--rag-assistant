Macros are often used to generate bulk of code. It's often a pretty localized usage and it's safe to #undef any helper macros at the end of the particular header in order to avoid name clashes so only the actual generated code gets imported elsewhere and the macros used to generate the code don't. /Edit: As an example, I've used this to generate structs for me. The following is an excerpt from an actual project: #define MYLIB_MAKE_PC_PROVIDER(name) \ struct PcApi##name { \ many members â€¦ }; MYLIB_MAKE_PC_PROVIDER(SA) MYLIB_MAKE_PC_PROVIDER(SSA) MYLIB_MAKE_PC_PROVIDER(AF) #undef MYLIB_MAKE_PC_PROVIDER
