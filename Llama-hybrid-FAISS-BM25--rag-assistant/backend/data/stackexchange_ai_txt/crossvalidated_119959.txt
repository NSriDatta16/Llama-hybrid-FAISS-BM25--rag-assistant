What does pre-training mean in deep autoencoder?

I am confused by the term "pre-training". What does it mean in deep autoencoder? And how does it help improving the performance of autoencoder? (I know this term comes from Hinton 2006's paper: "Reducing the dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks".)
