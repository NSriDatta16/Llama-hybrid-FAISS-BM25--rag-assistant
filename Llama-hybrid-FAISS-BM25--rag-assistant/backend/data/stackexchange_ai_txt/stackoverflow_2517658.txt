Scriptaculous Drag: How do I offset the dragging element?

This is an age old problem - but now I'm using scriptaculous its come back to haunt me. When dragging a tree node over other tree nodes I want mouseover to fire for each node I drag over. So I want to position the dragging thing so that its top-left is slightly below and to the right of the mousepointer can anyone help? - thanks
