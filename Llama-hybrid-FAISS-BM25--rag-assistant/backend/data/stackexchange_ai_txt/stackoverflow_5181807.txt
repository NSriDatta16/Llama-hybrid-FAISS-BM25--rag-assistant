Since DataTemplate is a generic template that could be used many times in the code, there is no way to access it by name (x:Name="numberTextBox"). I solved similar problem to this by making a collection of Controls - while Listbox was populating I add Textbox control to the collection. string text = myCollectionOfTextBoxes[listbox.SelectedIndex].Text; Till I found a better soultion - Tag property. In your ListboxItem you bind Tag property to the name Tag="{Binding Name}" and the to access it ListBoxItem listBoxItem = ContactListBox.SelectedItem as ListBoxItem; string name = listBoxItem.Tag.ToString();
