First, a correction: $\sigma_{pop}^2 = \dfrac{\sum (x_i-\bar{x})}{n} \equiv s_n ^2$ or $\dfrac{n \cdot s_n ^2}{n-1}$ depending on whether or not you know a priori the true mean. That doesn't change your conclusion that $E(\sigma ^2)$ is apparently "wrong" and $E(\tau)$ is apparently "right". On to your questions: Indeed, $E(1/X) \neq 1/E(X)$ . In fact, $E(\sigma ^2) = E(1/\tau) = \alpha / \beta$ , which reduces to $\dfrac{1}{\sigma_{pop} ^2}$ . There is no particular reason why the expected value of $\sigma$ should also reduce to $\sigma_{pop} ^2$ . In the plot above the Gamma distribution is plotted against $1/x$ to account for the fact that $\sigma = \dfrac{1}{\tau}$ . Even after this correction is applied, notice how the distributions shapes are quite different from one another. Notice also that, while the shape is different (and thus the mean and mode are also different), the percentiles, and thus the area under the curve (each on its original scale), are the same for all $x$ . This is what matters most for a direct comparison, because it allow us to calculate the probability of e.g. $\sigma >= 58.8$ (which is $70\%$ , as the plot shows). Clearly, the probability that $\tau >= 1/58.8 = 0.017$ is also $70\%$ . The plot also shows that. The medians of both distributions (plotted on the same x-axis) are also the same. The frequentist approach is based on a different set of assumptions than the bayesian approach. Before you decide for either approach, you should decide which set of assumptions best matches your problem`s requirements. See this question for a more complete answer to your question. The MAP estimator is sometimes used in MCMC (simulation) contexts. Starting the simulation from the joint distribution MAP can, in some cases, be more efficient. Other than that, I haven't seen them being used in practice either.
