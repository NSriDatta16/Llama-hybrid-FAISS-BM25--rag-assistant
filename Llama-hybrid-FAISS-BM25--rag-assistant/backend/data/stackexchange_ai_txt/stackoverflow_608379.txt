I just started with WIX and think that WixEdit( http://wixedit.sourceforge.net/ ) rocks for adding multiple files/dlls, solved my frustration with Wix of getting the files in easily. Just keep your files organized and then use the import folder function. Of course it doesnt support the new 3.0 recommendations of having one component per file. Heat is good also and supports one component per file. Next on my list is to get some automation so these files are updated automatically a la visual studio.
