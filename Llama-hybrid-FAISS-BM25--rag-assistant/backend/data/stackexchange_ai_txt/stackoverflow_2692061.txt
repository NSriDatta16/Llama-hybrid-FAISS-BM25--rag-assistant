Enough snippy comments, here's something of an answer too: The Matlab desktop: what all the windows are for, dragging code from the history back into the command window, the variable inspector, etc. Plotting: not just the plot command, but how to use the plot GUI tools, and how to create an M-file from a graphic. M-files for scripts and functions, and the key differences between them. M-Lint, the profiler. Use Matlab as a vehicle for teaching the perils and pitfalls of floating-point arithmetic. Getting help: at the command line, on the web, documentation, the file exchange, ... Set path and the current working directory. Importing data from files, exporting data to files, loading and saving. That should be enough to keep them busy for an hour or so. To clarify, I propose these topics to help you teach your students to avoid common Matlab errors including; Unproductive use of the tool, retyping commands which can easily be recalled from the history, using C (or Java) style file reading commands instead of uuimport, slowly typing scripts to draw graphics when Matlab can do it for you, wondering what all the little orange lines in the editor right margin mean and the squiggly underlines, trying to figure things out for themselves when the help facilities could tell them, tons of other stuff that many much more experience Matlab users have taken ages to learn. Floating point arithmetic is not real. and probably a lot of other stuff too.
