Logistic regression vs Random forest vs GBM: equal performance?

I'm trying to convince my boss that we should consider using machine learning in our field (oncology). We study brain tumours, roughly 90% die within a few years. I wanted to compare the performance of logistic regression, random forest and GBM for classification. My results show that there is no noteworthy difference in their performance. I do recognize that there are inherent flaws to such comparisons; e.g the logistic model could be improved with some interactions and splines (which are better taken care of out of the box by tree-based models). I would expect to see a difference between these models. What am I doing wrong? Reproducible example # Load data file 0.9, 1, 0) test$rf.class 0.9, 1, 0) test$gbm.class 0.9, 1, 0) library(pROC) #install.packages("pROC) roc1
