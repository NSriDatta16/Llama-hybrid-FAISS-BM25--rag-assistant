Location Search API for iPhone

I currently have an application that includes a screen where a user can search for a location or place (like Manhattan, Statue of Liberty, Paris, or Golden Gate Bridge) and they get a list of results back. When they select a result, I do some stuff with the lat/long for the result. This is currently using geonames.org, which at times is very unreliable. My question is simply, is there an alternative to geonames.org that I can either use as primary or fall back on? The API needs to be ok with commercial use, expose a REST style interface, and ideally be free or close to free for commercial use. Any help would be much appreciated.
