As mentioned, getElementsByTagName is not new... I think you're going to get about 10 references to jQuery . Returns all the paragraph elements: $('p').length If 19kb is too big, and you just want to do element selection, something like sizzle works well, at about 4kb. The only thing I would note is that you're probably going to end up needing something that's in jQuery anyway. http://sizzlejs.com/ Queries are very similar: Sizzle("li"); 19kb is a really small one-time price to pay for the power of jQuery.
