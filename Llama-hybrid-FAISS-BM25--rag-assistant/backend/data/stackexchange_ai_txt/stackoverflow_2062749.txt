Update datagrid view with updated data

I've a datagridview. I read an xml file and bind the data to the gridview. I change the xml and save it in another form. So i reread the xml file and i bind it to the gridview. The datatable is getting the updated values. But the grid is not getting updated till i close and open the application again. How to do it? Thank you. Regards, Raghavendra #1 Is there a Databind() or Rebind() for DataGridView? I set the datasource like this - dvMoviesList.DataSource = dtMovies; If i add any new row to the dtMovies table and set the datasource again, it is getting reflected. But if i edit the values of any of the existing rows and re assign the datasource it is not getting reflected till i close and open the application again. Any ideas? Thank you.
