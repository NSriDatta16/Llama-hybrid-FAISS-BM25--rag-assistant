I suggest to store the image as vector data, this way you could play and undo very quickly and divide by thousand times the memory used. For example you can only store: Gesture coordinates (x, y) Gesture type (touchBegan, touchEnded) Pen changes (color, width, effect) You also have a canvas to render the current image. Good luck!
