Obtaining C++ Code Coverage

I'm on Linux. My code is written in C++. My program is non-interactive; it runs as "./prog input-file", processes the file, and exits. I have various unit tests "input-file0, input-file1, input-file2, ..." For designing new unit tests, I want to know what lines of code existing tests do not cover. Question: Given that I control how "prog" is compiled/run; how can I get list of the lines of code that "./prog input-file" does not hit? Thanks! EDIT: I'm currently using g++; but perfeclty happy to switch to LLVM if it makes this possible.
