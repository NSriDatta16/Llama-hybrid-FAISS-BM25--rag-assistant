General rule is to make schema as normalized as possible. Then perform stress tests with expected amount of data. If you find performance bottlenecks you should try to optimize in following order: Profile and optimize queries add indices to schema add hints to query optimizer (don't know if SQLite has any, but most of databases do) If 1. does not gain any performance benefits, consider denormalizing database. Denormalizing database is usually needed only if you work with "large" amounts of data. I checked several lyrics databases on internet and the largest I found have lyrics for about 400.000 songs. Let's assume you can find 1.000.000 of lyrics performed by 500.000 artists. That is amount of data that all databases can easily handle on average modern computer.
