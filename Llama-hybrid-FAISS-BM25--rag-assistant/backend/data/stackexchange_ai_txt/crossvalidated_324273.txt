what is the best values of learning rate and max-steps for a specific batch size?

in deep learning and machine learning, when we increse the number of batch size then we should increse the learning rate and decrese the max-steps(iterations). Also, I know that the number of epochs based on the dataset (eg. contains one objects or various of objects). If we suppose that the number of dataset equal to 1453 samples and the batch size is equal to 32. what are the best initial learning rate, max-steps, and decay rate as starting? and there is an general equation for this?????
