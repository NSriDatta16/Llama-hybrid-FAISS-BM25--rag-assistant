Does a pulsed (spiking) neural network outperform a recurrent neural net?

Both pulsed and recurrent neural networks can model time varying information. But I am not sure which model is better relative to the computational cost. Does it pay to use the more complex pusled neural network or will the recurrent neural net work just as well with a lot less calculation required? Does a pulsed net converge more quickly? Thanks
