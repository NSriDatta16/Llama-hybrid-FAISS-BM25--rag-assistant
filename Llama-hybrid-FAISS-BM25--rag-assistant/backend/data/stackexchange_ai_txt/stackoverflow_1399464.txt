I believe the issue is that you have to make the OtherObject serializable. The other two variables are primitives and therefore they are already serializable. For Example: [DataContract] public abstract class BarrieHibbertWrapper { [DataMember] public string Name { get; set; } } You will have to add System.RunTime.Serialization as a reference. It could be that you will have to do the same to the class you included in your code.
