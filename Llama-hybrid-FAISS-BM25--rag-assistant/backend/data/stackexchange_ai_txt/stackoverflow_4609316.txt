How to uniquely identify the client machine in an ASP.NET application?

I have a server application that runs in a hosted environment but creates print jobs in the client's local network (behind NAT; the mechanics of this is not relevant). In order to send the print job to the printer that is attached to the workstation, I need to identify the workstation. The users move around between workstations, so I can't permanently associate a user with a workstation/printer. The trivial solution is to require the user to identify the machine he is logging in from, for instance by selecting from a list, but that's an inconvenience and subject to user error. Options I have eliminated: Host header variables (nothing identifiable is sent) Cookies, in support of a user selection. This somewhat addresses the potential for user error, but not really. HTML5 DOM Storage - is not supported by the client's browser Any other ideas? Edit: I do have the option of puttnig this particular function (create a print job) into a thick client app. The app can then of course be configured and the problem goes away. But the user experience will suffer from having to switch between the browser and a Windows app.
