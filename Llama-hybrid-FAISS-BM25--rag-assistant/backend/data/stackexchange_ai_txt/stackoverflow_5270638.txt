The idea of being able to embed arbitrary XML (in a user-defined namespace) within an XML page, and have the namespace somehow associated to plug-in code that understands this XML vocabulary, is a dream which many of us have shared. Unfortunately the group defining HTML5 (WHATWG) are moving in the opposite direction: they don't see this kind of extensibility as a requirement, and embedding XML in HTML is becoming harder rather than easier. The only exception is for an XML vocabulary like SVG or MathML that for some reason appeals to the folks on WHATWG and gets endorsed by them.
