I would say jsight's answer is a pretty good explanation. I have looked at Flex, Rails and GWT. All three inhabit the same space, with Flex producing Flash RIAs and GWT and Rails doing the same for HTML. Having worked with Flex, there is a lot to like but some serious niggling problems, the main one for me being the difficulty integrating HTML into a Flex app - it's no trivial task and there are few projects that can avoid this. GWT on the other hand is daunting initially because it's Java-based and does not come with the same kind of drag and drop editor that Flex provides in Flex Builder. But GWT Designer (by Instantiations) is a pretty good equivalent to Flex Builder in the GWT world and for a Java programmer with Swing skills, the architecture of GWT doesn't take much figuring out. Not to mention the sheer number of Java programmers around who can pitch GWT to their managers as a simple add-on their existing Java toolset. Plus the Google brand doesn't hurt. In terms of sellability within the enterprise, a Java tool is always going to be an easier sell than Actionscript or Ruby on Rails. It's hard to say for sure where things are headed but I would expect to see continued growth for all three. Everyone wants RIA these days.
