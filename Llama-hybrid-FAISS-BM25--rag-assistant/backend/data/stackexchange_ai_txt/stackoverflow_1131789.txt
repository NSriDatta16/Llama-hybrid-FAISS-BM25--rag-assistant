If you were organizing books in a library, how would you store them and what data structure would you use?"

I would use a hash table and use ISBN number as key. As this will give me a look up time of O(1)....as avg time of look up in hash table is O(1).... we can also use Binary search tree.....look up time is O(nlogn)... What data structure would you guys use and why?
