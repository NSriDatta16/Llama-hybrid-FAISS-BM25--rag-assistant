Assigning a view controller to be the delegate of a subview which is not directly descendent?

I am writing an iphone app where in numerous cases a subview needs to talk to its superview. For example: View A has a table view that contains photos A has a subview B which allows users to add photos, upon which I want to auto append them to A's table view So far I have been creating a @protocol in B, and registering A as the delegate. The problem in my case is that B has a subview C that allows users to add content, and I want actions in C to invoke changes in its grandparent, A. Currently I am working around this by passing around a self pointer to my base view controller (C.delegate = B.delegate), but it doesn't seem very proper to me. Any thoughts? (and/or general advice on code organization when all sort of subviews needs to talk to superviews would be greatly appreciated) Thanks!
