Fisher's method for combining p-values

I'm using the sumlog function in the metap package of R, and have a few questions about the nuts-and-bolts of this function: 1)Some of my p-values are reported as ' 2)A few studies in my review don't give a p-value and only state 'significant' or 'non-significant'. Is there any way to incorporate these? 3)I'm interested to know what this function is actually doing - as a opposed to simply averaging the p-values. Many thanks for all the help!
