How to find which variables are most correlated with the first principal component?

I came across an article where the authors did a Principal Component Analysis on gene expression data, and found out the genes that are most correlated to the 1st principal component, and they used that gene list for further analysis. Can somebody tell me how to find out entities (genes in this case) that are most correlated to the 1st principal component? Here's the link to the original free article , and this is how they've calculated it: Results of the gene set enrichment analysis of the genes most correlated to the 1st principal component. The correlations of the genes with the 1st principal component were transformed to SDs from the mean, then genes with values > 1.5 (positive correlation) or I can make a toy example of 6 samples and 20 gene matrix and do the PCA the following way but how to proceed next: rm(list=ls()) set.seed(12345) my.mat
