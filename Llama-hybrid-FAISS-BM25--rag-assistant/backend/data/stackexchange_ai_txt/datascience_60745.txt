Interpreting the new dimensions after PCA

I have telecom data with large number of dimentions. Now if I apply dimentionality reduction like PCA then from resulting dimention say PC1, PC2 I would loose the meaning or would not understand what they represent. Are their any techniques other than PCA which can provide any meaning or intution about the new dimentions. Also suggest if there are any research papers in this.
