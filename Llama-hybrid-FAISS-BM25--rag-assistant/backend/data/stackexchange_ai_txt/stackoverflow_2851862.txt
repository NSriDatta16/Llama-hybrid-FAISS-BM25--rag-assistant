What smartphones to target for a modern b2c app?

We want to build a smartphone app which uses geolocation, etc. and target the most important smartphones. Which OS would you support for a b2c application? I found a german statistic here: http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/150842/umfrage/prognostizierte-marktanteile-der-smartphone-betriebssysteme-in-2013/ which forecasts the smartphone usage for 2013. To summarize it lists the following OS, ordered by priority: Symbian, Android, Blackberry (RIM), Windows Mobile, iPhone Would you agree with this priority or should we start with the classical: iPhone/Android combo?
