WP7: Save a contact with predefined details

I am doing a Windows Phone 7 project, and is retrieving personal details for a person based on his phone number via a webservice. I'd like to allow the user to save this data as a contact; Ideally I would like to show the Edit Contact dialog with all the fields pre-filled based on the data I retrieve. I know I can do this: var saveTask = new SavePhoneNumberTask(); saveTask.PhoneNumber = phone; saveTask.Show(); But I need to pre-set all the other properties for the task also. Is there any way to do this in Windows Phone 7 ?
