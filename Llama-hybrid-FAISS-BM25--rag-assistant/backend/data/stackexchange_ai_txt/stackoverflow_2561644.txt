WCF Certificate issue

I am developing a WCF service on my local computer using Visual Studios built in ASP.NET development sever and I'm having issues creating and using temporary Certificates. I have created a cert call TempCA and added it to the Trusted Root Certificate folder and I have created another called SignedByCA which has been added to the personal folder. The service config file has been set up to use SignedByCA but when I run the service I get the following error. The certificate 'CN=SignedByCA' must have a private key that is capable of key exchange. The process must have access rights for the private key. I have tried using WinHttpCertCfg.exe to give other users access to the key but I have since found out that WinHttpCertCfg.exe has be deprecated in windows Vista. Has anyone had this issue before in a similar circumstance??
