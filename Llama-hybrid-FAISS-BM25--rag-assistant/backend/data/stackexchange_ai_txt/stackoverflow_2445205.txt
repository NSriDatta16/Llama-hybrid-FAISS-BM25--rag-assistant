Have a look at CSharpCodeCompiler in Microsoft.CSharp namespace. You can compile using CSharpCodeCompiler and access the result assembly using CompilerResults.CompiledAssembly . Off that assembly you will be able to get the types and off the type you can get all property and method information using reflection. The performance will be pretty average as you will need to compile all the source code whenever something changes. I am not aware of any methods that will let you incrementatlly compile snippets of code.
