Finnally It worked. Although I strongly encourage you to use a newer version of Indy as Remy suggests. I will post the steps that did the trick for me since there should be other people with the same problem. The original code I posted is functional, it works when we need to post information via secured http (https) but the remote server requires prior authentification using a client certificate. In order to make it work, it is necessary to verify the following: TIdHttp and TIdConnectionInterceptOpenSSL configuration Certificates For the first 2 steps follow the steps mentioned here link text or (in case link is expired) Google "IndySSL - using certificate authentication". It worked for me. Indy SSL DLLs. (For D6/Indy 8 download indy_openssl096g.zip from Indy SSL or Intelicom ) This DLLs where the only ones that worked for this version of Indy. Hope this will help.
