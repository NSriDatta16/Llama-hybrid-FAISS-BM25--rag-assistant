PCA won't work on a 4D tensor, but you could use an auto-encoder. Note that PCA will take a 2D dataset and reduce the number of columns in it (say 100 columns to 10). With a 4D dataset, you could use an autoencoder to either reduce it to a 4D dataset with fewer "columns" or reduce it to a 3D dataset.
