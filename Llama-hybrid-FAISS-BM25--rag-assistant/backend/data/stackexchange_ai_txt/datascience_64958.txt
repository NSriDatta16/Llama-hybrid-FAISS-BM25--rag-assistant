Why SVM gridsearch takes longer time?

I have a dataset of 5K records and 60 features focussed on binary classification. Please find my code below for SVM paramter tuning. It's running for a longer time than Xgb . LR and Rf . The other algorithms mentioned returned results within minutes (10-15 mins) whereas SVM is running for more than 45 mins. Questions 1) Is SVM usually slower and takes longer time? 2) Is there any issue with my code below? 3) How can I make the gridsearch faster? from sklearn.svm import SVC param_grid = {'C': [0.001,0.01,0.1,1,10,100,1000], 'gamma': [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf','poly'], 'class_weight':['balanced']} svm=SVC() svm_cv=GridSearchCV(svm,param_grid,cv=5) svm_cv.fit(X_train_std,y_train)
