If I group my data the variance changes, what does this tell me?

Imagine that I measure 9 times a certain physical properties (which I know its exact value is 11) and the outcomes are: $$X_i = 10, 11, 11, 10, 11, 12, 10, 11, 12$$ If I analyse $X_i$ as a random variable I can compute it's expected value and variance as it follows: $$\mathbb{E}(X_i) = \frac{1}{9} \sum X_i = 11$$ $$Var(X_i) = \frac{1}{9} \sum (X_i-11)^2 =0.5$$ Hence the measurement can be written as $X = 10.9 \pm \sqrt{0.5}$ If I define a second random variable: $$\bar X_j =\frac{1}{3} \sum_{\textrm{group of 3 $X_i$}} X_i$$ This means that: $$X_i = 10.7, 11, 11$$ $$\mathbb{E}(\bar X_i) = \frac{1}{3} \sum \bar X_i = 10.9$$ $$Var(\bar X_i) = \frac{1}{3} \sum (\bar X_i-11)^2 = 0.05$$ Hence the measurement can be written as $X = 10.9 \pm \sqrt{0.05}$ The fact that the variance is smaller in the second case, follows directly by the sum of iid and goes like $1/\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of averaged value to obtain $\bar X_i$. From a mathematical point of view it seems all clear but from a physical point of view what does it mean? If I consider averaged values the error I make on my measurement is smaller? The uncertainty of my measurement depends on how I treat my data?
