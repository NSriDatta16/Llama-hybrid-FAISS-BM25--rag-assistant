Does watermark/text on images at the same position influence the classification of images using CNN?

I'm working on a multi-class classification problem using CNN. Most of the images of each class have a text/watermark at a specific position on the image. I have a couple of questions. Does the watermark/text influence the CNN in feature extraction and then in the classification of the images? Is it fine to train my CNN model with images containing watermark/text or is it necessary to remove the watermark/text before training the CNN model?
