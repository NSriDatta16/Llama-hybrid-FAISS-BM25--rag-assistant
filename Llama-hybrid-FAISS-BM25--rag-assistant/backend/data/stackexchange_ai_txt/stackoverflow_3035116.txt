WinPcap is used for two things: Sniffing packets and sending packets. It can't prevent packets from arriving or being sent. You can use WinPcap to interfere with some connections to break them or to change them. Examples: Send RST (reset) packets in TCP to break a TCP connection. Send response packets on HTTP GET packets with your information to get a different result and ignore the actual result. It won't prevent packets from being sent or arrive, but it can make the client or server ignore other packets and use yours.
