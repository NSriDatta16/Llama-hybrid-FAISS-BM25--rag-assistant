After much trial and tribulation, I found a solution to my problem that, if not elegant, is functional. In order to bypass the call to the service endpoint when I detect a duplicate service request, I simply throw a FaultException . Then in the BeforeSendReply method, I check to see if replay.IsFault and then if the fault is the specific fault code I threw in AfterReceiveRequest . If so, i return the cached copy of the message response. The FaultException mechanism is what I need to use to bypass the the service call. If anyone wants full working code for this solution, drop a note here and I'll post my final code after I complete final debug and unit test. -Jeff
