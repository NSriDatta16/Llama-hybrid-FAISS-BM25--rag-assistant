Did you create two different 9-patches for mdpi and ldpi? 9-patch is not meant to be pre-scaled, sometimes it works but the theory says it shouldn't: when scaling (above all downscaling) the single black pixels of the edges get "shrinked" and then might become semi-transparent, breaking the 9-patch. This seems the case, with your middle/bottom images and the top one.
