Typical mistake I experienced as a coach was decision made by managers or even senior management according some study done by 'specialist' or even external consultant. Those people are many times not aware about what, how and who will yse the tool. In this case I see dissapointed people once they should use chosen tool. You have to consider who is going to use the tool for most of the day. Team members are better target community. Tool must support ScrumMaster role due to daily work she needs to done. Include experienced product owners into selection of the tool as tools have different support for planning that is necessary to be usable. Consider your organization (complexity of products, projects, number of locations)
