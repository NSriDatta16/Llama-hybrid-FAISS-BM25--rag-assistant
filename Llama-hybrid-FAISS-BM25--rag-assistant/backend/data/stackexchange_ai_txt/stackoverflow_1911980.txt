Most intuitive, readable API / language reference documentation

I'm working on the dreaded last stage of a project: documenting the API for a semi-technical audience. I'm wondering: what API docs have you found to be particularly elegant? Note that this has nothing to do with how elegant the API itself is: this is purely a question of the formatting/appearance of the API docs themselves. Which language or API docs convey their information in the most intuitive and readable way?
