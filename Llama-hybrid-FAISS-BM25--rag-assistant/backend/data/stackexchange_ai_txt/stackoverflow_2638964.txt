The basic trick to this is to add the header files to one of the targets (either executable or library). This is particularly irritating because cmake already knows all the header file dependencies and should take care of this for us. You can organize it further using the source_group command: source_group("My Headers" FILES ${MY_HDRS}) Note that you have to do the same thing in Xcode too.
