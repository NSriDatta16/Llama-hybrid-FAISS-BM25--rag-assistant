WTP HTTP Preview server - How can I re-configure default server port?

Under Eclipse Ganymede how can I re-configure the default server port (8080) of the Eclipse WTP "HTTP Preview Server"? @Leonel I suppose you never saw the "view" linked to this question, I asked "HTTP Preview Server", not other server views where the port is obviously visible between any other settable option ;-) otherwise I would not have asked on StackOverflow if the real problem was only to search between form settings @Leonel Tnx for your reliability, it's not a common virtue in these days ;), in fact as read I'd like to know if there is some hidden configurable param :p
