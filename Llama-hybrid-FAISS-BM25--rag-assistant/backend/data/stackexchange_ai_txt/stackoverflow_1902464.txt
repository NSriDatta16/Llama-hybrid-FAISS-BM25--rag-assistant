Is there a better way to bring names into class scope other than to typedef them?

I keep running into this issue: class CCreateShortcutTask : public CTask { public: CCreateShortcutTask( CFilename filename, // shortcut to create (or overwrite) Toolbox::Windows::CShellLinkInfo definition // shortcut definition ) ... Having to spell out Toolbox::Windows::CShellLinkInfo seems highly questionable to me. This is in a header, so I surely don't wish to issue a using namespace declaration or I'll drag that namespace into every client file that includes this header. But I don't seriously want to have to fully name these things in the class interface itself. I'd really love to be able to do something like: class CCreateShortcutTask : public CTask { using namespace Toolbox::Windows; -or possibly- using Toolbox::Windows::CShellLinkInfo; public: CCreateShortcutTask( CFilename filename, // shortcut to create (or overwrite) CShellLinkInfo definition // shortcut definition ) ... But these seem to be illegal constructs. Any ideas how to accomplish this? EDIT: I have asked a broader version of this question here
