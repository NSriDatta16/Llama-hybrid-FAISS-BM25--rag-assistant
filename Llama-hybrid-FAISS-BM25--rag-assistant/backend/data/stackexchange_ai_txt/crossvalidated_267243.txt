Very low MSE, but negative R^2 [different case than similar questions]

This question has been asked before, but I have a specific case I'm curious about. Essentially, I have a very low MSE, but the R^2 turns out to be negative. Even the scatterplot shows that a horizontal line isn't a good fit, so I'm not sure what to make of these results. I used sklearn's Linear Regression object, and calculated "Variance Score" (R^2) with the .score() function with .score(Xtrain, ytrain) for the training set (leftmost plot) and .score(Xtest, ytest) for the testing set (middle plot). These are time series predictions btw Thanks ] 1 [ ] 2
