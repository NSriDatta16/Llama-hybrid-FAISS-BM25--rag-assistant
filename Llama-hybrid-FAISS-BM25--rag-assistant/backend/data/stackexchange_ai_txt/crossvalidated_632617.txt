Logistic regression is for categorical outcomes; the "usual" form of logistic reg. is for dichotomous outcomes. So, you could divide your outcome into 3.9199 and everything else and then do logistic reg. But this treats every value that is less than 3.9199 identically and that may not be what you want. Ordinary least squares regression does not require a normally distributed outcome; it makes assumptions about the error term, which we approximate with the residuals from the model, so you would first have to look at those. If those are, in fact, very non-normal (which seems kind of likely) then you could look at robust regression or quantile regression, which do not make assumptions about the error. But, first, I suggest thinking about the outcome and whether there is some better way to measure it. What is it? Why does it take this particular value in more than 3/4 of the cases? Also, why is it missing a bunch of times?
