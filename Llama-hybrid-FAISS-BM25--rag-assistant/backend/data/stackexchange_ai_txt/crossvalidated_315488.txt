Your PCA technique might miss the difference between the groups: That is because it focuses on the total variation rather than the variation between the groups . If you are focused on exploring/picking-out a difference between the groups, then a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) might be a better (stronger) tool. But since you started with SVM (support vector networks?) instead of MANOVA/LDA I wonder if you have some restrictions that made you choose a non-linear technique? PCA is not helping on such issues that much. See the image below for a simple example that expresses these effects. The largest variations in the variables between groups (e.g. a total of var1 + var2) might be perpendicular to the differences within the groups (e.g. a distribution among var1 and var2). Aside from this limitation in power your PCA technique is robust regarding type I errors. Given the null hypothesis that 'the two groups are the same', then you could sample from a single distribution, perform PCA, and assign groups afterwards . So the PCA can't have any effect, if the null hypothesis is true.
