Deriving mathematical model of pLSA

After knowing how LSA works, I went on continue reading on pLSA but couldn't really make sense of the mathematical formula. This is what I get from wikipedia (other academic papers/tutorial show similar form) \begin{align} P(w,d) & = \sum_{c} P(c) P(d|c) P(w|c)\\ & = P(d) \sum_{c} P(c|d) P(w|c)\\ \end{align} I gave up trying to derive it, and found this instead \begin{align} P(c|d) & = \frac{P(d|c)P(c)}{P(d)}\\ P(c|d)P(d) & = P(d|c)P(c)\\ P(w|c)P(c|d)P(d) & = P(w|c)P(d|c)P(c)\\ P(d) \sum_{c} P(w|c)P(c|d) & = \sum_{c} P(w|c)P(d|c)P(c) \end{align} How does the summation appear at the last line? I am currently reading through some tutorial on Bayesian Inferencing (learnt basic probability rules and Bayesian theorem before but can't really see them being useful enough here).
