In C & C++ the term static has multiple meanings (it can govern linkage and storage) You'll have to read Stroustrup's D&E to appreciate his rationale - but when you declare a variable to be const at namespace scope it automatically has internal linkage - whereas in C you have to declare it static to force it to have internal linkage. Of course in C++, the use of static to control linkage has been deprecated, anonymous namespaces can be used to simulate internal linkage in C++. const variables in C++ were supposed to replace preprocessor constants - and since preprocessor constants are only visible in files that define them, similarly, const automatically makes the variable visible only in the file that defines it.
