Dragging markers with Ordnance Survey/Openlayers api

I've created a site link text using the api produced by the Ordnance Survey (I think this is called OpenSpace) which is based on OpenLayers. I've got it so you can click on the map to add a marker and I want to then be able to click on the markers and drag it around the map. Is there a simple way to do this using either the OpenSpace or OpenLayers apis.
