Read XML from a URL in PHP with cURL

I want to read XML data from a URL in Magento. I have three textboxes. One is for baseurl and others are for username and password respectively. when i enter these values i get url like "http://xyz.com/somefile.html?username=username&password=password" I am using the curl method to get content of the url but nothing happens. Here is my code $url='myurl'; $ch = curl_init(); $timeout = 5; curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL,$url); curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1); curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT,$timeout); $data = curl_exec($ch); curl_close($ch); I think there may be some problem with url because when i run this url on browser instead of showing xml contents it asks me to open or save the xml file. Can anyone help me with this? I can not change the url so please suggest me some code that works with this type of url.
