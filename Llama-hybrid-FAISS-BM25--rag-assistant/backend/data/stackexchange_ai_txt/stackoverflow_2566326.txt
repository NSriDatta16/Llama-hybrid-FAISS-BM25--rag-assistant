With my grammar school math. 1000 rps is equivelant to 86400 * 1000 = 86400000 views per day which is also equivalent to 2592000000 views per month. which is 2592 MILLION page views per month. Or , 2.5 BILLION page views per month. So you are talking about a website more popular than linkedln, which gets 1.9 billion views per month. Do you think linkedln runs in one box? Helpful answer: I average about 3MB in my CI applications. Havent done any aggressive optimization, but I think you should be happy with your 2MB figure.
