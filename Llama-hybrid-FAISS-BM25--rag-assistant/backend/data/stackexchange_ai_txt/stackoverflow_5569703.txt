Java Swing or SWT: easy way to build a desktop UI "wizard" -- suggestions?

I'm an experienced Java programmer. Used to do a lot of Swing by hand with Eclipse, but been mostly into web stuff for the past couple years. I have to build a desktop UI, a kind of wizard-y thing, choosing items from lists, typing in fields, next...next...next... that sort of thing. Before I jump into building it by hand with Swing, I'm wondering if there's been any major developments in the Java world with regards to desktop UIs. Is there something I should look at, maybe a drag-and-drop UI builder, or some kind of framework, that will make it easier? Any advice is useful, thanks! Rob
