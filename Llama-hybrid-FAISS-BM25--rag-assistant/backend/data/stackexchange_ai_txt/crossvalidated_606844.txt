Turning a continuous variable into a binary variable is almost always a bad idea. It has been termed dichotomization . Frank Harrell (@FrankHarrell) explains and gives some examples. Steven Senn gave it the name dichotomania : Dichotomania: an obsessive-compulsive disorder that is badly affecting the quality of analysis of pharmaceutical trials Basically, the problem is that information is lost when you convert a continuous reading into a binary normal vs. not normal. Worse, it can encourage investigators to try different cutoffs for defining the two groups, and then only publish the results with the cutoff value that gives the results closest to what they were hoping for.
