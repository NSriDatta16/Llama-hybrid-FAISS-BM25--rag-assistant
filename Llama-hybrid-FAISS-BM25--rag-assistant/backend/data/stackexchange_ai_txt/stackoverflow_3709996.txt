Getting jquery.validate { ignore: } to work for fieldset contents

I'm using the jQuery.validate() plugin for a form. However the form contains a fieldset (which is hidden, and used as a template for adding rows to the form) which I don't want to be validated. The fieldset will be named something like organisation_contacts_tmpl_33 with the invariant being the _tmpl_ part. I've tried: $('#myform').validate({ debug: true, ignore: '[id*="_tmpl_"] input' }); I've even renamed the fields inside the fieldset to start with tmpl_ and tried: $('#myform').validate({ debug: true, ignore: '[id^="tmpl_"]' }); (and multiple variations thereof) but to no avail . Any ideas?
