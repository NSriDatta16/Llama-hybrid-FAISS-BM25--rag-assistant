Your guess is correct. You'll need to add another List control to the report. Drag the existing List control into the new control. Under the properties for the new List control go to "Edit details group" and add to needed column to the "Group on". Next, select either "Page break at start" or "Page break at end" to add the page breaks. The rest of the report design will determine which is most appropriate. This answer assumes that the value for the outer group is already in the dataset for the existing list. If that assumption is incorrect, you'll need to add the column into the dataset.
