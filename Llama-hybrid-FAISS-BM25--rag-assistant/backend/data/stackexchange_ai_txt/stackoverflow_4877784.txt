jQuery UI drag and drop stop not firing as expected

$('#img' + imgID).draggable({ helper: 'clone', opacity: 0.35, stop: dragImageEnd() }); // Called when a drag image has been dropped function dragImageEnd(){ alert(currentlyOverFolderID); } The drag event is working perfectly as expected, except when the draggable property is being added initially to each element it fires the dragImageEnd() event, and when I start dragging and dropping after that the event never fires. I'm probably using it incorrectly, any tips?
