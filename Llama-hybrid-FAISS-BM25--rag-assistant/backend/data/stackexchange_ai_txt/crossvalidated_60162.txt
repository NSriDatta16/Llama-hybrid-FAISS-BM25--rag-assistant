Random forest with a mix of categorical and lexical features

I'm working on a binary classification problem for which the dataset is mostly composed of categorical features, but also a few lexical ones (i.e. article titles and abstracts). I'm experimenting with Random Forests, and my current strategy is to build the training set by appending the $k$ best lexical features (chosen with univariate feature selection, and weighted with $tf-idf$) to the full set of categorical features. This works reasonably well, but as I cannot find explicit references to such a strategy of using hybrid features for RF, I have doubts about my approach: does it make sense? Am I "diluting" the power of the RF by doing so, and should I rather try to combine two classifiers specializing on both types of features?
