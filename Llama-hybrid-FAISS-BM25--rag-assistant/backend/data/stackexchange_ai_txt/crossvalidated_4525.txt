I keep a separate repository for each project, with a project being centered around a particular data set or question being addressed. The repo contains the data, code, and Sweave documents/plots that explain and express the results. I maintain a separate repo for each discrete publication or presentation because A single project may result in multiple publications or presentations. Once a publication is out or you've given the presentation, you are essentially "done" with the contents of that repo so they don't need to be dragged around with the project. A output (publication/presentation/chapter) may contain data from more than one project. Not all of the results from a project will end up in a particular piece of output . Code that is reusable across projects gets its own repo, as well. If I come up with a new & discrete question using data that is already in one repo, I'll copy that data to a new repo. If you want to be really strict about it, many version control systems offer the idea of "subprojects", but I've found that to be overkill.
