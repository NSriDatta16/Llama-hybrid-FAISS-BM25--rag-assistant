Unfortunately Silverlight is limited in its polymorphic behavior regarding DataTemplates, I can only think of a workaround: Give the User class the property Reputation too, but make it meaningless, for example -1. Then apply a style to the reputation TextBlocks: ... You could also try (I can not test this): giving the User class a new property that identifies its type, make a second Style for the second TextBlock bind its DataTrigger to the type identifying property and move the {Binding Path=Reputation} declaration into a Setter: But you see, there is no elegant way, it's a shame that DataTemplate do not have a DataType property in Silverlight.
