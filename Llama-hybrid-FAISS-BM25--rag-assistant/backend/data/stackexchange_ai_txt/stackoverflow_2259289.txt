We started with CruiseControl.NET and NAnt. These are free tools and give you total control. They do integrate with TFS source control through a plug-in . The disadvantages were learning curve, poor documentation (for CC.NET), and XML editing. It came down to one developer (me) maintaining the scripts. We finally switched to TeamCity. It integrates with TFS source control; most standard actions can be done out of the box. It's easy to use (web-based), so any developer can set up his or her project in it with minimal training. For advanced usages, it integrates with NAnt . You will want a fairly hefty server for the build machine (although agents can be distributed). I haven't tried the TFS CI features; TeamCity does what we need it to do. There's a free version for starters; if you outgrow that, a license is reasonably priced for a mid-size development shop.
