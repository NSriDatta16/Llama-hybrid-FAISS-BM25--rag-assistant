Basically there are two general approaches to optional data: Include them in the tablea s nullable (ie optional) columns; or Use one-to-one relationships to child tables that contain logical groupings of attributes. Personally I think that unless you're dealing with an extremely large number of optional attributes you should favour nullable columns. The overhead is so low it's negligible--particulalry when compared to doing lots of joins. Plus if you have child tables via one-to-one relationships you're storing the primary key again (as a foreign key in the child table) so any storage overhead of nullable columns is in fact less. But anyway, that's all that is.
