The "combining" that is done in your code is just collecting the three random forests together into a single object, as a concatenation of the trees in each forest. The object rf.all is just a container to hold the trees: rf1 holds trees indexed as 1-50 (say), rf2 holds 51-100 and rf3 holds trees 101-150. The combine method does not have any relationship to the quoted passage that is distinct from averaging the results of a single random forest object (e.g. the prediction of the ensemble rf1 ). In other words, if it's true that a single ensemble incurs a loss of accuracy, then it's true that combination of several ensembles must also share the same defect.
