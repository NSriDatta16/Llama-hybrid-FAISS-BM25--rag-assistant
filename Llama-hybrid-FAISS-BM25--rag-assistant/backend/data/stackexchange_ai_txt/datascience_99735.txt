When should I use 'rbf' and 'polynomial' kernel trick in machine learning algo?

I have a problem about hate-speech classification using support-vector machine algorithm. The task is to identify the sentence that contains 'positive' or 'negative' sentiment. Which is the best Kernel Trick? ('rbf' or 'polynomial')
