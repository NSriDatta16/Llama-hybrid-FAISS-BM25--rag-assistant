If you want your member methods to know the dimension (your "dims" template parameter), add the following line to your template class: static const int Dimension = dims; then use Dimension in your methods. This is a static const member variable, so the compiler will be able to optimize it away and not require any storage for it. I just noticed that you can also use the identifier "dims" directly in a member function: public void PrintDimensions() { std::cout works fine with my compiler.
