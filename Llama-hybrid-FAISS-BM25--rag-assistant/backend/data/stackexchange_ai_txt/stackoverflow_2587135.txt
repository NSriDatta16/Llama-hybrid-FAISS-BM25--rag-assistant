Using the C Cluster library in Visual C++

Right so i'm trying to use a C library in C++, never actually done this before i thought it would be a case of declaring the header includes under a extern "C" and setting the compile as flag to "default" but i'm still getting linker errors and think that the header file might have to be complied as a DLL. I have no idea really. Is it the library that's the problem or is it me? There are some make files in the cluster-1.47\src, but i don't know how or if they relate to "cluster.h". I've uploaded a visual studio 2008 project for anyone to take a gander, any help would be appreciated as i've been hitting my head against the wall for time now. thanks Stefan Link to Visual Studio 2008 Project
