I've noticed people often get directed to this question when searching whether to use sigmoid vs softmax in neural networks. If you are one of those people building a neural network classifier, here is how to decide whether to apply sigmoid or softmax to the raw output values from your network: If you have a multi-label classification problem = there is more than one "right answer" = the outputs are NOT mutually exclusive, then use a sigmoid function on each raw output independently. The sigmoid will allow you to have high probability for all of your classes, some of them, or none of them. Example: classifying diseases in a chest x-ray image. The image might contain pneumonia, emphysema, and/or cancer, or none of those findings. If you have a multi-class classification problem = there is only one "right answer" = the outputs are mutually exclusive, then use a softmax function. The softmax will enforce that the sum of the probabilities of your output classes are equal to one, so in order to increase the probability of a particular class, your model must correspondingly decrease the probability of at least one of the other classes. Example: classifying images from the MNIST data set of handwritten digits. A single picture of a digit has only one true identity - the picture cannot be a 7 and an 8 at the same time. Reference: for a more detailed explanation of when to use sigmoid vs. softmax in neural network design, including example calculations, please see this article: "Classification: Sigmoid vs. Softmax."
