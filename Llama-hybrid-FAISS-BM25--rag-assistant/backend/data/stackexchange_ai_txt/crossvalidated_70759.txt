What if time variable is not significant in longitudinal analysis, can we remove it in the model?

In my longitudinal data, I firstly build a model with two fixed effects, session.week and sync. The former one is just the time variable. I actually have two subquestions : (1) What if time variable is not significant? can I remove it? When I run the following code with R quality.Model.1 What I get is the following $fixed Estimate MCMCmean HPD95lower HPD95upper pMCMC Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.3166 2.9966 0.9498 4.6601 0.0154 0.0000 session.week -0.0458 -0.0265 -0.2369 0.1867 0.7934 0.6352 sync 1.3079 1.6866 0.1026 3.7183 0.0244 0.0206 $random Groups Name Std.Dev. MCMCmedian MCMCmean HPD95lower HPD95upper 1 student.id:group.name (Intercept) 0.3303 0.1417 0.1535 0.0000 0.3912 2 group.name (Intercept) 0.0000 0.1975 0.3523 0.0000 1.2247 3 Residual 0.6365 0.6798 0.6859 0.5408 0.8552 As you see, the time variable is not significant, but sync is significant (p AIC BIC logLik deviance REMLdev 113.3 124.4 -50.67 96.63 101.3 Actually although this is a longitudinal study, I don't actually expect the time would change my independent variable. The non-significance result actually confirms my expectation. Since the time variable (session.week) is not significant, can I remove it in my model, so it becomes: quality.Model.2 The result of this models is : $fixed Estimate MCMCmean HPD95lower HPD95upper pMCMC Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.091 2.897 1.5119 3.931 0.0032 0.0000 sync 1.413 1.691 0.3116 3.320 0.0092 0.0074 $random Groups Name Std.Dev. MCMCmedian MCMCmean HPD95lower HPD95upper 1 student.id:group.name (Intercept) 0.3371 0.1480 0.1583 0.0000 0.3903 2 group.name (Intercept) 0.0000 0.1787 0.2955 0.0000 1.0023 3 Residual 0.6284 0.6721 0.6784 0.5373 0.8353 And if we summary the result, we got: AIC BIC logLik deviance REMLdev 108.7 118 -49.35 96.91 98.71 We don't lose the significance of sync, but the AIC has reduced. Can I conclude that my second model (without the time variable) is better? And can I just remove the time variable safely? It just made me feel wired to remove the time variable in a longitudinal study. (2) What if the the significance of sync is canceled when testing a model with interaction terms? Suppose we don't give up time variable, and I built a mixed model with an interaction term as follows: quality.Model.3 and we got the following : $fixed Estimate MCMCmean HPD95lower HPD95upper pMCMC Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 4.6887 4.3486 1.058 7.477 0.0200 0.0004 session.week -0.3859 -0.3402 -0.953 0.313 0.2842 0.1744 sync -0.6694 -0.2381 -4.267 3.874 0.8706 0.6835 session.week:sync 0.5110 0.4610 -0.395 1.368 0.2916 0.2018 $random Groups Name Std.Dev. MCMCmedian MCMCmean HPD95lower HPD95upper 1 student.id:group.name (Intercept) 0.3488 0.1465 0.1576 0.00 0.3941 2 group.name (Intercept) 0.0000 0.1861 0.3387 0.00 1.2614 3 Residual 0.6260 0.6808 0.6869 0.53 0.8444 Nothing is significant at all, including the interaction term!!! , after introducing the interaction term. If we do summary on it: AIC BIC logLik deviance REMLdev 113.7 126.7 -49.85 94.92 99.71 The AIC is larger than both quality.Model.1 and quality.Model.2. (3)What to choose So, which model should I choose if I want to see the effect of sync on quality? If I remove the time variable as fixed effects, then it's done perfectly. If I don't remove the time variable, then the main effects model suggests the significance of sync, but the interaction model cancels out everything.
