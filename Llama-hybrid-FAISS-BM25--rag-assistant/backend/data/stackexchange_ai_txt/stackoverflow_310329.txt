I would go for a Dining Philosopher's-esque approach, but depending on my audience, I would try to analogize it to the context of my audience. Are you speaking to business executives? Then analogize it to something like allocate a meeting room or a corporate car or booking a hotel room or whatever. Are you talking to average people? Then the dining philosopher's example is fine, or you can think up a similar situation involving caring for farm animals or sitting in chairs or whatever. Whether you hijack the dining philosopher's example, or make up your own, definitely use a metaphor.
