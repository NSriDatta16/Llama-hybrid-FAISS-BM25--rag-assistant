Is it possible to specify the indices for K-fold cross-validation with the tune function in R?

I would like to use the tune() function in R to specify the hyperparameters in an SVM model. The particular SVM implementation that I am using is the one that is provided in the e1071 package. By default, tune() runs a K-fold cross-validation, and chooses the testing and training sets for each fold by itself. I am wondering whether I can override this behavior and specify the indices of the testing and training set for each fold myself. If not, does anyone know if there is a package or combination of packages which allows me to run a K-fold CV on SVM and specify the indices of the training and testing set.
