Just use Statement, or PreparedStatement. http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html In a similar way to what you did, just call : Statement stm = Connection.createStatement(); then execute your SQL : stm.execute("SELECT * FROM MYTABLE"); grab the resultset and check out the results. Beware though - this is bad bad as far as security goes - as others have mentioned, PreparedStatements are a bit more secure, but still not 100%. To be honest, although basic JDBC is pretty simple, I really hate all the SQL strings littered around your code. If you want something a bit more elegant have a quick look at hibernate - it hides all the hackiness from you, and is also pretty easy to setup.
