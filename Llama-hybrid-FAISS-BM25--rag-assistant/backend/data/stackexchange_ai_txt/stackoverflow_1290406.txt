Doxygen and typedefs inside namespaces

Could someone tell me what is wrong with this code so doxygen cannot handle? /*! \file Enumerator.h \brief Implements an Enumerator pointer for accessing linked list elements. */ #pragma once #ifndef __MSCL_ENUMERATOR_H__ #define __MSCL_ENUMERATOR_H__ namespace MSCL { /*! \typedef Enumerator Pointer to linked list data structure. \sa ArrayList::GetEnumerator, \sa List::GetEnumerator */ typedef void* Enumerator; }; #endif I need the Enumerator that is used by many methods as an argument type to be 1) Visible in the help index. 2) Correctly linked with this documentation page. Target documentation format is chm. It's absolutely confusing becuase there's no error, no warning, nothing. Once, after playing with different doxygen configuration options I managed to achieve #1 - the type was in the index but I have no idea what switch did that and I couldn't repeat it.
