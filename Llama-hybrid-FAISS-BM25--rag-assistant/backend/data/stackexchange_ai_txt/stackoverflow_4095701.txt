Adding few static Html pages to website: Good/Bad practices?

I've this old and static website which is just a collection of html pages created in 2005 using DreamWeaver. I need to recreate it in ASP.NET MVC. However, I've noticed that there few contents that are not susceptible to change over time, such as The Ministerial decree that created that organization, its mission, and a couple of similar things. So, I wonder if for those cases, I can just put the content on the page. In one hand, that will speed up the development process. But, at the other hand, I fear that there be some principles I don't know yet that preach against using static pages in a modern website. I've checked online to see if there are blogs/articles on that, but all I can find is "theorical stuff", such definitions, etc., but nothing precise on that mather. Thanks for helping.
