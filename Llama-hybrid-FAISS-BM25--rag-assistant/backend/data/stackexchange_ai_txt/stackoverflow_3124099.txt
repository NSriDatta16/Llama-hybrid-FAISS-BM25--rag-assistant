CellDoubleClick event doesnt work after addition of Drag&Drop

After I added drag & drop to a DataGridView, the CellDoubleClick event stopped working. In the CellMouseDown event I have the following code: private void dataGridView2_CellMouseDown(object sender, DataGridViewCellMouseEventArgs e) { var obj = dataGridView2.CurrentRow.DataBoundItem; DoDragDrop(obj, DragDropEffects.Link); } How do I correct this to enable CellDoubleClick event?
