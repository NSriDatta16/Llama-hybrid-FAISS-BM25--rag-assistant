I assume that you know which sensors failed versus stopped to communicating. The first thing would be to mark those in the dataset. If a sensor is permanently stopping to communicate, you might also want to count that as another failure mode. Then you should compute time-features. For all sensors, compute a time-in-operation column. For each failing sensor, compute time until failure. Then plot these variables along with sensor reading variables against each-other and look for patterns. Use domain knowledge to engineer new features that may be informative, and plot those. For example, it may be that increased mechanical stress is correlated with sensor failure. So if there are some measurements of mechanical nature like temperature, vibration, speed etc those might be informational. The relationship could be to cumulative stress, or the maximum stress, or the large of differences in short time etc. Just gotta try different things and see what the data has to say. Once you have features that look informative, try a Linear Regression or Random Forest model, using time-until-failure as the target. You should probably do your train/val/test splits such that no device appears across folds.
