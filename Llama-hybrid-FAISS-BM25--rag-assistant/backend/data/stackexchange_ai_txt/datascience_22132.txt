Why do we need for Shortcut Connections to build Residual Networks, Because otherwise the network would not be a residual network. how [do residual connections] help to train neural networks for classification and detection? They add shortcuts for the gradient. This way the first few layers get updates very quick, the vanishing gradient problem is no longer a problem. So you can easily make networks with a 1000 layers. See Residual Networks paper . There is nothing specific about classification / detection. Its about very deep networks.
