It seems that your question stems from Section 9.4 in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by C. Bishop, where the author used upper-case letters $X, Z$ to denote both random variables and arguments of likelihood functions. For the latter, more standard notations should be lower-case letters. This ambiguity may cause confusions. Some descriptions in your post can be made more accurate as well: $q$ is not " a function from $Z$ to $\mathbb{R}$ ", instead, it is the density (here, "density" is a generic term which may stand for either the pmf when $Z$ is discrete or the pdf when $Z$ is continuous) of the latent random variable $Z$ , which is a function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ . To stress that $q$ is the density associated with $Z$ , a subscript " $Z$ " can be attached to $q$ , i.e., using $q_Z$ to denote the density of $Z$ . When we need to indicate the argument of $q_Z$ (e.g., the value of $q_Z$ evaluated at $z$ ), it can be made more specific as $q_Z(z)$ (I personally do not recommend writing $q(Z)$ or $q_Z(Z)$ , which would be easily understood as a new random variable but not a distribution function). By the same token, the precise meaning of the notation " $p(Z|X)$ " is the conditional density function of $Z$ given $X = x$ (where $x$ is the observed data values). When the joint density $f$ of $(X, Z)$ exists, the conditional density function of $Z$ given $X = x$ , denoted by $p_{Z|X}(z|X = x)$ for the greatest clarity, is given by \begin{align} p_{Z|X}(z|X = x) = \frac{f(x, z)}{p_X(x)}, \end{align} where $p_X$ denotes the marginal density of $X$ . It is easy to verify that $p_{Z|X}(z|X = x)$ is a valid density. Oftentimes, without losing the clarity, $p_{Z|X}(z|X = x)$ can be abbreviated as $p_{Z|X}(z|x)$ , or when the arguments are not needed, as $p_{Z|X}$ (with this notation, remember that this is a function of $z$ , not $x$ ). Now that both $q_Z$ and $p_{Z|X}$ are probability densities, the KL divergence between them can be unambiguously denoted as $\boxed{D_{\text{KL}}(q_Z||p_{Z|X})}$ , whose precise expansion is: \begin{align} D_{\text{KL}}(q_Z||p_{Z|X}) = \int_\mathbb{R} q_Z(z)\log\left(\frac{q_Z(z)}{p_{Z|X}(z|x)}\right)dz. \tag{1} \end{align} Note that as $x$ changes, $(1)$ is a function of $x$ .
