This is highly subjective but here is what I use: names for DAO class For an Order entity, I use OrderDao for the interface and HibernateOrderDao for the Hibernate implementation (a JPA based implementation would be JpaOrderDao , etc). class which create Single SessionFactory and retuns Session throug a static method I use the traditional HibernateUtil (and you'll find many references in the Hibernate documentation, literature, etc). Here is an example . There is a more sophisticated version in the Caveat Emptor sample app. hibernate mapping files A class named foo.bar.Foo would be mapped by a foo/bar/Foo.hbm.xml file. First, this makes mappings easy to organize, to find and ease the maintenance. Second, this allows to use the strongly typed Configuration#addClass(Class) method (which is refactoring resistant).
