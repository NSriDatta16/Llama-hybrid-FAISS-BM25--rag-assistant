I'd like to clarify the answers given so far because they seem to use phrases like "send EOF", "received EOF", "EOF character", etc. As per comments (thanks) to this answer, "send EOF" and "received EOF" are legitimate terms, but please don't think that it's a character. EOF is not a character at all. It is the value that getchar() (or fgetc/getc) returns if the stream is at "end-of-file" or a read error occurs. It is merely a special value outside the range of character values that getchar() will return that indicates the condition of error or end-of-file. It is defined by the C standard as being negative, whereas getchar returns characters as an unsigned char converted to int. Edit: On doing some research which I should've done before the paragraph I wrote that used to be here, I've realised some of my assumptions were completely wrong. Thanks to the commenter for pointing this out. Once a stream (such as stdin) is in end-of-file condition, this condition can be cleared again with clearerr() and getchar() may read more data from stdin.
