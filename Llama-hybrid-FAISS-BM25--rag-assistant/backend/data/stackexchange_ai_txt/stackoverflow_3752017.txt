Mobile Safari - Show console?

To prevent the default scrolling of a page I'm adding an event listener for "touchstart" events on the body and calling event.preventDefault() This works fine but I now can't access the debug console as it requires a page drag? Has anyone else had this problem and come up with a work around?
