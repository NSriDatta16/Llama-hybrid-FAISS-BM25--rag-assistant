LDAP is just a protocol, the wikipedia article explains it adequately http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol Its a way to query an underlying organizational structure like Microsoft's Active Directory. You can use LDAP queries to get all kinds of information about users, use it for setting application rights, etc.
