If the $X_i$ are random variables with a variance $\sigma_i^2$, then the variance of $X=\sum_i X_i$ their sum is $\sigma_X^2$ is given by: $\sigma_X^2=\sum_i \sigma_i^2 + 2 \sum_i \sum_{j So if draw a random sample $x_i$ from these distributions, then $x=\sum_i x_i$ will be random (when we draw another sample we will have another value for the sum). The variance of these random outcomes (the sums) will be given by the formula supra. If I divide a random variable $X$ with variance $\sigma_X^2$ by $n$ then the variance of this variable will be $\frac{\sigma_X^2}{n^2}$. Consequently, if you draw a random sample $x_i$ from the distributions of $X_i$, then $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_i x_i}{n}$ is random (with another sample I will have another average), if we draw many samples and each time compute the average, then we find the distribution of this random variable (the average $\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_i X_i}{n}$) and it has a variance equal to: $\sigma_{\bar{X}}^2=\frac{\sum_i \sigma_i^2 + 2 \sum_i \sum_{j If the $X_i$ are independent then the covariances are zero and the formula simplifies to. $\sigma_{\bar{X}}^2=\frac{\sum_i \sigma_i^2 }{n^2}$ If the $X_i$ are all independent and have the same variance $\sigma$ then this becomes: $\sigma_{\bar{X}}^2=\frac{\sum_i \sigma ^2}{n^2}=\frac{n \sigma^2}{n^2}=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ Note: the capital letters represent random variables, the small letters are draws from a random variable and so one particular outcome. Below some sample code to simulate this in the case of two independent variables #draw hughe sample from x1 and from x2 set.seed(1) #random variable with variance 25 x1
