Yes, your binning strategy makes sense. Alternatively, it’s also reasonable to fill missing values with the rounded average of the training dataset (ignoring the missing ones). You could also assume missing value denotes “no current competitor” and set it to a large negative number. Regardless of what works best for you, at test or predict time you would need to fill in with the exact same value. Alternatively, if that column is meaningful to learn with at all, you could train a model excluding the rows having no value. This may bias learning if the missing values are a systematic phenomenon plus behaviour is ambiguous if missing values can occur at predict time.
