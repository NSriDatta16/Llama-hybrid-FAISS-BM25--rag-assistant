Understanding Firebug profiler output

I've been trying to use Firebug's profiler to better understand the source of some JavaScript performance issues we are seeing, but I'm a little confused by the output. When I profile some code the profiler reports Profile (464.323 ms, 26,412 calls) . I suspect that the 464.323 ms is the sum of the execution time for those 26,412 calls. However, when I drill down into the detailed results I see individual results with an average execution time greater than 464.323 ms, e.g. the result with the highest average time reports the following details: Calls: **1** Percent: **0%** Own Time: **0.006 ms** Time: **783.506 ms** Avg: **783.506 ms** Min: **783.506 ms** Max: **783.506 ms** Another result reports: Calls: **4** Percent: **0.01%** Own Time: **0.032 ms** Time: **785.279 ms** Avg: **196.32 ms** Min: **0.012 ms** Max: **783.741 ms** Between these two results the sum of the Time results is a lot more than 464.323. So, what do these various numbers mean? Which ones should I trust?
