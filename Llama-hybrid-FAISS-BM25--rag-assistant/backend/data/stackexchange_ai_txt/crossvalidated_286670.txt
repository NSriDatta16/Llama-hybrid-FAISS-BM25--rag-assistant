Role of activation function in neural network: Before moving towards activation function one must have the basic understanding of neurons in the neural network. So what does an artificial neuron do? Simply put, it calculates a weighted sum of its input , adds a bias and then decides whether it should be activated or not . So consider a neuron . $$ Y = \sum (\textit{weight} \cdot \textit{input}) + \textit{bias} $$ Now, the value of $Y$ can be anything ranging from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. The neuron really doesnâ€™t know the bounds of the value. So how do we decide whether the neuron should activated or not We decided to add activation functions for this purpose. To check the $Y$ value produced by a neuron and decide whether outside connections should consider this neuron as activated or not .
