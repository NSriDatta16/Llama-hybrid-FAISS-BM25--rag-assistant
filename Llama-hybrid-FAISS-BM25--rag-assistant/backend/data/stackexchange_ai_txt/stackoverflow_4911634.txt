StackOverflow uses a cookie. I believe it's the one named "usr". If you're just trying to clear your stack overflow cookie, delete that one. Of course, safari is a nightmare around cookie handling so you might just need to use a real browser. If, however, your interest is really in html 5 local storage then you might want to rephrase the question. For safari (5/windows) I believe you click on the little gear icon in the top, go to preferences, then security. Then click on "show databases" and remove away.. But to iterate the point, SO doesn't use those.
