Saving multiples of the same object within Ruby On Rails

I've got an organisation database table which holds the following fields: organisationid, organisationname, organisationaddressid, mainadminname, mainadminaddressid. The two address ids are pointers to two records within the address database table. The address database table conatins the following fields: addressid, addressline1, addressline2, addresstowncity, addresspostcode. So when I create new organisation I want to capture the following information: organisationname organisationaddressline1 organisationaddressline2 organisationaddresstowncity organisationaddresspostcode mainadminname mainadminaddressline1 mainadminaddressline2 mainadminaddresstowncity mainadminaddresspostcode And when I save this information I want to create 1 organisation record and two address records. I'm at a loss on how to do this in ROR! Any suggestions gratefully recieved. Thanks for your time Sniffer
