Is there an easy way to drag items around in a ListView to change their order?

Let's say I have a ListView of items: Cat Dog Mouse And these are bound to the ListView via an adapter to a database. What I want to be able to do is to be able to re-order the list view,. For example I want to somehow drag "Mouse" up to the top of the list above "Cat". Once I have an order set, I then want to "save" the list and its order back to the database. Is there any way to do this? Has someone made such a custom ListView that I could use? The only alternative I can think of is to long press on a list view item and have a "Move up by one", "Move to top", etc. context menu that moves items around in the list.
