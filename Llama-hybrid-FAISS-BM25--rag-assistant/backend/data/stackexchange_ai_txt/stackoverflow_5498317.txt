which is the best way to update an application from a server?

I'm looking for a non-webstart/jnlp solution. I'd like to add to my app an update feature that checks in an ftp or http server and downloads the last version (if there is a newer one) replacing the libs that has been changed. How can i do that? I want to implement something like JDownloaders updates. Thanks
