CNN: How do I handle Blurred images in the dataset?

I have 30% blurred images in each classes. I have a total of 10 classes. I'm not allowed to drop these blurred images. How do I train the model to get better accuracy for both blurred and nonblurred training dataset ? Currently, I'm at 11% accuracy. The images were blurred using a Gaussian blur. I have used a Wiener filter, but not able to restore the image from blurred images. Please can anyone suggest a good way to train the model.
