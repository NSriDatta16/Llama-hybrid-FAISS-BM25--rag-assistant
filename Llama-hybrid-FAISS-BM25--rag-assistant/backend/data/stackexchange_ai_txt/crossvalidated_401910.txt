A random variable $\varepsilon \sim \mathrm{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ is not the kind of variable considered when thinking about function arguments or solving equations, but actually represents the outcome of a random experiment. (Mathematically rigorously, but not so important, one would say: it is a function mapping from a sample space into the space in which the random variable lives.) How can this be understood? A probability measure, like $\mathrm{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ assigns values to sets, so-called events. In this case, the probability of $\varepsilon$ ending up in a set $A$ has probability $$ \mathrm{N}(0,\sigma^2)(A) = \int_A \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \|x \|^2 \right) \mathrm{d}x. $$ That means, if you repeatedly saw i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) $\varepsilon$ 's, they would (in the large data limit) on average end up in $A$ , precisely $\mathrm{N}(0,\sigma^2)(A)\cdot 100 \%$ of the time.
