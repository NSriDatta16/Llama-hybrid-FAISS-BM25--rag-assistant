How do I create a list of vectors in Rcpp?

I'm writing an Rcpp module an would like to return as one element of the RcppResultSet list a list whose elements are vectors. E.g., .Call("myfunc")$foo should be something like: [[1]] [1] 1 [[2]] [1] 1 1 [[3]] [1] 1 1 1 (the exact numbers are not important here). The issue is that I don't know the right Rcpp way of doing this. I tried passing a vector > but this constructs a matrix by silently taking the length of the first vector as the width (even if the matrix is ragged!). I've tried constructing an RcppList but have a hard time casting various objects (like RcppVector ) safely into SEXP s. Anyone have tips on best practices for dealing with complicated structures such as lists of vectors in Rcpp?
