It's new for me that Q is constant over time. Q should correspond to the precision of your model and can of course change if the model precision varies over time. For me it's even a very nice feature for the Filter tuning. In the Dan Simon's "Optimal State Estimation" Q is always given with a subscript k, which means for me that it's not constant. Regarding to other sources on Kalman Filter I would advice to have a look at Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python . This is an interactive e-book with a lot of python examples, which help to understand some difficult aspects of Kalman filtering. The Q matrix is nice explained in Chapter 7.3 Design of the Process Noise Matrix.
