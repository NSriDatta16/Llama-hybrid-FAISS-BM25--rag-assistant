How do I convert an INT into HH:mm:ss using SSRS 2005

Ok I need to display total talk time of an agent that is coming into SRSS 2005 from SQL 2005 as an INT. For the life of me I cannot figure out what combination of expression editing or format editing I need to use. For the detail portion I can use: =DATEADD("s", SUM(Fields!Talk_Time.Value), CDate("00:00")) And it will return: 1/1/0001 12:00:14 AM Now I can use =LEFT(DATEADD("s", SUM(Fields!Talk_Time.Value), CDate("00:00")),8) Which will return: 12:00:14 But really what I need is: 00:00:14 Please help!
