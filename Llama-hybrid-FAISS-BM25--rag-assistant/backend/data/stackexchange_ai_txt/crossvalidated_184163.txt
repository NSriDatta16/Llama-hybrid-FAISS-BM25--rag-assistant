What can we conclude from a Bayesian credible interval?

I learned that the credible interval does not have the frequentist property, but recently I read the following statements that derived from the credible interval/region: Point (0,0) is on the edge line of the 98% credible region for the joint posterior density. The test for overall treatment effects is significant with p-value 0.02. in this thesis (Page 88) and We also depict the upper and lower 2.5% posterior quantiles in the figure. From these posterior inferences, we can further identify differentially expressed proteins. For example, if we require the 2.5% quantile above zero or the 97.5% quantile below zero, there are 19 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated proteins. in this paper (Section 4). Are they proper? Or what is the proper way to conclude from a credible interval? Any input will be greatly appreciated.
