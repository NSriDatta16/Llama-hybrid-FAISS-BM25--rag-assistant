Hm. The string may look horrendous (many things in Wordpress do :-), but from a performance perspective I hardly think that is the core of the problem. String operations are still quite fast, and at the end of the day, even if you use some sophisticated storage class, your data will be stored in some way like this, unless you are using a database. I would use a profiler to find out what the bottlenecks are. Maybe they are not in the PHP code, but in the Javascript that is done on top of it?
