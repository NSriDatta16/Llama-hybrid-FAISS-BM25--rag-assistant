OpenMP for loop ignores num_threads clause

I have the following code in VS2008: int i,j; bool pr = false; #pragma omp parallel for private(pr) num_threads(2) for(i=0;i (Not trying to make a nested OpenMP loop, in case you're wondering). The problem is, the num_threads clause has no effect whatsoever: I only ever get "Hello from thread 0 of 1" on the output. I tried using omp_set_num_threads(2) as well, to no avail. What gives?
