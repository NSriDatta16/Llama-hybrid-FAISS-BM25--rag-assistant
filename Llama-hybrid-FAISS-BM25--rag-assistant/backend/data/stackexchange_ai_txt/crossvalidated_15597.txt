Heteroscedastic test does not solve the problem

As my previous questions I'm trying to solve a problem with my stocks tests. I tried Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity but some residuals still pass these tests. My procedure is: Get two stocks prices (I have a matrix with two columns that represent the price lists) I do a linear regression, like: lm(prices[,1] ~ prices[,2]) Then I test the residuals of the linear regression with Unit Root tests (PP and KPSS) After these tests I do Breusch-Pagan test because I only need to work with stocks that have constant variance during all the period. I do: bptest(prices[,1] ~ prices[,2]) Ok, now I still get strange results, with strange i mean that when i plot the residuals i see that the variance is not constant (take a look at the chart below). So now, I need to understand how better test is the variance is constant. I read someone use GARCH (1,1) but I never used it, could someone exmplain it or maybe give me other tests to try?
