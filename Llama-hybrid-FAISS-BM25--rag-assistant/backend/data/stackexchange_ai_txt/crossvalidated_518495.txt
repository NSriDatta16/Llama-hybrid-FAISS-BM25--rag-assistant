What is the maximum Target cardinality in multi-label classification?

I have a dataset that consists of a target column with 65 classes. Also, the dataset has 200 columns/features. I researched multi-label classification and found the popular algorithms that can be used for multi-class classification include: k-Nearest Neighbors Decision Trees Naive Bayes Random Forest Gradient Boosting etc., However, I saw multi-label classification examples that have four or five target categories. Also from the Scikit-Learn Documentation on Multi-class : Number of targets Target cardinality Valid type_of_target Multiclass classification 1 >2 ‘multiclass’ Multilabel classification >1 2 (0 or 1) ‘multilabel-indicator’ Multiclass-multioutput classification >1 >2 ‘multiclass-multioutput’ Multioutput regression >1 Continuous ‘continuous-multioutput’ Found no maximum limit for cardinality in Multi-class . Is there any cardinality limit for Multi-class classification ? Are there any popular algorithms that can be used for predicting the classes that contain more than 65 classes?
