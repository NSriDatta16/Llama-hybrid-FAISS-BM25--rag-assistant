You need JavaScript on the client side (such as jQuery ) making AJAX calls to a server-side application. It will return JSON -formatted data, which you can then use to update the page on the client side. I think anything which relies on direct direct TCP communication is going to be very fragile from one user's browser to another â€“ that's not something which browsers typically facilitate, due to security concerns.
