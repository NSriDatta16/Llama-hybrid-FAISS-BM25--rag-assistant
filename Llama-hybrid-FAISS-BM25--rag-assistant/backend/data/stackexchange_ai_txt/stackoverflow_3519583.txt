You are right, there is no hierarchy of CMS pages in Magento. The best solution would be to create a real hierarchy by adding a parent_id to CMS pages and modifying the CMS module to handle nested URLs and breadcrumbs. But that requires a lot of coding. A quick-and-dirty hack is to modify the breadcrumbs manually on each subpage by adding something like this to the layout update XML: breadcrumbs home Home page Home page / myparentpage My Parent Page My Parent Page /myparentpage/ mysubpage My Sub Page My Sub Page
