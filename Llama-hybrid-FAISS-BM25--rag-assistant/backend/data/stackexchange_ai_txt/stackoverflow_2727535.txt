Convert a Delphi example using TDatabase and local paradox table to server storage

I am looking at the Developer Express Quantum Grid example 'IssueList' which is a useful bug reporting and tracking application that's almost ready to go out of the box. It uses a TDatabase component with several paradox (.db) tables. Is it simple to rejig the TDatabase settings to use a database on a shared machine so that several of us can access it together across the network? If so, what would be the steps needed please?
