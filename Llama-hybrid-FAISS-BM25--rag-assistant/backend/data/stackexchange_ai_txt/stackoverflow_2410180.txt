Is there a Ruby CSV parser that generates column getter methods?

I'm trying to generalize a data retrieval mechanism with Ruby, and can't seem to find a way to retrieve a CSV file and access one of the row's columns by using a dot operator like so: Let's say I have a CSV table: #some_file.csv name,age albert,13 And I create a FasterCSV table from it: a = FasterCSV.new(File.open('some_file.csv'), :headers => :first_row) Then, when accessing a row, I'd like to be able to say: a[0].name => 'albert' Instead of a[0]['name'] => 'albert' Anyone know how to do that?
