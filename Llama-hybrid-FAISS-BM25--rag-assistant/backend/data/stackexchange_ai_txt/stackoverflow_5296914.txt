It seems that Qt is encouraged for new applications, but GTK+ is handled (at least on Meego running on netbooks). http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-May/002704.html http://wiki.meego.com/MeeGo_Netbook_and_GTK The best for you would be to ask directly on the meego-dev mailing list , after having searched a recent information about that on the archives of their mailing list..
