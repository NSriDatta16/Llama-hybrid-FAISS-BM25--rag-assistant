unique constraint check in JPA

I am enforcing a unique constraint check in JPA for userid column which is enforced for all records in the user table. @Table(name = "user", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = userid)) My requirement is that, the userid's within a particular organization needs to be unique and not across all organizations. How do I enforce such a check?
