After some "try and error" i found a solution which works. But i am sure there is a more elegant way. Feel free to point me into the right direction. My solution consists of the replacement of the new span back to the u-tag on the onSave event: ed.onSaveContent.add(function(ed, o) { o.content = o.content.replace(/ (.*?) /gi, " $1 "); }); Felix Risterer mentioned the legacyoutput plugin. It works with this plugin too, but i will stick with the solution above cause the legacyplugin does many things and i am not fully able to predict what else could be affected.
