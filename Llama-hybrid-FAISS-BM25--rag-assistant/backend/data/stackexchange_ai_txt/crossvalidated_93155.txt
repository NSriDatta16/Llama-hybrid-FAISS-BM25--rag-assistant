While the other answers are great, I would add another sentiment: Avoid using SPSS. I used SPSS for my master's thesis and now on my regular job in market research. While working with SPSS, it was incredibly hard to develop organized statistical code, due to the fact that SPSS is bad at handling multiple files (sure, you can handle multiple files , but it's not as painless as R), because you cannot store datasets to a variable - you have to use "dataset activate x"- code, which can be a total pain. Also, the syntax is clunky and encourages shorthands, which make code even more unreadable.
