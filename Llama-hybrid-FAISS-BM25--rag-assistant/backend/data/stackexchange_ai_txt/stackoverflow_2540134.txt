Good question. Looking at the examples in the manual , I guess you can't. The best workaround idea that comes to mind is to make all your includes in your project not return naked values, but an array containing the return value ( return array(1); ). Everything else that comes to mind (mine at least) involves defining some constants or variables to flag whether you're in an include or not. Nothing elegant.
