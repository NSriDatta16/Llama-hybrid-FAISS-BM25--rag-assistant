Outlier treatment in sales data comparisson

I'm working for a webshop and I'm trying to compare month for month this year with same month last year. In order to get a better picture of growth in revenue/loss in revenue I use z-scores to detect outliers in the transaction data. We have about 2000-3000 monthly orders and with my calculations we have 20-50 monthly outlier values according to the z-score method. I use Python for my calculations Im not sure if it is the right decision to remove all transactions when the z-score is +3 or -3 because the values are correct. If I shouldn't remove the outliers, would I then convert them to the closest value over -3 and under +3? The tricky parts is my data is of course affected if we for example have improved our website and therefore increased our average order value. Another thing can be if we one month have special offers on high value products it would affect the data too. My question is if I am approaching my analysis the right way. If not, can anyone help me in the right direction :)
