I found the problem. In fact my objectclass was not compliant with Active Directory. Furthermore change information encoding by a python string. Here is the code to use: attrs = {} attrs['objectclass'] = ['top','person','organizationalPerson','user'] attrs['cn'] = str(username) attrs['userPassword'] = str(password) attrs['mail']=str(email) attrs['givenName']=str(firstname) attrs['sn']=str(surname) attrs['description'] = 'User object for replication using slurpd' I can add an account in my Active Directory successfully. Hope it will help u.
