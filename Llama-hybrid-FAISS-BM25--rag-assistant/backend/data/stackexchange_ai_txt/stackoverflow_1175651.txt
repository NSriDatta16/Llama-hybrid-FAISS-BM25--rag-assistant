Nothing about the drag and drop is unsafe, it's the pointer manipulation in the image processing code. Rather than coding this yourself, why not use one of the existing methods in the framework? Use System.Drawing.Imaging SetRemapTable ( example here ) to replace the transparency via a color map. See if you can handle this with pixel shaders , which would result in safe code an would likely perform a lot better because it would leverage the GPU.
