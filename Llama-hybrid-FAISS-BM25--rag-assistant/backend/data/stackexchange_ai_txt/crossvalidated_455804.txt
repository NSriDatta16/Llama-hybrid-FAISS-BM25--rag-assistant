Is it correct to say that when you add two standard errors to both sides of the sample mean, you will capture the actual mean 95% of the time? That's essentially the frequentist interpretation (given repeated sampling), though the Bayesians take a different approach. [I]s it correct to say that the critical value will determine how far the standard error will deviate from the center, and thus determines the level of confidence? I think you're conflating a few ideas here. A critical value like 1.96 is a function of how risk averse (or accepting) we are as researchers. It's not a function of the data. If I'm feeling very risk averse, I select a high critical threshold, but if I'm more risk-acceptant I choose a lower critical threshold. The standard error is a function of the data and sample size ( $\hat{\sigma}=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{n}}$ , where $\sigma$ is a standard deviation, and $n$ is the size of a given sample). Therefore, a critical value cannot affect the value of a standard error. Nevertheless, both a critical value and a standard error can affect confidence in a statistic. As (a) critical values get bigger and (b) standard errors get smaller, we become not only more confident about the interval in which a parameter exists but also we can be more precise in expressing the range of that interval. Basically, I still do not fully understand why we need to multiply by a z-value, which I guess is from a separate normal distribution? A $z$ -value simply measures the number of standard errors a point estimate falls from its null hypothesis using the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution is a standard normal distribution and is not the same thing as a distribution of observations from a single sample. The sampling distribution is the density distribution of sample means taken from many, many samples taken from the population of interest. We use the sampling distribution to hypothesis-test. When you construct a confidence interval, you're multiplying not by a $z$ -value but by a critical value like 1.96 (for 95 percent confidence using a two-tail test). Therefore, multiplying a standard error by a critical value, then adding and deducting that value from the point estimate, is what gives us our confidence interval. Remember that $z$ -values are measured in units of standard errors of the sampling distribution. They correspond to $p$ -values, which tell us the proportion of the sampling distribution that either occurs up to or after that value of $z$ . We use critical values like 1.96 because $z=1.96$ has a $p$ -value of 0.025 in its left-tail and 0.025 in its right tail, meaning that: $\bar{x} \pm 1.96\times \hat{\sigma}$ describes the central 95 percent of the sampling distribution.
