Should I use Hellinger transformed species (abundance) data for NMDS if this is what I used for RDA ordination?

I am conducting both constrained and unconstrained analyses on the same species abundance data. For the constrained ordination, I ran the RDA (redundancy analysis) on log x+1 and hellinger transformed species abundance data. For the unconstrained ordination, I am using NMDS. I initially did the nmds using raw (non transformed) species data: metaMDS(SPdata, distance = 'bray',k=2, trymax=100) This automatically applies Wisconsin double standardization. However, I just saw an example on YouTube where they also used the hellinger transformed data for the nmds. If I am hoping to look at both the RDA and NMDS results for comparison, should I also be using the hellinger transformed data for the nmds? like I did for the RDA. I just tried the NMDS with the hellinger transformed species matrix and it does give slightly different results. I am using the vegan package in R for both ordinations. I feel like this is a very basic question, but I have a limited stats background and haven't found a satisfying answer online. Thank you!
