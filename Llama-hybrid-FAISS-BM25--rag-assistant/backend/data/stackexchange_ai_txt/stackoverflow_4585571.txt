Drag and drop feature in javascript

Could you help me please? I would like to know how to support my website by adding a drag and drop feature using JavaScript. If anyone has useful references or examples; because I am totally blind in this area. Thank you :) The things that I have to do drag and drop could be a div or predifined object.
