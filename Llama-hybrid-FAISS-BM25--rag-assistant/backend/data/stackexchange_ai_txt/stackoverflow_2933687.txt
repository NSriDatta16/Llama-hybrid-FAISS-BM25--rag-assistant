In order to run ColdFusion code (CFML), you need to have a ColdFusion processor on your server. This means either using Adobe ColdFusion, or if you're looking to save money, try looking at Railo or Open BlueDragon, both are CFML processors. Any one of these solutions will work if you are in control of the server, however, if you are on a shared hosting account, you may be out of luck. Many hosts will have ColdFusion as an add-on service to your hosting account. It's best to ask your host to see if they offer it. If you can't get any of these solutions, the best you could do would be to go about translating that code (or, engaging the services of someone who knows how to do it) so that it would run on your host. This would mean taking it from CFML to PHP, ASP, or .NET (Visual Basic / C#). You won't find software that can do this for you.
