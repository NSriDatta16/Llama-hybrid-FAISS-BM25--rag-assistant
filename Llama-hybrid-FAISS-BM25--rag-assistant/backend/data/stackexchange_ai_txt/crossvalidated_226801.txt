Several tentative approximations: Random variables are not random. They are deterministic functions from the outcome to the real line, $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R$. So you run a random experiment (the experiment, say tossing a coin, is random in the sense that we don't have a formula to return the outcome a priori ), and get an outcome; run it again, and get another outcome. Soon you have a sample, and you happen to be interested in a parameter, say the proportion of heads, $p$: you are mapping something like $\small \{H,T,H,H,H,T,H,T,T,T\}$ to the interval $[0,1]$ to get an estimate of the parameter $p$ based on your sample, using the simple formula, $\frac{\text{no.heads}}{\text{total}}$, a deterministic formula. You may label this estimate, $\hat p$. Confidence interval : From this point estimate, you can calculate the CI with some formula, such as, $\hat p\,\pm\,1.96\,\sqrt{\frac{\hat p\,(1-\hat p)}{n}}$. Again deterministic, meaning (crazy nomenclature), a random variable... or two: one for the lower bound, and the other for the upper bound. So effectively you have unfolded the point estimate into two point estimates, based on some underling distributional assumptions (normal approximation), completely unrelated to the specific realization that your sample represents. This interval can contain $p$ or not . Again, think about the point estimate - it can fall very far from the true parameter, $p$, and affect the CI accordingly. But there is one saving grace, which is at the same time a painful yoga position: If you were to repeat this process time and time again, and get many $\hat p$ estimates with their respective confidence intervals, the true parameter $p$ would be contained in $95\%$ of them. The confidence interval does not tell you that with $95\%$ probability the true proportion is contained between its bounds, which is mind boggling. It is, instead nothing more than "an elaboration" on the sample based on things like the CLT. As such it is "random" (wink, wink). If you want the probability that the parameter $p$ is contained within an certain interval, you have to change party affiliation, and look up credible intervals under the apparently more satisfying Bayesian paradigm.
