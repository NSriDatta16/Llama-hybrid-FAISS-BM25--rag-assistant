As this question did pop up again, I may add another answer inspired by a recent blog post via R-Bloggers from Robert Kabacoff, the author of Quick-R and R in Action using the lmPerm package. However, this methods produces sharply contrasting (and very unstable) results to the one produced by the coin package in the answer of @caracakl (the p-value of the within-subjects analysis is 0.008 ). The analysis takes the data preparation from @caracal's answer as well: x1 produces: > summary(aovp( DV ~ IV + Error(id))) [1] "Settings: unique SS " Error: id Component 1 : Df R Sum Sq R Mean Sq Residuals 19 15946 839 Error: Within Component 1 : Df R Sum Sq R Mean Sq Iter Pr(Prob) IV 1 7924 7924 1004 0.091 . Residuals 19 21124 1112 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 If you run this multiple times, the p-values jumps around between ~.05 and ~.1. Although it is an answer to the question let me allow to pose a question at the end (I can move this to a new question if desired): Any ideas of why this analysis is so unstable and does produce a so diverging p-values to the coin analysis? Did I do something wrong?
