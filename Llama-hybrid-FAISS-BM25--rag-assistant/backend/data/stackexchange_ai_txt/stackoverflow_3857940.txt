Nick, You can do this for Facebook by configuring a domain alias (CNAME): http://wiki.gigya.com/035_Socialize_Setup/020_Facebook_Settings This only applies to Facebook. For other service providers (twitter, google, etc), users will remain logged in. I suspect the functionality will evolve as this issue receives more attention. For now, perhaps your site logout process should remind users that they're still logged in to (xyz) provider.
