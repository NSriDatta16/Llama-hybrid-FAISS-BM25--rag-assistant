Data lasts longer than applications. It hangs around for years and years. This is true even if your application doesn't handle data of interest to regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies, but the range of data which interests those guys keeps increasing. Also it is still more common for data to be shared between applications with an organisation (reporting, data warehouse, data hub, web services) or exchanged between organisations than it is for one application to share multiple databases. Such exchanges may involve other mechanisms for loading data as well as extracting data besides the front end application which notionally owns the schema. So, if you only want to code your data validation rules once put them in the database. If you like belt'n'braces put them in the GUI as well.
