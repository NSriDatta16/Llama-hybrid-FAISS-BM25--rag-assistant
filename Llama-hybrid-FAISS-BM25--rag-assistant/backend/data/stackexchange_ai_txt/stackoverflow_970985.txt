ADO.NET DataRow - check for column existence

How do I check for the existence of a column in a datarow? I'm building datatables to organize some data that I've already pulled back from the database. Depending on the type of data in each row, I need to create a datatable with different columns. Then, later on, I want to check and see if the datatable I am looking at has a certain column. I know I can catch the exception and handle it that way, but I'm curious if there is a property or method on the datarow object that will do this for me? Here's how I can do it by catching the exception: public static String CheckEmptyDataRowItem(DataRow row, String rowName, String nullValue) { try { return row[rowName].ToString(); } catch (System.ArgumentException) { return nullValue; } }
