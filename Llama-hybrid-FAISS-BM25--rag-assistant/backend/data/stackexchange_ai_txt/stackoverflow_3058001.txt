Elegant Method of Inserting Code Between Loops

In web development, I often find I need to format and print various arrays of data, and separate these blocks of data in some manner. In other words, I need to be able to insert code between each loop, without said code being inserted before the first entry or after the last one. The most elegant way I've found to accomplish this is as follows: function echoWithBreaks($array){ for($i=0; $i Unfortunately, there's no way that I can see to implement this solution with foreach instead of for . Does anyone know of a more elegant solution that will work with foreach ?
