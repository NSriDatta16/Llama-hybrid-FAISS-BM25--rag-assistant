How do I treat zero inflated univariate time series data?

The data I am handling is a rainfall data. The only columns are "Date" and "Rainfall". The day that is not raining will be accounted to zero, therefore it is a zero inflated dataset. I am looking to use "pscl" library from R and all the example I saw is either using multivariate or bivariate data. Is it not possible to use this method to handle zero inflated data? If no, should I ignore the violation of normality and proceed the forecasting?
