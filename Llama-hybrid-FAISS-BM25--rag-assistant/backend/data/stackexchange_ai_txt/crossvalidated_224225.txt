Can anyone explain the inner product within a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space?

I saw this formula on a machine learning paper, but just couldnt get my head around it. Can you anyone help me understand it? Suppose $H$ is a RKHS, K a kernel function, and $\{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3,\ ... \}$ and $\{\psi_1, \psi_2, \psi_3 \ ...\}$ are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions satisfying $\int K(x,y)\psi_j(y) = \lambda_j\psi_j(y)$. For any f and g from H, we can write $f=\Sigma\alpha_i\psi_i$ and $g=\Sigma\beta_i\psi_i$. Then why is the inner product $ =\Sigma_{i=0}^{\infty}\alpha_i\beta_i/\lambda_i$? Can anyone please explain?
