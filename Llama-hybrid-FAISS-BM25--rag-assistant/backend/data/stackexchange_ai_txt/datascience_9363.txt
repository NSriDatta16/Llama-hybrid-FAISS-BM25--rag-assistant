Linear Regression is used for predicting continuous variables. Logistic Regression is used for predicting variables which has only limited values. Let me quote a nice example which can help you make the difference between the both: For instance, if X contains the area in square feet of houses, and Y contains the corresponding sale price of those houses, you could use linear regression to predict selling price as a function of house size. While the possible selling price may not actually be any, there are so many possible values that a linear regression model would be chosen. If, instead, you wanted to predict, based on size, whether a house would sell for more than 200K, you would use logistic regression. The possible outputs are either Yes, the house will sell for more than $200K, or No, the house will not.
