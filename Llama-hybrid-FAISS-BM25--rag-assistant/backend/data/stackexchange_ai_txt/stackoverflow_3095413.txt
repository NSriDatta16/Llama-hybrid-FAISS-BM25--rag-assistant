I have create a post build event that run on our build server that copies the WSP file to our test server in a specific directory. Once on the test server, a (Windows Server) timer job looks for the WSP file and a STSADM command installs them. Sometimes we run into issues removing the solution since I haven not found an easy/elegant way to check if the solution is properly removed. Usually I run a command to remove the solution. Run it a second time and then install.
