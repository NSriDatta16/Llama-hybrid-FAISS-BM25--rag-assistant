Question in Artificial neural network normalization

I wish to normalize inputs parameters into [0 - 1] and fit into a neural network for training. I have done a simple normalization method - MinMax Question 1: if my inputs have negative values, do i need to increase each of the values by adding with the min negative value's absolute value? So there will not be any negative value left. Example training sets. Question 2: Do i have to normalize my outputs with my inputs as well? (together)
