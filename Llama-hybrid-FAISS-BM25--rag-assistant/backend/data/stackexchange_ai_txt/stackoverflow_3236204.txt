Note that you can partition your FILESTREAM table to distribute the FILESTREAM data across multiple disks. Regarding NAS, see this article by Bob Beauchemin where he says "Note that the filegroup needs to point to a local file system location; filestreams can't live on a remote server or a network addressable storage (NAS) devices unless the NAS device is presented as a local NFS volume via iSCSI." It indicates that if the NAS device is presented as a local volume via iSCSI, it can be used to store FILESTREAM data. (I have not tried this though)
