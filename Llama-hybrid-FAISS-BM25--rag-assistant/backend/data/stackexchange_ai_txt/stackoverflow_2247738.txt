While I did not solve this particular problem, I took a slightly different approach to writing the class that gave the the functionality I want and did not cause the problem to arise. I am still using NSFetchedResultsController, but rather than implementing all four delegate methods, I am only implementing controllerDidChangeContent:, which just calls [tableView reloadData]. This is the implementation that is included in the RootViewController class if you create a new Navigation-Based Application in XCode that uses Core Data for storage. You probably lose some control over table-edit animations, but it's much simpler and works fine for my purposes.
