The two good papers on this subject are below: 1) Bayesian Online Change Point Detection 2) Modeling changing dependency structure in multivariate time series These do not apply a clustering algorithm but take the interval (since the last change point) into account as you have asked for. And they work with parametric distributions. The paper by Adams and Mackay (the first one) also has the algorithm implemented in MatLab and Python.
