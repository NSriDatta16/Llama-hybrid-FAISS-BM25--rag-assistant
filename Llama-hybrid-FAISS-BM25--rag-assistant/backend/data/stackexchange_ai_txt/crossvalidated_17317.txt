Simple exponential smoothing

I simulated a time series using expressions (3.10a), (3.10b) from (Hyndman et al., 2008). Next, I'd like to use a simple exponential smoothing method to forecast for the next period. For a given initial point $\hat{y}_1$ I obtained the smoothing parameter $0 My question is as follows: am I going to predict the next value of the local level $l_t$ or the next value of the observed time series $y_t$? Regretfully, I still do not understand how one can predict a quantity which includes a random component, and if I got it right, time series without trend consists of level and such a component.
