Do you mean the vector members, or the vector structure itself? Members are guaranteed to be contiguous in memory but structure alignment is platform/compiler-dependent. On Windows this can be set at compile-time and also overridden using #pragma pack() . The answer for other containers is likely not the same as for vector, so I would ask specific questions about the ones you care about.
