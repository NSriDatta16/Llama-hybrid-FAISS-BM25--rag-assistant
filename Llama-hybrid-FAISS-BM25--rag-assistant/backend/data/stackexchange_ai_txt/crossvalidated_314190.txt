ACF indicates non-stationarity but but time series plot looks stationary

I am trying to choose the correct ARIMA model. To get a stationary series on which to plot the ACF and PACF on I've done the following transformations on my original series: natural log 1st non-seasonal differences 1st seasonal differences of the non-seasonal differences Judging from my time series plot(included below) the final series seems stationary but unfortunately I can't interpret the ACF plot. It looks to me like it would need further or different transformations. This is my data set with the transformations I've done. I included my plots below. I am using minitab 18 to generate these. Time Series Plot of Original Series Time Series Plot of Transformed Series ACF of Transformed Series (Lags: 48) PACF of Transformed Series (Lags: 48) ACF of 1st Non-seasonal Diff: PACF of 1st Non-seasonal Diff:
