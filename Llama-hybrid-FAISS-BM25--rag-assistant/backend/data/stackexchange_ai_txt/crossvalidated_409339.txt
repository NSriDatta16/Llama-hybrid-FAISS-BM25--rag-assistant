The problem here is that the metric for "population variance" that divides by the finite population size (without using Bessel's correction) is a bad measure of variance to begin with. If you incorporate Bessel's correction into the (finite) population variance for the data vector $\mathbf{x} = (1,2,3,4,5,60)$ you get: $$s_N^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_i (x_i-\bar{x})^2 = \frac{2717.5}{5} = 543.5 \neq 452.92.$$ Now, if you sample with replacement from your data then the sample variance will average to this value. In particular, averaging the sample variance over all 15 combinations of 4 distinct data points gives this value. (Try this and you will see.) The incompatibility you are getting in your question is hardly surprising when you consider that any finite set of data can be considered as a random sample of an infinite sequence, and in this context, the sample variance (incorporating Bartlett's correction) of any amount of data is an unbiased estimator of the superpopulation variance (i.e., the variance parameter). This, it is unsurprising that a sample variance of four data points does not average to the same thing as a "population variance" of six data points, when the latter does even use the same variance formula as the former. As suggested in O'Neill (2014) , Bartlett's correction should be incorporated into the "population variance" for a finite population (contrary to the standard approach presented in text-books and introductory statistics courses). It makes no sense to have a metric for the (finite) population variance that uses a different denominator than the sample variance. Not only does this create the strange situation you highlight in your question, but it also then means that the finite population variance is not an unbiased estimator of the variance for a superpopulation into which it is embedded.) "The reason we choose to incorporate Bartlett’s correction is that it makes sense to consider the finite population variance as an estimator of a larger infinite superpopulation variance in the context of a superpopulation model. With this consideration, Bartlett’s correction ensures that the sample variance and population variance both have the same expected value and therefore function as unbiased estimators of the superpopulation variance parameter."
