WWW::Mechanize can take an optional timeout parameter (specified in seconds) in its constructor (which is passed to its parent class LWP::UserAgent in this case). I think the default is like 180 seconds. Try increasing it, like: my $browser = WWW::Mechanize->new( timeout => 60 * 10, # 10 minutes ); See the LWP::UserAgent docs on the timeout method for the specific semantics of how this is treated. It's mostly as you expect, but just in case.
