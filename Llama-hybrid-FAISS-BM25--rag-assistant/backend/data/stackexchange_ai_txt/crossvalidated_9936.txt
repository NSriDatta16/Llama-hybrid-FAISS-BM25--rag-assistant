The variance gamma process is a useful way to go. It is an extension of the standard brownian motion process, $Z(t)$ $$Y(t;\mu,\sigma,\nu)=\mu \Gamma(t;1,\nu) + \sigma Z(\Gamma[t;1,\nu])$$ Where $\Gamma(t;1,\nu)$ is a gamma process, with independent gamma distributed increments. So $\Gamma(t+s;1,\nu)-\Gamma(t;1,\nu)$ has a gamma distribution with mean $s$ and variance $s\nu$. (you could replace the $1$ by another parameter $\mu$ if desired, to have mean $s\mu$, as is done here ). The intuition is that "time" is measured in some sort of trading volume rather than calendar time. So it incorporates a sense of the market "getting hot" and "getting cold". This process has the "fat tail" property that you seek, and is commonly used as an option pricing model. It can be used by averaging the Blackâ€“Scholes option price with respect to gamma distribution for the time. The increments of this distribution $Y(t)-Y(s)$ follow a Laplace distribution. More generally one speaks of what are called Levy process, which have characteristic function $\varphi_{y}(\theta)=E[\exp(i\theta Y_{t})]$: $$\varphi_{t}(\theta)=\exp\left(it\mu\theta - \frac{t}{2}\sigma^{2}\theta^{2}+t\int_{|x| \epsilon}[e^{i\theta x}-1]d\Pi(x)\right)$$ Where $d\Pi(x)$ is called the Levy measure, and governs discontinuities in the process (or the "jumps"). The measure must satisfy: $$\int_{|x| \epsilon}d\Pi(x) Thus it can have a singularity at zero as long it is not "too big". Can show for the variance gamma process the Levy measure is given by: $$d\Pi(x)=\frac{dx}{\nu|x|}\exp(-\frac{1}{\nu}|x|)$$ UPDATE In regards to Cardinal's well directed comments (I have a tendency to "wander-off" when I'm doing some sort of maths) you can see that the only criterion for your "fat tailed" distribution to satisfy your criterion is that the moment generating function $m_{X}(t)=E[\exp(tX)]$ exists when evaluated at $t=1$. Equivalently we require the characteristic function to exist when evaluated at $\theta=-i$. Because the Levy-process is defined by its CF then it is always finite when the two integral equations above are satisfied. The expectation is given by the above formula
