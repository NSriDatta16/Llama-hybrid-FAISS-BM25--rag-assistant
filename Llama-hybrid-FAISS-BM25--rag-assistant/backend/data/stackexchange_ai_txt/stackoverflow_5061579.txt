Have you checked that Emacs and terminal really display the font differently? In your screenshot, the font size itself in Emacs is bigger. Anyways, you can choose different spacing values when setting a font by appending them to the font name, e.g. "Monaco-10:spacing=110" . Try if you can get the behaviour you want this way. EDIT: Maybe the second paragraph of my answer should be disregarded. I basically guessed this based on the output of describe-font , but further experiments with it didn't yield satisfying results.
