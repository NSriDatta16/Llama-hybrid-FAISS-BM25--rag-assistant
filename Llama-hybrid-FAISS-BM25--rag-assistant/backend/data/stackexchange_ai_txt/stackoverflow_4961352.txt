Migration to cloud database

I am assessing the possibility of my organization (software as a service org) migrating parts of our existing disk-based DBs to an in-memory cloud-based DB model (hosted in our datacenters). The smoothest path would be to find a cloud DB that could execute dynamic SQL but I'm finding that the cloud DBs are fundamentally object-model based (i.e. no SQL). Does anyone have experience migrating parts of an RDBMS to a cloud-based DB? If so what path did you take?
