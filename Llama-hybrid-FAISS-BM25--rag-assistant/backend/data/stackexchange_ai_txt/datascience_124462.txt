Scale dataset while preserving relative distributions between columns

I have a large dataset with 460 columns. The columns have names such as 'AppOpen_1day', 'AppOpen_2day', ...... 'AppOpen_15day', 'Dig_Pos_1day', 'Dig_Pos_2day', ...... 'DigPos_15day' etc. Each column belongs to one of 62 categories (for example, the first set of columns above belongs to the 'AppOpen' category, the next set belongs to the 'Dig_Pos' category). Now, I need to scale these columns in order to train an autoencoder to fit on this dataset. I also need to make sure that the relative distributions between columns in a category doesn't change. (for example, AppOpen_2day column's distribution will be slightly shifted to the right with higher mean and standard deviation compared to AppOpen_1day column's distribution. That's how the data is, and I want to preserve that). I have tried sklearn's StandardScaler(), however it fits and scales each column independently, hence there is a good chance the relative distributions between columns in a category would change. Is there a method to scale my dataset where that doesn't happen? Or any existing standard library function that does the same?
