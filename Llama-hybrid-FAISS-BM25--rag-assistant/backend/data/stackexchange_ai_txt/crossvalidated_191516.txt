How to use Bayesian updating to measure deviation from initial estimates and how delayed a Scrum project is?

Imagine a Product Owner estimates that the software development team using Scrum they are working with is going to be able to complete 80 user stories in 5 sprints: Sprint 1: 16 stories Sprint 2: 16 stories Sprint 3: 16 stories Sprint 4: 16 stories Sprint 5: 16 stories Based on past team performance metrics, the team Product Owner has stated a belief that there is only a 5% chance the team will need more sprints to complete those 80 stories. But after the first 3 sprints, things look like this: Sprint 1: 8 stories Sprint 2: 8 stories Sprint 3: 12 stories Is there a way to use Bayes rule to update the original idea that there was only a 5% chance that the 80 stories will be finished on after the 5th sprint? What is the chance now? Would it had been possible to calculate it after the first sprint differed from the estimate? Assuming sprints behave as they have behaved in the past... What is the way to calculate the number of sprints that are needed to finish the project so that there is only a 5% chance that more sprints are needed?
