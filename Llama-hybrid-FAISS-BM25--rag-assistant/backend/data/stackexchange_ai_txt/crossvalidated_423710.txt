The approach that you describe is actually used in a nature publication as an illustration for the (often unknown) complexity involved when interpreting standard p-values. See here: Nuzzo, 2014 . But I agree with Dayne: this approach is not justied by the frequentist paradigm, since in the frequentist sense parameters are not random. If you go Bayesian, then this perfectly legit. However, Bayesians have developed other nice tools that are preferred, like Bayes Factors or posterior predictive p-values.
