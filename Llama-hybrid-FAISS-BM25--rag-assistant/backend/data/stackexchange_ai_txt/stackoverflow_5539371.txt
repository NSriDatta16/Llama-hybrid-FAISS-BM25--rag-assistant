The jQuery hide() and show() methods "animate the width, height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously" so as the height and width change, the browser is re-flowing the document. Browsers do re-flow very differently and in IE this is making the boxes jump. You may want to use a custom jQuery animate() - perhaps just the height? It is the decreasing width that is causing the floated elements to re-flow. The broken layout after selecting the "Cancel" link is caused by jQuery leaving style on the after the animation. This is causing the boxes div to not clear the paragraph on the left correctly and therefore have less width and therefore cannot fit 3 child elements on a row. You can remove these extra styles jQuery leaves by hooking into the callback on the final show() method like so: $('div.boxes').show('slow', function() { $(this).attr('style', ''); }).delay(700); Just to note also, that it probably doesn't help that IE will be running in quirks mode . Your page does not have a doctype which in my experience can lead to unwanted and unexpected rendering issues (particularly in IE). Apart from the missing doctype there are a couple of other minor issues that are causing you page to not validate . Hope this is useful :-)
