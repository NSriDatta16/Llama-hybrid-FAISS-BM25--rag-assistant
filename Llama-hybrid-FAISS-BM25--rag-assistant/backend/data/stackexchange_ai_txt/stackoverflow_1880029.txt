Find computed style "source" ("trigger") in DOM inspector

Is it possible to find in DOM Inspector what tag/class/id combination triggered a particular Computed style rule. In my particular case I have a font that changes its appearance if a wrap the fragment in some other tag combination. So I see the different computed Style font-size(s), but can not quickly understand the difference in the contexts. Maybe some other extension?
