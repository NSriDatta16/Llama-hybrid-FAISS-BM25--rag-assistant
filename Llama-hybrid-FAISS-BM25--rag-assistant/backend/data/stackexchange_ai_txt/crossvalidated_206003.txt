Slice sampling is a special case of Gibbs sampling, to the point that in Monte Carlo Statistical Methods , we started our chapters on Gibbs sampling with a first chapter on slice sampling (Chapter 8). To quote verbatim from the book (p.326): Slice sampling relies upon the decomposition of the density $f(x)$ as $$ f(x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^k f_i(x)\,, $$ where the $f_i$'s are positive functions, but not necessarily densities . For instance, in a Bayesian framework with a flat prior, the $f_i(x)$ may be chosen as the individual likelihoods. This decomposition can then be associated with $k$ auxiliary variables $\omega_i$, rather than one as in the fundamental theorem, in the sense that each $f_i(x)$ can be written as an integral $$ f_i(x) = \int \mathbb{I}_{0\le \omega_i\le f_i(x)}\,d\omega_i\,, $$ and that $f$ is the marginal distribution of the joint distribution $$(x,\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_k) \sim p(x,\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_k) \propto \prod_{i=1}^k \mathbb{I}_{0\le \omega_i\le f_i(x)}\,. $$This particular demarginalization of $f$ introduces a larger dimensionality to the problem and induces a generalization of the random walk of Section 8.1 which is to have uniform proposals one direction at a time. Now, why is slice sampling a particular case of Gibbs sampling? Simply because in the "augmented space" made of the original variables $X_i$'s and of the auxiliary slice variables $U_i$'s, the steps are sheer simulations from the full conditionals: 1.Generate from $p(u_1 | u_2,\ldots, u_n,x_{1}, \ldots,x_n)=\mathbb{I}_{0\le u_1\le p(x_1|x_2,\ldots,x_n)}$ 2.Generate from $p(x_1| u_1,\ldots, u_n,x_{2}, \ldots,x_n)=\mathbb{I}_{0\le u_1\le p(x_1|x_2,\ldots,x_n)}$ $$\vdots$$ 2i-1.Generate from $p(u_i | u_1,\ldots, u_{i-1},u_{i+1},\ldots,u_n,x_{1}, \ldots,x_n)=\mathbb{I}_{0\le u_i\le p(x_i|x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n)}$ 2i.Generate from $p(x_i| u_1,\ldots, u_n,x_{1},\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1}, \ldots,x_n)=\mathbb{I}_{0\le u_i\le p(x_i|x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n)}$ $$\vdots$$ 2n-1.Generate from $p(u_n | u_1,\ldots, u_{n-1}x_{1}, \ldots,x_n)=\mathbb{I}_{0\le u_n\le p(x_i|x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1})}$ 2n.Generate from $p(x_n| u_1,\ldots, u_n,x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n-a})=\mathbb{I}_{0\le u_n\le p(x_i|x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1})}$ So this is Gibbs sampling 101, only using uniform draws. Hence a Metropolis-Hastings move with probability one of accepting. If the support satisfies the connectivity property set by Besag (1994) , the chain is irreducible and hence Harris positive recurrent.
