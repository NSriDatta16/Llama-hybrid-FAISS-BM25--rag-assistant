Based on your description I think you will have to: Change current operation from sending email to storing email (probably in database). Add additional operation for retrieving prepared emails for current user Add additional method to confirm sending one or more emails and removing them from storage. The process will be: User will trigger some http request which will result in calling your WCF service for processing (first operation) WCF service will initiate some processing (asynchronously or firt operation will be one-way so that client doesn't have to wait). Processing will save email somehow Depend on duration of processing you can either use AJAX to poll WebApp which will in turn poll WCF service for prepared emails or you will create separate page which will user have to access to see prepared emails. Both methods are using second operation. User will check prepared email(s) and trigger http request which will result in calling third operation to send those emails.
