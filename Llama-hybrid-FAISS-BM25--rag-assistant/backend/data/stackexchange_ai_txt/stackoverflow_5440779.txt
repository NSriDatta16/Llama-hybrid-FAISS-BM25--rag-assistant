It all depends on your application. Minifying, for example, might be great for an application that is very external .js dependent. There is no reason NOT to do this - there is no overhead required and it potentially saves quite a few bytes. Compression is great for certain content types - terrible for others and involves a slight overhead while transporting pages. CDNs are up to your affordability, content type and how dynamic the content is. You obviously don't need Akamai backing up the average Drupal site. etc, etc, etc
