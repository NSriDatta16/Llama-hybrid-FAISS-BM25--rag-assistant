External cluster evaluation for a varying number of cluster

There are many external clustering indices like (Adjusted) mutual information, (Adjusted) Rand index, and many more. However, they are not very good at comparing clusterings where the number of clusters is not the same. For example, if I take one cluster and split it into two new ones, a comparison would yield a low score. To evaluate the clustering in my case, this operation should not affect the score a lot. Also according to [1], none of the compared cluster evaluation indices utilize optimal pairing, only greedy methods, to find the cluster matches (solve the linear assignment problem). So my question is: Are there any methods to calculate a matching score between two clusterings where the number of clusters differ and clusters are not only paired but also optimally matched in a 1:n (or even n:m) way? The computation complexity doesn't matter to me very much. Using an example with NMI: >>> normalized_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3], average_method='arithmetic') 0.8571428571428573 >>> normalized_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3], average_method='arithmetic') 0.8204614780379502 >>> normalized_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3], average_method='arithmetic') 0.7896900821428475 The scores get progressively worse for an increasingly larger split cluster.
