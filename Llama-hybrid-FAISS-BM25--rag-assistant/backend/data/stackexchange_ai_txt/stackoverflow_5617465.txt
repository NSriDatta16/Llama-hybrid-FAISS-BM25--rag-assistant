I think you just need to add a couple more conditions to exclude them. RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/clients/ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/somefolder/ And have these in front of your Rewrite rule in the subfolder section. That will stop it embedding /website/ into the URI if it already contains /clients/ or /somefolder/
