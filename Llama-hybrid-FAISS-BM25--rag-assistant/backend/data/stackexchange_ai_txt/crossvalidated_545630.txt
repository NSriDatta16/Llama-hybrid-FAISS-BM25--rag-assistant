The extreme amount of ties makes me skeptical of any of this, even if you go one-by-one through the marginal distributions. I would use something designed for binary tests. If you want to go one-by-one through the marginals, there are many good tests of proportions; my favorite right now is the G-test, but you might have one you prefer (e.g., chi-squared test). Something nice about the G-test is that it gives somewhat obvious generalizations. What the G-test does is compare nested logistic regression models, one of which has the group variable and the other of which just has an intercept, much as ANOVA compares nested linear models where one model has the group variable and the other just has an intercept. The G-test then does a likelihood ratio test of the nested models. You can go likelihood ratio tests of lots of different kinds of nested models. The likelihood ratio test that I have in mind involves nested multivariate probit regressions. The simple model just has an intercept term, while the more complex model has an intercept term in addition to the group variable (same as the G-test or ANOVA). You then do a likelihood ratio test of the nested models.
