Create the view with two different layouts. Assume that you have 2 xml layouts named gridLayout.xml and listLayout.xml and that somehow mode is determined earlier in your code and set to one of two constants GRIDVIEW or LISTVIEW. Than you can use a code fragment like: private Context m_Context = activity.getBaseContext(); private ViewHolder m_Inflater = LayoutInflater.from(m_Context); ... if (mode == GRIDTYPE) viewDisplay = m_Inflater.inflate(R.layout.gridLayout, null); } else { viewDisplay = m_Inflater.inflate(R.layout.listLayout, null);
