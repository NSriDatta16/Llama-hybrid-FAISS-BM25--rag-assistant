Relative includes paths with .. in it look a bit ugly and expect a certain filesystem structure, that is, "../../common/log.hpp" is two folders up. It makes sense to avoid unnecessary dependencies in general and on filesystem structure in particular, so that moving a header file from one directory to another does not force you to update all source files that include that header. It is also elegant to have your includes correspond to namespaces and classes. If, for example, you have: namespace foo { namespace bar { struct Baz; } } It is convenient and intuitive to include it like: #include "foo/bar/Baz.h"
