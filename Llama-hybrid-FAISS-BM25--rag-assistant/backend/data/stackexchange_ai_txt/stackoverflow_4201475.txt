Elegant data model for UITableViewDataSource

I have a model that essentially stores contact info: phone, twitter, address, etc. I need to show that data in a UITableView, so I need essentially 3 pieces of information: a label ("Phone"), the actual data ("(123) 456-789") and a URL to handle that data with the right application ("tel://whatever"). I was thinking of using 3 arrays, one for each piece of info, and going through each attribute, see if it's given (could be optional), and if so, add stuff to the 3 arrays for that attribute. Then, in the data source for the table view, each row can reference an index in the 3 arrays to populate the cell. The order is important so I can show address before phone, etc. Can anyone come up with a more elegant way to design the model so that I may not need 3 arrays, or lots of: if(self.phone != nil) { [labels addObject:@"foo"]; [descs addObject:self.phone]; [urls addObject:@"baz"]; } There will only be one "Contact" that can have a varying number of attributes, depending on some outside condition. So each attribute is optional. The table view will show the attributes of that one contact, in a certain order. Thanks!
