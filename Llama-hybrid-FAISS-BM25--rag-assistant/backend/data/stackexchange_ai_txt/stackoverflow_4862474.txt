IE errors on file download through .ashx file with caching turned off

I have a simple 'file download' generic handler which sets the response contenttype and headers before sending the file through the same response. I also have Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.server) set in the global.asax. As I have noticed from various sources, Internet Explorer doesn't like this no-cache setting and gives an error when trying to download the file (requested site unavailable or cannot be found). I thought maybe I could override this setting in the .ashx page, so I alter the response's cacheability setting to public. This did not solve the issue... removing the line from global.asax does solve the problem but obviously affects the whole site. Is there a way of setting the cachability just for my generic handler? Cheers :D
