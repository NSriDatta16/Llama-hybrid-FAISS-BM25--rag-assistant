You can use the pi weights to help you interpret/decipher/explain the model. The pi weights are obtained by dividing the ma polynomial by the ar polynomial . Presented in this way (i.e. as a pure ar) the model's parameters are simply a weighted average of the past . Bye the way your model is in my experience way and I mean "way" over-parameterized as a result of a poor model i.e. a list-based selection strategy rather than an iterative self-checking multi-stage approach. Unusual values need to be dealt with by incorporating pulse indicators and not torturing ar and ma coefficients to explain the anomalies. Often-time you can also have a non-constant error variance which can be dealt with GLS or a suitable power transformation. Finally there maybe break-points in time where model parameters change. Trying to form one set of coefficients to heterogeneous data is ill-advised.
