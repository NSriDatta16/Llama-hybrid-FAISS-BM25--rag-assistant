Should sampling for logistic regression reflect the real ratio of 1's and 0's?

Suppose I want to create logistic regression model which can estimate a probability of occurrence of some animal species living on trees based on characteristics of trees (f.e. height). As always, my time and money are limited, therefore I am able to collect only a limited sample size. I have following questions: Should the ratio of 1's and 0's in my sample reflect the true ratio of 1's and 0's? (at least approximately) I noticed that it is a common practice to perform logistic regression model with balanced sample (equal number of 1's and 0's) - but such models give surrealistically high probability of occurrence - right? Are there any articles/textbook which I can use to **support the notion, that the models which do not reflect the true ratio of 1's and 0's are " wrong "?** And finally: Is it possible to perform 1:1 sampling and subsequently correct the model with tau according to Imai et al. 2007? Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Olivia Lau. 2007. “relogit: Rare Events Logistic Regression for Dichotomous Dependent Variables,” in Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Olivia Lau, “Zelig: Everyone’s Statistical Software,” http: //gking.harvard.edu/zelig. Dots represent trees (red = occupied, grey = unoccupied). I am able to identify all occupied trees with 100% accuracy (1's) but I can not measure all trees in forest. The model is different for each sampling strategy (ratio).
