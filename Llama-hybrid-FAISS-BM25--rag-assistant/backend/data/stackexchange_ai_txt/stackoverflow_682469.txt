In the first case, the std::vector is being put directly into your class (and it is handling any memory allocation and deallocation it needs to grow and shrink the vector and free the memory when your object is destroyed; it is abstracting the memory management from you so that you don't have to deal with it). In the second case, you are explicitly allocating the storage for the std::vector in the heap somewhere, and forgetting to ever delete it, so your program will leak memory.
