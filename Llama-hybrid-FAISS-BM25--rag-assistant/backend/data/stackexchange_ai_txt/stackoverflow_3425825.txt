Database for record storage with revisioning

I've recently been tasked with improving a records database that consists of the following: All records are stored in one giant XML file. Any changes or updates to these records are done by hand within this XML file. Each record contains an 'Updated' datetime stamp to keep some form of revision control. The entire XML file is also checked into a subversion repository to keep revision control for the entire collection. This records database is strictly for internal use only and does not face any public interface. I'm a bit of a newbie to database design, but the above method feels a little cumbersome. I was thinking of moving all of the above to some form of perhaps a SQLite database and building some form of a front end to update/remove/view entries while keeping track of any changes to that DB. Are there better ways to do this or is it pretty standard to have a system like is already in place?
