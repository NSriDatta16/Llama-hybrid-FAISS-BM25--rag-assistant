Storing the counts in a DB table sounds perfectly appropriate here. The other options which come to mind are to use a file, which would not be very reliable ACID wise, or memory, using something like memcache, which would not survive a system reboot. Don't worry about using a DB table. It will hardly take up any storage space or incur any significant overhead unless they are being written to very frequently. If that's the case, please add more info and we may be able to propose other solutions.
