You have a few choices: Get rid of the line breaks, and format the SQL onto a single line. This works well for a simple SQL query, but can get cumbersome if the SQL is large and complex. Programmatically remove the breaks using string.Replace("\n"," ") . This can work well, but can be fragile - especially if you rewrite a single-line statement into a multi-line statement later. Don't put the string directly in your code, but read it from a resource or file. This can allow you to better organize your SQL queries, but you may still need to remove undesired breaks (using replace as above). Use a stored-procedure to avoid embedding the SQL directly in your code to begin with. It's a best practice, but it can require more significant changes to your code, and may not always be possible (for example, department policies may prohibit it).
