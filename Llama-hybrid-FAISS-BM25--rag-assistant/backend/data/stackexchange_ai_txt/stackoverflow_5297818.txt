I see two approaches: Pull data, index it (Lucene?) and search in your "copy" using your custom index. I would avoid this if possible, as the moving large amount of data is usually bad idea. Move some agents as close to the data sources as possible, run queries locally (close to SAP, DB, etc.) and transfer only the portion of a result that you really need. Consider looking at integration frameworks as Apache Camel or Spring Integration.
