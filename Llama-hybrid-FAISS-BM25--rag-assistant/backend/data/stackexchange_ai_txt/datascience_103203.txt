How to write a reward function that optimizes for profit and revenue?

So I want to write a reward function for a reinforcement learning model which picks products to display to a customer. Each product has a profit margin %. Higher price products will have a higher profit margin but lower probability of being purchased. Lower price products have a lower profit margin, but higher probability of being purchased. The goal is to maintain an AVERAGE margin of 5% for ALL products sold, while maximizing the total revenue. What's the best way to write this reward function?
