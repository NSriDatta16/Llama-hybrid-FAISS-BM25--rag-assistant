A 10k-by-10k array of doubles uses 1e8*8 bytes, which corresponds to 800MB. MATLAB needs these 800MB to be contiguous. Most likely, your 1GB free memory is a little fragmented, so MATLAB cannot fit the new array into RAM. Use the command MEMORY to find out the maximum variable size that MATLAB can handle at a given moment.
