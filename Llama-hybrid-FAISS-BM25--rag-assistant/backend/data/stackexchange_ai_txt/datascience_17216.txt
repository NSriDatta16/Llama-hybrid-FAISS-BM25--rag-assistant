PCA before K-mean clustering

If I applied PCA on feature vectors and then I do clustering, such like following: reduced_data = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(data) kmeans = KMeans(init='k-means++', n_clusters=n_digits, n_init=10) kmeans.fit(reduced_data) The reduced data will be the in terms of PCA components, so after clustering in kmean, you can get a label for each point (reduced_data), how to know which one from the origin data? how to play with a number of PCA components regarding the number of clusters? Thanks.
