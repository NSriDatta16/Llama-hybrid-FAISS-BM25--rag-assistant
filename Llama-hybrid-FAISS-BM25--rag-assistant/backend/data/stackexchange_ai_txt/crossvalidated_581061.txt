My solution was to use a graph to represent relationships between objects in the scene. Objects are all nodes, and two nodes are connected if they belong in the same cluster. In terms of a matrix, this is an NxN matrix with 1s where two objects are connected and 0s otherwise. The matrix is then symmetric and all diagonals are ones. I used a graph neural network, and the edges of the graph were regressed to the ground truth connectivity matrix via binary cross entropy loss. It worked very well.
