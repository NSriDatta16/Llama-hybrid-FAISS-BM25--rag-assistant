Which search range for determining SVM optimal C and gamma parameters?

I am using SVM for classification and I am trying to determine the optimal parameters for linear and RBF kernels. For the linear kernel I use cross-validated parameter selection to determine C and for the RBF kernel I use grid search to determine C and gamma. I have 20 (numeric) features and 70 training examples that should be classified into 7 classes. Which search range should I use for determining the optimal values for the C and gamma parameters?
