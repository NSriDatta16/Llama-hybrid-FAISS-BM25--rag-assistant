I think you're mixing things. JNLP is just a way of deploying your application, while JavaFX is a presentation layer. In fact you can deploy your JavaFX code in a JNLP package. You should compare JavaFX with Swing ;) With JNLP you can distribute Swing or AWT or SWT or JavaFX java applications. Having the posibility to execute then in a sandbox.
