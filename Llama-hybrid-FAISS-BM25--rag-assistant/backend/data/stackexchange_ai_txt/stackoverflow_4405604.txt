curl has some pretty awesome command-line options ( documentation ), for example, --limit-rate will limit the amount of bandwidth that curl uses, which might completely solve your problem. For example, replace the curl line with: curl --limit-rate 200K "$mp3" > ~/Desktop/URLs/$n.mp3 would limit the transfers to an average of 200K per second, which would download a typical 5MB MP3 file in 25 seconds, and you could experiment with different values until you found the maximum speed that worked. You could also try a combination of --retry and --retry-delay so that when and if a download fails, curl waits and then tries again after a certain amount of time. For example, replace the curl line with: curl --retry 30 "$mp3" > ~/Desktop/URLs/$n.mp3 This will transfer the file. If the transfer fails, it will wait a second and try again. If it fails again, it will wait two seconds. If it fails again, it will wait four seconds, and so on, doubling the waiting time until it succeeds. The "30" means it will retry up to 30 times, and it will never wait more than 10 minutes. You can learn this all at the documentation link I gave you.
