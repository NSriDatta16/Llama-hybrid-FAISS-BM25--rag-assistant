Yes, there are more C# books, and the C# community is more active, but at the same time both languages use the same framework, and have mostly the same features, which means a VB.NET programmer can pick up a C# book and understand it with no problem if he knows the C# syntax (which is close to many other languages' syntax). At the end of the day there is no BIG advantage of choosing one language over the other. Because of the reasons you mentioned, I'd choose C# if your team had no preference, but if most came from a VB6 background, I'd see no problem choosing the VB language. That's what happened in my organization. Most of our software was written in VB6 before so they decided to go with the syntax that the team was already familiar with, and I don't have a problem with that.
