How should I store textual data that won't change very often?

As an exercise in web design and development, I am building my website from the ground up, using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and no frameworks. So far, I've been following a model-view-controller design. However, there is one hurdle that I am quickly approaching that I'm not sure how I'm going to solve, but I'm sure it's been addressed before with varying degrees of success. On my website, I'm going to have a resume and an "about me" bio section. These probably won't be changing very often. For my resume, I think that XML that can be rendered into HTML (or any other format) is the best option, and in that case, I could even build a "resume manager" using PHP that can edit the underlying XML. A resume also seems like it could be built on top of MySQL, as well, and generated into XML or HTML or whatever output format I choose. However, I'm not sure how to store my about me/bio. My initial idea was a plain text document that can be read it, parsed, and the line breaks converted to paragraphs. However, I'm not sold on that being the best idea. My other idea was using MySQL, but I think that might be overkill for a single page. What I do know, however What techniques have you used when storing text for a page that will not change very often? How did they work out for you - what problems or successes did you have?
