I want to point out a potential issue with implementing a Neural Network in FPGA. FPGAs have limited amount of routing resources. Unlike logic resources (flops, look-up tables, memories), routing resources are difficult to quantify. Maybe a simple Neural Network will work, but a "massively parallel" one with mesh interconnects might not. I'd suggest starting with a simple core from OpenCores.org just to get familiar with FPGA flow, and then move on to prototyping a Neural Network. Downloading free Xilinx WebPack, which includes ISIM simulator, is a good start. Later on you can purchase a cheap dev. board with a small FPGA (e.g. Xilinx Spartan 3) to run your designs on.
