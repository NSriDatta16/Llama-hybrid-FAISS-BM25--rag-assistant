You can use ranking metrics. Examples: Precision@K - rank your prediction and calculate out of the top k what was the ratio of true positive. Average precision - averaging the precision@K for different Ks. DCG & NDCG - rank your data and the give high score for the relevant items and sum them. $\sum_{i=0}{N} \frac {rel_i} {log_2(i)}$ - relevance in your case is a positive example. You can see that the denominator is higher for bigger i, meaning higher gain for the first ranking. NDCG is just a normalized version of it.
