Lawyers are the most important people to talk to in this case. But I'd still say don't store it. If necessary, I'd suggest storing the contract in a format from which you CANNOT extract the original GIF. Such as taking a png file for the whole document, or some other solution. However, if you are storing the whole document with the signature embedded (and not extractable) then you have your ability to resend the signature, and you have no reason to store the unattached GIFs. Ultimately, having the unattached GIFs is just providing an enormous opening to getting sued. Storing them that way also opens you up to problems relating to 'pasting the wrong GIF' into a contract. I would say that having the gif files in a way that does not EXPLICITLY bind them to the ONE contract they apply to is VERY dangerous. EDIT After reading your post again I would say that there isn't a point in storing the GIFs or the PDFs. You should have a hard copy somewhere of the signed document (and if you are losing hard copies of contracts, then there are SERIOUS organizational issues) and after that, you don't need the signed version anymore, you just need to know the terms of the contract. So as long as you can reconstruct the terms for reading over, then I don't see why you'd need the literal signature again. If you need to prove they signed it, go back to the hard copy.
