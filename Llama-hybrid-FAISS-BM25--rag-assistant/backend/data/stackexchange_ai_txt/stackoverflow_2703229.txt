'Attempt to call private method' error when trying to change change case of db entires in migration file

class AddTitleToPosts post.name.upcase) end end def self.down end end Like you can nothing particularly complicated, just trying to add new column title by changing case of name column already in db. But I get attempt to call private method error. I'm guessing it has something to do with 'self'? Thanks for your help.
