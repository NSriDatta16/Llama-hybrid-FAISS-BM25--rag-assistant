Active Directory and SSO - anyone with experience on this?

We want to implement SSO functionality in our organization, but we're not really sure what our options are, and what the benefits / disadvantages for the different solutions might be. -We have multiple old ASP(Active Server Pages) sites which should use SSO -We have multiple ASP.net web-Applications which should use SSO -We want Sharepoint to use the SSO -CRM (Biztalk?) integration (Additional information about the user, such as Address, company, etc ) Since we're primarly .net, c#, Microsoft oriented, my first idea was to use Active Directory. I've also noticed that there is something called ADAM (Active Directory Application Mode), and ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services), but I can't really say I understand when/where these should be used. Here is a brief overview of the different web-applications -"My Personal Page" : User log's into an application where they can modify their personal information along with their company-information and their employees. (Asp.Net) -E-learning application (ASP) -CMS system for web-publishing (ASP.Net) -Sharepoint sites I haven't really been able to find any articles that can tell me "AD is a great choice! , you can use it everywhere", so If anyone has got any experience /feedback to give me on this, it would be really helpful. Also: How should rights/roles be managed ? Should all access/rights/roles for each application be stored in AD, or should this be stored in the applications themselves. IE : AD stores the roles: "Cms" "Cms.Article.AddAllowed" "Cms.Article.DeleteAllowed" Or should this information be split up, so that AD holds information about which applications the user is allowed to log into, while the application itself holds information about what the user is allowed to do within the application when logged in AD rights: "Cms" Cms rights: "Article.AddAllowed" "Article.DeleteAllowed" So, when the user logs in, they are first authenticated against AD, and if that goes ok, the rights for the Cms application is fetched from a rights-table in the cms system ? What are my options ? What other solutions other than AD do I have ? Thank you for any feedback, its much appreciated !
