I didn't have any success with refreshing the data bindings on the datagrid via the executeBindings and invalidateDisplayList methods. I also didn't have any luck by showing the confirmation alert before making the webservice call. In fact, I discovered that making the webservice call was completely unnecessary and removed it. So now the code flows like this: Drag/drop ADG row onto trash icon. Display confirmation Alert box. If user clicked "Cancel" button, redisplay the ADG. But the same problem persists. I'll update the Code section with the latest code.
