Had the same problem. Seems like there is something wrong with the set up instructions or the initial tables that are being created. This is how I got mysqld running on my machine. If the mysqld server is already running on your Mac, stop it first with: launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist Start the mysqld server with the following command which lets anyone log in with full permissions. mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables Then run mysql -u root which should now let you log in successfully without a password. The following command should reset all the root passwords. UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('NewPassword') WHERE User='root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Now if you kill the running copy of mysqld_safe and start it up again without the skip-grant-tables option, you should be able to log in with mysql -u root -p and the new password you just set.
