I know this was asked over a year ago, and ttnphns gave an excellent and in-depth answer, but I thought I'd add a couple of comments for those (like me) that are interested in PCA and LDA for their usefulness in ecological sciences, but have limited statistical background (not statisticians). PCs in PCA are linear combinations of original variables that sequentially maximally explain total variance in the multidimensional dataset. You will have as many PCs as you do original variables. The percent of the variance the PCs explain is given by the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix used, and the coefficient for each original variable on each new PC is given by the eigenvectors. PCA has no assumptions about groups. PCA is very good for seeing how multiple variables change in value across your data (in a biplot, for example). Interpreting a PCA relies heavily on the biplot. LDA is different for a very important reason - it creates new variables (LDs) by maximizing variance between groups. These are still linear combinations of original variables, but rather than explain as much variance as possible with each sequential LD, instead they are drawn to maximize the DIFFERENCE between groups along that new variable. Rather than a similarity matrix, LDA (and MANOVA) use a comparison matrix of between and within groups sum of squares and cross-products. The eigenvectors of this matrix - the coefficients that the OP was originally concerned with - describe how much the original variables contribute to the formation of the new LDs. For these reasons, the eigenvectors from the PCA will give you a better idea how a variable changes in value across your data cloud, and how important it is to total variance in your dataset, than the LDA. However, the LDA, particularly in combination with a MANOVA, will give you a statistical test of difference in multivariate centroids of your groups, and an estimate of error in allocation of points to their respective groups (in a sense, multivariate effect size). In an LDA, even if a variable changes linearly (and significantly) across groups, its coefficient on an LD may not indicate the "scale" of that effect, and depends entirely on the other variables included in the analysis. I hope that was clear. Thanks for your time. See a picture below...
