Level of detail of your unit tests

I wanted to start a discussion about the details that you cover in your unit tests. Do you test major functionalities, that consist of several methods doing one task at once with one test? or maybe you even test automatic properties? Because, for example, I see little value in writing a test that would test only this: public Email { set { if(Regex.Match(/*....*/)) email = value; } get { return email; } } As it's really clear and it's just a waste of time. Usually when I do unit tests I test a whole task - like on this example - a whole registration procedure. I'm asking this because, currently I'm reading the book "Applying Domain Driven Design and Patterns" authored by Jimmy Nilsson and there he points out that he's testing even such small details with a dedicated test. Isn't such level of coverage an overuse?
