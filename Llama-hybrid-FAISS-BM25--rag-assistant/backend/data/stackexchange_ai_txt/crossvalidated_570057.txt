Confidence interval for multiple samples of ratios of counts (in R)

Data and objective I have count data from two groups, A and B, from across multiple samples. I want to estimate the average ratio of A to B across all samples, along with a confidence interval. Issues I'm not sure which formula to use. I'm using the normal approximation, but the confidence interval overlaps zero, but that can't be right because a negative ratio is unrealistic. $$ CI = \bar{x} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$ From that, I have: mean = 0.175, lower = -0.0884 , upper = 0.438 Question How can I bound the confidence interval to non-negative values? Further details A glimpse of the data: sample countB countA A_to_B ... 42 42 1 1 1.0 43 43 2 0 0.0 44 44 2 0 0.0 45 45 2 0 0.0 46 46 2 0 0.0 47 47 2 0 0.0 48 48 2 0 0.0 49 49 2 0 0.0 50 50 2 0 0.0 51 51 1 0 0.0 52 52 2 1 0.5 53 53 2 1 0.5 ...
