Where can I find datasets with large number of features (100000) but less samples(100-1000)?

I am working on a dimensionality reduction algorithm for datasets with high feature to sample ratio. I need datasets with around 100000 features or more and 100-1000 samples with class labels to evaluate my algorithm's performance. Moreover the features should be real valued and not binary like in the Dorothea dataset.
