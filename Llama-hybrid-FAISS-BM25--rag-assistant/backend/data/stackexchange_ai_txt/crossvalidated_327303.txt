Why doesn't my ARIMA forecast include the trend?

Why doesn't my forecast include the upwards drift? (I can get it to work for AirPassengers, but not for my simulated data. See graphs below.) # simulate time series with drift set.seed(1234) x My assignment is to use only the in-built packages. I'm sure the forecast package can do this for me but alas ... (Also, I reckon I should predict a multiplicative trend to AirPassengers. How could I do that in base R please?)
