Sorting by weighted rating in SQL?

I have a table of events, and another of ratings. Each event can have many ratings. I need to be able to to pull the top three events from the database by rating, but of course, the ratings need to be averaged, so an event with one five star rating is not rated more highly than one with 4 average and 100 ratings. Can anyone guide me as to how to create this in SQL? Thanks UPDATE Thanks guys I suppose I should have been clearer with how things should be weighted (although I think I need to think more on how exactly I want this to work). SQL provided is a great help though
