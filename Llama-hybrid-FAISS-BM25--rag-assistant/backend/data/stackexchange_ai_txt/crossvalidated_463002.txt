How to test right-skewed distribution hypothesis?

Statistics is new to me. My dataset has 7000 incidents that were processed within x number of days. I took a sample of 400 from the population: ID closedindays" "1" 2 "2" 27 "3" 64 "4" 2 "5" 16 "6" 5 "7" 4 "8" 7 "9" 4 "10" 1 "11" 35 "12" 1 "13" 2 "14" 1 "15" 33 "16" 22 "17" 6 "18" 6 "19" 27 "20" 1 "21" 0 "22" 2 "23" 0 "24" 16 "25" 1 "26" 10 "27" 1 "28" 2 "29" 16 "30" 0 "31" 4 "32" 9 "33" 0 "34" 16 "35" 66 "36" 1 "37" 0 "38" 11 "39" 9 "40" 25 "41" 5 "42" 7 "43" 70 "44" 0 "45" 7 "46" 67 "47" 10 "48" 74 "49" 0 "50" 1 "51" 7 "52" 17 "53" 14 "54" 6 "55" 6 "56" 11 "57" 2 "58" 14 "59" 4 "60" 14 "61" 2 "62" 97 "63" 0 "64" 17 "65" 3 "66" 4 "67" 3 "68" 2 "69" 0 "70" 6 "71" 7 "72" 3 "73" 8 "74" 58 "75" 13 "76" 53 "77" 3 "78" 0 "79" 1 "80" 9 "81" 1 "82" 1 "83" 0 "84" 45 "85" 1 "86" 14 "87" 4 "88" 4 "89" 6 "90" 1 "91" 0 "92" 0 "93" 3 "94" 1 "95" 0 "96" 7 "97" 1 "98" 4 "99" 5 "100" 4 "101" 13 "102" 1 "103" 66 "104" 0 "105" 3 "106" 0 "107" 50 "108" 13 "109" 36 "110" 2 "111" 3 "112" 0 "113" 50 "114" 35 "115" 57 "116" 0 "117" 4 "118" 1 "119" 1 "120" 3 "121" 0 "122" 4 "123" 20 "124" 16 "125" 53 "126" 4 "127" 9 "128" 4 "129" 50 "130" 51 "131" 0 "132" 6 "133" 3 "134" 58 "135" 3 "136" 1 "137" 1 "138" 4 "139" 66 "140" 0 "141" 4 "142" 1 "143" 1 "144" 16 "145" 11 "146" 1 "147" 9 "148" 12 "149" 0 "150" 1 "151" 7 "152" 1 "153" 17 "154" 2 "155" 1 "156" 12 "157" 0 "158" 5 "159" 6 "160" 13 "161" 9 "162" 5 "163" 12 "164" 2 "165" 0 "166" 1 "167" 0 "168" 1 "169" 3 "170" 1 "171" 1 "172" 0 "173" 16 "174" 9 "175" 16 "176" 1 "177" 3 "178" 1 "179" 2 "180" 4 "181" 5 "182" 55 "183" 14 "184" 49 "185" 2 "186" 63 "187" 0 "188" 5 "189" 3 "190" 51 "191" 50 "192" 11 "193" 1 "194" 17 "195" 65 "196" 26 "197" 26 "198" 1 "199" 6 "200" 0 "201" 3 "202" 8 "203" 2 "204" 18 "205" 0 "206" 2 "207" 1 "208" 0 "209" 0 "210" 1 "211" 53 "212" 10 "213" 2 "214" 11 "215" 0 "216" 8 "217" 2 "218" 0 "219" 11 "220" 1 "221" 1 "222" 5 "223" 0 "224" 6 "225" 3 "226" 1 "227" 17 "228" 2 "229" 1 "230" 36 "231" 50 "232" 1 "233" 2 "234" 1 "235" 31 "236" 3 "237" 31 "238" 1 "239" 0 "240" 70 "241" 13 "242" 1 "243" 6 "244" 0 "245" 8 "246" 0 "247" 0 "248" 5 "249" 5 "250" 66 "251" 1 "252" 12 "253" 5 "254" 17 "255" 1 "256" 0 "257" 9 "258" 2 "259" 5 "260" 1 "261" 1 "262" 0 "263" 5 "264" 15 "265" 0 "266" 0 "267" 3 "268" 13 "269" 0 "270" 1 "271" 1 "272" 48 "273" 46 "274" 1 "275" 1 "276" 11 "277" 59 "278" 0 "279" 0 "280" 50 "281" 6 "282" 1 "283" 0 "284" 1 "285" 3 "286" 0 "287" 34 "288" 50 "289" 70 "290" 116 "291" 15 "292" 31 "293" 153 "294" 3 "295" 1 "296" 7 "297" 6 "298" 9 "299" 6 "300" 4 "301" 13 "302" 8 "303" 1 "304" 4 "305" 7 "306" 11 "307" 14 "308" 8 "309" 1 "310" 12 "311" 7 "312" 0 "313" 1 "314" 66 "315" 52 "316" 21 "317" 1 "318" 2 "319" 5 "320" 26 "321" 1 "322" 2 "323" 30 "324" 18 "325" 9 "326" 26 "327" 10 "328" 24 "329" 0 "330" 0 "331" 1 "332" 1 "333" 0 "334" 0 "335" 1 "336" 7 "337" 2 "338" 20 "339" 5 "340" 6 "341" 1 "342" 13 "343" 23 "344" 5 "345" 69 "346" 1 "347" 8 "348" 1 "349" 3 "350" 1 "351" 35 "352" 1 "353" 10 "354" 17 "355" 64 "356" 6 "357" 7 "358" 41 "359" 0 "360" 26 "361" 1 "362" 9 "363" 35 "364" 1 "365" 5 "366" 7 "367" 65 "368" 4 "369" 2 "370" 0 "371" 62 "372" 5 "373" 7 "374" 1 "375" 4 "376" 3 "377" 0 "378" 70 "379" 25 "380" 5 "381" 1 "382" 5 "383" 10 "384" 2 "385" 51 "386" 0 "387" 1 "388" 4 "389" 72 "390" 73 "391" 8 "392" 3 "393" 2 "394" 70 "395" 10 "396" 3 "397" 2 "398" 2 "399" 26 "400" 56 The population and sample seems to have a right-skewed distribution. What is my hypothesis? My hypothesis is that tickets are processed within 14 days on average. I made the following hypothesis: H0: H1: > 14 What is the problem? The problem is that my data is not normally distributed. Because of this I don't think i can do the one tailed Student's t-test. The Wilcoxon signed rank test seems to be a option. But this one checks on the median. How can i test my hypothesis on the mean?
