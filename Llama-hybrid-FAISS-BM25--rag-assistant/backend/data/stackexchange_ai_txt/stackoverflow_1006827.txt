I believe you can change the source code's encoding from Eclipse (or from any decent editor). Set it to UTF-8. Then everything should behave smoothly, because Java Strings are Unicode. I would strongly encourage using proper encoding in the source, instead of this \uXXX notation. The reason being, how on earth do you infer form the code what for instance \u00A3 means? It's much clearer to just put the correct character there.
