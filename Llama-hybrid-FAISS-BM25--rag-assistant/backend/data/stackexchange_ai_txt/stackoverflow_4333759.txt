Apart from general usability issues (will people know it's slidable? I could see how this can be annoying if you use that menu often and have to slide it a lot), dragging doesn't work on most touch interfaces. You could try adding left and right buttons that scroll the menu when they click them maybe? Also your demo doesn't work in Chrome on my desktop. Is the menu supposed to slide? It won't.
