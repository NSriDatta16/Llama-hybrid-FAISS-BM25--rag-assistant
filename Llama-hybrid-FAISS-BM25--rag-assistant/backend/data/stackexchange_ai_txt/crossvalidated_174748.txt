MaxEnt Model Equivalance and Disjunction

I want to use a maxent model for quite a simple problem but it doesn't behave as I expect. I'm clearly not understanding. I have two sets of labels $L = \{A,B\}$ and $L' = \{A',B'\}$ and some relationship that holds between them $\Theta = \{Equals, Disjoint\}$. I have data of the form $ $ where $l \in L, l' \in L'$ and $\theta \in \Theta$. I want to know for a new pair from $L$ and $L'$ whether they belong to $Equals$ or $Disjoint$. Given only the evidence that $ , $ and $ $. I look at the class probability and it is the following: A A' Equals[0.9656] Disjoint[0.0344] A B' Equals[0.0294] Disjoint[0.9706] B A' Equals[0.0294] Disjoint[0.9706] B B' Equals[0.0000] Disjoint[1.0000] According to the OpenNLP maxent model that uses generalised iterative scaling. The first three lines are as expected but the final line should just be uncertain i.e Equals[0.5] Disjoint[0.5] as there is no information about how B and B' relate to each other. Instead it seems to have associated B with class Disjoint from evidence $ $ and attributed it to the unseen B, B' data. What am I doing wrong? Is there another modelling technique that I should use instead?
