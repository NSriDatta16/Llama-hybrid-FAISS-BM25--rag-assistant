I've seen this example from the folks from Nokia: http://www.hotchips.org/archives/hc21/1_sun/HC21.23.2.OpenCLTutorial-Epub/HC21.23.270.Pulli-OpenCL-in-Handheld-Devices.pdf So I ask myself, is there any SDK from any mobile platform/os out there that I could use to test some of my desktop apps to an embedded app? I'd really, really appreciate to be able to program opencl on mobile/tablets systems. Vertex/fragment shader are not much of help because their specs for embedded systems do not include all the extensions we would need to rewrite our opencl code to shader.
