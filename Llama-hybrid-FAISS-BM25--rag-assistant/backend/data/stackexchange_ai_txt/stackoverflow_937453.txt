Sadly, the there really isn't a set of do's / don'ts. I'm not aware of any kind of CUA-like guidance for web applications for a given look/feel and user experience. for aesthetics : ASP.NET MVC Design Gallery - for MVC ASP.NET Design Templates - for webforms 25 Magento site designs I would also look at reading Smashing Magazine on a regular basis (I am sure there are others) it has pointers on layouts, design templates, galleries, typography and things like optimizing different kinds of work flows in sites (e.g. shopping carts, non-profit sites etc). It was amazing how on my last project just starting with one of the the asp.net templates made my app look better out of the box and that minimized the resistance of end users on their initial go around with the app. YMMV of course.
