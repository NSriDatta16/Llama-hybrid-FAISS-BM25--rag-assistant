To do this you would need to create your own type, implement IList , IBindingList (and ideally IBindingListView ), and optionally ICancelAddNew and IRaiseItemChangedEvents . You'd also need either a public non-object indexer ( public T this[int index] {get;} ) or ITypedList . From having done things similar to this, I strongly advise you; don't, unless this is really important. It would be more pragmatic to copy the references into a new BindingList<> . Also; with new items; which list would it go into?
