It seems like TeamCity is simply leveraging Gallio to run VS tests. Gallio appears to have msbuild integration and sounds perfect but after a closer look it seems that it would require a VS install just like MSTest as it appears to depend on MS exes: The plugin enable condition was not satisfied: '${process:DEVENV.EXE} or ${process:VSTESTHOST.EXE} or ${process:QTAGENT.EXE} or ${process:QTAGENT32.EXE} or ${process:QTDCAGENT.EXE} or ${process:QTDCAGENT32.EXE}'. Host process exited with code: 0 That being said it sounds like at least one person has got it working: Christoph De Baene - Running MSTest without Visual Studio
