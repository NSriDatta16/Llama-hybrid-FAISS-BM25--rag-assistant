This isn't exactly what you're trying to do, but you might want to checkout the opensource JavaScript project called Forge. It provides JavaScript for signing/verifying text, etc. It is currently being used to demonstrate a technology called WebID. WebID requires SSL certificates -- which Forge stores (along with the associated private key) using flash local storage or the new HTML5 WebStorage. The certificates are then used when doing client-side TLS. There is an option in the demo to import a certificate from the browser's keychain, however it involves a manual process at the moment (exporting from the browser as PKCS12 and importing as PEM). This could be potentially improved in the future. In any event, here are the URLs to the WebID demo and the source: https://webid.digitalbazaar.com/manage/ http://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge The demo uses a self-signed certificate so you'll likely see a warning about that. If you want to read up a bit more on the relationship between Forge and WebID: http://digitalbazaar.com/2010/08/07/webid/
