The interpretation doesn't differ that much. The difference is that instead of point estimates, you end up with posterior distribution , so now, unlike in frequentist case, interpretations like "given the assumptions we made and the observed data, with 95% probability, the result lies between X and Y" etc. As a frequentist, I could report that the p-value for the estimate as >0.05 and the 95% confidence intervals include an estimate of 0 (OR 1.0) or no effect. With Bayesian estimate you would know what is the probability that the result is actually greater then zero.
