Qt QImage pixel manipulation problems

I'm currently in the process of writing a steganography application with Qt. I am trying to hide my message bits in the least significant bit of the blue colour of the pixel. From debugging I can tell that this section is working as it should. However after hiding my bits in the message I then save the image and then reopen it. This is where the problem develops. When I read in the (reopened) image the scanLines that I read in are not the same as the ones I wrote previously, and I can't figure out why. Maybe it's just me being stupid, or maybe I'm missing something. Any help would be much appreciated. The code I have so far is as follows void MainWindow::Encrypt(QImage image, QString message) { if(image.isNull()) { qDebug() bvec; QByteArray bytes = message.toAscii(); char mask; QRgb tempPix; for(int i = 0; i bvec; QRgb *pixel; int blue; image = image.convertToFormat(QImage::Format_ARGB32); for(int i = 0; i Thanks
