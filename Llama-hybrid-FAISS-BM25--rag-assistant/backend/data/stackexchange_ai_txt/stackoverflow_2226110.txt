It's better than not documenting the code. If you're going to do it, I would try to expand the role. Attempt to challenge the developers to find bugs, improve the code(dangerous, but its with the lead's guidance), write test cases and all the things that should have been done the first time around. Set some type of incentive for the most problems a junior can find. Encourages the junior to look harder and makes the lead think a bit more before ditching their basic duties while writing code.
