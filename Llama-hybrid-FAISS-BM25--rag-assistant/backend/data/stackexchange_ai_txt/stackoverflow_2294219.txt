You won't be able to do this with the file-input as this would present security issues. Instead, consider performing some client-side validation upon submit. Within the client-side logic, determine whether the submit should be aborted (before a page-refresh occurs) or if it should be permitted to follow through (sending your data and file to the server). As a suggestion, the jQuery Validation plugin is extremely well-constructed a very popular amongst client-side developers. I would encourage you to consider it for if you decide to tackle client-side validation. Important: Client-side validation is not a substitution for server-side validation. It is meant only to supplement validation logic already in place on the server.
