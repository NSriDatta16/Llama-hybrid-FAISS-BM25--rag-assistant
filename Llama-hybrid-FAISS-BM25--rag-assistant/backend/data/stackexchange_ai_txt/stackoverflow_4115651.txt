Why is my WPF-Button not clickable?

I've got a strange thing goin on here. I'm designing a small program with Visual Studio 2010 using WPF and VB.Net but for some reason, all my buttons and checkboxes (didn't test more items) aren't clickable anymore! Even if I drag a pretty new one out of the VS-Toolbox! They've got all "IsFocousable" and "IsHitTestVisible" and "IsEnabled"-Setting set to "True". Does someone has an idea to fix that!? Greetz!
