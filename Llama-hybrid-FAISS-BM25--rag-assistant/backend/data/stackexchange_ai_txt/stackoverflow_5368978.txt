Here is the JSFiddle Demo: UPDATE: The reason it wasn't working is because you have variable marker within the scope of initialize function and thus, moveMarker was not able to access the var marker . So, i went ahead and move the marker to the global scope by declaring it outside of all functions, and that way moveMarker can access and move the location of the marker. By doing so you'll have to drop the var declaration for the marker inside of initialization function. marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position: myLatlng, map: map, draggable: true }); Keep in mind the modified code would only move the marker's position but would not center the map based on the marker. You'll have to call map.setCenter(); to center the map. You need to parse out the numbers seperately and set it to type Number using parseFloat() . google.maps.LatLng() takes two Number parameters for Lat and Lng. A better way of doing this is to create two textfields. One for lat and another for lng, and retrive the value with var lat = parseFloat(document.getElementById('markerLat').value); and var lng = parseFloat(document.getElementById('markerLng').value); You can create and set the marker by doing var newLatLng = new google.maps.LatLng(lat, lng); marker.setPosition(newLatLng);
