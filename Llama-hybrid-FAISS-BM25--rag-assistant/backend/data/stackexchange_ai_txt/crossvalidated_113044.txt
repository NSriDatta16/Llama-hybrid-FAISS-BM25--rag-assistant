I'm not clear on why you are starting a new topic on the subject, nor am I clear on the motivation for pursuing a $\sin$ link. A binary model with a $\sin$ link is no longer a logistic model. And there are no boundary problems with ordinary logistic regression. You seem to find something wrong with infinite parameter estimates in order to achieve probabilities of zero or one but in fact this does not present a problem for the logistic model. If you wanted to fit a variance-stabilizing model you would use the $X\beta = \arcsin(\sqrt p)$ model, yielding $p = \sin^{2}(X\beta)$. This model looks very appealing (information matrix = $X'X$ times a constant) but when you plot the log-likelihood surface you find it is too flat to lead to efficient estimates of $\beta$.
