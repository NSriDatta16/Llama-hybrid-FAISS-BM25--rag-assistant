I don't think you can do that directly with a key-value store, but one way to work around is to store the user in multiple places. For example, you have key-value mapping of a user to a list of blog posts. You also have a mapping of an age to a list of users. Also a gender to a list of users. Now if you want to search by age or gender you pull the corresponding list of users, and then pull all of their blog posts. Part of the reason a key-value store like Voldemort can work is that storage and queries are cheap enough that you can do extra ones. The problem, though, with the above scheme is that if you're using Voldemort in a distributed way you're better off with lots of keys that map to short lists of data (so you can distribute based on key) which something like mapping gender to user would violate (only a few keys with potentially very large lists of data for each).
