Stock price prediction is notoriously difficult, especially when trying to predict price. Maybe an approach you could take is convert your prices into returns (helps with the non-stationary nature of raw prices) and then try and model returns? Getting the price from returns is not difficult (multiply current price by predicted return to get expected price.) Another approach you could take is just more feature engineering, adding further regularisation to the model (dropout, batch-norm) or what has helped me in the past is very small learning rates eg 1e-5.
