c++ check if file is empty

I got a project in C++ which I need to edit. This is a declaration of variable: // Attachment OFSTRUCT ofstruct; HFILE hFile = OpenFile( mmsHandle->hTemporalFileName , &ofstruct , OF_READ ); DWORD hFileSize = GetFileSize( (HANDLE) hFile , NULL ); LPSTR hFileBuffer = (LPSTR)GlobalAlloc(GPTR, sizeof(CHAR) * hFileSize ); DWORD hFileSizeReaded = 0; ReadFile( (HANDLE) hFile , hFileBuffer, hFileSize, &hFileSizeReaded, NULL ); CloseHandle( (HANDLE) hFile ); I need to check if the file is attached (I suppose I need to check if hFile has any value), but don't know how. I tried with hFile == NULL but this doesn't do the job. Thanks, Ile
