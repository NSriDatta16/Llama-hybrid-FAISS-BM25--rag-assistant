I use Mercurial because code.google.com supports it. I also use it because it is written (mostly) in Python and is easily extendable. It is also easily installed on many operating systems. Some people I work with are afraid of the commandline and like having the ability to use a GUI tool, so I point them to TortoiseHg. Both have their pros and cons. Use whichever you are more comfortable with.

I have also began using Subversion at work. I would rather not be using Subversion.
