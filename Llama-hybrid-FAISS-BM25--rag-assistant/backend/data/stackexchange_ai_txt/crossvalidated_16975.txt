I would think this would be something standard...that some method for assessing the association between two continuous-valued time series could be adapted for the categorical case, and that it had already been done. How about just using the $\chi^2$ test statistic and comparing the observed value to values obtained when you shift one of the series relative to the other (cutting it somewhere and rolling the end back to the beginning)?
