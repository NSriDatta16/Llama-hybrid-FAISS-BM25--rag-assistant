A neural network will typically allow for non-linearities and interactions that a linear regression model with just the main effects in the model cannot capture. In case interactions or non-linear effects are important, you cannot rely on the linear regression model to tell you about what may matter in an neural network. Additionally, note that relying on statistical significance to make decisions about what model to use is fraught with issues. It is generally not a good idea, if you wish to achieve good out of sample predictions e.g. in terms of RMSE. In fact, it is a completely terrible approach (unless you somehow take the model selection into account, e.g. by bootstrapping the data repeatedly, selecting a model on each bootstrap sample and then averaging the predictions).
