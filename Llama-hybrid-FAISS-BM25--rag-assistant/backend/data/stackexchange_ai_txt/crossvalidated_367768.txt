With the decompose() command you calculate the trend by an Moving Average (The mean in a specific window around time t(x)). For this it is unavoidable to loose some information at the beginning/end. You could just use all Values between 2014m7 and 2016m6. (Are you sure there is a seasonal effect? All Values in the seasonal component are very small. If you don´t need this effect you wouldn´t loose the data points.)
