Let's see the options. 1 - Perforce. Used by lots of companies (as people said there) Adobe, Amazon, MS, Google Companies who grew, advanced, and depend on selling software everyday to put food on the table, that's their choice. I guess that's the way I would go if I needed a supported "global solution" for a multitude of sites, etc Good for Win/Linux (not sure about Macs though) 2 - SVN. Used by big teams as well, KDE uses it (huge, huge project) currently in revision 880,000 (yes!) Very practical for both Windows and Linux usage (even though I would call TortoiseSVN below average in some aspects) Commercial support can be contracted as well. Good for Windows / Linux / Macs as well. 3 - Accurev If I was trying to be "edgy". I wouldn't deploy it on the whole company without some testing and getting used to it first. 4 - MS Team Foundation It may be a good solution but I never tried and is probably Windows only. 5 - Git / Bzr / Hg - Bzr and Hg have their "tortoises" so, good for Windows (even though I'm not sure about maturity) Git would be linux only for the time being, even though it is VERY GOOD (and much better and easier to use than a couple of years ago). I would NEVER, EVER, ABSOLUTELY No WAY JOSE use Clearcase. PERIOD It is a waste of everybody's money and time and sanity. Steer clear of: CVS / Clearcase / anything older
