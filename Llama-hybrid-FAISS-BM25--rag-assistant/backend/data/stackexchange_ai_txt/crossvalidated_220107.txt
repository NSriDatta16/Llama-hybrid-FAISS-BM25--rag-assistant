Why can't negative data be used here? MultinomialNB assumes that features have multinomial distribution which is a generalization of the binomial distribution . Neither binomial nor multinomial distributions can contain negative values. How is scikit-learn handling the continuous data? If you want to work with bayesian methods use GaussianNb but generally there are a lot of estimators capable of handling continuous data in scikit-learn. Is this the most logical way to do this? From my perspective it's unwise to work with small piece of data (unless you have strong reason to do so). Statistics tends to work better with large amount of data ( Law of large numbers ). Moreover data binning is also a dangerous transformation. For example:
