dividing Mean by standard Deviation meaning

I have played around with logistic regression a little using movement data intervals that are prelabeled as either resting or active. I now found that if I divide the mean movement of the individual intervals by the intervals standard deviation, the outcome is quite a good predictor of whether the interval is a resting interval or or active, with an average auc = 0.93 in a 20 fold cross validation. Does someone have an idea of what I have created dividing the mean by the standard deviation? Its like a flipped coefficient of variation, or semi-normalization?!. I want to report this in an essay, so I am asking myself whether there is a name to this statistic.
