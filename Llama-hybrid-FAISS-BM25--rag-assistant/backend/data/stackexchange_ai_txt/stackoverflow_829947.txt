MS Word Macro - Delete Paragraphs

Could somebody please help me with a MS Word Macro that would search for a specific symbol in every paragraph throughout the document and delete paragraphs that DO NOT contain that symbol. I know practically nothing about VBA, but just received a huge & unwieldy document I need to edit real fast.
