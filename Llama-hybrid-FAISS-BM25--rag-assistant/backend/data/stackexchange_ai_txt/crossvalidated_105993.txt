How to visualize a range (min/med/max)?

I'm looking for a visually compelling yet immediately understandable way to visualize a range of data (min, median, max) Considerations: The approach should be understandable to a wide variety of people Ideally, would allow for the comparison to another set of data Ideally, will work okay or both high and low N cases What new ways can you think of to visualize this type of data ? Here are some examples: Example 1: Here is how a range of data and a comparison is displayed on Glassdoor: Example 2: Here is how a range of data and a comparison is displayed on Indeed: Example 3: Here is another very similar example from CareerBuilder: Example 4: and Trucar's visualization of a range of data (car prices paid by many users). This is likely pushing the realm of understandability by an average audience.
