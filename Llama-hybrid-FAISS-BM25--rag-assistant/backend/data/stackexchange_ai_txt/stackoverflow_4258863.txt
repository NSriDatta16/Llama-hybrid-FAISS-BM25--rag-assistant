Accessing variables in objects in javascript without "this"

function Peon(number) { this.number = number; this.inc = function() { number = number + 1; }; return true; } var p = new Peon(10); function returnNumber() { p.inc(); alert(p.number); } This code doesn't work as intended. Is there a way to make it work without having to write this.number=this.number+1; Here it is a trivial choice, but in bigger codes not having this.* would make it a lot more readable. Is it possible?
