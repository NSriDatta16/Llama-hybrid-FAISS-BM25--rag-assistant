How should I organize javascript when using CodeIgniter

I'm trying to find a good organization practice of my javascript (jquery) files when using CodeIgniter. I do a lot of ajax sites and many of my views are loaded in various controllers, I'd like to only load the necessary javascript for those views without duplicate code. How do y'all handle this issue?
