Because this particular overload knows that you're starting out with int values, it knows you're not using decimal values. Converting each of your values to a double and then adding the double values together would probably be less efficient, and would definitely open you up to the possibility of floating point imprecision issues if you had a large enough collection of values. Update I just did a quick benchmark, and it takes roughly 50% longer over twice as long to average double s as it does to average int s.
