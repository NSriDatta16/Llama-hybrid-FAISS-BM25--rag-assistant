There are couple of approaches you can test: Hypothesis based features: if you have a list of errors which you know are linked to response variable you will create features Frequency based features: If you are building ML model very low occurring features might not be impact if response variable is not associated to it. I am not a fan of PCA analysis but I generally use regularised regression algorithm like lasso to reduce the dimension. If the numbers of variables is too much to handle I would do a uni-variant gini/ uni-variant analysis and reduce the variable set. Hope it helps. Happy learning!!
