Shameless plug - I am in the process of writing a pure Perl GUI toolkit, XUL::Gui that renders its GUI using Firefox. It allows you do anything Firefox can (XUL, HTML, JavaScript, Flash, other web tech). Firefox uses the native look and feel of the OS (or any other theme you want), and is available for most platforms. use XUL::Gui; display Window title=>'My Application', Button( label=>'click me', oncommand=>sub{ shift->label = 'ouch'} ); It's currently under development, but probably stable enough to start working with. The idea is to be as simple and perlish as possible. Nearly all boilerplate is optional, with sensible defaults. For example, the Window tag is only needed because I wanted to title the window. The module is up on CPAN . I'd encourage anyone to take a look, and send me feature requests or bug reports.
