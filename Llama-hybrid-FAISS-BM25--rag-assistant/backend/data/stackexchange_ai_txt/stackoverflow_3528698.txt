How many users on one azure instance before I hit performance issues?

Our app is a simple portal (will be deployed as azure webrole) with following features - Login See details particular to that account (no heavy calculations, only showing details already saved in the DB) See a list of events published to all accounts Basic account management like password change What I am trying to gather is what do you think is a reasonable number of concurrent logins for an app like this on one small Azure instance? (I know two instances are needed for better uptime, but lets say we have only one)? The backend is SQLAzure for legacy reasons (and not windows azure storage). To give an idea about datasize, about a 1000 users data will be stored within 50 MB of storage (images are present only for events and will be pulled from windows azure blobs).
