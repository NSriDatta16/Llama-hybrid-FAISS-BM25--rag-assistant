What is the purpose of Instrument assemblies in place in VS2010?

In visual studio 2010 under the test settings By default instrument assemblies in place is checked, however when it is checked anytime I run my unit tests I will be told there is no code coverage xml file being generated. If I choose to not instrument assemblies in place it works fine. What gives?
