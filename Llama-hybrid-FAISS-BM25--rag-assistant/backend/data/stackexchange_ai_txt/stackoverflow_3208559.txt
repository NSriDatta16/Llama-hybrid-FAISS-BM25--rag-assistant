This is a document classification problem - your "document" is simply the query or text. You'll first need to decide what the list of possible categories is. "Who is Lady Gaga?" could be Entertainment, Celebrity, Questions-In-English, Biography, People, etc. Next you'll apply a decision framework to assign a score for each category to the text. The highest score is its category - as long as it's above a noise threshold and there isn't a second-place category that's too close to differentiate. Decision frameworks can include approaches like a Bayesian network or a set of custom rules. Some open source projects that implement classifiers include: Classifier4J Matlab Classification Toolbox POPFile (for email) OpenNLP Maximum Entropy Package
