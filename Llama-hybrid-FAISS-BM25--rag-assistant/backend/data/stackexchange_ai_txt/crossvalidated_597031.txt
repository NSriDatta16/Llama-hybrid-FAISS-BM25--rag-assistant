Deduce the logistic regression formula

This issue may be a little trivial, but I really want to get some inspiration. I know the formula of logistic regression, but have no idea how it is deduced. How can I deduce this formula from more basic math theory? Is this the best function to fit binary classification? $$\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}=e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 x}.$$
