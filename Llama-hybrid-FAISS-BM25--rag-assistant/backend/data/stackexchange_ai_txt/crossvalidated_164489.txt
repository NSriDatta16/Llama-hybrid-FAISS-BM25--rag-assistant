Relative speed of gaussian process classification

I used gaussian process classification implemented in Matlab gpml toolbox and also in R kernlab. For my problem - 600*14 matrix with two classes - it trains order of magnitude slower than other classifiers. Gauss. process is taking hours to finish what SVM/naive bayes/random forest does within minutes. Is this expected behavior of the classifier, or is there some other reason for such a poor speed? (e.g. scale of the data, slow implementation, etc.)
