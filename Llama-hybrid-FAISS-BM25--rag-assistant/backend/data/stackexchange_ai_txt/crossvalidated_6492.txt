What's a good prior distribution for degrees of freedom in a t distribution?

I want to use a t distribution to model short interval asset returns in a bayesian model. I'd like to estimate both the degrees of freedom (along with other parameters in my model) for the distribution. I know that asset returns are quite non-normal, but I don't know too much beyond that. What is an appropriate, mildly informative prior distribution for the degrees of freedom in such a model?
