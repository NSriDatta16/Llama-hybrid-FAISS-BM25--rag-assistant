The prawnto plugin is is up and alive on Github , albeit without much documentation. I have built several Rails apps that put PDF generation front and center, and I can definitely attest that Prawn/Prawnto is the way to go. The DSL provided by Prawn is really elegant and pleasant to work with, and even though the library isn't as feature-packed as others, it handles most of what you will need out of the box without any pain at all. I saw Gregory Brown (author of the Prawn library) give a talk about Ruby implementations, and he's a user of JRuby. I'd be surprised if you find any problems there, though I haven't personally used Prawn with JRuby. The Prawn Google Group is relatively active and helpful, so you might want to check it out as well. It also appears that the Prawn website is still available as well.
