Autocorrelation with missing Data

How should missing observations be handled to create ACF-Plots? Let's assume we have a time series t = [1, 1, 1, 2, NaN, 3, 2, NaN, ...]. What schould be done with these missing data points? I have not found any function for python that can handle missing data points.
