Search many fields with will_paginate / searchlogic

How do you effectively search among many fields in a model? # user.rb model def self.search(search, page) paginate :per_page => 20, :page => page, :conditions => ['name like ? OR notes like ? OR code like ? OR city like ? OR state like ?, "%#{search}%","%#{search}%","%#{search}%","%#{search}%","%#{search}%" ], :order => 'name' This code is horrible for any more than a few fields, and it doesn't return a result if, for instance word #1 comes from :name and word #2 comes from :code. Is there a more elegant way?
