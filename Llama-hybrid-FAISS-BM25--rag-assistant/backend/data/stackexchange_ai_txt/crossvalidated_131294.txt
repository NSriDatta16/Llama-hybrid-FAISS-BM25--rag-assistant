How to estimate the infinitesimal generator of a Markov chain?

I am working on an 8 state (8th state absorbing) multi-state markov model, and what I am having difficulty understanding is, how sensitive are the results to the initial qmatrix and what is the best way to go about creating the initial matrix? For example, in http://leg.ufpr.br/~silvia/papers/mmm.pdf , the matrix is: -(q12+q14) q12 0 q14 q21 -(q21+q23+q24) q23 q24 ....... But when the Q matrix is created immediately below using the following code Q there are no negative values. In fact, for Q[1,1], the value is zero, not the negative of the sums of q12+q14. Also, the fourth row, which is the absorbing state, is entered as all zeros. Why wouldn't Q[4,4] be 1? How would I go about creating that initial matrix, given the frequency of times the subjects are observed moving between states? (For another example, please see the state table provided below.) On a more general note, if someone could recommend a good primer for understanding and using Markov models (skewed towards a general audience), and interpreting their results, I would be grateful. Here is a the state table for my data (in R): dput(mm2myTrajectoryStateTable) structure(c(13295L, 946L, 126L, 6L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 3461L, 15035L, 937L, 100L, 19L, 17L, 2L, 636L, 2014L, 3977L, 146L, 4L, 16L, 4L, 46L, 153L, 518L, 1141L, 0L, 10L, 19L, 84L, 109L, 16L, 3L, 257L, 25L, 0L, 18L, 117L, 62L, 13L, 72L, 446L, 11L, 0L, 4L, 12L, 31L, 1L, 28L, 139L, 12909L, 15089L, 4377L, 680L, 146L, 193L, 38L), .Dim = 7:8, .Dimnames = structure(list(from = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"), to = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8")), .Names = c("from", "to")), class = "table")
