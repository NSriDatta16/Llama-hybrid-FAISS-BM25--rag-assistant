I find this interesting, you say that you somehow "know" that it does not belong to the classes given. Yet you do not then describe what precisely it is about that item that makes you think this. As soon as you suspect a class coming from "something else" (called SE from now on) you have basically begun to describe a model for predicting that class - if only intuitively. The task then is to "weed out" the model that is hiding in your intuition. This is always done by describing what distinguishes SE from the rest of your data (this always exists, or else you wouldn't suspect anything). The main problem with the SE is that this distinguishing feature must be based on the prior information alone - no data can possibly be used to train a classifier for SE. For if it could, then SE would effectively not exist as you explain, it would just be one of the classes. The best way to incorporate SE is to make a prediction about what kind of document you would see if it came from SE. Given that the situation comes up pretty frequently, this should not be too difficult to do (as you would have some idea of the type of features that you would predict). If you are using a Bayesian posterior probability based approach this is fairly simple to incorporate into a standard analysis. We just add one extra likelihood into the denominator, so you have: $$P(C_{i}|D_{new}D_{train}I)=\frac{P(C_{i}|D_{train}I)P(D_{new}|C_{i}D_{train}I)}{P(D_{new}|D_{train}I)}$$ $$=\frac{P(C_{i}|D_{train}I)P(D_{new}|C_{i}D_{train}I)}{\left[\sum_{j=1}^{r}P(C_{j}|D_{train}I)P(D_{new}|C_{j}D_{train}I)\right]+P(C_{SE}|D_{train}I)P(D_{new}|C_{SE}D_{train}I)}$$ Where $C_{j}$ is the jth class (plus something else), $D_{new}$ is the data from the document you are trying to classify, $D_{train}$ is the training data, and $I$ is your prior information. Note that the general procedure is not any different in principle from adding any of the other classes. But it is different in practice because the phrase "something else" is vague and does not make any obvious predictions about future data.
