(I think you are not asking about the implementation details, but whether you should make it a compile-time, a deploy-time, or a runtime config aspect.) I think it really depends. If you have a well-know config mechanism (be it a config file, an environment variable, command-line parameters, whatever) for the field, I would add this as a config item there. Then you can use exactly the same binaries in production as in testing. Some organizations demand this very strictly. Since you will never need that feature in production, I'd recommend to make this a compile-time config item so you can be 100% sure you will never mis-configure the app in production since would not support that feature. (Of course, you must make absolutely sure that you never deploy a binary compiled for testing to production.) Conditional defines/conditional compilation is a good choice here, I think. That's all there is to say about it, no?
