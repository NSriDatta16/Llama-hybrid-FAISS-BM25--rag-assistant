css methodology needed

i want to start the design of a website. I know i will need to: think of a general layout design banner/footer choose colors and font make sure everything is well positionned test the site with other browsers ... the problem is i don't know what is the good order to proceed in a efficient way. Should i design things from the general to the more precise levels? If anybody has a general methodology , a way to organize themeselves for design, it would be greatly appreciated.
