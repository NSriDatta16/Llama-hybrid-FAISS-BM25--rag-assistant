If you have a true baseclass for your BaseValidator control which your PasswordValidator extends, then any markup/controls in the baseclass should be available through protected properties. I would even go so far as to argue that a true base should not have an ascx portion. The base class should provide methods and properties that expose controls to built on the fly (probably during Page_Init to maintain viewstate). If you have 2 separate controls on the same page, your parent page can be modified to provide brokerage methods to allow such communication. If you have the PasswordValidator and you just need the controls/markup, you can use the LoadControl method to create an instance of the BaseControl in memory, access its controls/markup programmatically and either add it or destroy it depending on what you want to do with it. Barring any of that, it would be just as @Shawn said. Server controls.
