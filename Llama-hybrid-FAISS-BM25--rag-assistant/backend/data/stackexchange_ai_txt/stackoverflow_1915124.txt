Should code coverage be used as a "Milestone" that can block a project's progression?

I am a development manager on a project with a painfully low unit test code coverage and we are definately feeling the weight of the "techincal debt" in the legacy code in our system. My question is if anyone uses code coverage as a milestone or development threshold that prevents the project from moving to the next sprint until the code coverage reaches a specific level? What is the "best practice" for using the code coverage metric?
