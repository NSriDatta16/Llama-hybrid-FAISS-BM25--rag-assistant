I would suggest that you not try to read/write using JavaScript but instead head down the road of embedding a small web server on the USB drive. I did this for an app once and it worked out well. I used the Cassini web server. I created two projects in visual studio. First, I created an ASP.Net web site to read/write from an SQLite database. This site displayed all my content and was built just like any other ASP.Net site. Second, I created a Windows Forms application that hosted the Cassini web server and presented the user with a form that contained a single web browser control. This made the user experience very simple ... they just clicked MYAPP.EXE from the root of the USB drive and the form opens, starts the web server, and navigates the browser control to the start page of the web site.
