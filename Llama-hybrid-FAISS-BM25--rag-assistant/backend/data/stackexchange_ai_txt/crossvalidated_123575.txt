+1 for the question! It can be shown that if $y_{t}$ and $x_{1t}$ are cointegrated then the OLS estimator of that equation will be super consistent with a rate of convergance of $T^{-2} $ compared to the stationary $T^{-1} $ case. Notice further, that even if you have misspecified stationary terms terms in your regression or haven't captured all the dynamics of the true DGP the estimator will still be consistent since the stochastic trends will dominate asymptotically for $T\rightarrow\infty $ so any misspecification of stationary terms will not affect the estimator. The problem with running that regression is that the estimator can be severely biased in small samples if the stationary terms are misspecified and you cannot test hypothesis on the parameters since the estimator is not normal and the distribution depends on unknown parameters. In short: you will get super consistent estimates but you cannot test parameter significance nor say anything else about them. An easy way to test if the static relationship, (1) below, is stationary or not would be to test your estimated residuals for a unit root using an ADF-test. Remember to not include a constant since we assume a mean zero process and remember that the distribution is not the regular Dickey-Fuller distribtuion but depends on the no. of parameters in the static regression, (1) below. I guess you have heard of the Engle-Granger 2-step approach and your problem seems very similar to that approach. 1) Estimate the static regression: $y_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1t}+\beta_{2}x_{2t}+\varepsilon_{t} $ (1), where $y_{t}\sim I\left(1\right) $, $x_{1t}\sim I\left(1\right) $ and $x_{2t}\sim I\left(0\right) $ and test the estimated residuals for a unit root. If the variables cointegrate then the residuals should be stationary. Note that the null hypothesis of a unit root corresponds to the null hypothesis of no-cointegration. 2) Run the dynamic regression: ${\Delta y_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\Delta x_{1t}+\beta_{2}\Delta x_{1t-1}+\beta_{3}\Delta x_{2t1}+\beta_{4}\Delta x_{2t-1}+\beta_{5}\Delta x_{3t1}+\beta_{6}\Delta x_{3t-1}+ecm_{t-1}}+u_{t} $ (2), where $ecm_{t-1}=\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1} $, i.e. the estimated residuals from the static regression. Note that I included another stationary variable $x_{3t} $ to show that in this second step you can include whatever stationary variables you will. $ecm_{t-1} $ will show if and by how much $y_{t} $ error corrects to $x_{1t} $. Notice further that the t-values in (2) follow a normal distribution and regular inference applies. Some notes to think about: A) If $y_{t} $ and $x_{1t} $ cointegrate and you want to test that there is no need to include $x_{2t} $ in the static regression, (1), since you can include it in, (2), instead. B) Notice that the biased parameters which arise in small samples in the static regression, (1) are not a problem for an ECM, which is a rewritten ADL model, since it should be dynamically complete (this can be shown by MC simulations). C) Why would you want to estimate the static regression (1) on its own? You do not know if the variables cointegrate (if they do not cointegrate you'll get a spurious regression) and inference is invalid, hence we cannot test any hypothesis on our estimated parameters. In short: Estimate your ECM or use the Engle-Grange approach unless you want to expand your analysis to CVAR's.
