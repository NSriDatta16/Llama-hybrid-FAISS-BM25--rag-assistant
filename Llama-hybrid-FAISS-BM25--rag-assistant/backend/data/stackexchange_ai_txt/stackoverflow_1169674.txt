Ruby code to JAR

I'd like to be able to compile a ruby program to a java JAR program. I've looked into JRuby and seen several examples of Java applications that would be able to eval() ruby code, but is there a more elegant solution allowing to simply code everything in ruby and then compile the lot directly to a JAR file? The overall goal behind that is to be able to extend a security tool called Burp Proxy. So I'd like to be able to use all my Ruby pentesting scripts (obviously organising them so they interface with Burp extender) and compile my plugins to JAR file that can be executed by the tool. If you could include some examples or links to examples in your answer that would even be better! Thanks for your time.
