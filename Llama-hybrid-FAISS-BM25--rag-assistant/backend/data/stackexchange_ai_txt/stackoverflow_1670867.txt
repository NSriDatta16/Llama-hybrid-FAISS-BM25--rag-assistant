Libraries or tools for generating random but realistic text

I'm looking for tools for generating random but realistic text. I've implemented a Markov Chain text generator myself and while the results were promising, my attempts at improving them haven't yielded any great successes. I'd be happy with tools that consume a corpus or that operate based on a context-sensitive or context-free grammar. I'd like the tool to be suitable for inclusion into another project. Most of my recent work has been in Java so a tool in that language is preferred, but I'd be OK with C#, C, C++, or even JavaScript. This is similar to this question , but larger in scope.
