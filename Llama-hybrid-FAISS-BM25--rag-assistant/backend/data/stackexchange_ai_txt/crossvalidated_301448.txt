Shortest time for $C$ distinct objects to arrive

Assume there are $N+1$ objects denoted by $O_1,O_2,...,O_{N+1}$ , and each object has an arrival process. The first $N$ of them arrive with rate $\lambda_i,~i=\{1,2,...,N\}$ , and $O_{N+1}$ arrive with rate $\mu$ . Let $X_i$ denote the inter-arrival time of the $i$ -th object (keep in mind that each object has an arrival process, and the inter-arrival time means the time between two adjacent same objects), and let $Y$ denote the inter-arrival time for object $O_{N+1}$ . All the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed. Question: think of the situation that, starting from any time epoch, there are at least $C$ distinct ( $C$ is a constant) objects arrive before object $O_{N+1}$ arrives. If this case happens, find the time duration $\tau$ , during which the first $C$ distinct objects arrive. Extra info: By definition, $\tau$ is a random variable, but current research has verified that it can be regarded as a constant . My analysis: for object $O_i$ that belongs to the $C$ objects, its inter-arrival time $X_i$ must be smaller than $Y$ ( $X_i ), and $\tau$ must be between $X_i$ and $Y$ ( $X_i ). Then define an indicator function $I_i$ , $I_i=1$ if $\tau$ satisfies $X_i on condition that $X_i , otherwise $I_i=0$ , so we have $\sum_{i=1}^N I_i=C$ . Taking average on both sides, we get $\sum_{i=1}^N E[I_i]=\sum_{i=1}^N P(X_i . If I have the expression for $P(X_i , maybe I can get $\tau$ . Unfortunately, this analysis is not correct according to my simulation. Can someone tell me how to analyze this problem? Thank you so much!
