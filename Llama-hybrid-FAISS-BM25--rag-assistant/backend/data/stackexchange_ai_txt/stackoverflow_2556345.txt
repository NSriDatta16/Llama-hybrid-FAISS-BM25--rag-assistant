Detect base64 encoding in PHP?

Is there some way to detect if a string has been base64_encoded() in PHP? We're converting some storage from plain text to base64 and part of it lives in a cookie that needs to be updated. I'd like to reset their cookie if the text has not yet been encoded, otherwise leave it alone.
