Fluent NHibernate HasManyToMany and NotFound

I have the following FNH mapping fragment: HasManyToMany((c) => c.Plaintiffs) .LazyLoad() .WithTableName("invoicePlantiff") .WithChildKeyColumn("PersonReferenceID") .WithParentKeyColumn("invoiceID") .FetchType.Join(); Which produces the following HBM: The problem is that I am dealing with legacy data that is, let us just say 'less than ideal', and some records have invalid ids so I need to put the not-found="ignore" attribute on the many-to-many tag inside the bag. I do not see ANY way to accomplish this with FNH. There is the .NotFound.Ignore() on the References() call, but not on the HasManyToMany Call. Can someone tell me what I am missing? Even if it is a hack to 'inject' the attribute after it is rendered / before configuring NH is fine, i just need it to work. Thanks in advance. UPDATE gcores answer will not work, it adds it to the wrong tag, see my comment on his answer for more info.
