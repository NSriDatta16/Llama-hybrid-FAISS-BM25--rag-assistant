As Robert Gould pointed out, you loose control over construction. You will also get construction issues which are a lot more obscure. Static classes quickly end up with static initializer blocks. These blocks get called the first time someone references your type, and this order may not be as well defined as you like to think. So the run-order of these static initializers may change without you planning so, and can cause strange bugs.
