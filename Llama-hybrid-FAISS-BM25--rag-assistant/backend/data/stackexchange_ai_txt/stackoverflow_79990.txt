I would think that this would be the simplest solution: SELECT TOP N PERCENT FROM TheTable ORDER BY TheScore DESC Where N = (100 - desired percentile). So if you wanted all rows in the 90th percentile, you'd select the top 10%. I'm not sure what you mean by "preferably in a single record". Do you mean calculate which percentile a given score for a single record would fall into? e.g. do you want to be able to make statements like "your score is 83, which puts you in the 91st percentile." ? EDIT: OK, I thought some more about your question and came up with this interpretation. Are you asking how to calculate the cutoff score for a particular percentile? e.g. something like this: to be in the 90th percentile you must have a score greater than 78. If so, this query works. I dislike sub-queries though, so depending on what it was for, I'd probably try to find a more elegant solution. It does, however, return a single record with a single score. -- Find the minimum score for all scores in the 90th percentile SELECT Min(subq.TheScore) FROM (SELECT TOP 10 PERCENT TheScore FROM TheTable ORDER BY TheScore DESC) AS subq
