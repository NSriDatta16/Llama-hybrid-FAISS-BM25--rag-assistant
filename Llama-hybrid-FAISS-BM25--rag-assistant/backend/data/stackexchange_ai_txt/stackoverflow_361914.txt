You'll want to declare your method as an IBAction in your header file: - (IBAction) myMethod: (id) sender; Save your header, then switch to Interface Builder. Right click on the Bar Button, and drag from the selector tag to your view controller object (probably the File Owner). When you release, you should be given a popup menu of available actions, and myMethod should be selectable. If you don't get this popup, you may need to make sure your File Owner class is set properly: select the File Owner in the file window, then select "Tools" > "Identity Inspector" from the menu. In the inspector, type your view controller's class into the Class field.
