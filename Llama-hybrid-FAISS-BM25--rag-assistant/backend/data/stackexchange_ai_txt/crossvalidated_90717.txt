Does randomness imply independence?

By looking at a lag plot, it seems that my dataset is random (no autocorrelation whatsoever). Should this be sufficient to infer independence of observations? As a matter of fact, I know that the observations are dependent and hence randomness should not guarantee that. But intuitively it feels otherwise. Given that randomness does not determine independence. Is there some statistical measure to test independence of observations? edit: Please note that the data is not of timeseries nature, it is the average bandwidth usage of a customer across the month.
