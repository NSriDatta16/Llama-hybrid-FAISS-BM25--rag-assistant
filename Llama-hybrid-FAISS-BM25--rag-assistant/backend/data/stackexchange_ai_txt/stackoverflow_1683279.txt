Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 and Entity Framework walkthrough

I am in the process of evaluating Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 and looking for possible replacements for current our data access layer. The Entity Framework looks like a promising replacement to the data retrieval functionality in our applications. Does anyone have a great walk-through/tutorial that demonstrates how to use the Entity Framework from soup to nuts?
