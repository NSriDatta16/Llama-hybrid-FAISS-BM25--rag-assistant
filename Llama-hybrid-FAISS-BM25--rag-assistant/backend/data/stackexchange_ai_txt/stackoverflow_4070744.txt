Adding extra sections to a NSFetchedResultsController

I'm writing a small iPhone app for my company that shows bookings for each employee one week at a time. I'm using core data to get a list of 'Bookings' for a given week and want to display them in a UITableView broken down in to one section per day of the week. The problem comes in that I need to show 7 sections for each day of the week (showing a 'No Bookings' cell where a section/date has no bookings). I've got a screenshot of the app as it stands here (sorry can't post images yet as I'm new to StackOverlow) At the moment I'm achieving this by using a 'fetchResults' method which gets the bookings and organises them in to an array of possible dates: - (void)refetchResults { // Drop bookings Array, replacing with new empty one // 7 slots for 7 days each holding mutable array to recieve bookings where appropraite self.bookings = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:[NSMutableArray array], [NSMutableArray array], [NSMutableArray array], [NSMutableArray array], [NSMutableArray array], [NSMutableArray array], [NSMutableArray array], nil]; // Create the fetch request for the entity. NSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]; NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"Booking" inManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext]; [fetchRequest setEntity:entity]; // Limit to this weeks data [fetchRequest setPredicate: [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"(date >= %@) && (date } My question is: is there any way to achieve the same result using NSFetchedResultsController? Somehow I'd need to get the NSFetchedResultsController to have 7 sections, one for each day of the week, some of them possibly having no bookings. Any help much appreciated :)
