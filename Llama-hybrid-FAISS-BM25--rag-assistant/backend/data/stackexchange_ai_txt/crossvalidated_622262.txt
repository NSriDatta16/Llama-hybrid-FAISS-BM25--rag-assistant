One-class training for anomaly detection is supposed to only get "normal" class data as input. However, it is very common in practice that what we believe to be "normal" data is in fact contaminated by some outliers. Because of this, it is highly desirable that the AD method can reject such contamination, and find the true normal datapoints. For one-class SVM the ability to reject outliers is highly dependent on the regularization parameters. In scikit-learn OneClassSVM the most relevant parameters should be gamma and nu . The one-class SVM learns a hyperplane, and this separates the one normal class from all other classes. The method decision_function() can be used to get the (signed) distance to this hyperplane, it returns positive for an inlier and negative for an outlier. The predict function uses the continious scores, but also applies a learned _offset in order to binarize into inlier/outlier.
