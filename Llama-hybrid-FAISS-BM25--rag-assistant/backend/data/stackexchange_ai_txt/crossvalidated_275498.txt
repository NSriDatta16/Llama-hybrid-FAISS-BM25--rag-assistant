Output of sentence convolution neural network yielding dimension equals to word embedding

From this article titled A Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentences , it is mentioned in section 2.2 that generation the output of a convolution layer is determined by the formula of: where m refers to the size of the weight matrix with dimension d x m , s refers to the sentence matrix of dimension d x s , d refers to the size of word embedding, and j refers to an index. Mathematically based on the formula above, Cj should have the dimension of m x( (m-1) x s) . It is also mentioned that the dimension of c for wide convolution is d x (s+m-1) . I understand that using wide convolution method will generate an index of j from 1 to (s+m-1) and hence explains the s+m-1 part of output layer dimension d x (s+m-1) of the convolutional layer, but my question is why does it have the preserve the size of d for each index of convolutional output layer (i.e. why isn't the dimension m x( (m-1) x s) instead of d )?
