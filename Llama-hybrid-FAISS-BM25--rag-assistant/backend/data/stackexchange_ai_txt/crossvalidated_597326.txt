Can we give higher priority certain features in machine learning models?

I am preparing a model for predicting the customer propensity to buy from our company. We are using the transaction data for modelling. On discussion with our sales team, we realized that some features are of higher importance and they should have more say in the prediction. They insist on giving weight to these features in the model. Is it possible to give more prominence to certain features in the model (in any model)? Is it advisable to do so? What are the pros and cons of this approach? How should I convince the team for or against it?
