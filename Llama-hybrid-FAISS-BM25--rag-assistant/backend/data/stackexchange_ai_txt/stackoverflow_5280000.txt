No, fragments are currently not in a hierarchy. I looked at doing this, but at this point all of the use cases for it have been driven mostly by an extreme over-use of fragments where each separate UI element is implement as a fragment. That isn't how they are intended to be used, they are intended to encapsulate the major top-level pieces of an application. If you have a hierarchy of stuff, that is what your layout and views are for.
