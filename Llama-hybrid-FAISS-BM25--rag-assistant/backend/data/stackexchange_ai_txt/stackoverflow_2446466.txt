Java: Set collection, where items are identified by its class

I need Set collection, where its items will be identified by items class. Something like ReferenceIdentityMap from Appache Collections , but on class scope i.e. two different instances of same class must be identified as same in this collection. You know, it is a violation of equals()/hashCode() identity principle but in occasional use it makes sense. I have done this in simple class backing with Map , E> , but due to simplicity it doesn't implement Set . There may be a more elegant solution, decorator of any Set would be great. Is there any implementation of such collection there (Apache/Google/something/... Collections)?
