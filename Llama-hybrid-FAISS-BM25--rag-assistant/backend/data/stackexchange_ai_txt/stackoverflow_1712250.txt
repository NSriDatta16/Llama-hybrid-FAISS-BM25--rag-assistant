Perhaps the best answer to your question is "What are you trying to do?". I say that because if you're looking to build a web application now that works in modern web browsers (read: not IE) using HTML5, then the scope/boundaries that you're going to care about are what the main modern browser manufacturers are currently supporting and plan on supporting soon. Google Wave did this and came up with a great product that works cross browser (Firefox/Chrome/Safari/Opera). Some basic tenants of HTML5 that are widely supported already are video/audio/canvas/storage/geo. http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/05/google-bets-big-on-html-5.html
