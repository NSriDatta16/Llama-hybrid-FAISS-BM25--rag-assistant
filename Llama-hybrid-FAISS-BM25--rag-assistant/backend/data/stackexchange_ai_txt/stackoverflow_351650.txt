Here's a couple more indexing anti-patterns that I have seen or have been guilty of: Blanket coverage - Placing indexes on tables with little or no growth and a (very) low rowcount. This is counterproductive as the index lookup can take longer than a table scan. Industrial Strength Indexing - Placing an index on a primary key column. I've been asked to do this to "speed up" a query.
