Best way to disable client caching

I'm using a simple servlet filter that forces the browser to skip caching for some server resources: Cache-Control: private Pragma: This works fine in Internet Explorer but it doesn't works well with Firefox 3.0.10. I ended to write this code: Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=-1 Pragma: no-cache, no-store Expires: -1 // -1 is the unix time, the client receives a date in 1969 :) Last-Modified: -1 // ditto this forces firefox to cache nothing. What about other browsers? What about best practices on no caching headers that works on major browsers?
