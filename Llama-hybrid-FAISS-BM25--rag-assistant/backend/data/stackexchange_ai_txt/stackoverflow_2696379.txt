JQuery delegate what may cause it to not function

I have a webpage using jquery 1.42 The following 2 segments of code live in my page. $('body').delegate('h2', 'click', function() { $(this).after(" delegate paragraph! "); }); $('body h2').live('click', function() { $(this).after(" live paragraph! "); }); The live method always works, yet the delegate doesn't fire at all. If I create a trivial page with simple html blah both approaches work. So I'm assuming there is something else going on in my page. With firebug I am seeing no javascript errors, no html errors. and breakpoints on the delegate method definately do not get hit. What else might be the cause of delegate not triggering? EDIT: heres the list of other scripts on the page:
