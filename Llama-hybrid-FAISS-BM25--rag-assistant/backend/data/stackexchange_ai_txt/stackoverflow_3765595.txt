Lucene indexing with for structured document where each text line has meta-data

I have a document structure where each text line in the document has some meta-data associated with it. The search result must show the line and the meta-data for the line. Currently I am storing each such line as a Lucene documents and storing the metata-data as one of the non-indexed fields. That is I create and add a Lucene Document structure for each line. My concerns is that I may end up with too many Documents in the index. Is there a more elegant approach ? Thanks
