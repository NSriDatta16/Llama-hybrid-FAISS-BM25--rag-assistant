Don't use subqueries. Each subquery runs once for every row. So if the outer query returns 10 rows, then the inner query will be run 10 times. The effect is made even worse by the fact that you have a subquery in a subquery. The effect multiplies, so if the outer one returns 10 rows and the inner one returns 10 rows, then the inner most one will run 100 times. Edit: never mind on that last paragraph--it looked like you had a subquery within a subquery, but looking at it again, you don't. Either way, don't use subqueries.
