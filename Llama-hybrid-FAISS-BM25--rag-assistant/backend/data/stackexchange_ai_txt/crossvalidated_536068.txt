Prediction Intervals the Same in Multi-Step with R Forecast Package - Why?

Using the R forecast package for a multi-step time series forecasting exercise, I've noticed that sometimes I get the same prediction interval at each step (6 months, in my case) and sometimes, I get what would be more along the lines of my expectation -- a widening PI the further into the future I go - to account for the increasing uncertainty. Why would a PI remain constant in a multi-step ts forecast?
