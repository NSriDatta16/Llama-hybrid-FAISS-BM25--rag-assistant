logistic like curve fitting using machine learning

I have a set of points of a function k(x). I am trying to do some curve fitting to find the exact k(x) function. It seems that the data points fit to a logistic like curve only a little shifted and stressed. So far I have tried polynomial regression, but I don't feel the fitting is correct. I have attached a snap of the fitted curve here. So my question is, is logistic regression only used in classification tasks? Or can it be used for curve fitting? If not what are the other available techniques to fit a logistic like curve to a set of data points?
