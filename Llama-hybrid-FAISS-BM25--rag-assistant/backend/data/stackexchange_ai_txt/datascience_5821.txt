Convolutional neural network for sparse one-hot representation

I have some basic features which I encoded in a one-hot vector . Length of the feature vector equals to 400. It is sparse . I saw that conv nets is applied to a dense feature vectors. Is there any problems to apply conv nets to a sparse feature vectors?
