It sounds like you are adding your dragged instances to the wrong parent. In actionscript, you can take any object and re-assign it to any parent. So, you will need to look for which parent it really needs to be attached to. If you add a child MC (MovieClip) to another parent MC that is visually below other parent clips, then it too will be below the other parent clips. By being an internal component of the new parent MC, it inherits the parent's z-index, no matter where that parent is located. I would recommend checking out the "insert target path" command in the actions palette. It allows you to navigate to the clip you want to re-attach from one parent to another and then see what path it is recommending. You may be surprised at what the paths actually are from one MC (MovieClip) to another... Also, by using a timeline of that length, you may actually be causing the correct parent to "disappear" from the stage because it is on a keyframe that does not contain the correctly labeled MC and may have caused any code attached to it to not be loaded. I am not sure how you are doing things in your game, so these are all just guesses...
