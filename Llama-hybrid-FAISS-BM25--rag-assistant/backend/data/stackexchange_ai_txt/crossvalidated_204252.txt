Why is it OK it assume MSw (Mean Squared within) to be equal to ordinary average of cell variances?

Statistic book (at least the one I'm using) say that MSw required for ANOVA (calculation of F score) will be equal to ordinary average of variance of each independent sample(cell) when all samples are of equal size. For the following example matrix, the variances of sample a, b and c are respectively, 11.6, 11.9 and 27.76. So with this logic, the MSw will be average of these three values (i.e., 17.087 ). But if we calculate variance combining all raw values together (i.e., d = c(a,b,c)), the resulting variance values for sample d will be 20.81 . This difference can become even larger depending on samples. Then why is it OK to assume that variance of d will be equivalent to ordinary average of variances of a, b and c ( a = 38, 35, 33, 33, 31, 28; b = 33, 32, 26, 34, 36, 34; c = 23, 26, 21, 34, 31, 32)
