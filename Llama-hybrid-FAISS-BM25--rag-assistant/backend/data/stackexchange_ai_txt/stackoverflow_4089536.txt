In VSTS How to run a 20 second webtest every 5 seconds

I have a WebPerfoamce test in Visual Studio Team System 2008, it's average execution is 20 seconds. I have a load test that runs the test every 5 seconds using: Test Mix Type: Based on user pace Tests per user per hour: 720 (Which should be 12 test runs per min) with a constant user load of 1. The problem is when this is executed only 2 or 3 tests are run per min. I expect 11 or 12 though... If anyone has any ideas.. please suggest away :)
