Not exactly an answer to the question... but if you are trying to detect a specific browser brand, the point of feature-checking is kind of lost. I highly doubt any other browsers are using the Chrome userAgent string, so if your question is 'is this browser Chrome', you should just look at that. (By the way, window.ActiveXObject does not guarantee IE, there are plug-ins for other browsers that provide this object. Which kind of illustrates the point I was trying to make.)
