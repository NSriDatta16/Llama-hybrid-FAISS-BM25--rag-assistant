If you are using a MasterPage for your site, you may want to consider adding the following response header to its Page_Load event: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { Response.AddHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate"); } Since your .js file(s) will not use the MasterPage, the browser should save the reference to its cache. The example above is what I use and it works well under Firefox3, IE7, and Chrome7. Note that the response header above is the only thing I added for cache control and it does the job. However, I often see Pragma and Expires response headers on other websites. For example, here is the response headers that are used in Gmail: Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate Pragma: no-cache Expires: Fri, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT Date: Tue, 02 Nov 2010 16:38:15 GMT x-dns-prefetch-control: off Content-Encoding: gzip Transfer-Encoding: chunked X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block Server: GSEServer: GSE I'm not sure if those are used for older browsers and/or other newer browsers. I prefer to implement the minimum amount of code to solve a problem and I've never (yet) had a case where the Response.AddHeader noted at the top wasn't sufficient.
