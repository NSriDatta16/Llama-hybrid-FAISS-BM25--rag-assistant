Unit Testing just tests the external API of your Unit, you shouldn't test internal behaviour. Each test of a TestCase should test one (and only one) method inside this API. Aditional Test Cases should be included for failure cases. Test the coverage of your tests: Once a unit it's tested, the 100% of the lines inside this unit should had been executed.
