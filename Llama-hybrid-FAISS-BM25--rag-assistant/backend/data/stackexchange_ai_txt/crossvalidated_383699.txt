convergence of an algorithm

I want to know when we speak about the convergence of an algorithm, what are the conditions that we should check. For example, I was looking for the convergence of the policy iteration algorithm in reinforcement learning and I didn't know which characteristics can show its convergence. It seems that monotonicity of algorithm and uniqueness and existence of answer shows its convergence, but when I was looking for my answer in different papers, I didn't know which lemma's are responsible for showing the convergence of policy iteration algorithm.
