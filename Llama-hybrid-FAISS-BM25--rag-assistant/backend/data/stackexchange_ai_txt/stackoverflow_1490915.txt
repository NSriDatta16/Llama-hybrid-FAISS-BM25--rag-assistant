This page of the manual might interest you : 12.3.3. Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit ; quoting a few sentences : The statements listed in this section (and any synonyms for them) implicitly end a transaction, as if you had done a COMMIT before executing the statement. And, a bit farther in the page : Transaction-control and locking statements. BEGIN , LOCK TABLES , SET autocommit = 1 (if the value is not already 1), START TRANSACTION , UNLOCK TABLES . See also this paragraph : Transactions cannot be nested. This is a consequence of the implicit commit performed for any current transaction when you issue a START TRANSACTION statement or one of its synonyms.
