When implementing the repository pattern should lookup value / tables get their own Repository?

I am creating RESTful services for several database entities based on a modified version of the BISDM . Some of these entities have associated lookup tables, such as depicted below: I have decided to use the repository pattern to provide a clean separation between data persistance / retrieval; however, I am not sure how lookups ( as opposed to entities ) should be represented in the repository. Should lookups get their own repository interface, "share" one with the associated entity, or should there be a generic ILookupRepository interface? For the moment, these lookups are read-only; however, there will be a time where we may want to edit the lookups via services. Option 1: ISpaceRepository.GetSpaceCategoryById(string id); Option 2: ISpaceCategoryRepository.GetById(string id); Option 3: ILookupRepository.GetSpaceCategoryById(string id); Incidentally, this question is related to another one regarding look-up tables & RESTful web services .
