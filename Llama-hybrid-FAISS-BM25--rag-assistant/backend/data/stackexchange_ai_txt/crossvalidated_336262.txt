Short answer: you can't. There is no statistical test that will tell you whether a predictor that contains the integers between 1 and 10 is a numeric predictor (e.g., number of children) or encodes ten different categories. (If the predictor contains negative numbers, or the smallest number is larger than one, or it skips integers, this might argue against its being a categorical encoding - or it may just mean that the analyst used nonstandard encoding.) The only way to be sure is to leverage domain expertise, or the dataset's codebook (which should always exist).
