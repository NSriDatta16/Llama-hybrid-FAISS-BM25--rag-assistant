Here are some quick answers based on my experience with Mongo. Java client Not sure, but it does exist and it is well supported. Lots of docs , even several POJO wrappers to make it easy. Track web clicks 8 or 9. It's really easy to do both inserts and updates thanks to "fire and forget". MongoDB has built-in tools to map-reduce the data and easy tools to export the data to SQL for analysis (if Mongo isn't good enough). CMS like system 8 or 9. It's easy to store the whole web page content. It's really easy to "hook on" extra columns. This is really Mongo's "bread and butter". Store uploaded files There's a learning curve here, but Mongo has a GridFS system designed specifically for both saving and serving binary data. Easy to set up failover Start your primary server: ./mongo --bindip 1.2.3.4 --dbpath /my/data/files --master Start your slave: ./mongo --bindip 1.2.3.5 --dbpath /my/data/files --slave --source 1.2.3.4 Support 10gen has a mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user . They also have paid support. Their response time generally ranks somewhere between excellent and awesome. Documentation Average. It's all there, but it is still a little dis-organized. Chock it up to a lot of new development in the last.
