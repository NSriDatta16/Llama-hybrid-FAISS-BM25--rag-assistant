Tensorflow, how many layers does this model have?

I'm very new to machine learning and I'm not sure about Tensorflow implementation of neural network model. How many layers does the model below have? model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(200, activation="tanh")) model.add(Dropout(0.3)) model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) I think the answer is 2, because dropout applies to the input layer, but the input shape is (None, 20) and not 200, so does that Dense layer actually follow a implicit input layer?
