How is bootstrapping used in machine learning?

I understood bootstrapping in the statistical context. Example: we have a sample of 1000 people. We want to know their mean. We pick 5 people at random (with replacement) for 20 times and we compute the mean of the 5 people for each extraction. We end up with 20 means and we can have an estimate of the real mean and of its error. Is this correct? I was following an online course of machine learning and neural networks. The professor briefly mentioned bootstrapping. How would you use it in the context of machine learning? I know how bagging is used (ensembles), but I am not sure how plain bootstrapping would be used.
