I managed to figure out what was wrong here. I made two mistakes: In app.yaml , url: /test.* had to be before url:/.* (otherwise the /test URL would be matched to /.* before getting to the /test.* handler) Beware of copying all the files from the GAEUnit package into your project root! The GAEUnit folder contains a urls.py file that will overwrite your one if you are not paying attention. This was happening in my case. I simply restored my original urls.py. When working with the django test Client , and if you intend to access the response.template or response.context properties, you need to ensure that you call django.test.utils.setup_test_environment() , otherwise template and context will be Nothing . I call this in my test module, right at the bottom. Result: working unit tests!
