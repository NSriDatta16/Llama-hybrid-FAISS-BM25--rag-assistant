Deriving ADF unit root test form for the time series with quadratic deterministic trend

I have the following time series process $y_t $ $$\Delta y_t = \delta + \gamma t + \epsilon_t$$ where $e_t$ is white noise process with the variance of $\sigma^2$ . I guess that whereas $\Delta y_t$ is trend stationary process, $y_t$ is a random walk with a quadratic deterministic trend. So, by using the process $y_t$ which is defined as a random walk with a quadratic deterministic trend, I want to apply the ADF unit root test. During the testing procedure, which form do we assign to $y_t$ under the null hypothesis? What I did is as follows: My solution is that! But my solution is totally wrong. I just want to exhibit my attempt, so I added them as a picture because this solution is too long to type it and it is wrong. (Sorry for not typing ) But, I have no idea other than this solution. Please share your ideas with me. Thank you a lot!
