Memory Monitor is just one of the tools in Instruments. After you start your Instruments run (Xcode: Run > Start With Performance Tool > Leaks), click Library in the instruments window toolbar and drag Memory Monitor into the main window. Memory Monitor is significant because it shows TOTAL memory usage by your app, whether or not that usage is reflected in ObjectAlloc. The most important bar in Memory Monitor seems to be the last one, Total Memory Used. If this one keeps climbing, eventually your app will be toast. Drag the triangle control through the time bar (top of window) to get numeric value for any point in time.
