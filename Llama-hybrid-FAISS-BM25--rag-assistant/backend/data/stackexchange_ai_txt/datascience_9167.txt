What does RMSE points about performance of a model in machine learning?

I am working on Decision Tree algorithm and at the end I calculate RMSE value based on actual labels and predicted values (for regression). Now what I am having difficulty in is in understanding the significance of the RMSE value that I get. I know that the lower the RMSE better is the performance of the model but what RMSE value is considered reasonable low or high? Suppose my RMSE value comes as 20 so does that mean the performance of my model is 80% (means 80% of predictions are correct)?
