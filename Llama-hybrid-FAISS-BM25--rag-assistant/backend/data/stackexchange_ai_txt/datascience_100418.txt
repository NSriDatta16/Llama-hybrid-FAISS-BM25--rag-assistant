AllenNLP installation issue - No matching distribution found for torchvision =0.8.1

As per demos, we are expected to install AllenNLP using following command: pip install allennlp==2.1.0 allennlp-models==2.1.0 But it always throws error: ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torchvision =0.8.1 (from allennlp==2.1.0) (from versions: 0.1.6, 0.1.7, 0.1.8, 0.1.9, 0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.2.2, 0.2.2.post2, 0.2.2.post3, 0.3.0, 0.4.1, 0.5.0, 0.9.0, 0.9.1, 0.10.0) ERROR: No matching distribution found for torchvision =0.8.1 (from allennlp==2.1.0) Have tried installing torchvision separately but the version demanded by AllenNLP is not available at all. As can be seen in error above the torchvision =0.8.1 is demanded, but the available versions are ... 0.5.0, 0.9.0 ... What am I missing ?
