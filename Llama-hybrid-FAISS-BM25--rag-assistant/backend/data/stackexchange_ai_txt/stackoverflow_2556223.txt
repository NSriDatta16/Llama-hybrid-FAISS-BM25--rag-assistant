I’m currently rebuilding a legacy PHP web application with a MySQL database my self. The PHP code was kind of spaghetti and is now rewritten in Java as it type safe, promotes well-structured code, has excellent tooling and has superior unit testing capabilities. For database to Java mapping I use Hibernate/JPA. The web application is incrementally delivered to production. Meaning we run both Java and large parts of the old PHP code together until the application is fully converted. But in order to use hibernate effectively we needs the database to be logical correct (something MySQL MyIsam does not enforce). So with each production release I run an refactoring scripts for the database (also used to build the development environment and do unit testing) and update the PHP code with a new version that works with the schema changes. As a web framework I use Stripes as it’s simple, elegant and easy to learn.
