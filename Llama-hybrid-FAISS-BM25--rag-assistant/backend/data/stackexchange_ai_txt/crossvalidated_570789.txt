Matching on pre-treatment outcome $z$-score in diff-in-diff analysis to avoid regression toward the mean bias in $ATT$ estimates?

There have been many articles (e.g., Chab√©-Ferret (2017) , Daw & Hatfield (2018) , Zeldow & Hatfield (2021) ) discussing the perils of matching on pre-treatment outcomes (such as patient's medical cost or hospital utilization in healthcare studies) which have dissimilar distributions since regression toward the mean effects may cloud average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) estimates. Would matching on the pre-treatment outcome $z$ -scores rather then raw values remove any bias due to regression toward the mean?
