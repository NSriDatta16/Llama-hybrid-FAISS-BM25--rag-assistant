It isn't strictly necessary to standardise, whether it is required or not may depend on the distance metric you choose. For instance if you opt for the Mahalanobis distance then separation will be based upon the number of standard deviations separating points and not the absolute distance between them, as such it is a scale invariant metric. As with many things in machine learning there is no hard and fast answer and the only way to know for sure is to apply a variety of techniques see which gives the most appropriate results for your data.
