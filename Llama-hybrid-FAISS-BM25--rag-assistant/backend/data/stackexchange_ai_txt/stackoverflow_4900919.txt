Should I use malloc in c++, or new? If I use new, can I still use realloc? You can use malloc in C++; however, it is strongly discouraged in most circumstances. Additionally, if you call malloc , calloc , realloc , etc., you need to use free to deallocate the memory when done. If you use new to allocate memory, you must use delete to deallocate it. The C-allocation routines do not have type safety. new does.
