Dealing with imbalanced data-set and cross-validation

I have a data set of brain tumours, 700 malignant, and 225 benign. And I want to build a classification model using SVM, to classify the tumours types based on the data I have. My first question, is it considered an imbalanced dataset? if so, should I do undersampling of the malignant class? Also, is it correct to use the below code to do cross-validation for my dataset? NOTE: groups = instances' labels vector (sorted malignant 0s then benign 1s) data = instances' data feature matrix k=10; cp = classperf(groups); cvFolds = crossvalind('Kfold', groups, k); for i = 1:k testIdx = (cvFolds == i); %# get indices of test instances trainIdx = ~testIdx; %# get indices training instances svmModel = fitcsvm(data(trainIdx,:), groups(trainIdx), 'Standardize',true,'KernelFunction','RBF','KernelScale','auto'); pred = predict(svmModel, meas(testIdx,:)); cp = classperf(cp, pred, testIdx); end I still couldn't understand how crossvalind works? I mean does it guarantee that it takes instances from both classes at each fold?
