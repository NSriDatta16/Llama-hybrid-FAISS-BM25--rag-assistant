As noticed by Xi'an in the comment, your description sounds as if you described a multinomial distribution, where given that $N$ people are to visit the store on a single day, on one of the three exclusive periods of the day, with probabilities $p_1,p_2,p_3$ , then the distribution would describe the counts of people to be observed in those bins. Assuming multinomial likelihood, you could use Dirichlet distribution as a prior, to have closed-form Dirichlet-multinomial model for updating the probabilities. However, I don't think this is a valid approach. First of all, it would need you to know the total number of people per day $N$ , I assume you don't? Second, this assumes that one person can visit the store only once per day. Those constraints do not seem realistic. You would rather need a distribution for the counts, that is not bounded. For example, you could assume that the number of people visiting the store at the 8:00-10:00 time slot as Poisson distribution, with the average number of people shopping being equal to $\lambda_2$ . You could assume that the time slots are independent from each other--this is also not true, but makes sense that if visiting the store once, does not prohibit someone from visiting it at different time. In such case, for each time slot you would estimate $\lambda_i$ independently of other slots. For Bayesian updating, you could use closed-form Gamma-Poisson model. Of course, those are just trivial models, while in more realistic scenario you would need to build a model that takes different things into account (e.g. time of the year, day of the week, ongoing marketing campaigns, etc).
