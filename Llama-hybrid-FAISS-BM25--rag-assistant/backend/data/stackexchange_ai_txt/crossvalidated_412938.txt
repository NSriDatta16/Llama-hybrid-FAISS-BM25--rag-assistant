Not sure this is the most elegant way of doing this, but you can compare nested models (e.g. m2 would be the same model without one of the factors you're trying to estimate). Then you run anova(m1,m2). You can estimate the main effect of the missing predictor to the overall fit of the model. You'd report it as: χ²(Df)=Chisq, p =pvalue.
