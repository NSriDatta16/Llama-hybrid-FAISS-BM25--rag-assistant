The problem with the Cox model is that it predicts nothing. The "intercept" (baseline hazard function) in Cox models is never actually estimated. Logistic regression can be used to predict the risk or probability for some event, in this case: whether or not a subject comes in to buy something on a specific month. The problem with the assumptions behind ordinary logistic regression is that you treat each person-month observation as independent, regardless of whether it was the same person or the same month in which observations occurred. This can be dangerous because some items are bought in two month intervals, so consecutive person by month observations are negatively correlated. Alternately, a customer can be retained or lost by good or bad experiences leading consecutive person by month observations are positively correlated. I think a good start to this prediction problem is taking the approach of forecasting where we can use previous information to inform our predictions about the next month's business. A simple start to this problem is adjusting for a lagged effect, or an indicator of whether a subject had arrived in the last month, as a predictor of whether they might arrive this month.
