You can use this instead of the command line: string log = @"C:\Builds\tfsLog.txt"; string settingsFilePath = @"C:\TeamProjects\TeamProjectSettings.xml"; var batchTeamProjectCreator = new BatchTeamProjectCreator(); var succes = batchTeamProjectCreator.BatchCreateTeamProject(settingsFilePath, out log); you'll need to add a reference to this dll: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies\Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamFoundation.TeamExplorer.dll You will still need to use the xml, but its a bit more elegant. Hope this is what you where looking for. :) Good luck, Oshry
