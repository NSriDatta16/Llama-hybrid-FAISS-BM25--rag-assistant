You mentioned two alternatives already: Silverlight and Flash . It's safe to assume that ~95% people have Flash Player installed; Silverlight has also seen quite good adoption in this short amount of time. But jumping on the eye-candy bandwagon isn't necessarily going to make your site better. There will be issues with accessibility, search engines not being to properly index your content, users not being to bookmark pages they want to get back to. Rich graphics pages, although vector, take more to load and can often turn out just annoying (where the goal was visual appeal, the opposite happened). All these things can be worked around or even fixed, but it takes much more resources compared to using standards. All these things would apply even if there was some new technology that we "haven't read of" . HTTP is as slow as network connection is, not by poor design. It's actually very efficient. HTML processing is also blazing fast, considering browsers performed well enough for people using them even on sites with terrible, fat table-based markup. JavaScript scene is looking very bright; there is increased attention on the new version of the specs, multiple implementations, incredible speed advantages in modern browsers over the course of last year. And don't think only WebKit is fast -- Opera and Mozilla have never fallen behind. If you observe what was happening on the Internet in the last 20 years, you would have noticed that proprietary, vendor-dictated technologies eventually got pushed out by open standards. The only reason Flash Player survived was that JavaScript and open video codecs needed some time to get developed. Now that they are here, I think the same thing is going to happen all over again.
