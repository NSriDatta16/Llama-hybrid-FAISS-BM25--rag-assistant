Unless you're doing a specific type of development that involves mathematical calculations, most programming areas do not really require a lot of math knowledge (exceptions below). However, it's very common in hiring to look for a strong math background because there tends to be a high correlation between strong math skills and strong programming skills--good organization to solve complex mathematical problems indicates good organization to solve complex programming problems. There have been some studies that actually look at alternative ways to teach programming with very different results. For example, looking at correlations between creative writing and programming, look at people with very good creative writing skills, and teach them to program as if the program is telling a story, not solving a problem. This has shown to also produce very good programmers, often with a different take on problems. Exceptions to when math is really required is for things like video codec implementations, statistics required for advanced reporting, or any type of low-level 3D work not using an API that abstracts it all away (which is most commonly the case).
