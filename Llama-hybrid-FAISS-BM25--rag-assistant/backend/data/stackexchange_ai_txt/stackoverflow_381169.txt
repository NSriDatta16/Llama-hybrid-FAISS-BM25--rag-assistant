How to encourage non-anonymous editing on MediaWiki?

Problem At work we have a department wiki (running Mediawiki ). Unfortunately several persons edit without logging in, and that makes it very difficult to track down editors to ask questions about the content. There are two strategies to improve this encourage logged in editing discourage anonymous editing. Encouraging For this part, any tips are welcome. But of course there is always risks involved in rewarding behaviours . Discourage I know that this must be kept low or else it will discourage any editing. But something just slightly annoying would be nice to have. [update] I know it is possible to just disallow anonymous editing, but that will put a high barrier to any first time contribution (especially for people outside our department!), so I do not think that is an option. [/update] [update2] Using LDAP or Active Directory does not solve the problem since the wiki is also accessible and used by external contractors. [/update2] [update3] I am no longer working for this company. That does not mean that I completely have lost interest in this question, but from my current interest point the most valuable part is the "Did you forget to log in?" part below, and I will accept answers based on this part of the question. [/update3] Confirmation One thought was to have an additional confirmation step for anonymous users - "Are you really sure you want to submit this anonymously?", although with such a question there is a risk that people will give up or resist editing. However, if that question is re-phrased in a more diplomatic way as "Did you forget to log in?" I think it will appear as much more acceptable. And besides that will also capture those situations where the author did in fact forget to log in, but actually would want to have his/her contributions credited his/her user. This last point is by itself a good enough reason for wanting it. Is this possible? Delay Another thought for something to be slightly annoying is to add an extra forced delay after "save page" displaying something like "If you had logged in you would not have to wait x seconds". Selecting a right x is difficult because if it is to high it will be a barrier and if it too low might not make any difference. But then I started thinking, what about starting at zero and then add one second delay for each anonymous edit by a given IP address in a given time frame? That way there will be no barrier for starting to use the wiki, and by the time the delay is getting significant the user has already contributed a lot so I think the outcome is much more likely to be that the editor eventually creates a user rather than giving up. This assumes IP addresses are rather static, but that is very typically is the case in a business network. Is this possible?
