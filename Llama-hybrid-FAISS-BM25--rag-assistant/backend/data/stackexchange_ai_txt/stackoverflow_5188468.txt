This is what I use, but it's based on an API protocol that's eventually being phased out. It's also rate limited, I believe to 100 searches/day. In the below function, service is "web"; you'll need to get a key from http://code.google.com/apis/loader/signup.html (any URL will work). GetGoogleResults Then, you can do something like google str(google) will tell you the structure of the result. If you just want the number of results, you can use google$responseData$cursor$estimatedResultCount . As I said, this is based on a protocol that may go out of style some day. Per Dirk's answer, there is an alternate approach using a custom search engine that you can use instead, but it's also rate limited (if you want a function for this method, you can ping me at noah_at_noahhl.com). The final, and not rate limited, way is just to use RCurl to get a page from google, but it's pretty messy to parse, and requires spoofing a user agent to get around Google's attempts to prevent people from doing this. (I can also share this code, but it gets broken whenever Google tweaks any of their HTML).
