For a discrete random variable, $$\text{E}[X] = \sum_{\text{all possible } x} x\,P(X=x)$$ . If you consider the roll of a 6-sided (fair) die, then this is just a weighted arithmetic average . If $N: \text{number of dots face up after a roll}$ , then $$\text{E}[N] = 1\frac{1}{6}+2\frac{1}{6}+3\frac{1}{6}+4\frac{1}{6}+5\frac{1}{6}+6\frac{1}{6}$$ . For a continuous random variable, we use the probably density , $f_X(x)$ , which is a measure of the intensity (a derivative of a probability) but it is a similar idea. $$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\,f_X(x)dx$$ The intuition is that both are these are conditioning on all possible values of the random variable, $X$ , and weighting those possible values with the chance they occur. So, the expected value is an arithmetic mean . You can compare this mathematically with the geometric mean to see the difference. If this still isn't clear, feel free to comment.
