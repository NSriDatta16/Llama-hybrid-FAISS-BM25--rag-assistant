Good question! In short: it depends on your context, and risk tolerance :) Slightly longer: I think it's always good to push the envelope on early adoption of technology. It gives you an advantage over late-comers in the commercial world, and also gives you much more leverage in influencing the technology as it emerges. If you don't want to have to re-write code, or update your source, then early adoption may not be for you. It's perfectly respectable to want to write solid, stable code that never has to change, but it's entirely up to you (and your business context)
