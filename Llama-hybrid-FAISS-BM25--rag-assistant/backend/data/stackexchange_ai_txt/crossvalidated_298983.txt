Reinforcement Learning on Historical Data

I have been working on learning the optimal policy of communications for customers (which notifications to send, how many to send and when to send). I have historical data of past notifications sent (with timestamps) and their performances. Was trying to apply RL to this problem in order to learn the optimal policy. However, one key constraint here is that I do not have the luxury of learning the policy on the fly (on-line) as I do not currently control the actions (which notifications can be sent to what customers). I have two questions: Is RL the right framework under such constraints? How can we learn the optimal policy offline in such situations and how do we evaluate the same?
