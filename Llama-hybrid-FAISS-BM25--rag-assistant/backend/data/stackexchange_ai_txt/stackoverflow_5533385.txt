Usually there are 2 types of seed data required. Basic data upon which the core of your application may rely. I call this the common seeds. Environmental data , for example to develop the app it is useful to have a bunch of data in a known state that us can use for working on the app locally (the Factory Girl answer above covers this kind of data). In my experience I was always coming across the need for these two types of data. So I put together a small gem that extends Rails' seeds and lets you add multiple common seed files under db/seeds/ and any environmental seed data under db/seeds/ENV for example db/seeds/development. I have found this approach is enough to give my seed data some structure and gives me the power to setup my development or staging environment in a known state just by running: rake db:setup Fixtures are fragile and flakey to maintain, as are regular sql dumps.
