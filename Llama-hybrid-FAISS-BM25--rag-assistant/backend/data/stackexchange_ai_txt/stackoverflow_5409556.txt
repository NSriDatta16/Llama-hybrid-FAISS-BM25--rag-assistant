It is not possible to directly write into another app's file space. Your app has write access to its own space and external storage (SD card) with permission. However, I can imagine a couple ways to do this, depending on what you're trying to do, specifically. 1) Write the file to the SD card from one app. Have the other check if it's there and read from it when it opens. Make sure to write it to your own proprietary folder - don't clog the user's storage space. If applicable to your situation, delete the file and your folders on the SD card from the other app once you've read the file. 2) Register a custom BroadcastReceiver in the recipient app, and stick the data you need to transfer inside of an Intent that you will send from the other app. You should use your own action String so that no other application in the system attempts to use your Broadcast.
