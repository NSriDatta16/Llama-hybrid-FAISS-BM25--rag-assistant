I tend to stay up to date with the latests 'small' releases. For example moving from Rails 3.0.5 to 3.0.7 probably isn't going to be a big deal. (However, I'd still checkout http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/ for details). But it does mean that you'll get all the security and performance updates. But moving from 2.3 - 3.0 will require work! Which is why it always makes it easier to stay pretty up to date. As soon as you start falling behind it only makes it more difficult to upgrade in the future. Further, as long as you've got decent test coverage you can just update the version, run your tests and check if everything works.
