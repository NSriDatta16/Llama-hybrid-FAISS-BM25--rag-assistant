There's this recommendation that is valid for anyone learning anything new: keep it simple. In the case of web development, I would certainly vote against Silverlight, for a number of reasons. The first one you have already mentioned, it is very Google-unfriendly. The second one is that it is not an ubiquitous plugin: lots of people don't have it yet, and lots of people feel (rightly) scared when they get to a site and see this thing asking them to download and install a plugin. It gets even worst when you're talking about Mac and Linux users, lots of them don't even know what is Silverlight (just try among your friends). Another aspect is that, unless you have some very good design skills, or are planning to hire a designer, a Silverlight site has a big chance of looking ugly as hell. When you go for good old HTML you have tons of beautiful, free html and css templates out there , but that's not the case with Silverlight, AFAIK. Finally, if you really want to learn web programming, the best is to start with the basics, HTML, CSS and Javascript. In the case of Javascript you can skip learning all the gritty details, and go for jQuery, it will be a great stepping stone. If you really want to play with Silverlight and XAML I would recommend adding some pzazz to the site after it's up and running, but not upfront. For someone starting on web development, coming from the ASP.NET side, I would strongly recommend ASP.NET MVC, like the guy before me did: it is closer to real web development than webforms, and it promotes (though it doesn't guarantee) a more elegant architecture. I know that your goal #1 is to learn Silverlight, but I would hold on a bit and get the basics covered first. Now, when it comes to the specific Junior Women's Club site you mentioned, I would go for a packaged solution like DNN first; then, once everyone is happy and dandy (and it will take a while, you'll get an infinite number of requests once it's available, from font colors to new features to administrative tasks) then you can start working on your own pace and in peace on a homebrew v2. Another nice thing about DNN is that it allows you to code your own custom modules, so you can do some web development (including Silverlight) in small pieces, instead of getting bogged down on a huge project at once.
