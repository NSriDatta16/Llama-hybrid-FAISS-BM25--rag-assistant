Best way to import a website into a Visual Sourcesafe 2005 Database

What is the best way to import a website into a Visual Sourcesafe 2005 database? I tried opening a the VSS database and drag-n-drop the folder but it started prompting me for a comment on each folder. Is there a better way or someway to have it only ask onces for any files or folders that are being processed?
