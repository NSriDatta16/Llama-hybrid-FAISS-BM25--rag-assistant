Ajay, I wasn't able to find anything specific to just "USB Connected," but there are a few Broadcast Actions that may be of interest in this case depending on what you are trying to accomplish: ACTION_MEDIA_SHARED : External media is unmounted because it is being shared via USB mass storage. ACTION_UMS_CONNECTED : The device has entered USB Mass Storage mode. This is used mainly for the USB Settings panel. ACTION_UMS_DISCONNECTED : The device has exited USB Mass Storage mode. This is used mainly for the USB Settings panel. There doesn't seem to be a Broadcast Action specific to USB simply being plugged in, you could also try doing something with: ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED : External power has been connected to the device. But this would go off for both USB connected to a computer and USB connect ONLY to a power source... Interestingly, I also found this LINK simply stating that there was no Broadcast Action for "USB Connected". You may be out of luck in this case :-\
