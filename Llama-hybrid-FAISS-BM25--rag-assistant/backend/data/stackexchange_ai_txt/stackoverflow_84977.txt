At the basis there is no guarantee that such a thing will ever work perfectly. As long as the browser developers find ways to do their own thing rather than the 'standard' way of doing things, you will have differences. I've had positive results using the Yahoo User Interface Base CSS , but in the end even that couldn't cope with the more complex items that should be possible with CSS. In the end I went for a less-than-perfect solution and simply made my framework check if I had set up browser-specific stylesheets. Here's a PHP snippet to illustrate. Sorry for the language-specific solution, but I guess the idea is clear enough to implement in different languages: $sHTML .= "\t\t \n"; if (file_exists($sPathCSS.$sFileStyle."_".BROWSER_AGENT.".".$sExtension)) $sHTML .= "\t\t \n"; if (file_exists($sPathCSS.$sFileStyle."_".BROWSER_AGENT."_".BROWSER_VERSION.".".$sExtension)) $sHTML .= "\t\t \n"; With no missing files, no unrecognized tags or other code that might choke some browsers, the pages from the framework render as we want them to render in all browsers requested by our clients. More importantly, they do so without producing errors (i.e. an empty Error Console in FireFox) which makes debugging when you actually do run into an error a lot easier.
