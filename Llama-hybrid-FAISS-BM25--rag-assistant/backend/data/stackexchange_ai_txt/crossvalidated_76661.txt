Which principal components should I use?

Which components should use for plotting in a PCA analysis? Should it be component 1 versus component 2, or any combination that shows clustering is okay to use? Also, I have seen that in a few cases the axis labels mention the variance that is shown (e.g. it says "Principal component 1 (Var. 58.09%)"). Does this mean that in these plots only a part of the corresponding axis is shown (i.e. is it zoomed-in)?
