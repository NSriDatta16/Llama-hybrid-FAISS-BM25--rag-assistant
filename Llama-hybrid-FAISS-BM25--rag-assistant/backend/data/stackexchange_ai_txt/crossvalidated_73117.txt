Although I don't know anything about circuit design, I'm confused as everyone else why you would expect results to cluster around the average. The CLT has to do not with the shape (as many have correctly pointed out) but the probability of each a data point landing into a random a subset. If the underlying process had a bi-modal distribution, most of the samples would have skinnier peaks. If your random seeds determine the efficiency of their placement and there is some sort of upper and lower bound on performance then your numbers simply reflect the distribution of such locations.
