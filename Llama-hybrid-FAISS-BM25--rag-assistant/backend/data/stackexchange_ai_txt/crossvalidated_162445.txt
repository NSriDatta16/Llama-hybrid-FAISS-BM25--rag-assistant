Adding up regression coefficients in the presence of multicollinearity and reversal of signs?

My time series model suffers from multicollinearity between two independent variables. When taking one of the variables out of the model I obtain a coefficient of 0.08 for variable 1 but when including both variables simultaneously the sign reverses and I get a coefficient of -0.33 for variable 1 and 0.45 for variable 2. My professor said that if both variables were perfectly correlated the sum of both coefficients would be 0.12 and that 0.08 was therefore a sign for multicollinearity. Does anyone know a paper confirming what she said? Also when running the regression exluding variable 1, I was expecting the coefficient for variable 2 to be somewhat similar to the coefficient of variable 1 (using the same logic as above, i.e. adding up the coefficients should yield a coefficient that is similar to running the regression alone) but the coefficient is very different (0.3). Can somepne explain why this might be the case?
