There are really two dimensions to the scripting vs program reality: Is the language powerful enough, particularly with string operations, to compete with a macro processor like the posix shell and particularly bash? If it isn't better than bash for running some function there isn't much point in using it. Is the language convenient and quickly started? Java, Scala, JRuby, Closure and Groovy are all powerful languages, but Java requires a lot of boilerplate and the JVM they all require just takes too long to start up. OTOH, Perl, Python , and Ruby all start up quickly and have powerful string handling (and pretty much everything-else-handling) operations, so they tend to occupy the sometimes-disparaged-but-not-easily-encroached-upon "scripting" world. It turns out they do well at running entire traditional programs as well. Left in limbo are languages like Javascript, which aren't used for scripting but potentially could be. Update: since this was written node.js was released on multiple platforms. In other news, the question was closed. "Oh well."
