Not as far as I know... well, the theoretical limit would be the int32 limit for the array, but you'd hit the string length limit long before that, I guess... Just don't go mad with it ;-p It may be better to write lots of small fragments to (for example) a file or response, than one huge hit. edit - it looked like there was a limit in the IL (0xf4240), but apparently this isn't quite as it appears; I can make it get quite large (2^24) before I simply run out of system memory... Update; it seems to me that the bounding point is the format string... those {1000001}{1000002} add up... a quick bit of math (below) shows that the maximum useful number of arguments we can use is 206,449,129: long remaining = 2147483647;// max theoretical format arg length long count = 10; // i.e. {0}-{9} long len = 1; int total = 0; while (remaining >= 0) { for(int i = 0 ; i = 0; i++) { total++; remaining -= len + 2; // allow for {} } count *= 10; len++; } Console.WriteLine(total - 1);
