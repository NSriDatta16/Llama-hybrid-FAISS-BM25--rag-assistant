css refactoring tool

i have taken over a website that has tons of css files and lots of inline css as well. Is there any tool that can show me a visualization of how this stuff is organized as i have a strong feeling that. Many pages are bringing in more css than necessary Also, i want to remove all the inline formatting as well into css files. Is there any refactoring tool that does even this by itself?
