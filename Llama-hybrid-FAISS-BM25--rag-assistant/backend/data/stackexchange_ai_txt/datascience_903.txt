Analyzing A/B test results which are not normally distributed, using independent t-test

I have a set of results from an A/B test (one control group, one feature group) which do not fit a Normal Distribution. In fact the distribution resembles more closely the Landau Distribution. I believe the independent t-test requires that the samples be at least approximately normally distributed, which discourages me using the t-test as a valid method of significance testing. But my question is: At what point can one say that the t-test is not a good method of significance testing? Or put another way, how can one qualify how reliable the p-values of a t-test are, given only the data set?
