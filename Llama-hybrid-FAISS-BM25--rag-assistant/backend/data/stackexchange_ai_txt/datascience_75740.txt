Logistic Regression Multi-level Independent variables

im trying to study logistic regression, when i did the target variable with all features, i had the summary showing the p-values as usual, but one for the features has 60 level, another feature has 13 level, so how can i proceed with this kind of data, knowing that some of these level has significant low p-values but others dont, so i cant drop the feature completely for example below is a sample of the summary, please your advise Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 3.262e+01 3.241e+00 10.063
