What should be the optimal parameters for Random Forest classifier?

Currently i am using RF toolbox on MATLAB for a binary classification Problem Data Set: 50000 samples and more than 250 features So what should be the number of trees and randomly selected feature on each split to grow the trees? can any other parameter greatly affect the results?
