Most likely you are running out of a resource. Are your disks getting busier as you create these processes. Do you ensure you have less processes than you have cores? (To minimise context switches) Is your load average below 24? If your CPU consumption is dropping you are likely to be hitting IO (disk/network) contention i.e. the processes cannot get/write data fast enough to keep them busy. If you have 24 cores, how many disks do you have? I would suggest you have one process per CPU (in your case I imagine 4) Give each JVM six tasks to run concurrently to use all its cores without overloading the system.
