There are a few parts of your question I'd like to address: I have no information on whether these 5,699 students form a population or if they are samples from a larger population. They almost certainly should be considered a sample from a population. This is true for almost every dataset. Ask yourself this: Do those 5,699 students make up the entire population of graduate students in the world, throughout all time? If not, then they aren't the population. Even if it were, the entire point of statistical inference is that you do not have access to the population's data. If you did, you would simply compute the average years-to-graduation in each group and conclude, with 100% certainty, that "yes, they are different." There would be no need for a statistical test. should I perform the two sample t-test? Does it even matter since my degrees of freedom are so large? It's true that, with a large enough sample, the t-test and z-test are largely the same. I suspect that with a sample of your size the difference would be very small (unless the two groups are very unbalanced). However, I would simply run a t-test because this constitutes a more conservative assumption on the data. Does this mean I have check if the number of years to graduate is normal for each group (permanent, temporary) or do I combine the data and check to see if the years to graduation is normal? You would need to check the distribution of years-to-graduate in each group (2 distributions). Although you have a large amount of data and normality may not be a concern, the discreteness of your data (1 year, 2 year, 3 year...) may become an issue. If you prefer to use a numerical test rather than a simple examination of your data, I suggest the Shapiro-Wilk test , which you can perform in R: shapiro.test(myData) Where a p-value > 0.05 indicates weak evidence that your data are not normal . If your data appear to be nastily distributed or fail the Shapiro test, I would recommend a nonparametric alternative to the t-test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test , also implementable in R.
