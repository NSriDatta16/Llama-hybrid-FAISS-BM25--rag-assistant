On Intel hardware the BSR instruction is close to what you want - it finds the most-significant-set-bit. If you need to be more precise you can then wonder if the remaining bits are precisely zero or not. I tend to assume that other CPU's will have something like BSR - this is a question you want answered to normalize a number. If your number is more than 32 bits then you would do a scan from your most-significant-DWORD to find the first DWORD with ANY bits set. Edsger Dijkstra would likely remark that the above "algorithms" assume that your computer uses Binary Digits, while from his kind of lofty "algorithmic" perspective you should think about Turing machines or something - obviously I am of the more pragmatic style.
