Spline binary logistic regression in R

I am beginner in using R. I want to run a binary logistic regression and I guess some variables have nonlinearities. So I want to use splines method to understand affect of each range in a continuous variable. I am confused about it. How can I do it in R ? Knots (cut points) will determine automatically or I should determine manually ? How can I know overall p-value of variable ? model I do not know "rcs" is helpful or not.. I found it by searching here. I will be grateful if you guide me about it.
