(Disclaimer: I don't have the neural network toolbox, so I'm only extrapolating from the Mathworks documentation) It looks from your input parameters like you're using TRAINLM . According to the documentation, you can set the net.trainParam.max_fail parameter to change the validation checks. You can set the initial mu value, as well as the increment and decrement factors. But this would require some insight into the expected answer and performance of the search. For a more blunt approach, you can also control the maximum number of iterations by setting the net.trainParam.epochs parameter to something less than its default 100. You might also set the net.trainParam.time parameter to limit the number of seconds. You should probably set net.trainParam.show to NaN to skip any displays.
