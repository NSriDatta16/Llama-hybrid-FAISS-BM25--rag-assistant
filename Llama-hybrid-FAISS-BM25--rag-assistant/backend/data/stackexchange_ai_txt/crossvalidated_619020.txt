Finding support vectors by hand for SVM

The problem I am trying to solve goes like this: Consider the points $(1, 1)$ , $(2, 2)$ and $(3, 3)$ , of class $1$ , and the points $(4, 5)$ , $(5, 7)$ , $(6, 5)$ and $(7, 7)$ , of class $-1$ . Find the support vectors for a hard-margin SVM. I have to solve this problem without any compute help, and also quite fast. First I made a plot of the points. From the plot I can see that points $(1, 1)$ , $(5, 7)$ and $(7, 7)$ can't really be support vectors, which leaves me with $2$ points from each class. Obviously I need one support vector from each class, but the optimal solution could have $1$ vector from one class, and $2$ from the other. First I tried solving the problem by solving the primal optimization problem for the hard-margin SVM, with no succes, then the dual, again with no succes. I think I could solve this problem by solving the dual problem, but I am supposed to solve problems such as this one in about $10$ minutes (this is a training problem for an exam). I suspect there's an easier way that I'm not seeing, particularly because the course I'm taking didn't focus much on optimization. I tried to prove that some combination of vectors or another is the best, but I didn't reach a solution this way either. Online, I could only find problems where people claim that it is trivial to see which vectors are the support vectors, and then just give the vectors without any sort of explanation. I had a suspicion that the $2$ closest points(from different classes) have to be support vectors, but I wasn't able to prove it, and now I'm not even so sure of it. Any sort of help is appreciated!
