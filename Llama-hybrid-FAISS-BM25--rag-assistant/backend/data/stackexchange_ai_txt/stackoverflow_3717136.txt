PHP Debugging with Breakpoints - case studies, examples..?

I'd really like to get deeper into my php scripts and use things like breakpoints, as I'm doing with JS with firebug. I'd like to know more about what techniques people use, and some solid examples of how to debug with breakpoints a php project. Thing's I'd like to be able to see.. Properties of objects Class hierarchies.. where objects are coming from, file names etc.. (useful in ZF/Magento) Variables, types, content.. headers, post data, get data, session data, cookies.. Network / filesystem status.. I know a lot of this can be done with logging and print_r/vardump etc, but its a bit raw.. and I'd like to be able to use a "continue"/"step-over" etc command on code after hitting a breakpoint, like with firebug. from php.ini: zend_extension_ts = c:\wamp\bin\php\php5.2.11\ext\php_xdebug-2.1.0-5.2-vc6.dll; xdebug.remote_enable=On; xdebug.remote_host="localhost"; xdebug.remote_port=9000; xdebug.remote_handler="dbgp";
