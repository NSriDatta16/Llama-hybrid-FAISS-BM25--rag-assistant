It depends when the warning was written, but further down the paragraph it suggests: Be sure to turn off git's crlf munging: git config --global core.autocrlf false My guess it that it's a combination of line-ending conversion problems and msysgit not being stable when that bit of documentation was written. However, having myself only ever used git-svn to do an import from SVN to Git, and not two-way collaboration, it's possible that the warning is still valid.
