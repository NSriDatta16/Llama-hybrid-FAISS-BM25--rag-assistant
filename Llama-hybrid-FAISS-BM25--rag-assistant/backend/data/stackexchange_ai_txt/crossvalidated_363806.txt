These odds ratios are the exponential of the corresponding regression coefficient: $$\text{odds ratio} = e^{\hat\beta}$$ For example, if the logistic regression coefficient is $\hat\beta=0.25$ the odds ratio is $e^{0.25} = 1.28$. The odds ratio is the multiplier that shows how the odds change for a one-unit increase in the value of the X. The odds ratio increases by a factor of 1.28. So if the initial odds ratio was, say 0.25, the odds ratio after one unit increase in the covariate becomes $0.25 \times 1.28$. Another way to try to interpret the odds ratio is to look at the fractional part and interpret it as a percentage change. For example, the odds ratio of 1.28 corresponds to a 28% increase in the odds for a 1-unit increase in the corresponding X. In case we are dealing with an decreasing effect (OR The formula is: $$ \text{Percent Change in the Odds} = \left( \text{Odds Ratio} - 1 \right) \times 100 $$
