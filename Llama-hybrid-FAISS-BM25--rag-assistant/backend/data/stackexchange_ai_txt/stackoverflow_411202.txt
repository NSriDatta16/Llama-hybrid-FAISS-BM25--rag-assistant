Flex 3 - Launching a .exe file

i want to organize my ebooks. and want to create an air app that would have the list of my ebooks. i want it, that if i click that ebook name. i would launch/call the ebook file. just like double clicking the icon in a folder. how could i trigger that in flex? thanks. also, is it possible that if i saved the page number in my flex app.when launching the ebook file, i would go directly to that particular page?:D? thank you so much!
