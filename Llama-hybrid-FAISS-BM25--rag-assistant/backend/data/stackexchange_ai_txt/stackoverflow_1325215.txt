Since Telerik Report definitions are nothing more than pure C# / VB classes, you should be able to use any "standard" C# approach for including meta data with your reports. In your derived report classes, you can add any fields or proprieties you need to manage your settings, or you can try to create a more "elegant" solution by extending Report in your project. The current version of Telerik Reporting does not offer a native metadata solution for setting report attributes, but it is a very interesting idea. I have asked the Telerik Reporting team to weigh-in on this idea, so they should provide more guidance soon. In the mean time, I think you are on the right track with your planned "Report base class" that will make it easy for all project reports to set the necessary "settings" values.
