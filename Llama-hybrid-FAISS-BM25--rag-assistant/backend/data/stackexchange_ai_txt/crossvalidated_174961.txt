Proving a time series is stationary

I am trying to prove a time series is stationary and I think I am misunderstanding something. My question is $$\ X_t=U_1 sin(yt) + U_2cos(yt) $$ with $E[U_1]=E[U_2]=0$ and $E[U_1^2]=E[U_2^2]=\sigma^2$ and $y=(2 \pi w_0)$ is a constant. it was pretty easy to show that the mean does not depend on t, but then my book gave me the autocovariance = $ \gamma (h)=\sigma^2 cos(yh)$ and I am struggling to reach this. my thoughts... let $s=t+h$ $$cov(x_t, x_s) = E[(x_s - \mu_s)(x_t - \mu_t)]=E[x_s x_t] - 0 =E[x_s x_t]$$ so we need the expectation at two different time periods. I tried to $$\ E[x_t x_s]=E[(U_1 sin(yt) + U_2cos(yt) )(U_1 sin(y(t+h)) + U_2cos(y(t+h)) )]$$ but after continuing with this line, nothing came of it. I don't think we need to use trigonometric identities, so can anyone point me in the right direction?
