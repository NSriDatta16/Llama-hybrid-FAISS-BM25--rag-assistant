Consider a simple example, where you are trying to model salary (Y) as a function of years of experience (X) for employees of a large company. After exploring the data on a random sample of n = 50 employees of the company, you feel comfortable fitting a Gamma regression model to the (X,Y) data collected for the sample. Your first model assumes that the log-transformed expected salary is a function of years of experience: $log(E(Y|X)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * X$ Because X was not standardized in this model, you can interpret $\beta_1$ as follows: Having 1 more year of experience is associated with an multiplicative increase in the expected (or average) salary given by $exp(\beta_1)$ . Your second model assumes that the log-transformed expected salary is a function of the standadized years of experience: $log(E(Y|X)) = \beta_{0s} + \beta_{1s}*X_s$ Because X was standardized in this model, you can interpret $\beta_{1s}$ as follows: Having one SD more years of experience is associated with a multiplicative increase in the expected (or average) salary given by $exp(\beta_1)$ . Here, SD refers to the observed standard deviation of the variable 'years of experience' in the sample of employees. For example, if SD = 5 years and the estimated value of $\beta_{1s}$ is equal to 0.5, then you can say that having 5 more years of experience is associated with an increase in the expected (or average) salary of $(exp(0.5) - 1)*100%$ (roughly a 65% increase). As you can see, standardizing the X affects the magnitude of increase in the values of X that you will relate to a multiplicative change in the expected (or average) value of Y. The link itself affects what transformation of the expected value of Y given X you are modelling - in this example, you are modelling the log-transformed expected value of Y given X.
