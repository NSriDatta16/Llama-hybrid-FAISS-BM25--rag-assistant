It sounds like you have a working server-side script that returns data in response to well-formed requests, so it's a matter of getting your NSURLConnection to make requests in the appropriate fashion. If you have a known-good request, you can inspect on the properties of the NSURLRequest object you're creating ( HTTPBody , URL , etc.) and see where you're going wrong. Also pay attention to any error messages you might be receiving in your delegate methods (i.e., connection:didFailWithError: )
