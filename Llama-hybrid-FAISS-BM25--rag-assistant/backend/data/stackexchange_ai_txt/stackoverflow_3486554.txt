Tricky RegionPlot question (Mathematica)

I use the following to visualize the range of means when averaging n coin tosses as a function of n. p = 1/2; e = 1/4; pp[n_, x_] = CDF[BinomialDistribution[n, p], x]; p3 = RegionPlot[pp[n, n x] > p - e && pp[n, n x] For aesthetic reasons, I want that plot to be contiguous even though this range doesn't make sense for non-integer n. The solution above gives a "saw-tooth" appearance, but instead I want it to look like a step ladder, So, for any non-integer n0 the region would be the same as for the largest integer n not greater than n0, any idea how to accomplish this?
