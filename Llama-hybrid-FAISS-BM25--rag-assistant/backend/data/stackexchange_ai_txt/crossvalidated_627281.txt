The Bayesian would choose a prior distribution for p , the probability of flipping heads, which should be any valid probability distribution on [0, 1] . As long as a good prior is used, as the Bayesian observes and collects data, the Bayesian's posterior distribution will approach (heads ~ 1.0, tails ~ 0.0)
