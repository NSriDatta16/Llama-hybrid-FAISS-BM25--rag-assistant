Estimation is never correct, but it can be precise. Nothing along the lines of what you're asking for is specially developed for propensity scores; but when you view the problem as one of prediction, there's probably too many methods to count. Asking for test statistics is silly because you don't have a hypothesis. As far as plots, however, you can consider ROC curves, simple boxplots, or diagnostic plots related to the logistic regression model used to obtain the scores.
