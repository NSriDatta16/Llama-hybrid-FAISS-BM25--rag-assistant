What is the hypothesis test I've used, or what should I change to fit a "common" one?

I've had discussions with several professors, as well as scouring the internet (and chatgpt), trying to improve the description of the methods I've used, or to look for better ones. I'm hoping a wider audience might have some tips. I am trying to compare the performance of two methods of classification for a specific medical situation. My claim is that when the 95% CIs of the median performance metric overlap, the methods are equivalent in performance. There are a few challenges, including ones that make standard methods like Mannâ€“Whitney U tests impossible: There is no ground truth, so the classification metric is Cohen's kappa. For the current technique (sample A), there have only been a few (small) studies that have calculated kappa among recordings, and, even worse, access to that data is prohibited. This means that I only have summary statistics for the current technique. This technique is the gold standard (i.e. humans classifying the data using the agreed upon rules). But, two humans will disagree sometimes on the same data. For my technique, I do have a kappa value for each recording, so I can do any number of tests on this sample (sample B). But for each recording I can only calculate one kappa value (because each was only classified by one human). Given the limitations, I have done the following: For sample A, I have the median and 1st and 3rd quartile kappas, and I calculated the 95% confidence intervals by assuming normality and using the known IQR and sample size. For sample B, I have the kappa value for each recording, so I performed bootstrapping to get the median and 95% CIs. Using these, I found that the 95% CIs of sample A and sample B overlap, and thus I cannot reject H0. The professors I have talked to feel that the technique, while creative, is acceptable. My concern is that because of the limitations, there doesn't seem to be a simple name for the technique I've used.
