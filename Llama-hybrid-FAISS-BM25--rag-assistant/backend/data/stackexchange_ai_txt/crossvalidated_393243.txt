Why there is square in MSE (mean squared error)?

Please forgive me for such a beginner question, since I'm learning stats . & machine learning. I'm trying to understand Mean Squared Error. I understand the "Mean Error", the Mean of Errors between real and predicted values, what worries me is why we take square of errors? If it's just to keep the values positive then why don't we only take absolute values. I just want to understand what values does it bring to the actual loss function. Thanks
