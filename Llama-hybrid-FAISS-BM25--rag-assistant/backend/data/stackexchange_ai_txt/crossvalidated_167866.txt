Learning material for regression analysis

I found a lecture notes from regression analysis but it was quite hard to learn from it. Those notes were aimed for students who had read just basics of statistics beforehand. I have a background in mathematics, read basic course of probability and measure theory/real analysis but wrote my master's thesis from algebra so I can prove theorems on my own and fill the details of reasoning. But I would like to learn on my own what kind of methods I can use in particular situations and to improve my skills to have a job. I also like if there is some explanation why those methods work in particular situations. Those lecture notes had the following subjects: One and two way anova, one and several explanations linear regression model, logistic regression and applying regression model to analysing the trend and seasonality. What would one suggest to learn the topic on my own?
