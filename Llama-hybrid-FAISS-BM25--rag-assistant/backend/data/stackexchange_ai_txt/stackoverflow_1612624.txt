The answer depends on your context. Here is some generic advice: If there's one file per model, then you need to store one path on each model that has it. If there's one file shared by several models, but your objects are relatd on a hierarchy, you need to store it on the "father object" - the one that has_many others. The other objects will have to do self.parent.file_path. Finally, if there's one file used by several non-related models, then I don't know what to suggest, except that maybe there's a better way to organize your models. What objects are you trying to store, and what relationships are between them?
