Interpreting odds ratio of multiple comparisons from a logistic regression model (using R)

I recently ran a logistic regression on categorical data and ran a Tukey multiple comparisons post hoc analysis using the glht function in multcomp package. id.glm3 Where inter_MarEx is the interaction between marker type ( marker ) and time after exposure ( exp ) I understand that I must convert the coefficients from log odds ratios to odds ratios via exp(coefficient) and generally understand how to interpret them with mixed continuous. However, I do not quite understand how to interpret the odds ratio resulting from the multiple comparisons. summary(glht(id.glm4, linfct=mcp(inter_MarEx="Tukey"))) Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses Multiple Comparisons of Means: Tukey Contrasts Fit: glm(formula = detec ~ apptreat + inter_MarEx, family = binomial, data = indiv_detec3) Linear Hypotheses: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) EW 24 - EW 0 == 0 -1.5989 0.6196 -2.581 0.0937 . EW 48 - EW 0 == 0 0.9306 0.6190 1.503 0.6429 EW 48 - EW 24 == 0 2.5295 0.3575 7.076 Now I convert the coefficients to get the odds ratio from log odds ratio. Linear Hypotheses: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) EW 24 - EW 0 == 0 0.20 0.6196 -2.581 0.0937 . EW 48 - EW 0 == 0 2.54 0.6190 1.503 0.6429 EW 48 - EW 24 == 0 12.55 0.3575 7.076 How would I go about interpreting the odds ratios for the multiple comparisons above? For example, when comparing Milk 48 and EW 48 (odds ratio = 50.28), would I interpret the output as saying the odds of detecting EW at 48 hours after exposure are 50:1 greater than the odds of detecting Milk at 48 hrs after exposure? If this is incorrect, how should this be interpreted?
