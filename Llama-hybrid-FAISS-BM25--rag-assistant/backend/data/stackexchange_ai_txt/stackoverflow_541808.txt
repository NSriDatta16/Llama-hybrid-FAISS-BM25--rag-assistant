Best Way To Prepare A Read-Only Database

We're taking one of our production databases and creating a copy on another server for read-only purposes. The read-only database is on SQL Server 2008. Once the database is on the new server we'd like to optimize it for read-only use. One problem is that there are large amounts of allocated space for some of the tables that are unused. Another problem I would anticipate would be fragmentation of the indexes. I'm not sure if table fragmentation is an issue. What are the issues involved and what's the best way to go about this? Are there stored procedures included with SQL Server that will help? I've tried running DBCC SHRINKDATABASE, but that didn't deallocate the unused space. EDIT: The exact command I used to shrink the database was DBCC SHRINKDATABASE (dbname, 0) GO It ran for a couple hours. When I checked the table space using sp_spaceused, none of the unused space had been deallocated.
