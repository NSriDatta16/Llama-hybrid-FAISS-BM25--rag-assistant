There are "more statistical" ways, but they're not better. It's known as a "forecast combination puzzle", when a simple average outperforms other more sophisticated weighting schemes. I don't think there's a definitive answer to why it happens but you can find a lot of papers on this subject, e.g. "A Simple Explanation of the Forecast Combination Puzzle" Jeremy Smith, Kenneth F. Wallis My explanation is that your weighting schemes are based on the estimates themselves. You don't know the optimal weights, you must estimate them. This brings in the estimation error, which when combined with the individual forecast errors in aggregation increases the combined forecast error.
