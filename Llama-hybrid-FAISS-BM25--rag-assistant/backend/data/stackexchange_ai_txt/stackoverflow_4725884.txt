This issue seems to be getting a lot of attention, so I thought I would post the actual code I'm using with minimal scrubbing. This is in my seeds.rb file. min_sequence = 1000 case ActiveRecord::Base.connection.adapter_name when 'SQLite' select_current_sequence_number_sql = "select seq from sqlite_sequence where name = 'businesses';" set_min_sequence_to_ten_sql = "update sqlite_sequence set seq = #{min_sequence} where name = 'businesses';" result = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(select_current_sequence_number_sql) result.nil? || result.empty? ? current_sequence_number = 0 : current_sequence_number = result[0]['seq'].to_i if current_sequence_number
