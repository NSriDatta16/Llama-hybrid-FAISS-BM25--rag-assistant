what exactly is referred (in terms of maths) when we say that the neural net is learning the feature function? This is about representation learning . Deeper layers act as learning entities for new unknown representations: A central idea, referred to as greedy layerwise unsupervised pre-training, was to learn a hierarchy of features one level at a time, using unsupervised feature learning to learn a new transformation at each level to be composed with the previously learned transformations; essentially, each iteration of unsupervised feature learning adds one layer of weights to a deep neural network.[*] [*] Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives, Bengio et. al 2014, pdf .
