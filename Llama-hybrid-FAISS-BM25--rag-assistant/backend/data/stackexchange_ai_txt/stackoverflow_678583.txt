C# / Windows Forms - How can I determine if someone is currently "Dragging"? (not in DragOver event)

Assuming that I'm in a function that is called in a Timer on in Windows Forms class... how can I tell if the user is currently attempting to "Drag" something? example: public void SomeMethod() { // This doesn't exist of course :) if (Mouse.IsDragging) ... } EDIT: I should specify that I know that I can override DragEnter and DragLeave to set my own private variable... but I'm asking/looking for a '.Nety' solution if one exists.
