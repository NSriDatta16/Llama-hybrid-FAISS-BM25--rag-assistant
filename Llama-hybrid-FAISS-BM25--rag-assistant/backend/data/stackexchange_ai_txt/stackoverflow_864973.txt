you could set your own window name, the exact syntax escapes me right now, but you can use the current time and session id to create a unique id on window load, then use that id This would be done the same way you set a name in the javascript window.open() function, (but you can do it to self, instead of new window) googling shows: self.window.name = myclass.getUniqueWindowId( thisSession ); UPDATE Regarding your need to save this from refresh to refresh, i did some tests and it looks to save it from refresh to refresh. Using Firefox 3, on initial load, the window name is blank, and pressing CTRL+R over and over, and the window name was populated. i then commented out the setting the name code and reloaded and it still retained the name. alert( self.window.name ); self.window.name = "blah"; UPDATE I have to make noticed the comment below on jQuery's 'jquery-session' plugin, which really works and offers way more than what's discussed here. Although , one should also make it clear that it relies on HTML5's Web Storage, not supported by older IE versions. Corporate still depends heavily on IE 7 ('and below' here in Brazil). Based on self.window.name , THE solution for everything non-compliant to HTML5, I offer the following code snippet as a cross-browser solution: //---------------------------------------------------------------------- //-- guarantees that window.name is a GUID, and that it would //-- be preserved whilst this window's life cicle //---------------------------------------------------------------------- //-- window.name will be set to "GUID- " //---------------------------------------------------------------------- $(window).load( function () { //---------------------- var GUID = function () { //------------------ var S4 = function () { return( Math.floor( Math.random() * 0x10000 /* 65536 */ ).toString(16) ); }; //------------------ return ( S4() + S4() + "-" + S4() + "-" + S4() + "-" + S4() + "-" + S4() + S4() + S4() ); }; //---------------------- if (!window.name.match(/^GUID-/)) { window.name = "GUID-" + GUID(); } } ) //-------------------------------------------------------------------- I found the GUID function here (for which I proposed some code clean-up).
