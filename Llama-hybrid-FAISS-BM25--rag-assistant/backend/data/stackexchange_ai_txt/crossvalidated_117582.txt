Bayesian networks model dependencies of categorical variables (e.g. how the gender, level of education, religion, social class etc. interact each other). Bayesian hierarchical models are rather dedicated to parameter estimation. For instance, you have a population of students, you assume their age is distributed normally with some parameters $\mu,\sigma^2$, i.e. the age of the $i$-th student is a density function $f(a_i|\mu,\sigma)$. In the frequentist approach, one would just calculate average $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$. In the Bayesian context, you have to consider some prior probability density function $f(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and to update it to posterior according to Bayes rule $$ f(\mu,\sigma^2|a_i,a_{i-1}\dots,a_1)\propto f(a_i|\mu,\sigma^2)f(\mu,\sigma^2|a_{i-1}\dots,a_1) $$
