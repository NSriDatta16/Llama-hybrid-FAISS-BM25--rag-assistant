Stretch PNGs smoothly in Cocoa AppKit

In questions like this one it shows how to use UIKit's -(UIImage *)stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:(NSInteger)leftCapWidth topCapHeight:(NSInteger)topCapHeight to stretch a PNG easily, e.g when inserting text in an iChat like bubble. I would like to do the same on regular AppKit/Cocoa/desktop app using CoreGraphics or some NSImage related API but couldn't find an equivalent method. Does anybody know how to do this in AppKit?
