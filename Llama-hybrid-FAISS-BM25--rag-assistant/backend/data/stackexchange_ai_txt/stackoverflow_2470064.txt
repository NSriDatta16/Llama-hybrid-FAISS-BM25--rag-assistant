It sounds like you are saying that after compiling a WPF application many times in Visual Studio you receive an OutOfMemoryException error. Can you elaborate further on where exactly this error shows up? In the Designer In the output window etc ... It's possible that there is a bug in either a 3rd party hosted control on the designer or in Visual Studio itself. If you are not using any 3rd party controls then I encourage you to file a bug on connect for the issue. http://connect.microsoft.com
