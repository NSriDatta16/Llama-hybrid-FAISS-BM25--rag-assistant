In ecology and conservation, graphs are very commonly used to model animal dispersal, with the nodes representing actual locations in a landscape. I'm not sure I've seen a published real-world example, but it would be perfectly reasonable to use a directed acyclic graph to model something like a wildlife migration. Imagine a population trying to go from point A to point B, with multiple possible routes, including some that meet or branch. You can calculate things like the probability any particular nodes are visited, the expected number of individuals going through nodes, the expected time to reach a node, etc. If absorption is included, then you can also calculate things like the probability of survival and the expected number of individuals to survive. Add multiple states of absorption, and you can calculate the probability of mortality for different causes. This information provides managers a way to identify priority areas/paths/actions for conservation (i.e., what gives us the best bang for the buck for investing money/resources). The book “Finite Markov Chains” by Kemeny and Snell includes a bunch of these calculations using absorbing Markov chains, and I've implemented them (and others) into the samc R package . Here's a table of the various statistical calculations the package can do: link . My package documentation does tend to focus on spatial ecological applications, but it can be used for anything really. It also tends to focus on building graphs from raster data, but directly inputting graphs as a matrix is possible (eventually, I plan to add support for igraph inputs). Off the top of my head, hydrological modeling is another real-world application of these types of calculations; I think it makes perfect sense to think of river systems as DAGs. I could see someone modeling water inputs (e.g., rain) and outputs (e.g., city usage, farm usage, etc) to make predictions about downstream events like flooding.
