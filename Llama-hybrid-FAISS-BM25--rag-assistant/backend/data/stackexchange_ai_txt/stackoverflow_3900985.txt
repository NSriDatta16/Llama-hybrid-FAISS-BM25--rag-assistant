In php, how do I load txt file as a string?

I have a text file that contains paragraphs of text. I want to load it as a string in php, and then collect all the e-mail addresses within it as an array. However, how do I initially load the text file contents as the string? Restated, I have $string = **WITHIN TEXT FILE "user@domain.com MIME-Version: bla bla bla user2@example.com"; $matches = array(); $pattern = '/[A-Za-z0-9_-]+@[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.([A-Za-z0-9_-][A-Za-z0-9_]+)/' preg_match($pattern, $string, $matches); How do I load the text from the text file into the string variable? Thanks in advance!
