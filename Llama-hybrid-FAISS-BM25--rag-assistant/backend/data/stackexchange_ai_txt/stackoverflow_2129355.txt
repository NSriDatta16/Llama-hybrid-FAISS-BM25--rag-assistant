So, how do I reference MyTextBrush, while still retaining the x:Name property for the brush in this particular control template? Regarding this problem it sounds like you are using a dodgy/fragile template. What control template is it? If you have full source control of the template, remove references to the named element (most likely in a storyboard). They must be animating the brush for some reason. The other option might be to just create another unused brush within your template (Perhaps on a hidden element) with the correct name to keep the template happy. Lastly, you can try adding the x:Name onto the brush in the shared RD , but this is quite complicated and not sure its worth it! Two more potential solutions: Try binding just the Color property of the SCB... that should work as its a DP Change the template animations so they do not use a named brush, but instead use a named parent then access the brush via the TargetProperty e.g. Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Shape.Fill).(SolidColorBrush.Color)" Storyboard.TargetName="myNamedParent"
