Logistic regression is slow

I am relatively new to machine learning and I have a data classification problem where each sample has ~1500 features (continuous) and the category is binary. I want to apply logistic regression, for learning purposes. I have done a vectorized implementation in Python, which works very well and is fast on other datasets with a smaller number of features (order of magnitude 10s-100s features). On my dataset, however, I can't even finish the training (on ~3000 samples), as it simply takes ages. Could this be a problem of: 1) my vectorization, 2) the number of features in a sample (time for some dimensionality reduction?), 3) the fact that the problem is not suited to logistic regression, 4) using Python, or something else altogether?
