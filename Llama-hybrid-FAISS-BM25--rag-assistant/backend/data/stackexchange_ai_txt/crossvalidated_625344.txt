I think the distinction you're not making is for model correctness. Posit a probability model for child's weight. In simplest terms, statement 1 and 2 are equivalent only if : (1) $$ \text{Weight}_i = \vec{\alpha}_m \mathbf{X}_i + \beta_m \text{ Maternal Smoking} + \epsilon$$ Where $\mathbf{X}_i $ represents the baseline (non-smoking characteristics) risk factors for low birth weight including features such as maternal age, polybirth, maternal parity, maternal weight, etc. $\epsilon$ is a random error term. Here $\beta$ is the value of -200g with Maternal Smoking = 1 represents a mother who smokes. Subscript (m) denotes marginal effects. A more complex model may have: (2) $$ \text{Weight}_i = \vec{\alpha}_c\mathbf{X}_i + \beta_c \text{ Maternal Smoking} + \gamma_i \mathbf{X}_i \text{ Maternal Smoking} + \epsilon$$ Where the effect $\gamma_i \mathbf{X}_i \text{ Maternal Smoking}$ represents interactions between the smoking risk factors and baseline characteristics - high maternal weight and smoking may not have additive effects due to synergistic mechanisms like poor placental development, incidence of preeclampsia, etc. Subscript (c) denotes conditional effects. In this case, if one fits model 1 when in fact model 2 is true, it is possible through the balance of covariates that $\beta_m$ is estimated to be 200, and further it is true that the average gestational birth weight will increase 200g . It is not true, however, that any given mother who discontinues smoking will gain exactly 200g in counterfactual birthweight. She may only gain 50g due to the predisposition of baseline traits and their interactions, whereas another woman may gain 400g of birthweight by evading emergent delivery (i.e. preeclampsia). The average individual treatment effect of smoking discontinuation is given by $-\beta_c \text{ Maternal Smoking} - \gamma_i \mathbf{X}_i \text{ Maternal Smoking}$ . $\beta_c = \beta_m$ only if the matrix of characteristics is centered. This case is completely distinct from the notion that a mother, having all measured baseline characteristics held constant would, in a counterfactual reproduction, have a randomly distributed birthweight whose distribution is given by that of $\epsilon$ .
