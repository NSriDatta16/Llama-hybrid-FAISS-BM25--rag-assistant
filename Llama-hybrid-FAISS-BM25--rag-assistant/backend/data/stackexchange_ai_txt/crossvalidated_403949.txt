It will take many days for 800k on non-linear SVM. Start with smaller subsets of samples and move upwards. 1000-10000 for example. Look at how your target metric improves with increasing number of samples (learning curve). With only 13 features it is likely you will have diminishing returns way before 800k samples. Remember that you will need to tune hyperparameters also. Can usually be done on a smaller sample subset.
