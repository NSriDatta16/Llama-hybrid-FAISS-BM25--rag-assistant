Multiple choices here, since I assume the course's topics will be quite different. One of the best books, especially if you think you'll need to teach some Bayesian theory, is this: Doing Bayesian Data Analysis . Even if is "Bayesian-oriented", it aims to teach to a wide range of students; thus it starts from basics probability concepts, then go through inference and regression and provide a wide range of examples and the main differences between Frequentist an Bayesian approach. Give it a look. Other relly helpful books (but probably too advanced) are: Multilevel-Hierarchical models Regressions They both start from simple probability concepts and go on with regressions and inference. Also, they both cover the Frequentist and Bayesian approach and give different examples on social sciences (mostly political elections-referred). Hope I've been helpful somehow.
