Your problem is your first premise: a Client is not a Person (neither is an Employee). As you've correctly surmised a person can be one, both or neither. So it's not an "is-a" (inheritance) relationship you want here, it's a "has-a" (composition) association. We haven't been helped in this regard because what you're describing is a typical example that we are taught when we learn OO programming in college, from reading books, etc and it's not a good model. A Person has zero or more Roles. A Role could be a Customer, Supplier, Employee, Manager or whatever. If you follow that model through you'll end up with something far more flexible (and accurate). What I'm describing here is extremely common in CRM systems and tends to be referred to as a Party system. The general idea is: Parties are the key entity for a person or group of people; Partieis have two (or more) subtypes: Person and Organization are common; A Party has zero or more Roles; Sometimes Parties relate to each other but more typically Roles relate to each other. Example: Joe Smith is a Person, being a subtype of Party; Acme Corp is an Organization, being a subtype of Party; Joe Smith has a role of Employee; Acme Corp has a role of Employer; There is a Role Employment Relationship (a type of Role Relationship) between Joe the Employee and Acme the Employer. There are many variations on this theme.
