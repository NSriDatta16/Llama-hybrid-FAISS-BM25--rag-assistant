jQuery Deep Linking a Web App

Question... I want to build a one page web app that has deep linking (the url changes on click to where the user is loading) so the user can share links, bookmark, etc... The issue with the jQuery BBQ plugin is that it requires the href to have a hash in it like href="#/photos/1" That means I need to make sure every URL in my app starts with a hash. Also, it means non-JS browsers won't work since the URLs are all hashed. Is there an elegant way to accomplish a one page web app with deep linking that works seamlessly for JS & Non-JS browsers, and requires less code changes? thanks
