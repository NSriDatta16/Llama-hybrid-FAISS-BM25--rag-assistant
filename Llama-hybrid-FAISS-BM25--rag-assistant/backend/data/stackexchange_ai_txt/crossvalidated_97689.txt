Latent variables motivation for ordinal and binary logistic regression

The latent variable motivation for losgistic regression goes thus. There exist $Y^*=\beta^tX+\epsilon$ which is continuous. We can only observe $Y$ at specific thresholds of $Y^*$, say at $Y^*\leq \alpha_1$, $\alpha_1 Therefore $P(Y\leq j)=P(Y^*\leq \alpha_j)=P(\beta^tX+\epsilon\leq \alpha_j)=P(\epsilon\leq \alpha_j-\beta^tX)$ Assuming that $\epsilon$ is logistic then we have: logit$(P(Y\leq j))=\alpha_j-\beta^tX$ My question goes like this: With only one threshold say say $\alpha$: We get a binary logistic model of the form logit$(P(Y=j))=\alpha-\beta^tX$. and with $n$ thresholds for large $n$ we observe almost all of $Y^*$ so we can use ordinary least squares regression for modeling. Can someone illustrate to me in a nice way what we gain and what we loose for large $n$ and for small $n$ where $n$ refers to the number of thresholds?.
