Add some JavaScript to assign a unique ID or class to the element below the mouse pointer and then use the standard selectors with the QWebFrame to locate it. A more simple solution might be the selector ":hover" but that will give you a whole bunch of elements which you need to filter because the mouse always hovers over HTML and BODY and all the other elements which are stacked upon each other below your mouse. So if the mouse is over a span in a paragraph, you will get at least HTML, BODY, P, SPAN .
