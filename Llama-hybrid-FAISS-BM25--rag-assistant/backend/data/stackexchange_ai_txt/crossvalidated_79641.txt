How to measure test set error with logistic regression

In measuring the performance of a model, I divide my data into 2 sets, the training set and the test set, fit my model to the training set and then try to predict the results of the test set. If I'm looking at binary classification, I expect to classify my results into 0's and 1's. However, the output of the logistic regression is probabilities. So if I predict a probability of 51%, but I classify this as a 1 because it is > .5, and I get it wrong 49% of the time, isn't my model right as opposed to being 49% wrong? Would it be a better measure to check if my error rate is close to the expected error rate for the model?
