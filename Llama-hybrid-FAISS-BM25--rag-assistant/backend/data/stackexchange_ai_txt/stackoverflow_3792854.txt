Hierarchy level in UINavigationController in iPhone

Is it possible to decide the number of hierarchical level dynamically in UINavigationController in iPhone ? Actually, in my application I have to display hierarchical data but I don't know the number of levels at the coding time. The number of levels can be increase or decrease. The exact number of levels will known to me at the time of display. Please suggest the related code if possible. With regards, anurag85
