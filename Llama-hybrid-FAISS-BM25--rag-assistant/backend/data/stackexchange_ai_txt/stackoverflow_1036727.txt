Define every symbol as a command in LaTeX

I'm working on a large project involving multiple documents typeset in LaTeX. I want to be consistent in my use of symbols, so it might be a nice idea to define a command for every symbol that has a specific meaning throughout the project. Does anyone have any experience with this? Are there issues I should pay attention to? A little more specific. Say that, throughout the document I would denote something called permability by a script P, would it be an idea to define \providecommand{\permeability}{\mathscr{P}} or would this be more like the case "defining a command for $n$"?
