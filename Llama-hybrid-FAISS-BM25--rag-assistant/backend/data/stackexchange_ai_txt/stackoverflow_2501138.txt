'module' object has no attribute 'pcapObject'

I have the following sample code which doesn't seem to want to run. import pcap pc = pcap.pcapObject() dev = sys.argv[1] pc.open_live(dev, 1600, 0, 100) pc.setfilter("udp port 53", 0, 0) while 1: pc.dispatch(1, p.pcap_dispatch) I'm really not sure why. I'm using pypcap . I'm running this on both 2.5.1 and 2.6 versions of python (separate machines) using mac osx (leopard).
