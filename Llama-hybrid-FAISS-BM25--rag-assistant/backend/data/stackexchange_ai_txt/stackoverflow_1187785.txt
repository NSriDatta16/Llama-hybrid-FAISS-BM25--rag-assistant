I guess it depends on how accurate you want to be. I personally use minutes as "days" or "months" can be misleading time periods. For example if you say something will take 1 day - does that mean 24 hours solid work? Or 8 hours? Or the average 3-4 hours of productivity within a working day? All tasks should be listed, but if they are small you can often group them. But remember that just because it's only changing a label text there is more time involved that just changing the label, you have to find it, open the file, make the change, commit the changes, update any documentation, test it etc - so tasks very rarely only take less than 1 minute. Also try to put an upper limit on the task time. If your adding tasks that are taking over 3-4 hours, break them down into smaller sub-tasks and list those. This will give you a much more accurate estimate.
