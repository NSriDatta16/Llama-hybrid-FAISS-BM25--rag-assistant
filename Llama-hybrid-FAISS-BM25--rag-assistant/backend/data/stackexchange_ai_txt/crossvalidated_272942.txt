How to do multinomial regression when baseline choice percentage of one choice item is 0%

I am trying to find a clever way to analyze the choice ratios between a baseline condition and a different condition. Specifically, I have a baseline condition, where the choice ratio between two cells is let's say A/B. In another condition, the choice ratio between the same two items is C/D. Now, what I need to find out is whether (C/D)/(A/B) is significantly different from 1. The problem I have is that B cell has a 0% choice rate. In other words, the equation becomes (C/D)/(A/0), which leads to the conclusion that (C/D)/(A/0) is infinitely greater than 1. I tried to analyze this with multinomial logistic regression, which is unable to take care of this problem. Is there a clever way in which I can convert the choice ratios where the result is not "infinitely greater than 1", but a viable number?
