MySQL: Storage of multiple text fields for a record

An inexperienced question: I need to store about 10 unknown-length text fields per record into a MySQL table. I expect no more than 50K rows in total for this table but speed is important. The database actions will be solely SELECTs for all practical purposes (and searches will be done using an integer PK id only). I'm using InnoDB. In other words: id | text1 | text2 | text3 | .... | text10 As I understand that MySQL will store the text elsewhere and use its own indicators on the table itself, I'm wondering whether there's any fundamental performance implications that I should be worrying about given the way the data is stored? (i.e. several "sub-fetches" from the table). Thank you.
