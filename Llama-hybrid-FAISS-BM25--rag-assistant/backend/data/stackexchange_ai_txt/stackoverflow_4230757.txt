NSButton setEnabled not working

I am trying to start an application with every button disabled except for one. First of all, I've tried to set them to disabled through the interface builder and then set them to enabled when I need them to be enabled. However, when I call setEnabled: it doesn't actually enable them (I even did NSLogs to see if it was getting there!). Secondly, I also tried to initialize them to be disabled in the code (within the applicationDidFinishLaunching: method) and then once again set them to enabled, but that still didn't work. Does anybody have a suggestion to try and make them disabled/enabled when I need them to be? - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification { [loadImageButton setEnabled:NO]; [autoFitButton setEnabled:NO]; [estimateAgeButton setEnabled:NO]; [ageProgressButton setEnabled:NO]; } - (IBAction)loadAAMModel:(id)sender { ... ... if (waam.ModelLoaded) { [modelNameLabel setStringValue:f]; [svmLabel setStringValue:svmPath]; [ageTableLabel setStringValue:ageTable]; NSLog(@"model loaded...set loadImageButton to Enabled!"); [loadImageButton setEnabled:YES]; NSLog(@"loadImageButton set to Enabled."); } }
