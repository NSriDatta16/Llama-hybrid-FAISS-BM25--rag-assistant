Sampling a proposed value with a limited range target when running MCMC

I want to do an MCMC algorithm and need to sample a proposed value from a proposed distribution. In the Metropolis algorithm, people usually use a normal distribution as proposal. But if the prior distribution is a beta distribution. a realised value of a normal random variable may fall outside [0,1]. In such circumstances, how should we sample a value?
