Delphi Form Drag Lockup

Make a Delphi 2007 application, TForm as main window. Run application. Try to drag the form using the caption bar. The debugger shows an unending stream of error messages, complaining it can't find some unnamed routine. Escape and Break don't work. 3 finger salute doesn't work. Clicking in some other window and then back to the Delphi application stops the avalanche of error messages and allows the application to function in its original location (the form itself hasn't moved). Strangely, on occasion I've had related behavior using Firefox -- clicking in the browser window doesn't work 'til I click in some non-Firefox window, after which the browser window is active again. Anyone seen related behavior? Suggestions? Might it be a mouse driver problem? Toshiba laptop with ALPS touchpad mouse.
