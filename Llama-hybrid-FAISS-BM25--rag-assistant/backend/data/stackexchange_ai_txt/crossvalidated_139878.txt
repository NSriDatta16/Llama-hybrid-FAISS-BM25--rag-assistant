Discrimination between measurements made at different points in time

I would like to ascertain what variables discriminate best between experimental conditions in a repeated-measures experimental design. I have performed Repeated Measures MANOVA to determine whether the groups of measurements differ significantly at all and found they indeed do. I can get a rough idea of what variables have the highest prediction power, based on their Roy's greatest root value (one could have used another statistic, of course). I would now like to check this via another statistical analysis which would follow the MANOVA. Speaking loosely, I am looking for a predictive discriminant analysis analogous to repeated measures MANOVA. From what I have read on Repeated Measures (Longitudinal) Discriminant Analysis, it seems that it is used to discriminate between groups of subjects all of which have been measured on several occasions ( Sajobi et al., 2011 ; Lix and Sajobi, 2010 ; Komarek et al., 2009; Kohlmann, 2010). On the other hand, what I am looking for would discriminate between these repeated measures themselves, all of which included all of the participants (a single group). Brief two paragraphs in McLachlan (section 3.7.5, pp. 83-84) were too compressed to give any insight. References Kohlmann, M. (2010).
