How should I include Infragistics dependencies in InstallShield Setup Project?

I've a Windows Application in which we are using Infragistics controls. Now, we are creating its setup project using InstallShield. This is my first time with InstallShield. It seems we need to provide Infragistics setup in dependencies. I don't want to install setup or it shouldn't be. Can't it be done just provide Infragistics DLLs which we have in our Debug/Release folder? Please, help! Thanks.
