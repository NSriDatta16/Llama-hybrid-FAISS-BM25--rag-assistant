Windows services are not supposed to have ui. This includes consoles and messageboxes. With that out of the way... Have you considered hooking up an appropriate trace listener to System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceListeners ? Based on your command line you could add a MessageBox tracelistener or a tracelistener that dumps trace messages to a console? You'll be leveraging built-in debugging mechanisms that have been extensively tested and are, in their own way, extremely extensible as well. You'll also implicitly get to distinguish between messages that are displayed in release mode vs. messages displayed in debug mode (via System.Diagnostics.Trace.Write() or System.Diagnostics.Debug.Write() ).
