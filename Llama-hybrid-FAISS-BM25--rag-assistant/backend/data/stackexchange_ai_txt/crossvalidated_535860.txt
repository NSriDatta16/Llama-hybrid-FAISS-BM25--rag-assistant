This is a discussion from some points in Scortchi's answers. It is important and needs to be carefully handled. :) I highly recommend Re-cast the model if you have this warning. Double-check the correlation between all predictors to see if there are any very high correlated pairs, if so, remove one from that pair. In my real data, I saw a pair with a correlation close to 0.99, which means they are near a "perfectly" correlation. This triggers the failure of the algorithm. Sometimes, the algorithm cannot even estimate the corresponding coefficients. (a) I do not agree with @Simon that: "You're removing the predictor that best explains the response". Actually, in my case, I have "gross profit" and "gross profit + interest". The latter is not different much from the former because the interest of the firm does not change much over time. So using either (and just only) one of these two is good enough. I strongly oppose doing nothing (no offense). In my research, we did an intensive simulation to show that this warning actually provides some very off coefficient estimates. A lot of problems come when you predict, construct other statistics, conduct inference by using those point estimates. It is very dangerous to just leave them alone. I also tried Bayesian analysis, but it does not help in solving this issue (at least in my case). The point estimates are still problematic. All in all, I recommend doing something (re-cast the model with a better understanding of predictors) to remove serious multicollinearity ! I think this warning is mainly due to the inside algorithms' failure caused by multicollinearity (we all know that, as statisticians, multicollinearity is notorious).
