Putting a div on a new line (problem caused by floating elements)

So I have a 3 unordered lists like so: Title (Click To Download) Sample Song With the following css style: /* SITE MAP MENUS */ ul.menu { float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 10px; display: block; font-size: 13px; line-height: 24px; color: #898989; } ul.menu li {} .menuText { } li.heading { color: #493f0b; font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1px solid #d7d7d7; } However when I put a new div: The paganation would go here.. Instead of going below the lists it goes next to them. How would I fix this? (the class pleasedontfloat has no rules applied to it)
