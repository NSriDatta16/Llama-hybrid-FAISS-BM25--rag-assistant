It appears the solution to my problem is to change my approach. During my research, I discovered that for the Frame element in Main.xaml, the default JournalOwnership is set to Automatic . If I set this to OwnsJournal , the problem goes away. Apparently, if the frame is using the journal of the browser, weird stuff happens if you navigate via a [ScriptableMethod] . My solution was to change my approach to the problem.... which ends up being more simple and elegant. One thing to note is that when the Journal is managed by the browser ( JournalOwnership=Automatic ), you can navigate to pages within your control simply using the URL. Here's the solution I ended up with which allows me to have HTML navigation (outside my silverlight control) that will navigate to different pages in my SL control. Master Page (Plain Html with links to navigation) Profiles Scores Note, the PDMC.aspx is a simple page which contains my silverlight control object. Main.xaml is the RootVisual of my silverlight Control. It simply contains a frame which we will use to swap out views: Finally, to make the external links simpler and prettier, I added a UriMapper to my App.xaml: That's it.. a much simpler solution.. Hope this helps someone else down the road (and yes Im new to silverlight at time of this discovery :) )
