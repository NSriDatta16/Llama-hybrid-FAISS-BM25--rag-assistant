Magento: case/tiered pricing and being able to break out of case and price for individual skus

I am just looking for some ideas, we have a client that wants pricing by case which gets special pricing then if you are buying individually. so lets say the case quantity is 12 and you buy 3 cases, we could easily setup a tiered pricing scenario, if quantity > 12 price is x, if quantity is > 24 price is x, if quantity > 36 price = x. The problem is lets say they wanted to buy 3 cases and 3 individual skus. Magento's tiered pricing will not work with this because everything over 36 will have the same price. We would of just created a case quantity attribute and put that as a dropdown menu where it would list 12, 24, 36 and when they choose that, it populates the quantity field. Programmatically or out of the box, does anyone think there is a way to say if the user buys 36 the price per unit = x, if the customer buys 39, the price is x for 36 and x for 3?
