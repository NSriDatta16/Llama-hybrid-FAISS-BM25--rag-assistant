What you describe is basically a pre-image attack. You're trying to find an input such that, when it is hashed, the output has some property like "a leading 1".* It is an explicit goal of cryptographic hashes to prevent such pre-image attacks. If you can make such an attack, we tend to consider that algorithm to be insecure and stop using it. So while that means it's not impossible, it means your machine learning algorithm would have to simultaneously outwit a large fraction of the mathematicians in the world, and their super computers. It is unlikely that you will do so. However, if you did, you would become known as someone who broke a major cryptographic hash algorithm. That fame is worth something! *Technically a "first preimage attack" tries to find a match for a specific hash. However, to show that a hash algorithm has first preimage attack resistence, they typically show that you can't find any meaningful information about the input from the hash.
