Canonical correlation is not your tool, but possibly you don't mean that method because you also refer to 'correlation analysis' which is different. In the simplest case you have an instrument that measures satisfaction, e.g. a question in a survey, and you have 200 measures from employees and 400 from the customers. You don't have missing data unless the answers are coupled somehow. As @F.Tusell suggests, if the survey was given to the customer who complained and also to the employee that dealt with the complaint then they would be analysed together. As you describe it you just have data in two groups with different sizes. In the absence of anything coupling the two sets of responses you might be interested in difference between these two satisfaction distributions. One very simple but informative question might be: do customer and employee satisfaction levels differ on average? This is the sort of thing answered by a t-test.
