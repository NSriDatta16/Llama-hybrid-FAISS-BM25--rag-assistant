It is working now, but the mystery remains. Apparently a bellyful of Chinese buffet is the only solution to a problem like this, for once I had one, the problem went away. My test program was a single file with class Test { static void Main (string[] args) { . . // some logging attempted here. . } } When I had the problem originally, I was doing the logging within Main() . Afterwards, I created a method on the class Test, instantiated class Test in Main, and moved the logging to the method. This removed the problem: class Test { static void Main (string[] args) { var p = new Test(); p.Go (); } public void Go () { . // some logging here. } } This is still inconclusive. I moved it back the way it was originally and it began working. So, I must conclude that the answer to this conundrum is: Do not attempt first-time log4net test programs without a bellyful of Chinese food.
