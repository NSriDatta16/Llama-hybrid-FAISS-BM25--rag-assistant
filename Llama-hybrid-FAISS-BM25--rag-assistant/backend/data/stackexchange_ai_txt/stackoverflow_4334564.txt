How do I obtain for each distinct primary key occurrence in a table, the first of an ordered set of rows?

I want to obtain a specific set of results from a table in a single query and I'm not being able to find how to do it. I've a got a table recording every agent state change (online, offline, away, etc) and the time when it happened. I want to obtain for each agent id the last state change , i.e. considering agents A and B, I'd have the original table containing: ID | STATE | DATETIME A | Online | 29-11-2010 A | Offline | 30-11-2010 B | Away | 28-11-2010 B | Online | 30-11-2010 And I would want to generate an output like so: ID | STATE | DATETIME A | Offline | 30-11-2010 B | Online | 30-11-2010 I realize this might be a really basic select query, but I can't put my finger on what my be. Also mad props if it could be INFORMIX compatible :D
