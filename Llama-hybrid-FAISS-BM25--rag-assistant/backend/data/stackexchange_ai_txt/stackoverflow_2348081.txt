The quick answer is that you may have to declare a constructor in GUIListbox which calls SetupCallbacks . The reason is more complicated: because GUIListbox doesn't declare a constructor, when you declare an object of that type the GUIWindow constructor is called. When the GUIWindow constructor is running, the object isn't a GUIListbox yet. From the compiler's perspective, it only becomes a GUIListbox once the (empty) constructor for that class starts. So when the first constructor runs, the methods from GUIWindow are called. IOWs, this doesn't work, and will never work in C++ the way that you want it to. Here's a reference describing this pitfall in detail: http://www.artima.com/cppsource/nevercall.html . And here's an explanation from my favorite C++ resource: http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/inheritance-mother.html#fqa-23.5
