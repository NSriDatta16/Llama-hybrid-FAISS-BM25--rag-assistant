Multivariate model and large regression

I am not familiar with the concept of multivariate model and just learning about regression model. I am familiar with Autoregressive model and Moving Average. Multivariate regression model provided cues to look into what a multivariate model is but I could not follow the question as such in this thread. My problem is in the area of sparse regression which I understood as where the coefficient matrix has more number of zero entries. My first question is, the coefficient array should be a vector or why is it a matrix? Is sparse regression only meant for multivariate models? Can a univariate AR(100) be sparse if say 30 of the variables are non-zero lagged. Can somebody show the functional form of how multivariate model looks like and how is it different from sparse if there is any difference? Any references where I can find examples of sparse regression models and books which introduce the concept.
