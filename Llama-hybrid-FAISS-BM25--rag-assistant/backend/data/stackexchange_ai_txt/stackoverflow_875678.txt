Google Maps API - Slow loading javascript

I am using Google Maps API to display a map on a certain page. Problem is that the file http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api..... sometimes happens to load very slow - decreasing the page's performance, because the rest of the JavaScript is first loaded on document ready, which its rarely reaches - because the browser locks up waiting for the file from Google. I have tried to move the JavaScript file from the tag to under my content. But the rest of the JavaScript is never fired because the browser waits for the file from Google. Is there a way around this, or have anyone else experienced same problem? It began recently, and I have no idea why. This is my code, if anyone is interested: $(document).ready(function() { // Google Maps initialize(); // Other JavaScript comes here.... }); If I access http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&amp;v=2&amp;sensor=true&amp;key=ABQIAAAAa24xicak8_ghHX58i7La7hRFh9iM79SNC94rOejOtdMRvQmJiBS6Uv5F_1BNSh9ZuSzFXyekHISgew The file loads instantly.
