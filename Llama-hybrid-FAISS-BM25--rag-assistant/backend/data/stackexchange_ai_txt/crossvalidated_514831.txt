I think what you're missing here is conditional dependence, and what it is conditioned on. Suppose we have some Poisson distribution of known mean parameter $\mu$ . Then any two samples drawn from this distribution, $n_1$ and $n_2$ , are conditionally independent of each other, i.e. $$ \begin{split} P(n_1 \mid \mu, n_2) &= P(n_1 \mid \mu), \\ P(n_2 \mid \mu, n_1) &= P(n_2 \mid \mu). \end{split} $$ This is true as long as $\mu$ is known. Intuitively, if we know $\mu$ , then observing $n_1$ doesn't give us any new information about what we will observe in $n_2$ , because we have all the information we need already about the distribution from which it is drawn. However, you are describing the bar situation as if $\mu$ is unknown . You say, I think knowing the number of students arriving in the first few hours tells us something about how busy the bar will be in the next hour. Translation: Observing $n_1$ tells us something about the value of $\mu$ . Suppose $\mu$ is unknown. Then we can assume some prior, $P(\mu)$ , and we can update this prior upon an observation using a Bayesian update rule: $P(\mu \mid n_1) \ne P(\mu).$ Then $n_2$ is not conditionally independent of $n_1$ , because before observation of $n_1$ , we have, $$ P(n_2) = \int_0^\infty P(n_2 \mid \mu) P(\mu) d \mu, $$ and after observing $n_1$ , $$ P(n_2 \mid n_1) = \int_0^\infty P(n_2 \mid \mu) P(\mu \mid n_1) d \mu \ne P(n_2). $$ Thus, for unknown Poisson parameter $\mu$ , $n_2$ is conditionally dependent on $n_1$ . However, for known $\mu$ , they are conditionally independent. This is probably what your source means when it says that multiple draws from a Poisson distribution are independent. Intuitively, in your example, you are dealing with a Poisson distribution of unknown mean, and you are using an initial sample to hint you towards what the mean may be. However, if you knew $\mu$ in the first place, observing a time-interval sample would grant you no new information. Now, there may be other reasons why the students coming into a bar in non-overlapping time intervals may not follow a Poisson distribution. What comes to my mind is time-dependence, or people being put off from full bars. But I'm sure for the sake of an example problem, it's reasonable to approximate it as a Poisson distribution.
