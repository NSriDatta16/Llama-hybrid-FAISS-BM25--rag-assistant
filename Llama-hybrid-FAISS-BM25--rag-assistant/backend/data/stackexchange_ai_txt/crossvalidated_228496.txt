I believe that conditional logistic regression will give you the desired results. You correctly identify the need to use a repeated measures convention when analyzing this data. You have 5 respondents evaluated for the binary outcome of correct/incorrect face/object recognition over multiple conditions. The numerous responses from one person generate the need for a repeated measures approach. If your intent is actually better stated as whether the respondent chooses face or object, you could use the same analytic approach, but note that you would be interpreting the respondents choice not correct/incorrect classification. For a third category of "both" you would need multinomial logistic regression. I will assume you are interested in correct/incorrect classification in what follows. You state "Since every participant is measured in all 3 background conditions, it is a dependent design. Since, for one individual picture, I keep the noise constant over the 3 background conditions, it is somehow paired or matched." The conditions under evaluation, while limited in their value or quality, are not "conditioning" your analysis. The use of grey background, face picture with 45% noise is just one vector of covariates that present when a response is recorded. Grey background, object, 45% noise is another vector, while white, face, 10% noise is another. The regression will suggest to you whether background (dummy coded), noise or additional variables are associated with the correct response. The association between correct identification and change in any one value, holding all other values constant, is the interpretation of multivariable regression. Thus, you will obtain a sense of the association between background OR a one unit difference in noise OR whether a face/object was shown by using conditional logistic regression. Your model in R would be something like: install.packages("survival") require("survival") clogit(correct ~ background + noise + pic_type + strata(person), data) A more complicated model for each specific face or object among pictures could be considered, but you will dilute your ability to detect the desired effect of background.
