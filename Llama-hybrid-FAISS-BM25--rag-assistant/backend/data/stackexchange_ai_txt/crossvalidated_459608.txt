Bayesian ANOVA : simple main effect and post-hoc analysis

I'm conducting a two-way ANOVA with one within-subjects factor A (A1; A2) and one between-subjects factor B (B1; B2), but I would like conduct this with the bayesian approach. I did it with JASP. However, is it possible to compute simple main effect for Bayesian ANOVA ? If yes, how can I do it ? This option is not available in JASP, thus can I do it with t-test, as it's possible in frequentist approach when interaction is significant ? Or, is it possible to do it with R ? Moreover, I computed bayesian post-hoc in JASP and BF were the same than Bayesian t-test... So I did not understand why... Finally, my last question is about power. I don't have many participants, so how to know if my bayesian analysis did not suffer from a lack of power when BF shows anecdotical evidence ? I have read this article on the topic but did not find an answer : Jong, Marsman, Wagenmakers (2019) Bergh, D. Van Den, Doorn, J.
