weight training speed too slow in CNNs

I'm writing my own CNN code from scratch. Though I got fast, converged and satisfactory results, the trained weights change very little in value (while cost/loss function drops in time rapidly in a seemingly converged manner). My initial weights: convolution kernels as non zero unit matrices; fully connected layer weights as 0's. The activation function is sigmoid. The data scale from 0 to 1. Why do the weights change so little?
