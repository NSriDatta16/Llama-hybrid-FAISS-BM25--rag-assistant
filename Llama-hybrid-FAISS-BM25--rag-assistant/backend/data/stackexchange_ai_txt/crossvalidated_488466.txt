What is $\alpha$ in SVM Lagrangian fucntions

Is it a column matrix or a row matrix? I saw on a CMU slide that $\alpha$ is defined as $\alpha=(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n)^T>=0$ ? I dont see much of a formal definition for the exact form of $\alpha$ in the SVM Lagrangian functions, given that the data X is usually a matrix. PS: here is the link for that slide http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/Class/10701_Spring14/slides/SupportVectorMachines.pdf
