JQUERY FIND:FIRST not finding the first Paragraph?

Goal, is to extract the content for the CKEDITOR Text Editor, and then only obtain the FIRST paragraph. For some reason the bellow isn't working... Ideas? Given the following JavaScript: var newTitle = CKEDITOR.instances.meeting_notes.getData(); newTitle = $(newTitle).find("p:first").text();
