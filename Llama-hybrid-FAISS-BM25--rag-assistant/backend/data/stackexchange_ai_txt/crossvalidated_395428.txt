In case of few observations of a certain type, the best thing is always to gather additional data. If this is not possible you can rather discard these observations, or you can merge them into larger groups. So in your case, you could merge 'TL' and 'TR' to 'T' and conduct your analysis with that. df $x1 = as.character(df$ x1) df $x1[df$ x1=="TL"] = "T" df $x1[df$ x1=="TR"] = "T" As you still have only five entries for this new category, this is however also not a satisfactory fix. For logistic regression the concept of EPV (events per variable) is important. 'Events per variable (EPV) and the relative performance of different strategies for estimating the out-of-sample validity of logistic regression models.' Austin & Steierberg (2017) This article states that ' Differences between the bootstrap-corrected approach and the use of an independent validation sample were minimal once the number of events per variable was at least 20 '. In their experiment they therefore conclude that one should at least have 20 events per variable. You should take a look at the article.
