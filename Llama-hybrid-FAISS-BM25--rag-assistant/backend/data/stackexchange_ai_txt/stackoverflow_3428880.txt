Android: How to design to achive the "RadioGroup" effect?

I'm trying to design an Android layout that would look like the following: Entity1 option1 for Entity1 option2 ... optionN Entity2 option1 for Entity2 ... optionN Entity3 ... With the requirement that for each entity, one and only one option is allowed. And I decided to use radio button with the intention of using RadioGroup to enforce that. I designed as follows to achieve the above: ... And the pseudo-code would be: RadioGroup raGroup = createEmptyRaGroup() ... row = new TableRow(); row.add(TextView-entity1); row.add(TextView-op1ForEntity1); RadioButtton raBtn = createRadioButton(); raGroup.addView(raBtn); row.addView(raBtn); ... And the problem I'm having is that I can't group the radio buttons under one RadioGroup so that only one option is selected. At run-time, Android complains that the radio button must be a direct child of the row. If I add the radio button to the row first, then adding the radio button to the radio group first would then throw a similar run-time error. Can anyone advise me how to achieve the RadioGroup effect using the above design or otherwise? Thanks guys.
