Using a Random Forest for Time Series Data

This is a simple question, is it okay to use a Random Forest model on Time Series Data? I ask this because, in a random forest model, we perform bootstrapping of observations where we randomly sample from the training set with replacement. Doesn't this ruin the "ordering of observations" in the model, since it being time series data. I'm asking this with context to financial data, say I'm doing a classification type problem to buy/not buy an asset, and I collect daily data for some features to predict this variable.
