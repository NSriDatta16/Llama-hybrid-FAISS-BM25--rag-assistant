What you need to do is read up on NSHTTPCookieStorage and NSHTTPCookie . Documentation here and here . Here is some sample code on iterating through the cookies that your app has access to read/write: for(NSHTTPCookie* cookie in [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]) { // read and write from the CookieStorage } As the documentation points out, keep in mind that you only have access to your cookies and not any other app's, including Safari.app.
