What you have is a time series interrupted by level shifts . These level shifts are often (in your case definitely!) not known a priori. I suggest that you investigate by googling "automatic intervention detection". This and other intelligent searches for intervention detection in time series should yield some results. The bottom line is to characterize/model your time series with both ARIMA and outlier detection. Outliers can be either pulses, level shifts, seasonal pulses and/or local time trends. Care should be taken to investigate the detection of interventions both using the observed data to build an ARIMA first and alternatively subsequent to the detection of the interventions. You might review some of my other postings on the subject of time series ; Outliers ; Exception Reporting particularly Outlier detection for generic time series .
