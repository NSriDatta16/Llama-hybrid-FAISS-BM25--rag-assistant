Can I use ANOVA when participants choose yes/no to a four option IV?

I have one IV with four levels. Participants are asked if they prefer: Option 1. yes/no Option 2. yes/no Option 3 yes/no and Option 4 yes/no. So, this is a binary response, and as I understand you can't use ANOVA on a yes/no response. However, does it make a difference that each participant answers all four options? Is ANOVA a valid analysis to use? If not ANOVA, then what can I use? Ordinal logistic regression has been suggested to me, but I can't see "Preference" yes/no as a predictor variable?
