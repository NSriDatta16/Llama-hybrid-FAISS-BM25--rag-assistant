Discrete choice prediction

I have a set of images of same color cars which I have users rate on a scale from 1-5 (integers only) based on how attractive they think the car design is. For each image I have a set of parameters about the cars in question, mostly various ratios of dimensions (say height at middle, width at trunk, curviness of hood, etc). I first give the user a set of training images and have them rate them. I would like to use this training set to predict future ratings by a particular user based on the ratios of the car in question. While a number prediction would be great (ie a prediction of what the user will rate the car), I am also willing to settle on a predicting of whether the rating is above or below say, 3. I don't really have a background in stats, but I think this has something to do with logistic regressions and discrete choice? I was wondering what a good reference for this would be. To add a little more info, there are no strong individual correlations amongst the ratios and the users rating. Moreover, a linear regression is out of the question because there isn't a simple relationship between changing a particular ratio and the attractiveness. Moreover, I also do not want to intoduce too many ratios because then they become correlated with each other (say, height/width and height/length can give length/width upon division).
