If I were you, I would choose WiX as a platform for your installers for all these applications. Some reasoning behind this: it is XML-based, that is, friendly to source control, diffing and merging it has rich set of tools for most of scenarios you might need (harvesting lots of files, creating upgrades and patches, creating multi-lingual installs, etc.) it is free and open source it is production-ready (at least, version 3.0 - later versions are still in beta) it is used by Microsoft to create installations for such products like MS Office it has rich community at wix-users@lists.sourceforge.net and StackOverflow it integrates into the VS like a charm it is friendly to build engines like NAnt and MSBuild VS setup project is not my choice because: it is very limited in set of features- it encourages bad practices like Installer classes finally, it was retired by Microsoft I'm not familiar with InstallShield Limited edition, though. Hope this overview will help you finding the best option for your case.
