The implementations in Matlab are sophisticated and complete. I have found it to be sufficient for evaluating different types of networks. It is also very programmable using external interfaces. However, since the implementations of the algorithms are not open source, it is sometimes more difficult when you need to move a particular piece of code into an application outside of Matlab, as my hand coded implementations of different neural network types produced different results.
