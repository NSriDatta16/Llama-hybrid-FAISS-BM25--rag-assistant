Is VAE based on mean-field assumption?

According to the slides (section 6) , mean-field variational inference (aka. MFVI) assumes the latent variables ( $z=\{z_1,..,z_m\}$ are independent from each other, and on top of this assumption, we can derive the update rule for each latent variable distribution $p(z_i)$ using Lagrange multiplier, and then iteratively update all $p(z)$ using coordinate ascent algorithm. Given this definition of MFVI, I wonder if VAE is also using mean-field assumption, because in VAE each data-point $x_i$ has its own latent variable $z_i$ , and different data-points' latent variables are independent, say $(x_i, z_i)$ has nothing to do with $(x_j, z_j)$ . I'm not very sure if this understanding correct, since in VAE the latent variable $z_i$ is more like the local latent variable, whereas in the MFVI they are global ?
