How do you estimate the step-change in a time series model with a change-in-slope?

I have some count data, and have used poisson regression to estimate the time trend. An intervention is implemented at a certain time, and I have allowed a step-change and a change-in-slope at this time. I am trying to work out how to report the size of the step-change. Here is some example data (this is R code): d Here is a model with a step-change but without a change-in-slope: m $time, d$ count, ylim = c(0, 60), xlab = 'time', ylab = 'count') lines(d$time, predict(m, newdata = d, type = 'response'), col = 'blue', lty = 3) The step-change can be reported as 0.33 (95% CI 0.27-0.41) exp(cbind(coef(m), confint(m))) # 2.5 % 97.5 % # (Intercept) 23.4428917 20.468470 26.7581900 # time 1.0167337 1.009642 1.0238982 # interventionTRUE 0.3339105 0.269626 0.4134894 However, I also want to include a change-of-slope. Here is a model with both a step-change and a change-in-slope: m2 Now we have two relevant terms for the step change at the intervention. How do I report the size of the step-change and its confidence interval? exp(cbind(coef(m2), confint(m2))) # 2.5 % 97.5 % # (Intercept) 19.9406071 17.1744624 23.0535891 # time 1.0264078 1.0186741 1.0342461 # interventionTRUE 4.8906579 2.2085820 10.7974154 # time:interventionTRUE 0.9300491 0.9104426 0.9498756
