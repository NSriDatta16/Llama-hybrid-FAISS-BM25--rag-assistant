From Intel's software blog: Compare Windows* threads, OpenMP*, IntelÂ® Threading Building Blocks for parallel programming It is also the matter of style - for me TBB is very C++ like, while I don't like OpenMP pragmas that much (reeks of C a bit, would use it if I had to write in C). I would also consider the existing knowledge and experience of the team. Learning a new library (especially when it comes to threading/concurrency) does take some time. I think that for now, OpenMP is more widely known and deployed than TBB (but this is just mine opinion). Yet another factor - but considering most common platforms, probably not an issue - portability. But the license might be an issue. TBB incorporates some of nice research originating from academic research, for example recursive data parallel approach . There is some work on cache-friendliness, for example . Lecture of the Intel blog seems really interesting.
