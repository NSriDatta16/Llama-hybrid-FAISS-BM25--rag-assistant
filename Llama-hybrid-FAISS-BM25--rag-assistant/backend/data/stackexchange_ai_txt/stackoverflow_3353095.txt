You can use String.split or Android's TextUtils.split if you need to return [] when the string to split is empty. From the StringTokenizer API docs: StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.
