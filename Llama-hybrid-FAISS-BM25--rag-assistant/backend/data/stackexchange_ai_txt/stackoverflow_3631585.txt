The general consensus is that, so far, App Engine's BlobStore upload API will only accept multipart encoded POST data... in other words, an HTML input type=file form. Or, you can use Firefox to read a user's binary file (via drag and drop) with the FileReader API and reconstruct the multipart encoding manually. Then you can submit the data asynchronously with XmlHttpRequest. As of writing, Chrome and Safari do not support the FileReader object so they cannot break apart binary files and thus not send multipart encoding asynchronously. Note that the drag N drop + XmlHttpRequest method of uploading files to App Engine still works in all 3 aforementioned browsers if under 1 MB.
