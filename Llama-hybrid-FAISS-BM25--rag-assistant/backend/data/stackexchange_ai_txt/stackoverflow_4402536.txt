How do you avoid leaving debugger print/pdb statements in python open source apps when you're debugging them and just finish?

Sometimes when developing using open source software, you need to read it's source code (specially zope/plone). A lot of times I need to write print statements, or debug calls (import pdb), or comment try/except clauses, you name it. Sometimes I have a lot of files opened when trying to find an issue, and sometimes I forget to remove these print/debug alterations. So, my question is: how do you keep yourself organized when doing it? Do you write "TODOs" along the modifications and search for them later, do you keep everything opened in your editor and when you find what you were looking for you just revert the files (This approach isn't useful when you're searching for a really big problem that needs days, you need to turn off your computer and return the other day)? Or you just don't do nothing since print statements in development environment is nothing to worry about? I'm using Vim. I'm just interested to know how other programmers treat this issue.
