Correlation as a time series

I have been studying a few simple statistical models for (univariate) time series. From my understanding, ARIMA and its siblings are used to model the mean of a time series. Rather than a static measure like mean() , the result is a series estimating the mean. ARCH and its brothers are used to model the volatility of a time series. Rather than the usual sd() , the result is a series estimating the variance. Question What would be a credible model for the correlation of two time series? Notes While mean models explore the idea of regressing lagged values of the time series, volatility models (eg. ARCH model) explore the idea of regressing lagged residuals where residuals are the difference of a mean model to its original time series. In its general sense and for a variety of reasons, ARIMA and ARCH are superior models than rolling windows with mean() (popularly known as moving averages outside statistics world) and sd() . However, there is no such a thing for the correlation of two time series X and Y to my knowledge. The closest thing would be rolling a sad, straight window with cor() , Pearson's coefficient function in R, and work around the resulting series. A poor solution Trying to replicate Pearson's correlation model, p_(X,Y) = cov(X,Y) / (sd(X) sd(Y)) = E((X-mean(X))(Y-mean(Y))) / (sd(X) sd(Y)), to the time series world, I had the above without the intended success. library('forecast') library('fGarch') X
