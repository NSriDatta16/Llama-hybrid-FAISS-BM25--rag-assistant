It sounds like you have UU-encoded data (older method) or MIME-encoded . To deal with that, you can use Convert::UU and MIME::Base64 CPAN modules respectively. To use MIME::Base64 (or its pure-Perl implementation, MIME::Base64::Perl): use MIME::Base64::Perl; my $decoded = decode_base64($encoded); How do you know the difference? The modern MIME encoded text looks like this (Especially pay attention to MIME-Version: header which tells you it's MIME-encoded as well as Content-Transfer-Encoding header which tells you the encoding base - if it's not base64, you need a different CPAN module: MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="frontier" This is a message with multiple parts in MIME format. --frontier Content-Type: text/plain This is the body of the message. --frontier Content-Type: application/octet-stream Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 UU-encoded text would look something like: begin 644 cat.txt #0V%T ` end If the encoded data looks differently than either of the above samples, please post the exact format so we can determine what it is.
