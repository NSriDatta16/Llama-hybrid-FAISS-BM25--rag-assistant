As mentioned in David's answer, it's not recommended to put the config files outside of the WEB-INF directory. However, if you're looking for ways to organise your project, you might try creating a new subdirectory under WEB-INF. For example, when I'm dealing with lots of faces-config files, I'll create a directory /WEB-INF/config and put the faces-config files in there.
