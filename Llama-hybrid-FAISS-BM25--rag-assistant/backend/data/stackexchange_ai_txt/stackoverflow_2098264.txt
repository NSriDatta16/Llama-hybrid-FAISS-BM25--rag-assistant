Could it be because mod_perl 2 closes STDOUT? I just discovered this and posted about it: http://marc.info/?l=apache-modperl&m=126296015910250&w=2 I think it's a nasty bug, but no one seems to care about it thus far. Post a follow up on the mod_perl list if your problem is related and you want it to get attention. Jon
