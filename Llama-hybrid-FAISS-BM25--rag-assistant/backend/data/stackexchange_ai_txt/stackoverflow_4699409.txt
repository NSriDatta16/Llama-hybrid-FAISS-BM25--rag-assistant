android: ending activity from tab

I have 3 classes, let's call them 1, 2, and 3. Class 1 extends TabActivity and organizes the whole tab thing, Class 2 and 3 are just two separate tabs each with some lines of text. I call Class 1 from another activity using startActivityForResult. I then added an optionsMenu in class 2, and when user clicks the optionMenu, the following code is carried out: @Override public boolean onMenuItemSelected(int featureId, MenuItem item) { Intent i = new Intent(); switch(item.getItemId()) { case Result.NEXT_ID: i.putExtra(Result.PAGE_REQUEST, NEXT); setResult(RESULT_OK, i); finish(); break; case Result.PREV_ID: i.putExtra(Result.PAGE_REQUEST, PREV); setResult(RESULT_OK, i); finish(); } return super.onMenuItemSelected(featureId, item); } In my parent class (the class that called 1 to begin with), in its onActivityResult function, I want to get the data from the extras. However, the intent is always null, and I can't figure out why. When I call finish() on class 2, is it calling some other function in class 1? Do I have to transfer the intent data somehow? Here's the startactivityforresult, Result is Class 1 private void getResult(String result) { Intent i = new Intent(this, Result.class); i.putExtra(RESULT, result); i.putExtra(PAGE, curr_start_page); startActivityForResult(i, 0); } I also tried to put the optionmenu methods in Class 1, however, when I call finish(), it doesn't do anything. Edit: I think I should put optionsmenu in Class 1, since im starting class 1 in startActivityForResult. But how do I exit out of a tab layout? calling finish() in class 1 doesn't seem to do the trick.
