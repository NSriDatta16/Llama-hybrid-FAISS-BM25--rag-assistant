Learn Unknown parameters from Input,output and Known parameters - Online training

I am new in Machine Learning field and I want to achieve one task using Machine Learning, but I am not sure how can I do that. Please help me, I am trying to do following task. I have an external function (don't know its internal working) which accept input force ranging from 0 to 9.8 (it's gravity constant g ) and it produces output percentage from 0%-100%. This percentage will apply to real object and depend on the physical environment, it will apply some force that could be different than the input force. My objective is to get applied force near to required force. The external function uses some parameters to come up with the percentage. Out of those parameters, some are constants and some are variables which changes according to the outside environment. Using required force, actual gained force and constant parameters, I want to fine tune variable parameters. Consider following diagram for better explanation -------More simplified----- In below table I have KF(Known constant features) UKF(unknown constant features). Using all data collected i.e. Input, output, and KF(known features) find value of X,Y,Z. These X,Y, Z will not change. Input | KF1 | KF2 | KF3 |...| KF10 |UKF1|UKF2|UKF3 |...|UKF10| Output(achieve same value as Input) 0.1 | 5 | 10 | 0.5 |...| 80 |X | Y | Z |...| P | 0.1 0.5 | 5 | 10 | 0.5 |...| 80 |X | Y | Z |...| P | 0.5 2 | 5 | 10 | 0.5 |...| 80 |X | Y | Z |...| P | 2 4 | 5 | 10 | 0.5 |...| 80 |X | Y | Z |...| P | 4 . | . | . | . |...| . |. | . | Z |...| . | . . | . | . | . |...| . |. | . | Z |...| . | . . | . | . | . |...| . |. | . | Z |...| . | . 8 | 5 | 10 | 0.5 |...| 80 |X | Y | Z |...| P | 8
