No. Trying to predict a day's number of beachgoers on the basis of that day's temperature and cloudiness, when all you have is monthly numbers of beachgoers and corresponding monthly means of temperature and cloudiness, presents the same problem as when a researcher tries to make predictions about individual Americans using state-level data. You have only aggregate-level data, and hence no way to know how the number of beachgoers on each day within a month related to that day's temperature and cloudiness. The most you could do is predict a within-month average daily rate (that is, a monthly rate divided by the number of days in the month) on the basis of that month's average temperature and cloudiness. Transforming $X$ doesn't help. To make finer-grained predictions, you need finer-grained data.
