Yes, you can do that, but you should not do that . The problem is that publishing this while the constructor is still running can produce all kinds of strange side-effects, because some common guarantees don't hold true while the constructor is still running (for example final variables can seem to change their value while the constructor still runs). This IBM developerWorks article describes the precautions to take when constructing objects and the reasoning behind those precautions. While the article discusses the subject in the light of multi-threading, you can have similar problems in a single-threaded environment when unknown/untrusted code gets a reference to this during construction. (that last paragraph was "stolen" from one of my earlier answers ).
