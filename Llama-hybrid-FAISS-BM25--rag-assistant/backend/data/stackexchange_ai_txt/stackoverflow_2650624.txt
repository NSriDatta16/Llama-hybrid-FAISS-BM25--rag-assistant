Although not as direct as embedding comments, since functions are first-class objects in JS, you can specify arbitrary properties for them. E.g.: > function f(x) { return x * x; } undefined > f function f(x) { return x * x; } > f.comment = 'Hello' Hello > f.comment Hello This way you can embed metadata into function objects cleanly and portably.
