A few pieces of information can be gathered without too much trouble: Use GetDriveType to find the first removeable drive, test if writeable media exists (which will largely rule out CD drives). May also want to look at further strings that are available when you query the drive information via win32. Use libusb to see where the first storage class USB device is (will likely be a flash or hard drive) This C# article points towards win32 disk drive classes you might be able to tap into. Post your answer here when you find it! -Adam
