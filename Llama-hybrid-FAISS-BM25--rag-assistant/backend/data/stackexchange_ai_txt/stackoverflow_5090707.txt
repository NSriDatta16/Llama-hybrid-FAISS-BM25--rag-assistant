How can I get test coverage around AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas in ASP.NET MVC?

So I'm shooting for 100% coverage on an MVC3 site, and we're using areas. I can get coverage on everything else EXCEPT for this one line in Application_Start : AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas(); I've already thoroughly tested each area's registration, so this really amounts to an integration test of sorts, but I'd still like to cover this somehow without having to resort to a CoverageExclude attribute or lowering the coverage percentage. Note that unit testing this in NUnit this explodes with the following exception snippet: System.InvalidOperationException : This method cannot be called during the application's pre-start initialization stage. at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.EnsureTopLevelFilesCompiled() at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetReferencedAssemblies() Any ideas?
