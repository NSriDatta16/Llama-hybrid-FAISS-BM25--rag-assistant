Objective-C. Pay close attention to memory management, i.e., retain, release and autorelease. Took me about a month (part time) to get something that pretty much worked. And then another month to refactor after learning what I'd done wrong the first time. This was while the NDA was in place so it would probably be easier now. You need to join the iPhone Developer Program. Installing a development app is just a matter of running from XCode once you have you certificates sorted. (Check the iTunes Connect documentations. It's pretty good.) Installing on someone elses iPhone is a matter of figuring out ad-hoc deployment (hard) or uploading to iTunes (easy).
