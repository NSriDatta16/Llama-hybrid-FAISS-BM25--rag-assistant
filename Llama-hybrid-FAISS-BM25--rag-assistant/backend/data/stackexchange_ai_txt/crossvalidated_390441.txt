What does area under this density plot gives me?

I am new to data science and trying to grasp the concepts. I have a question in my exercise asking "what proportion of US states have populations larger than 10 million?". The density plot is shown below: What I did was assumed the region to the right of 10 million on X-axis as a right angled triangle. Calculated it's approx area to be (0.5*20*0.5) which comes out to be 5 . Now what does this 5 represent? Shouldn't be the area of any part be less than 1 as the area under the curve should be 1 . This is what I understood by listening to some lectures on edx.
