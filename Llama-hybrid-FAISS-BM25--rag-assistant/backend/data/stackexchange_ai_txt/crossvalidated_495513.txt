In case of normal NN, the weights and biases are updated during backward propagation. In CNN, apart from weights and biases does filters values are also updated? For question 1; In CNN, the filter values are considered as weights(+bias if set to have). So, as same as normal neural networks, the filters are updated(or optimized) as the weights are optimized during training. Related to first question, how the filters are chosen? "Filters are chosen" means types of filters are chosen. As per my understanding different filters extract different features of an image. As well as how number of filters are chosen. For question 2; Before training you can choose the number of filters for each layer, which is the output dimensionality, or the number of output channels. If you look up for the operation of CNN, you will understand why the number of channels is the same as the number of filters you set. Different filters extract different hidden, latent features of an image. Early Convolutional filters in the CNN models used in Image Segmentation are known to extract easilty noticeable features such as lines. Later filters detect more abstract features such as textures. The number of filters are basically the hyper-parameters that a researcher must set before the training.
