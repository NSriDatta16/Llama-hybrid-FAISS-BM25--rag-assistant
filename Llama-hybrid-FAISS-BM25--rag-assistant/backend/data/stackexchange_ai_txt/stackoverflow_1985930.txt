Server-sent email sporadically includes weird characters

For the past year at least now a good dozen or so of the users of my site have experienced odd characters showing up in the emails they receive. I've researched the issue numerous times and have pretty much written it off to be some sort of encoding issue on the users' end. That conclusion doesn't really sit quite right with me since I've never been able to replicate the issue. The odd characters aren't really even characters, they're a series of characters which represent high characters such as periods. =2e, for instance, appears where ever periods should appear. Some other character string appears for each line end. According to what I've researched in the past, this type of encoding is fairly standard and is called Quoted Printable and only very old email software is unable to read it. Each time this occurs I ask the same old barrage of questions about the operating environment the affected user is working with and they are never using an older client so QP should be rendered correctly. There is seemingly no difference between a recipient affected by the issue and one which is not. The emails that are affected are sent automatically by my web server and no special encoding is applied. Pretty standard sent from an ASP classic application using ASPMail by ServerObjects Inc. Anyone have any ideas what could cause this, or am I corrected in assuming its an end-user encoding issue not rendering properly?? A little update on this... I recently found out that if we are to send the mail from our server as plain text rather than HTML mail - the weird characters do not exist. This only occurs when HTML mail is sent.
