You can't know for sure that a class has the capacity to clone because clone() is a method from Object. The best you can do is to check if the class is Cloneable . Usually when a class is Cloneable it means that the developer overrode the clone() method. But even so, Object can't call this method. There is the reflection solution. But as the doc says : Even if the clone method is invoked reflectively, there is no guarantee that it will succeed. You can read documentation here , and there is a statement from Josh Bloch on this class (last paragraph).
