The literature you linked to and other references employ both a Bayesian and a non-Bayesian approach to solving the problem. In the lecture slides you can see that on slide 10 they start with a likelihood ratio test and this is not Bayesian. But on slide 25 (for example 2) they have switched to a Bayesian analysis. So the theory itself does not specify whether it is or is not Bayesian. The kinds of analyses that are done on the data in the context of this theory do. You don't need to be a Bayesian to talk about a loss function or even a criterion for decision making these analyses can either be done using a Bayesian approach or not. So the answer to your question is: Signal Detection Theory can be done with either a Bayesian approach or not.
