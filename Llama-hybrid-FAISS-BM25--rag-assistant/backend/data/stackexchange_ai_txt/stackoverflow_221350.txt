There is a line, somewhere... sharing library code is positively encouraged - but you need to be a little bit careful when apps consume each-other, simply to prevent spaghetti code and circular references. If the code you mention is really library code (i.e. neither project is the "master" for this data), then it should be fine (versioning issues aside). If it is the case that Project A wants Project B's data, then it usually isn't long before Project B wants Project A's data, and you have a spider web. In such cases, it may be preferable to use an SOA approach; have the projects expose their data via something like a WCF service, so that other projects only call into the public mex/wsdl API (ideally without assembly sharing). But it is a deceptively complex question, and I don't think any single answer can cater for every scenario.
