Variance-covariance matrix of logit with matrix computation

I'm trying to obtain the variance-covariance matrix of a logistic regression: mydata through matrix computation. I have been following the example published here for the basic linear regression X But then my var/cov matrix doesn't not equals the matrix computed with vcov() v == vcov(mylogit) 1 gre gpa 1 FALSE FALSE FALSE gre FALSE FALSE FALSE gpa FALSE FALSE FALSE Did I miss some log transformation?
