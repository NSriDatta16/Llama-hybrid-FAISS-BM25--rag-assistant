http header in a packets?

how to retrieve the http header in a packet in c++? any sample code or tutorials can be a big help!.. thanx!.. note: winpcap was used for the packet sniffing and these packets are already filterd to be only tcp and http/s protocols..the only problem is how to decode the packet's http header..
