What are you trying to accomplish exactly? Are you just trying to populate your user database with a bunch of fake/test users? Then simply do some logic to do so and save the models like you normally would. If you require the UI to be used, one option you have is using Django's test client which allows you to pragmatically write get/post requests just like you were to be someone browsing the web page. Hope that helps as a start.
