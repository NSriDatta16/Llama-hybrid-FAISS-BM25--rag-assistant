Yes - the problem here is that you don't have a unique ID for the resource because: products/cat1/cat4 Is actually the same page as products/cat4/cat1 (Presumably a view of everything tagged with cat1 and cat4, or all matches from cat1 and cat4) If your categories where organised into a hierarchy you would know that "cat6" is a child of "cat1", for example. So your two options would be 1) Enforce a natural order for the categories or 2) Have two different URI's essentially pointing to the same resource (with a 301 permanant redirect to your preferred resource).
