If I understood correctly, $f_{1}$ is a value which describes pixel 1 in an image which has a total number of $d$ pixels. Now you have several such images, which you call $f_{object1}$ and $f_{object2}$. In your description you do neither use the word time nor the word video regarding these objects. Therefore I would interpret that you have independent images - thus no time series at all. Yet I assume that you are actually meaning that $F$ is video which contains subsequent images $f_{object1}$ and $f_{object2}$, ordered in time. In this case: $f_{object}$ is not a time series, but an image. $F$ is a time series, a video, where N is the index of time. To be very concrete, you have a d dimensional array which changes over time. The time index is N.
