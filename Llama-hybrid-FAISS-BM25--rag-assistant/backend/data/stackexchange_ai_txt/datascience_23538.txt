CNN for ordinal classification

How do we design a CNN for ordinal classification? I am trying to analyze plant leaf images for diseases. I've got the disease type classification working. Now we need to classify the magnitude of the disease affliction on a scale of 1 to 10 (ordinal scale), where 1 is almost no trace of diseased parts on the leaf and 10 is completely diseased. Is it possible to construct a CNN for this task? How do I deal with the imbalance in training samples for each ordinal level?
