Don't ask a python programmer this question as the language doesn't have a switch statement and encourage the use of dictionaries instead. To answer your question, I can think of one case where a switch statement is useful. It is useful when the language / compiler / static analyzer can make sure that you're checking all cases. This works good with enums. If you add another item to an enumeration, you can now get warnings in all of the places where you are doing a switch on that kind of enumeration telling you that you're missing a case.
