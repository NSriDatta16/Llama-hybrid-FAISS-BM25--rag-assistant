In the past year you have had an average of $\frac{1000}{365}\approx 2.7397$ a day visiting the site, of which $10\%$ have downloaded the song, so about $0.27397$ downloads a day. Let's assume that each arrival is independent of others and each download decision given an arrival is independent of others, taking those to be the mean of a Poisson distribution for daily visitors and the probability of downloads respectively, going forward; this suggests a Poisson distribution for downloads as well. Then you get the following Number Prob visits Prob downloads 0 0.064588040 0.760352907 1 0.176953534 0.208315865 2 0.242402101 0.028536420 3 0.221371782 0.002606066 4 0.151624508 0.000178498 5 0.083081922 9.78069E-06 6 0.037936951 4.46607E-07 7 0.014848122 1.74797E-08 8 0.005084973 5.98621E-10 9 0.001547937 1.82229E-11 10 0.000424092 4.99256E-13 Depending on how you frame it, your confidence interval for the number of downloads a day might be $[0,2]$ or $[0,1]$. A $0\%$ daily download rate is by far the most likely outcome. A $2\%$ download rate in a day is rather unlikely, as you might need from $40$ to $66$ visitors that day (and some rounding), and a single download, and that is rather unlikely.
