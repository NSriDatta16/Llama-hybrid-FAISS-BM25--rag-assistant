I suggest you to use TFS 2010 and Visual Studio 2010 (if you are developing .Net Applications) You don't need to worry about SC at TFS. TFS stores everything in SQL Server DB. TFS works on a web server, so you can connect your source control where you want. WI tracking is a plus. TFS has an amazing WI tracking mechanism. You can customize your WIs if you want. TFS supports additional software process such as MSF, CMMI or Agile. Test capabilities of TFS 2010 is perfect. If you use with Visual Studio 2010 you can maximize your efectiveness with TFS 2010. Branching is allways annoying when the time comes to merge; but TFS 2010 allways helps you. You can track changes at your sources before branches and merges. TFS 2010 Build mechanism supports WorkFlow. So you can highly customize your build process easily; if this is not okey for you, you can use additional batch files (MsBuild). TFS 2010 has an easier administration operation then TFS 2008 and 2005. You can easily create build agents, machines, project collections, etc... TFS 2010 supports almost all MS products; such as MS Office. Excel has a great integration with TFS Or MS Project. Don't forget Sharepoint. TFS is not only a source code management system, TFS is a project management system, application lifecycle management system, workitem tracking system, and so on.. But i know you can not use TFS from MSDN Subs for commercial purposes. Because this is only for test and only 5 user can connect (i am not exactly sure) At least, you don't had to set up TFS on a dedicated server if you want (this is not recommended). You can set up on Win7 if you want and TFS can work on SQL Server Express So i suggest you TFS 2010. If you are developing .Net Apps nothing can be better then TFS.
