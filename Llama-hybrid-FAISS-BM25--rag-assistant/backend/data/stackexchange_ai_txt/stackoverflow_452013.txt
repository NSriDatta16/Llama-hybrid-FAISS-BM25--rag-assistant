disk based storage in mysql cluster

I have been trying to find out if it is possible to do table partitioning with disk based tables in MySQL Cluster. I want to store a large table on disk, and do range partitioning on the table. I have a feeling the answer is no. Thanks for any info you can offer. Mike.
