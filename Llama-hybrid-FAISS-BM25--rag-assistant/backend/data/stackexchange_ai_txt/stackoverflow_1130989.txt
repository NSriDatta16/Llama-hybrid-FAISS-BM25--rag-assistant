You can easily wrap what this article describes into a attached property/behaviours... ie. TextBoxManager.AllowDrag="False" (For more information check out these 2 CodeProject articles - Drag and Drop Sample and Glass Effect Sample link text ) Or try out the new Blend SDK's Behaviors UPDATE Also read this article by Bill Kempf about attached behaviors And as kek444 pointed out in the comments, you then just create a default style for textbxo whit this attached property set!
