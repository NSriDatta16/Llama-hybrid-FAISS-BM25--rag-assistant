How can entropy help in machine learning classification?

I cannot fully grasp why entropy is so important in machine learning classification. I understand the usage in decision trees but I don't see the importance elsewhere. I mean entropy somehow comes up naturally in decision trees but aside from that I don't see the importance at all.
