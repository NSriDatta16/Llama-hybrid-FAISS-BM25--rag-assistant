When finding the probability of at least $1$ thing occurring out of $X$ trials where order matters, why can't you do $P(1) + P(2) +\ldots + P(X)$?

Basically, I have a homework problem here along with the solution: However, I'm confused why I can't do it in the following way. Let's let C represent a crash and N represent not crashing. So this should be the set of probabilities where at least 1 car crashes: $CCC = (.0423)^3$ $CCN = (.0423)^2$ $NCC = (.0423)^2$ $CNC = (.0423)^2$ $CNN = .0423$ $NCN = .0423$ $NNC = .0423$ So if I sum up all these probabilities, it should be the probability that at least $1$ car will crash. However, it ends up being $0.132343557$ which is incorrect. The correct answer should be $0.122$ as noted in the image above, but I'm confused why this method shouldn't work the same.
