Empty Spacing Divs Disappear

not sure why this isn't working-- i have 3 divs where the two on the side are empty, and all my content in the middle. IE6 is apparently ignoring the empty divs, as the content is pushed to the left. Any ideas what the problem could be? .sidebar { float: left; width: 25%; height:auto; visibility:hidden; font-size:1px; line-height:0; } .main { width: 50%; height:auto; float:left; } ... I've tried putting empty comments instead of empty paragraphs in the divs, tried putting in the divs, anything the internet said to do, to no luck. let me know if you want to see the content in the main. Thanks!
