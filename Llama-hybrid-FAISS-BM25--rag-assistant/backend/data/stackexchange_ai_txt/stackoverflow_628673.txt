The only way would be to write a regular expression which parses out the javascript links and follows them. This would probably only work if the url to the page was in the javascript code, e.g: Something instead of just Something Because with the second example, you would actually have to process the javascript link using PHP, which can be very challenging. Keep in mind also that you would have to create website-specific regular expressions because each site formats their URLs differently. So Cnn.com might format their urls differently than Reddit.com
