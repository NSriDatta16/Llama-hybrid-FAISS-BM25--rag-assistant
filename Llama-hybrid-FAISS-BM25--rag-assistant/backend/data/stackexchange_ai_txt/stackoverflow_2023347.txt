Why is my SD Card not writable (Android)?

In the emulator I can't seem to write to the attached SDCard. The following code always spits out the "can't write root" log message, but not the "can't read root" one. File routesRoot = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); if (!routesRoot.canWrite()) Log.v(getClass().getSimpleName(), "can't write root"); if (!routesRoot.canRead()) Log.v(getClass().getSimpleName(), "can't read root"); Ideas?
