Let's say you are considering catastrophic health insurance, and there is a 1% probability of getting sick which would cost 1 million dollars. The expected cost of getting sick is thus 10,000 dollars. The insurance company, wanting to make a profit, will charge you 15,000 for the policy. Buying the policy gives an expected cost to you of 15,000, which has a variance of 0 but can be thought of as biased since it is 5,000 more than the real expected cost of getting sick. Not buying the policy gives an expected cost of 10,000, which is unbiased since it is equal to the true expected cost of getting sick, but has a very high variance. The tradeoff here is between an approach that is consistently wrong but never by much and an approach that is correct on average but is more variable.
