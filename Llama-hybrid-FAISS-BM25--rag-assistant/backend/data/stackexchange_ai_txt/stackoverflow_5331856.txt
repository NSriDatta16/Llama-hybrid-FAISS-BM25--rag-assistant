In Java, using == for non-primitive expressions will always compare object references . You're asking whether Password refers to the exact same object as the string literal "a". Use either: if (Password.equals("a")) or if ("a".equals(Password)) These will call the String.equals(Object) override, which determines whether two references refer to equal String objects - i.e. the same logical sequence of characters. The former will throw an exception if Password is null; the latter won't. Don't treat this as a suggestion to always use the latter form - if Password shouldn't be null, then an exception may well be better than continuing in an unexpected state. I'd also encourage you to be consistent with your variable names - typically local variables are camelCased, so you'd use password instead of Password .
