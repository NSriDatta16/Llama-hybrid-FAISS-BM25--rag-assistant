What is MYSQL Partitioning?

I have read the documentation ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/partitioning.html ), but I would like, in your own words, what it is and why it is used. Is it mainly used for multiple servers so it doesn't drag down one server? So, part of the data will be on server1, and part of the data will be on server2. And server 3 will "point" to server1 or server2...is that how it works? Why does MYSQL documentation focus on partitioning within the same server...if the purpose is to spread it across servers?
