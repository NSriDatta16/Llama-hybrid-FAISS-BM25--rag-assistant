How to export Visual Studio 2010 UML Modeling Diagrams

I recently created a very nice UML Class diagram inside Visual Studio 2010 (b2). The tools worked like a charm and I was able to model a rather complex domain within minutes. However, I cannot find any way to export my diagram as an image (PNG/JPEG/etc.). Does the modelling features in VS2010 support exporting diagrams as images? If so - how do I do it? Print src is NOT the answer. Edit: Found one way to export... Go to File > Print and select Adobe PDF Edit 2: Found another, slightly more elegant, way to export. In the diagram editor: Select all ( Ctrl + A ), Copy ( Ctrl + C ), Go to your favourite image editor (paint works fine) and Paste ( Ctrl + V ). Voila!
