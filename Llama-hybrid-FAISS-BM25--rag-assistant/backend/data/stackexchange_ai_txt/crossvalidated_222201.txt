Interestingly enough, we don't already seem to have a question on visualizing interactions with binary dependent data . The most interesting aspect of your question is that you have binary data. And a lot of it, so I'd recommend plotting the fits from a suitable model, for instance a logistic regression. Let's generate some toy data and fit a model (I'll use R, because I know it better): set.seed(1) nn .95 summary(target) model Alright, now we need to decide over which range of months and tenure we wish to plot the model fit. mm I see two ways of plotting this. Probably best to try both and see which one works best. The first way would be to plot a 3d surface: foo The second possibility would be to plot the response to one variable, say months, for different values of the other variable. I like setting the other variable to the quartiles in the originally observed data: probs Or of course, the other way around: plot(range(tt),c(0,1),type="n",xlab="Tenure",ylab="Fitted probability of target") for ( ii in seq_along(probs) ) { lines(tt, predict(model,newdata=data.frame(months=quantile(months,probs[ii]),tenure=tt),type="response"), lty=ii) } legend("bottomright",lty=seq_along(probs), legend=paste("Months:",quantile(months,probs)))
