Move list item to top of unordered list using jQuery

Lets say i have the following unordered list Hank Alice Tom Ashlee What im looking for is when i click on Tom, that it moves (animated and without dragging) to the top of the list (index 0). Ive considered jquery sortable, but i cant find a way to activate the moving part programmatically.
