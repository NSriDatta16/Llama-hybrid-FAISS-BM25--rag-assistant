Here's a quick macro that should do what you want - use with caution, and don't forget to backup! Set the value of 'search' to be the text that you're looking for. It's very crude, and will delete the paragraph if your text does not appear somewhere within it. Sub DeleteParagraphContainingString() Dim search As String search = "delete me" Dim para As Paragraph For Each para In ActiveDocument.Paragraphs Dim txt As String txt = para.Range.Text If Not InStr(LCase(txt), search) Then para.Range.Delete End If Next End Sub I've tried this on Office 2007. Bit scary, but seems to work!
