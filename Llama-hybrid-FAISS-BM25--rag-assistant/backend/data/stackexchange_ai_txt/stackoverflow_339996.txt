A solution for avoiding memory leaks with events is delegation. In a nutshell, you attach your event handler to a parent object instead of the children. Because of propagation, a click on a child will also register as a click on the parent, triggering your handler. By checking the target attribute of the event, you can then decide what to do with it. Since the handler is attached to the parent, you can add or remove children without worrying about leaks.
