Simple Liberty reserve PHP script for registration form

Hi I'm designing a script for someone that wants to have an online registration form where people can sign up for a certain event. There is also a cost to attend the event. So I need to have something where they can pay online. liberty reserve seems like the easiest way to do this. Can somebody show me how to design a script that forwards the person to liberty reserve to pay for the item and then sends them back to the website after they have paid? Thanks .
