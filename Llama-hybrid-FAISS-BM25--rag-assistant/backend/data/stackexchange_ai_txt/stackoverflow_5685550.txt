The advantages of Java ObjectStream serialization are: You have minimal code to write, and minimal thinking to do when designing your serialization format. Dealing with complicated (graph-structured) networks of objects is simple. The end result should be type-safe and bug-free (assuming that you don't implement your own custom read/write object methods, etc) The main disadvantage of Java ObjectStream serialization is that it is fragile in the face of changes to the classes that you've serialized. Dealing with this can be difficult. (By contrast, a hand-parsed text format is largely immune to this issue ... and problems are easier to fix.)
