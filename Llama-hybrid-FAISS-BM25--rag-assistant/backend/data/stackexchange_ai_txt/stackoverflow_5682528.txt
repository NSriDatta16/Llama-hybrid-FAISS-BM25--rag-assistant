How to do a partial CVS update

I am working on a project where I am responsible for 2 subcomponents. The project has many developers and the whole structure is organized by directory hierarchies where a root contains all the rest of the system. We use CVS. Since my job is focused only on the two directories, I just need to update all the rest with the CURRENT tag. There is this one guy who issues the CURRENT tag for the whole project. Ideally my two subcomponents should be tagged as often as possible such that one single checkout/update will bring the whole system including my two directories up-to-date. Unfortunately that's not the case. But I need the rest part of system to be up-to-date. I can not just issue 'cvs upd -r SORT_OF_CURRENT_TAG' at the root dir since this will probably compromise my part of the code if SORT_OF_CURRENT_TAG is behind. Is there a way in CVS by which I can do an update on part of the system and leave the rest(my part) intact? Thanks Bin Zhao
