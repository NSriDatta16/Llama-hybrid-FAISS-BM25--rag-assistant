Make container overflow its parent without making the parent bigger in IE 6?

I used the three column layout in A List Apart's "In Search of The Holy Grail" article for a store I'm working on that uses Magento. Inside the middle column, at the top, there's a container that I would like to overflow so it extends outside the middle column and goes over the top of the right column. Like below. _______________________________ | | | | | Middle/Top | |Left |_______________________| | | | | | | Middle/Main |Right| |_____|_________________|_____| The way I've got it works fine in all modern browsers, but in IE 6 the overflowing Middle/Top section causes the width of the Middle/Main section to expand an contain it. Does anyone know of a way to fix this?
