We use merge replication via RMO on 20+ client systems that are occasionally connected. As far as I know, you should go with pull subscriptions. I don't know if you could make it work with push subscriptions but I don't advise trying. As you say, the client system will be requesting the sync, which fits the definition of a pull subscription. The "Use When" section in your second link is pretty clear in its recommendation for push in this case: Data will typically be synchronized on demand or on a schedule rather than continuously. The publication has a large number of Subscribers, and/or it would be too resource-intensive to run all the agents at the Distributor. Subscribers are autonomous, disconnected, and/or mobile. Subscribers will determine when they will connect and synchronize changes. Most often used with merge replication.
