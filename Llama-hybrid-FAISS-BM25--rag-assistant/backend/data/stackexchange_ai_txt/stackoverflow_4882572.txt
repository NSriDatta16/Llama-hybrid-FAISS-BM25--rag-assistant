How to bundle an openframeworks application in xcode (relative resource linking?)

An trying to get openframeworks to build me my application so that i can open it from anywhere and it will load the needed images from within the apps Resources folder. I believe this is relative linking? I have done it before, on an older xcode and oF 61. To do this i dragged the needed images into the project file on the left and added it to the executable target, with in a 'build phase' -> 'copy files'. Been trying all sorts of methods, ofSetDataPathRoot() which solved the problem last time isnt working for me this time. Any ideas/help would be appreciated! Thanks
