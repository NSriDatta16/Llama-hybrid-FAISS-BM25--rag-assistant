Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD) is an algorithm for finding the minimum distance between multiple embedded words. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. For example: Source: "From Word Embeddings To Document Distances" Paper In your problem, it will allow you to find that "Tacos Mexican Restaurants" is similar to "Burritos Taqueria" even though they share no common string literals.
