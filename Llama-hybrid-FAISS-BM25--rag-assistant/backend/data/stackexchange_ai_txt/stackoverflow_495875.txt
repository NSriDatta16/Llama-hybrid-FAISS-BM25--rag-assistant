You could also use Path.GetFullPath , although (as with Dan R's answer) this will give you the entire path. Usage would be as follows: [IO.Path]::GetFullPath( "fred\frog\..\frag" ) or more interestingly [IO.Path]::GetFullPath( (join-path "fred\frog" "..\frag") ) both of which yield the following (assuming your current directory is D:\): D:\fred\frag Note that this method does not attempt to determine whether fred or frag actually exist.
