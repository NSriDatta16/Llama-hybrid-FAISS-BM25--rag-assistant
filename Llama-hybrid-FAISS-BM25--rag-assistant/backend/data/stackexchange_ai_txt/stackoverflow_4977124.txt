The Split method allocates memory for a string object for each element in the returned array. If you're going to run into a memory issue, it's going to be on that line. Since you're allocating memory for potentially 10,000 large strings at once, on a potentially fragmented heap, it's not surprising that you might come to a point where it just can't find enough contiguous space to allocate for the next string (which would result in the exception you are getting). Do you really need all of those strings at once? Or can you do something like this loop: Read one line at a time (or into a buffer) to build a string. Stop when you've found the first "chunk". Get the info you need from the chunk. (I'm assuming you don't need the whole thing, you're just interested in getting something out of it?). Continue reading the html (Restart at #1), reading it into the same string variable so that the first chunk can get garbage collected. If you can implement your solution that way, you're issue should disappear.
