UI Patterns in JavaScript

What UI patterns do you usually use in JavaScript? By UI patterns I mean best practices to be used to build and organize UI, generated/managed from JavaScript (apart from libraries like jQuery or YUI). For example, if you came from .NET world you are familiar with MVC (Model-View-Controller) patterns family. In the world of WinForms and ASP.NET you will meet Model-View-Presenter. In WPF most likely you will find MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) approach. And what about JavaScript?
