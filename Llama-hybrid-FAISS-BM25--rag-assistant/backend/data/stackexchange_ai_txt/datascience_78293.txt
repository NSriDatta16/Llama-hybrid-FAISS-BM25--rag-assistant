Defect Detection and Failure Detection/Predictive Maintenance are two areas of modern manufacturing and engineering where machine learning can provide substantial and even radical solutions. For example, intelligent systems may detect defects at an early stage with enough accuracy and generality so as to save both costs and increase reliability. On the other hand, intelligent systems may monitor operation logs of systems (eg an aircraft) and predict component failure exactly when needed with accuracy and generality so as to reduce downtime, save costs and increase safety. Both these approaches require sophisticated learning methods (ie machine, deep, learning) so as to handle complexity and at the same time be general enough and accurate enough for practical purposes.
