(1) Straightforward RECT rDesk = { 0 }; GetBystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETWORKAREA, 0, &rDesk, 0); RECT rWnd; GetWindowRect(wnd, &rWnd); POINT pttl = { rWnd.left, rWnd.top); POINT ptbr = { rWnd.right, rWnd.bottom); if (PtInRect(&rDesk, pttl) && PtInRect(&rDesk, ptbr)) // .... SPI_GETWORKAREA queries the desktop area (as opposed to the screen, which includes the Taskbar etc.) Replace GetSystemParametersInfo with GetMonitorInfo to support multiple monitors. (2) GetWindowRect Does the target window belong to an elevated process, or a process running in a different security context? (3) Other remarks For RegisterMessage , don't use such non-unique names. After all, it works systemwide. I make a point of embedding a GUID in their name. PostMessage has already been mentioned: it's asynchronous, and you can pass pointers cross-process. I don't see why you need to pass your window handle to some other, unrelated window.
