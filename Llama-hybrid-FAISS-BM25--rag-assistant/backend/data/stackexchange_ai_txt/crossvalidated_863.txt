Mike, I agree that an ANOVA based on total time probably isn't the correct approach here. Further, I'm not convinced that Chi Sqaure solves your problem. Chi square will respect the idea that you can't be in two locations at the same time, but it doesn't address the problem that there are likely dependencies between time N and time N+1. In regards to this second issue, I see some analogies between your situation and what people run into with eye and mouse tracking data. A multinomial model of some sort may serve your purposes well. Unfortunately, the details of that type of model are beyond my expertise. I'm sure some statistics book somewhere has a nice little primer on that topic, but off the top of my head I'd point you towards: Barr D.J. (2008) Analyzing ‘visual world’ eyetracking data using multilevel logistic regression. Journal of Memory and Language, Special Issue: Emerging Data Analysis (59) pp 457-474 https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/gmpm/ is a non-parametric approach to the same issue being developed by Dr. Barr If anything, both of those sources should be more than complete because they get into how to analyze the time course of the position.
