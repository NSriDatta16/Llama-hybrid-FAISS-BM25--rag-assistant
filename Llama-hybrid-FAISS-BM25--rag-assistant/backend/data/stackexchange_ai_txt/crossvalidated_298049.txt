CNN convolutional layer backpropagation formulas

I tried to implement a CNN in Java but I am stuck at updating the weights in my convolution layer. I tried to create the following image that shows how I calculate each weight delta and error signals: I searched the internet but did not find a solution so it would be great if someone in here could tell me what I did wrong.
