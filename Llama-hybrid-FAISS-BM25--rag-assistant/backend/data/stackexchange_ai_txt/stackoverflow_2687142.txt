The best way I have found to do this is to indicate the table column as a "fixed width" column so that the text inside it wraps. With the xtable package, this can be done with: align( calqc_xtable ) xtable demands that you provide an alignment for the option "rownames" column- this is the initial l specification. The section specification, p{1.5in} , is used for your first column header, which is quite long. This limits it to a box 1.5 inches in width and the header will wrap onto multiple lines if necessary. The remaining five columns are set centered using the c specifier. One major problem with fixed width columns like p{1.5in} is that they set the text using a justified alignment . This causes the inter-word spacing in each line to be expanded such that the line will fill up the entire 1.5 inches allotted. Frankly, in most cases this produces results which I cannot describe using polite language (I'm an amateur typography nut and this sort of behavior causes facial ticks). The fix is to provide a latex alignment command by prepending a >{} field to the column specification: align( calqc_xtable ) {\\centering}p{1.5in}', rep('c',4) ) Other useful alignment commands are: \raggedright -> causes text to be left aligned \raggedleft -> causes text to be right aligned Remember to double backslashes to escape them in R strings. You may also need to disable the string sanitation function that xtable uses by default. Note This alignment technique will fail if used on the last column of a table unless table rows are ended with \tabularnewline instead of \\ , which I think is not the case with xtable and is not easily customizable through any user-settable option. The other thing to consider is that you may not want the entire column line-wrapped to 1.5 inches and centered- just the header. In that case, disable xtable string sanitization and set your header using a \multicolumn cell of width 1: names(calqc_table)[1] {\\centering}p{1.5in}}{Identifier of the Run within the Study}"
