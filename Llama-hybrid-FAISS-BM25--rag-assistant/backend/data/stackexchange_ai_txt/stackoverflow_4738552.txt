If I understand you correctly, on a given DB system, in each "iteration" (1...N) you are loading a sequence of DataSets (1,2,3) and running queries on them. It seems like at the end you want to calculate the average time across all iterations, for each DataSet . If so, you actually need to have an additional column DataSet in your all_results table that identifies the DataSet. We can add this column as follows: all_results all_results DataSet iteration lines loadTime query1 query2 query3 1 1 1 100000 120.4 0.5 6.4 1.2 2 2 1 100000 110.1 0.1 5.2 2.1 3 3 1 50000 130.3 0.2 4.3 2.2 4 1 2 100000 120.4 0.1 2.4 1.2 5 2 2 100000 300.2 0.2 4.5 1.4 6 3 2 50000 235.3 0.4 4.2 0.5 7 1 3 100000 233.5 0.7 8.3 6.7 8 2 3 100000 300.1 0.9 0.5 4.4 9 3 3 50000 100.2 0.4 9.2 1.2 Now you can use the ddply function from the plyr package to easily extract the averages for the load and query times for each DataSet. > ddply(all_results, .(DataSet), colwise(mean, .(loadTime, query1, query2))) DataSet loadTime query1 query2 1 1 158.1000 0.4333333 5.7 2 2 236.8000 0.4000000 3.4 3 3 155.2667 0.3333333 5.9 Incidentally, I highly recommend you look at Hadley Wickham's plyr package for a rich set of data-manipulation functions
