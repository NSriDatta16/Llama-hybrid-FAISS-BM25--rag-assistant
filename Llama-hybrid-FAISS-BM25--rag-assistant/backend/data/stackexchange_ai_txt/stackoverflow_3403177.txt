In what context are angle brackets escaped with backslashes?

a bit of unusual question - in what context are angle brackets escaped with backslashes? I am sending an XML document (as a string xsd type) through a web service, which saves it to database, but there I see all XML's angle brackets escaped with a backslash, so I am wondering where exactly (Java XML creation using DocumentBuilder and Transformer, Web services stack, saving to database, or some other?) it gets escaped? Example: intended XML: 1 actual result: \ \ \ 1\ \
