iOS: how to change the size of the UIScrollView content?

I'm now trying to create my own Text panel (with code highlighting and so on). In fact everything is ready except one thing - scrolling What I've done: created UIScrollView and inserted my own view as a subview using Interface builder. in ViewController viewDidLoad method I've pointed initial textfield size to be the UIScrollView content size. And when user writes too much into my text field. I call delegate (which is ViewController ) to change size. To do that I simply write [scrollView setContentSize:newSize]; And what I get is increasing of the scroll view but not my text field - just blank lines appears. I think I need to set my view's size too but I can't figure out how... And a second part of my question: Every time I call [textField setNeedsDisplay] it calls drawRect: method with rectangle which is equal to the whole size of my view (which is much bigger than it's visible part). What will it look like if I try to use my view to modify file which size is more than 3 mb? How can I force it to redraw only visible part? Thanks for your attention.
