How much Organic Search impacts on sites access

I was wondering how much does organic searches, on google specially, impacts on visits for a website, in general? I've been looking for some reliable source, with statistics, can't find it, though. I'd like to be able to say "Today, xx% of site visits come from organic searches", with some reference backing the information. Thank you
