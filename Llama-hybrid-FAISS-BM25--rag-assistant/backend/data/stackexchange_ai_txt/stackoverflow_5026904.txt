iPad open a modalViewController at application launch

here is my problem: I have an iPad application based on a SplitViewController. When I launch the application, since it always starts in portrait mode, only the Detail pane is shown. All right. I want now open a modalViewController at the application launch for login purpose, but I am not able to find out the right way. I grasp on the web the following code: SampleModalViewController *sampleView = [[[SampleModalViewController alloc] init] autorelease]; [sampleView setModalTransitionStyle:UIModalTransitionStylePartialCurl]; [self presentModalViewController:sampleView animated:YES]; and it runs nicely, but where do I have to place it in order to have the modal controller displayed at startup? I tried to override viewDidLoad in the DetailViewController, but it does not work. Thanks for your help! Roberto
