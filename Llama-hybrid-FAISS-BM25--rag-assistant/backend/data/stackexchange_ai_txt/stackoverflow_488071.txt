C# constructors with same parameter signatures

I'm sure this must be a common problem. I've got a class that in an ideal world would have the following constructors public Thing(string connectionString) public Thing(string fileName) Obviously this isn't allowed because the signatures are the same. Does anybody know of an elegant solution to this problem?
