What is max_trials and executions_per_trial in keras-tuner

I am wondering what is the difference between max_trials & executions_per_trial in kerastuner.tuners.bayesian.BayesianOptimization function. Does execution_per_trial somehow relates to cross valdation? max_trails at first sounds like number of epochs to train but its not the case since there we have a another attribute for that. I didn't get much from the original documentation found here You should specify the model-building function, the name of the objective to optimize (whether to minimize or maximize is automatically inferred for built-in metrics), the total number of trials (max_trials) to test, and the number of models that should be built and fit for each trial (executions_per_trial).
