Speech recognition is really fuzzy pattern-matching, so how about looking into artificial neural networks as they're extremely good at pattern matching. Ensure that the audio's in a nice simple format and trim to syllables/words. Train the network on these files and then find a way to split the files you record in code. It may be simplest to start with a very limited vocabulary (individual letters maybe) as a proof of concept. Be prepared to run computers overnight to train the networks and try to get access to a high performance cluster.
