how to properly use the layout/template breakdown correctly What you need to know is the folder structure of the Magento & the use of its own MVC structure. This is a very very important part to get you started from the basic roots. Whatever version you use, the folder structure & the MVC structure followed by Magento will almost never change. Try to follow the Magento's own Knowledge Base & Wiki tutorials. If you want you can also follow some other sites as well. how to add custom model/controller functionality to the application without hacking away at Magento's core code base You will need to use the custom module functionality to override the core code base of model / controller. It's a simple process of writing the main logic in a XML file, of what core class you want to override of Magento, in your module's "etc" folder. Try to understand the process first, from the Knowledge Base & Wiki tutorials, to get a firm grip on overriding core classes. I hope this helps.
