In-memory databases are roughly at least an order of magnitude faster than traditional RDBMS for general purpose (read side) queries. Most are disk backed providing the very same consistency as a normal RDBMS - only catch the entire dataset must fit into RAM. The core idea is disk backed storage has huge random access penalties which does not apply to DRAM. Data can be index/organized in a random access optimized way not feasible using traditional RDBMS data caching schemes.
