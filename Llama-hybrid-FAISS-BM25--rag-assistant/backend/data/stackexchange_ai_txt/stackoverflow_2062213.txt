I'm assuming you have 4 ViewController placed into a single TabBarController. If this is the case, why do you want to defer loading? The actual views (usually the 'heavy' part of the ViewController) are not loaded until you actually select one in the tab bar to bring it forward (which is, I think, the behavior you're looking for). The whole point of the UIViewController class (well, one of the points, anyway) is to allow you to place your view in a hierarchy without having to create all the UI elements required until it's actually time to show it. This makes app organizations much easier.
