It's impossible to send POST data back in GB2312. I think UTF-8 is the W3C recommendation and all new browsers only send data back in either Latin-1 or UTF-8. We were able to get GB2312 encoded data back in old IE on Win 95 but it's generally not possible on the new Unicode based browsers. See this test on Firefox, POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:1234 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 46 My page is in GB2312 and I specified GB2312 everywhere but the Firefox simply ignores it. Some broken browsers even encode Chinese in Latin-1. We recently added a hidden field with a known value. By checking the value, we can figure out the encoding. request.getCharacterEncoding() returns the encoding from Content-Type. As you can see from my trace, it's always null.
