simulating a stationary markov chain approach

I have hard time simulating a markov chain stated here: Consider a set of N transformations T= {t1,...,tn} . Let S={s1,...,sL} be a sequence of transformations s of length L , where each element s(i) is chosen from the transformations in T . These are binary transformations. Given my problem I have S={s(1),...,S(7)} and my max length is 7 . I am interested in calculating the Matrix P (7*7 defined here). What I understood brings me to a P(7,1) dimention and not 7*7 . Can anyone explain me how to build this? As an example, here is my filtered data: markovSet = 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 by counting/normalizing, I can generate P(s1)s as: P(s1)=sum(markovSet)/norm(sum(markovSet),1) ans = 0.1444 0.1444 0.1222 0.1444 0.1222 0.1889 0.1333 the summation of them is equal to 1. I am having issue how to calculate the transition matrix to generate 7*7 matrix. Thank you.
