I'm not sure to have understood correctly your issue. JBpm doesn't clean tables for old process instances when you deploy a new process definition. When you deploy a new process definition with the same name of an existing one, you get new version of that process definition. Existing process instances continue running with the process definition version they was started with, while new process instances take the latest version unless you specify the precise version to be used. In theory, process definition can also be modified for running process instances using the API. In doing so, you must pay attention to make these changes compatible with the flowing of these instances.
