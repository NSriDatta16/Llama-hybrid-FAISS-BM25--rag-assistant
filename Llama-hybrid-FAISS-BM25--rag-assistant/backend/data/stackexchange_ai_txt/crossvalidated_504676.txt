Is RMSE a good non-parametric substitute for Pearson's r?

I am examining how well two non-stationary time series, which are supposed to be representing the same thing, match each other. I believe I should, therefore, be specifically looking for a linear relationship in the graph of one against the other. However, my data does not fulfill the normality assumption of person's r. I know that the non-parametric equivalent is spearman's rho; however, I are not sure if measuring the correlation for monotonic relationships in general is useful in this case. Therefore, I was considering using RMSE as a measure, by treating the more authoritative time series as the actual values and the other as a predictive model of the first for the purposes of calculating residuals. I intend to use this for calculating a lag time and to replace the cross correlation calculation. Are their any statistical problems with this or are their any better methods? Also, since this is replacing cross correlation, how does the problem of intra/auto-correlation in relation to cross correlation effect this RMSE method?
