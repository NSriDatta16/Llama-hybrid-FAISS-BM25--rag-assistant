I think i found a workable - though not centralized - solution. Instead of cluttering the code with try/catch blocks, all it seems to need is a null-check for the event.Error property. If something happened to the connection, this property is always not null. The exceptions only get raised if you try to access event.Result. It may not be the most beautiful solution, but it appears to work so far. Perhaps there is a more elegant way though...
