In my personal opinion, I wouldn´t use DL models for time series regression no matter how much data is available. They are hard to train in this type of task and you´ll be requiring a huge amount of data and time to get great results. Consider a DL model would require more features than just the plain time serie. XGBoost is more friendly and requires less time and data for training. A disavantage could be the amount of features, as you give more to the model, it takes longer to train, I think 70 features would not be a big deal for it. Finally, I suggest doing a feature selection just to ensure data quality and speed up the training of whatever model you´ll be working on. Hope it helps!
