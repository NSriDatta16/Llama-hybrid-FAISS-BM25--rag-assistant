Logistic regression using a probability as Input

I am creating a model that predicts the availability of machines. Historical data is given as a percentage of time that the machine is available. (e.g. machine x was available 95% of the time) I would thus compute a logit specification model with the dependant variable not being 0 or 1, but within the interval (0,1). Is it valid and possible to use logistic regression on this scenario?
