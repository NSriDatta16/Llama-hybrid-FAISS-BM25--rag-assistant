Functions are opaque objects, so you won't have much luck storing them in files or something like that. You can, however, store lists and compile them upon retrieval from the database. This won't help you store closures, of course. That would entail storing the lexical environment along with the code, neither of which you have (portable) access to. Code that you compile from stored lists will have to rely entirely on global data or data stored in the database. By the way, note that you can funcall symbols, so you don't need a function table for global functions.
