Magento createBlock method not working, displaying static block data

Ok so Ive created static blocks in my CMS area, and Im trying to output them inside of a custom homepage template Ive built. Every document I can find says to output the block as follows getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('my-block-identifier')->toHtml() ?> That didnt work for me, so then I tried another way. -- createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('my-block-identifier'); echo $block->toHtml(); All the sites referencing this tell me to use the actual blocks identifier to get the block. So then I decide to manually lookup the block_id in my cms_block table and see if using the block_id number in place of the literal my-block-identifier name will work - and it did. So I am confused... Can anyone tell me how I can get the block by the actual identifier, or look up the blocks id by the identifier so that I can grab the block by block name? Any help much appreciated.
