Well, we did it using Panels (one Panel for every Day) and gave them a hight of 24hours * 2px/minute. Than we created a JEventButton which is inhertied by JButton and placed the button on the Panel for example a Event beginning at 10am until 12am began at pixel (2 * 60 * 10) and had a hight of (2 * 60 * 2) pixels. I hope this helps somebody else and would be thankful about other opinions.
