Generating entity class files from table schema

I am using LINQ to SQL with C#. Is there a method through which we can generate entity class files from the table schema? By dragging tables onto the graphical designer classes are generated but they are not the real class files(i mean actual files with the extension cs). I am aware of that we can code the class files first and then create the schema manually or programmatically, but i wanted to know if the reverse is possible, may be using some third-party tools. I feel it will be very convenient to use LINQ that way. Thanks in advance.
