Reasons for getting the Program Compatibility Assistant dialog?

What are possible reasons for getting the Program Compatibility Assistant dialog after my application closes? (source: microsoft.com ) EDIT: Program Compatibility Assistant: frequently asked questions I realize this question has already been asked on S.O. Program Compatibility Assistant thinks my app is an installer Windows 7 Program Compatibility Assistant appeared for my app. Why? Why I receive a message from the Program Compatibility Assistant? How do I prevent programmatically the “Program Compatibility Assistant” in Vista (and Windows 7) from appearing? However, my app: Only gets PCA after it closes Does not attempt to do anything that requires elevated privileges (I don't think) Does not get PCA when run from IDE Is not an installer/setup program Does not have "installer" or "setup" in the program name Does not throw an exception when it closes, or exit with a code other than 0 (I don't think) Does not get PCA if I add node to application manifest Note #6, with the following app.manifest, I no longer get the PCA: So that second part seems to fix it, but I am worried that my application is still doing something that I am unaware of. To be clear, I'm asking a 2 part question: What issues can cause the PCA dialog to appear? Is the node absolutely necessary in order to avoid the PCA dialog? Or might I still be doing something wrong?
