You are describing the "Language Modeling" problem in NLP. Language modeling finds the probability distribution over sequences of words - given the words I have seen so far, what are the most likely words that will come next or are missing. word2vec can find reasonable collocations/cooccurrence for individual words. However, word2vec will do a poor job with sentence completion because it does not model grammatical dependencies. You can find a word2vec nearest individual word demo here .
