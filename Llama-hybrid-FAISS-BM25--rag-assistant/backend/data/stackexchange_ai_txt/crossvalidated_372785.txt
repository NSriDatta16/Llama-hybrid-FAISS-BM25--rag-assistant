Pros and cons of using a median version for measuring dispersion?

If a data set is in the presence of some outliers, then the sample average could not be a "fair" measure of the centrality of that data set. Instead, the sample median could be a better choice. However, it is not too unthinkable that, if a sample mean is not very informative, then the corresponding sample standard deviation is not very informative as well. So, in the presence of outliers that affect the empirical distribution sufficiently significant in a given sense, it seems more advisable to use a measure for dispersion such as $\sum_{1}^{n}|x_{i} - \hat{{\text{med}}}(x)|$ where $x := (x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})'$ is the data at hand and $\hat{\text{med}}(x)$ is the sample median of $x$ ; the intuition is that it is then a measure of dispersion with respect to a more "impartial" measure of centrality. Under the assumption that such a measure is not as widely used as the usual standard deviation, it follows that such a measure has certain properties that are not very desirable. So my question is what are the pros and cons such a measure possesses comparing to the canonical measure of dispersion. Thanks.
