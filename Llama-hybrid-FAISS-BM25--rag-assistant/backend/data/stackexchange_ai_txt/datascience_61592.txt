I think the reason why macro average is lower than micro average is well explained by pythiest's answer (dominating class has better predictions and so the micro average increase). But the fact that micro average is equal for Precision, Recall and F1 score is because micro averaging these metrics results in overall Accuracy (as micro avg considers all classes as positive). Note that if Precision and Recall are equal then F1 score is just equal to precision/recall. As for the question if the "weighted macro-average" always going to equal the "micro average"? I did some experiments with different no. of classes and different class imbalance and it turns out that this is not necessary true. These statements are made with assumption that we are considering all the classes of same dataset (in contrast to Rahul Reddy Vemireddy's answer)
