In addition to Stephen's excellent answer, if you do plot the residuals and find they are severely non-normal (and your sample size isn't huge) you can run quantile regression or robust regression. I would do this rather than transform, especially if your measure of intelligence is one of the familiar IQ tests (WAIS or SB) where mean = 100 and sd = 15. Log of that isn't as easy to interpret or relate to. Also, you mention you have "above average" people. This could be a reason for a lower than expected correlation. There is a problem called restriction of range. Like this (R code with comments): set.seed(1234) IQ 130], genknow[IQ > 130]) #0.11
