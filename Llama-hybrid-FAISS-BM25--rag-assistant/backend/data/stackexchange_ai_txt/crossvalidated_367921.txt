What do neural networks offer that traditional non-linear statistical models do not offer?

I have tried to find an answer to this question but have not found a satisfactory answer. I understand that neural networks(NNs) offer the potential to complex build non-linear models. What I donâ€™t understand is what do NNs offer that traditional statistical non-linear models do not offer. In other words, why would I choose a NN model over a statistical model (e.g. non-linear regression) at least in some cases?
