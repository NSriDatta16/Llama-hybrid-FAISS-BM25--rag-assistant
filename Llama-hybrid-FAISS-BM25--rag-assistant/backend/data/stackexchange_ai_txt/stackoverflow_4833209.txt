A lot depends of the design and the final layout. Where do you want to display validation errors? How? Via Error decorator? Do you want also use descriptions? Do you need to use other decorators? The best way seems to be to create just your own Zend_Form_Element_ThreadIcons element. This is as easy as subclassing one of Zend_Form elements and implementing custom _render() method returning HTML you need. You may even use your own View instance there. Then you may pass array of icons as an element option and handle it the way you need. If you decide using decorators, you my find this presentation very useful to master the technique: http://www.slideshare.net/weierophinney/leveraging-zendform-decorators
