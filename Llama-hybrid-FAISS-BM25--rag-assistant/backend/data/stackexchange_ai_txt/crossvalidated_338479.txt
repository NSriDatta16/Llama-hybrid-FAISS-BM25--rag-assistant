The question is ill-posed. We cannot advise the doctor that, for example, inspecting feature $X_a$ is more worthwhile than inspecting feature $X_b$, since how "important" a feature is only makes sense in the context of a specific model being used, and not the real world. Logistic Regression and Random Forests are two completely different methods that make use of the features (in conjunction) differently to maximise predictive power. This is why a different set of features offer the most predictive power for each model. Such feature importance figures often show up, but the information they are thought to convey is generally mistaken to be relevant to the real world. Why one would be interested in such a feature importance is figure is unclear .
