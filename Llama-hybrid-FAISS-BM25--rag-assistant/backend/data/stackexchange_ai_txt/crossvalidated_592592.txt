Shift-Invariance arises from Computer Vision tasks such as Image Classification. At a high level it means that the classifier should not be affected by the position of the object (e.g. cat) in the image. [From Bronstein et. al. Geometric DL] A little more: MLPs do not have this property. The claim that CNNs are shift-invariant is contested by Bronstein et. al., CNNs are shift-equivariant ("a shift of the input to a convolutional layer produces a shift in the output feature maps by the same amount"). What is shift invariant in traditional CV architectures are the pooling layers.
