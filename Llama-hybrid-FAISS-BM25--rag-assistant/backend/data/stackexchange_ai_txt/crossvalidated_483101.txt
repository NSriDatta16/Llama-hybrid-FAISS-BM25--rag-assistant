Given that you would be using MCMC sampling, you can simply calculate the probabilities from the samples. If you draw $n$ MCMC samples from the posterior distribution of $\alpha$ , than the alpha matrix would be $n \times 3$ , so you can calculate the probability by counting such cases and dividing by total (i.e. taking mean of booleans). In R, this translates to: mean(alpha[1,] > alpha[2,] & alpha[1,] > alpha[3,])
