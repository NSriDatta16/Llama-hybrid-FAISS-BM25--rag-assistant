Logistic regression models, though used for categorical Y, are not classification methods. They are instead used to estimate tendencies, i.e., probabilities. Briefly, a classifier is appropriate when the probabilities of class membership hover around 0.0 and 1.0, i.e., when the signal:noise ratio is exceedingly high. Otherwise it is not often useful to force probabilities to be converted to labels. At any rate that would require a utility/loss/cost function because it is a decision, not a prediction.
