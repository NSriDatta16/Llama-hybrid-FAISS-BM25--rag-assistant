FileMaker 11: Can't widen layout?

The company that I work for has been using FileMaker since v5, I believe. For some reason, in our database, we can't seem to widen any layouts beyond something like 615px - not even if I create a blank layout from scratch. However, if I create a new database, everything is as it should be. Here's a screenshot of what's going on, for clarification: I don't get an option to drag it over or anything, but I can drag the layout up and down just as far as I please. Google's gotten me nowhere, and I've spent long enough hunting through settings and coming back empty-handed.
