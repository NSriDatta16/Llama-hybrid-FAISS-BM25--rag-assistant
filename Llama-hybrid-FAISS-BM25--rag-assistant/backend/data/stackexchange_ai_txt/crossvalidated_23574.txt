I saw another very interesting usage case for dimensionality reduction in a video from stanford a while ago. They scanned a bunch of people with a body scanner, and used that to generate 3d models. After they had a bunch of data they applied dimensionality reduction to reduce the amount of variables they had to work with. And modifying those variables allowed them to quickly change the height/weight/gender of the resulting 3d models.
