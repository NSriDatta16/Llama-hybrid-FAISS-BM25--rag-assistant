I have used this technique many times myself, and I don't think it's that inelegant... however, an alternative you could try is: performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:NO . Just because you are already on the main thread, does not mean it would not work (in fact the documents reference behaviour that will happen when called from the main thread)... and I think it would have the same behavior when waitUntilDone is set to NO, where it queues up the request to execute the selector and have it run when the current run-loop ends.
