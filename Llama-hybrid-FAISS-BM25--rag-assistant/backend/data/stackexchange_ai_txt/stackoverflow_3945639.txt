Black margins appear when expanding form?

Create a .net 2.0 Windows form app, add a splitContainer docked Fill, with this in its form constructor: public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); for (int i = 1; i Press F5. Grab the form by the lower right-hand-edge and drag quickly to expand the form. The form expands rather jerkily due to the work being done in all the controls. I have an app with a form in it with some slow controls which has similarly become slow. The difference is that in my app, I get ugly black space appearing for a fraction of a second in the gaps as I drag out the form with my mouse. The window is not re-drawing properly. This ugly black space does not appear in the sample code above. Any ideas what might cause black space to appear when expanding a slow form? I have tried double-buffered but that makes no difference. EDIT: I have dismantled the form down to its basics so that this can be reproduced. Start a new C# Windows Form application called WindowsFormsApplication_SampleFault. Paste the code below into the Form1.cs using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Drawing; using System.Reflection; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Security.Principal; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; namespace WindowsFormsApplication_SampleFault { public partial class Form1 : Form { public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); for (int i = 1; i then paste this into Form1.Designer.cs namespace WindowsFormsApplication_SampleFault { partial class Form1 { /// /// Required designer variable. /// private System.ComponentModel.IContainer components = null; /// /// Clean up any resources being used. /// /// true if managed resources should be disposed; otherwise, false. /// protected override void Dispose(bool disposing) { if (disposing && (components != null)) { components.Dispose(); } base.Dispose(disposing); } #region Windows Form Designer generated code /// /// Required method for Designer support - do not modify /// the contents of this method with the code editor. /// private void InitializeComponent() { this.statusStrip1 = new System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip(); this.SuspendLayout(); // // statusStrip1 // this.statusStrip1.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(0, 472); this.statusStrip1.Name = "statusStrip1"; this.statusStrip1.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(756, 22); this.statusStrip1.TabIndex = 6; this.statusStrip1.Text = "statusStrip1"; // // frmOptions // this.AutoScaleDimensions = new System.Drawing.SizeF(6F, 13F); this.AutoScaleMode = System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode.Font; this.ClientSize = new System.Drawing.Size(756, 494); this.Controls.Add(this.statusStrip1); this.DoubleBuffered = true; this.ImeMode = System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode.Off; this.MinimizeBox = false; this.MinimumSize = new System.Drawing.Size(750, 500); this.Name = "frmOptions"; this.ShowIcon = false; this.StartPosition = System.Windows.Forms.FormStartPosition.CenterScreen; this.ResumeLayout(false); this.PerformLayout(); } #endregion private System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip statusStrip1; } } Press F5 and attempt to drag-out the form. Note I am deliberately overloading the redraw mechanism to produce the black areas. I believe that something is wrong with the form designer code but I am not sure what.
