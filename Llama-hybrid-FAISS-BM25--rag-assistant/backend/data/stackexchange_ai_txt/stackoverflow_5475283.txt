Joining InnoDB tables with MyISAM tables

We have a set of tables which contain the meta level data like organizations, organization users, organization departments etc. All these table are going to be read heavy with very few write operations. Also, the table sizes would be quite small (maximum number of records would be around 30K - 40K) Another set of table store OLTP data like bill transactions, user actions etc which are going to be both read and write heavy. These tables would be quite huge (around 30 Million records per table) For the first set of tables we are planning to go with MyISAM and for the second ones with InnoDb engine. Many of our features would also require JOINS on tables from these 2 sets. Are there any performance issues in joining MyISAM tables with InnoDB tables? Also, are there any other possible issues (db backups, tuning etc) we might run into with this kind of design? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
