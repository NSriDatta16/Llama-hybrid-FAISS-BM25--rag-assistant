Google Maps API: Prevent dragging into a grey area

I am using Google Maps API (v3) to render a world map. When I zoom all the way out (to zoom level 1) and start dragging the canvas, I am able to move out of the map boundaries, and the area outside shows up in grey color. I want to prevent the user from dragging the map outside the boundaries of the world map. How do I do that?
