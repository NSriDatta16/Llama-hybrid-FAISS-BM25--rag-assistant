Exponential Averaging using Simple averaging

Mathematically what is the expression that is close to a 10 Day Exponential moving average (span of 10 means decay factor of 0.818181) that is created using averaging over Simple moving averages. E.g. 10D Exponential average is close to weighted average of (3D,5D,7D,10D) Simple moving averages. Context for this : I want to run a exponentially-weighted least squares regression with huber loss (mae for outliers). But this regression does not converge, so I am thinking of averaging out non-weighted least squares with different lookbacks.
