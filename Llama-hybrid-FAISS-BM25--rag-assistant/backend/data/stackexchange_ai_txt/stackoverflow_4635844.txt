SQLite3 strange error

I have a simple iphone/ipad application... but now, mysteriously , when i touch on any textfield (in UIWebView or in UIView, it's the same ), the log console give me this error: 2011-01-08 20:47:17.242 App_tab[298:207] sqlite3_prepare 'SELECT name, size, width, height, bpr, format FROM store WHERE key=?' failed: 'no such table: store' (1) 2011-01-08 20:47:17.474 App_tab[298:207] sqlite3_prepare 'INSERT INTO store VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)' failed: 'no such table: store' (1) 2011-01-08 20:47:17.475 App_tab[298:207] '(null)' no such table: store (21) the app continue work, but i have a lot of these errors... Please note that: don't have any sql database don't have any sql framework don't save data on disk. This problem come from today and i don't know a method to solve it! EDIT: Ah, it appears in all projects that i open with my xcode! Any idea? It's very strange and i don't able to debug... thanks, alberto.
