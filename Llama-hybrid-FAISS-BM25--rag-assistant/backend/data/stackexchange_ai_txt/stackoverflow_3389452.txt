I can't comment on the other two approaches, but we are using Jasperserver and that seems to be more appropriate if you want to actually use a portal with which people will access their reports. With this, you create reports in ireport and publish them to the portal. People log in to the portal to access their reports. I don't think you'd use Jasperserver if you were simply embedding it in your application.
