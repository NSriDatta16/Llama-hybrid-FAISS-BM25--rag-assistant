I have found that PowerShell is a much more maintainable solution for smaller things. Console apps require relinking into new libraries and recompiling and redistributing out when the libraries you depend on change (in my case going from Visual Studio 2005 - Visual Studio 2008's codecoverage and other things) as well as executables your scripts may call vsinstr, mstest, etc. where as with PowerShell scripts you can easily customize for each environment you have and don't have to go through the compile, link, deploy stuff for every environment you choose. In fact if you get your path info from the registry the same script can run in both environments. You can do everything you want with either, I just prefer having to maintain a single simple text file, then a console app. Just personal preference.
