How to test if con-infection between microbes is correlated?

I am analyzing the results from a diagnostic test that looks for the presence of micro-organisms in humans. In some cases, there is only one microbe but in others, there are multiple infections. What is the statistical test I should apply to assess whether certain microbes are more likely to come up together? In other words: If I have the species A, B, C, D, E, how can I test if species B and E are more likely to be found together? Also, what machine learning approach would be best to support the statistical test? That is: what model would be best to investigate this sort of associations? Thank you
