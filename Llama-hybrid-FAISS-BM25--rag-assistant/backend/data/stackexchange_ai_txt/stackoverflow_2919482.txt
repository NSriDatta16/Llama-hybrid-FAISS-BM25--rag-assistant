It's nothing really to do with C++, or any language per se, it's more down to the fact that it only makes sense in a WPF/Silverlight context. The only thing that MVVM brings to the table that other view/logic separation patterns do not is WPF/Silverlight commands/binding. The main reason for using MVVM is to leverage the powerful binding system built into WPF/Silverlight, it just doesn't makes sense to talk about it in different contexts, unless they have a similar model.
