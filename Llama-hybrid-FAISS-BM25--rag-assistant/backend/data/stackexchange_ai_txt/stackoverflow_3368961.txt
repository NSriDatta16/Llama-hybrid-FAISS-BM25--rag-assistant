SQL Express is limited to 4GB. If you think your development environment may exceed that, then go for the Server Farm. As for me, we already have a full farm for staging and production, so I get no additional benefit from running a server farm installation in dev. @Robert-Koritnik has a good point that, if you're already running a full SQL instance on your box, you might consider Server Farm just to avoid having another instance of SQL Server on the box. I tend to do my development within a VM, so Standalone works just peachy for me.
