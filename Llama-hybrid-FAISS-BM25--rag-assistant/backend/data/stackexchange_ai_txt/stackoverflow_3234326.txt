@toxoplasmotic: yes. RE: Getting no events firing. As it turns out, the Drag events are wired up, but provide no functionality. RE: Dragging under/over the various drop target canvases. There seems to be some kind of zorder that's established by the 'natural order' of the creation of the canvases. But these things aren't really the important points. Solution #1. With Silverlight 3, there was introduced a new Expression Blend Behavior: MouseDragElementBehavior. It encapsulates quite a bit of drag/drop functionality. It is preserved in SL4. Solution #2. On codeplex there is a Silverlight Toolkit that has (in the experimental stages) another very nice encapsulation of drag/drop functionality. It appears that this one might require a little extra coding if you're not working with list boxes and tree views, etc. Solution #3. But the capper is this: it's pretty easy to do drag/drop using Alex Van Beek's fairly well documented code. It is here: http://blogs.infosupport.com/blogs/alexb/archive/2009/09/07/A-complete-Silverlight-3-drag-and-drop-solution.aspx The key to success is to disassociate the dragged object from its parent and associate it with an abstraction of the browser window, usually the root object or another canvas that's transparent. The difficulty (not so difficult) is to keep the various coordinate systems in sync. (the "from" canvas, "to" canvas, dragged object) Cheers! Greg
