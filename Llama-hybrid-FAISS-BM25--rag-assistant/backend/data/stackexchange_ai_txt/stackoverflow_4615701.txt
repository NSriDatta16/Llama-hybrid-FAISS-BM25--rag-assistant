You can deploy the Infragistics assemblies with ClickOnce just like your application assemblies. Is there a reason why you want them installed as a prereq? Edit Files deployed with ClickOnce only get downloaded once. They will not be downloaded again unless they are updated. The common point of confusion, however, is that the ClickOnce progress dialog always displays the entire size of the application even if it's only downloading a single file. If you want to know exactly what is being downloaded, use Fiddler . I'm serious, use Fiddler, it's awesome.
