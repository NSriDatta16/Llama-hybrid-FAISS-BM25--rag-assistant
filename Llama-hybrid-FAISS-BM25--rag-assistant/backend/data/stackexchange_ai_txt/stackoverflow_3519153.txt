Your Preferences should extend PreferenceActivity . Then you need to create a resource xml file for preferences, and reference that in your PreferenceActivity like so: @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.preferences); etc. } The preferences xml should have a PreferenceScreen as the top level element, and you can take advantage of all the different preference views Android makes available to you for setting preferences. This would be the most common, and elegant way to do it.
