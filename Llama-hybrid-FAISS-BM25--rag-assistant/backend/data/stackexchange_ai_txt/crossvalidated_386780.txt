What is the best way to choose interactions between continuous variables for Logistic Regression?

I have a logistic regression model that I am working on for a school project. I have about 55 predictors, all of which are continuous. I am relatively new to the idea of "interactions" between variables. What is the process for choosing interactions between variables and then adding them into a logistic regression model?
