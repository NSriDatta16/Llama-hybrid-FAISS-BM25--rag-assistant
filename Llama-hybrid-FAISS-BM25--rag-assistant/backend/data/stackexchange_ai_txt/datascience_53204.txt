How to determine if a string is 'food' or 'drink'?

My data exists of several restaurant menus (in text form). I would like to detect the category of an item on the menu which can be 'food' or 'drink'. How do I call this kind of machine learning? Text classification? I know javascript isn't ideal for this kind of thing but I would like to use brain.js or tensorflowjs to implement a proof of concept. Thanks in advance!
