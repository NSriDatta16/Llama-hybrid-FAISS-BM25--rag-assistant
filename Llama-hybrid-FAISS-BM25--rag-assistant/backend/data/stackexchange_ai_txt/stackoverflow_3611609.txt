traditionally this is solved with an MVC pattern. however if you are not disciplined, you will see business logic creeping into your view layer. design your package structure as best you can so that everything fits neatly into a model, view, and controller packages. make sure you have well define interfaces for sharing data between packages. make every effort to design the packages in a way that each individual package will be testable and mostly usable without depending on the other 2. i would also encourage you to look at the IOC pattern. this will help when connecting all your packages together. it will also help during testing when you need to mock up some stub classes to test 1 package independently of the other 2. IOC is the "wiring" of your application, it lets you mix and match objects.
