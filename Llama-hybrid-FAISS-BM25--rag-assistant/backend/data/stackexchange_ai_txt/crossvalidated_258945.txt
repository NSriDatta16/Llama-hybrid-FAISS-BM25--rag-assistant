Using Random Forest in a dataset as the one you described has two major problems: Random Forest does not perform well when features are monotonic transformations of other features (this makes the trees of the forest less independent from each other). The same happens when you have more features than samples: random forest will probably overfit the dataset, and you will have a poor out of bag performance. When using PCA you get rid of these two problems that are lowering the performance of Random Forest: you reduce the number of features. you get rid of collinear features. (all collinear features will end up in a single PCA component).
