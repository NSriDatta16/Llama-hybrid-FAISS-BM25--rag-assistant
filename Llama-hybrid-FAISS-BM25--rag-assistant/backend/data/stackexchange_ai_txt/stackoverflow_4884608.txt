Not really sure this will qualify as an answer since I'm not a hundred percent sure it will work. But it should work :) If I understand you correctly, you want to drag files from the desktop and drop them in a drop zone somewhere in your browser. This triggers an ajax upload call to a play server. I've got the second part of that working, using a straight jquery ajax post. The files are received just fine. For the first part, I'd try using the dnd support in html 5 (scroll down to Dragging Files): http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/dnd/basics/
