Is a super high odds ratio unusable?

So I've been working on a logistic regression model, and all has been going well for the most part. However, I just started analyzing the results and trends of the model, and one particular odds ratio is giving me trouble. The odds ratios for the model (with four independent variables) are 0.9999999628643, 1.00000072117459, 0.0393990796298753, and 23974346.5342214. Now this is obviously a huge problem. Most of them are fine, but then there's that one odds ratio in the twenty millions. While a larger odds ratio makes sense, as that's the variable that's probably going to have the largest impact on the output, I didn't anticipate having something that high. Is this unusable? Did I do something wrong? Thanks for any help you can offer! Edit The CI for the odds ratios are [0.999998601016136, 1.00000132471432], [0.999997388410105, 1.00000405395019], [1.02226897236851E-06, 1518.4726501918], and [0.810502926670688, 709151408131148].
