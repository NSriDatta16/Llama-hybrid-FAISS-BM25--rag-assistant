What function could be a kernel?

In the context of machine learning and pattern recognition, there's a concept called Kernel Trick . Facing problems where I am asked to determine whether a function could be a kernel function or not, what exactly should be done? Should I first check if they're of the form of the three or four kernel functions such as polynomial, RBF and Gaussian? Then what am I supposed to do? Should I show it is positive definite? Could someone solve an example to show an step-by-step solution for such problems? Like for example, is $f(x)=e^{x^tx'}$ a kernel function (suppose we don't know it is a Gaussian kernel)?
