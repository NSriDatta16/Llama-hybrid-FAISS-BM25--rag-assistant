Creating big file on Windows

I need to create big relatively big (1-8 GB) files. What is the fastest way to do so on Windows using C or C++ ? I need to create them on the fly and the speed is really an issue. File will be used for storage emulation i.e will be access randomly in different offsets and i need that all storage will be preallocate but not initialized, currently we are writing all storage with dummy data and it's taking too long. Thanks.
