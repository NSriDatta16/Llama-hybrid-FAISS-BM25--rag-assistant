(Caveat Emptor: I'm not an expert in this area) If you just want to talk about differences in time spent per location, then submitting the "time-per-location" data as counts in a multinomial mixed model (see the MCMCglmm package for R), using subject as a random effect, should do the trick. If you want to talk about differences in location preference through time, then maybe bin time to reasonable intervals (maybe to the resolution of your timing device?), classify each interval according to the mouse's location at that time (eg. if 3 locations, each interval gets labelled either 1, 2, or 3), and again use a multinomial mixed effects model with subject as a random effect but this time add interval as a fixed effect (though possibly only after factorizing interval, which drops power but should help capture non-linearities through time).
