"Ice skater" / "figure skating" / "ISU" method of discarding outliers

So I need a way of ruling out outliers and "the ice skater method" has been suggested. The person who suggested it has a good deal of experience of doing the task I am doing, so I am certainly compelled to use it! However, I can't find anything about anyone else using/testing it... The figure skating method: in figure skating competitions, there are five judges and after a routine you get 5 scores ("five samples from a 1D distribution"). To calculate your final score they discard the highest and lowest individual score(the outliers) then average the three scores in the middle. To me it is a vaguely intuitively appealing method of getting an average that is not biased by outliers. To scale it to an average coming from more than 5 values you could either discard the top and bottom 20% or just the top and bottom datapoints. At this point I guess I could describe the data we're measuring and argue that it's a good fit (it feels like it is!), but that's not exactly my question... ...what worries me is that from googling is that I haven't found any mention of it. Is it at all a formalized idea, perhaps by another name? Is it widely used? Have its properties been studied/is there literature on when it might/might not be a good idea?
