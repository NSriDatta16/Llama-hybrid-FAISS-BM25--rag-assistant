PowerPoint document pulls data points from XML / Excel

What I want to do: Pull information (numbers, words, etc) from fields that are either in an XML document or in an Excel spreadsheet, and embed these values in a text paragraph inside of a PowerPoint presentation. Example: Yearly, the production of product Y has reached thousand units. where is some value pulled from the XML or Excel document. Thanks!
