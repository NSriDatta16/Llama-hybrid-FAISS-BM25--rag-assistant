Most software such as Stan, WingBUGS, SAS etc. requires you to provide an analytic form for the prior instead of MCMC samples. Possible ways around it are to refit the model with all data or to approximate the posterior with e.g. some mixture distribution (e.g. of bivariate normals to $\mu $ and $\log \sigma$ - e.g. in R using e.g. the mclust package or in SAS using PROC FMM) and to use the mixture log-pdf as the new prior.
