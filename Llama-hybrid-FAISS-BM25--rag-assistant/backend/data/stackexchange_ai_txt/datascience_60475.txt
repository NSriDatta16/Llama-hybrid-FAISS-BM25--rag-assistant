How does Neural Network denoise an image?

I understand the mathematical formalism behind how neural networks work as a classifier or perform regression analysis. But I face difficulty to realize how they are such a great denoising instrument. Even a simple fully connected single hidden layer network can denoise appreciable amount of noise from a relatively simple enough signal (with proper training of course). Do neural networks mimic one or more mathematical operations of filter (such as convolution) and that's why they are so effective in denoising application?
