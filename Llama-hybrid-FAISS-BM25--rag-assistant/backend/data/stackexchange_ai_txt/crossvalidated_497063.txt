How to manually calculate predictions of kernlabs SVM

I am trying to manually replicate the predictions of kernlabs SVM (polynomial & radial kernel) using caret. Here is the code to fit the model: fitControlSVM Given the fit, I can extract the coefficients & xmat of the "best" model: coefs $finalModel@coef[[1]] xmat finalModel@xmatrix[[1]] and quickly get the coefficient for each predictor: (predictor given the svm_poly$finalModel, I further get the hyperparameter: SV type: C-svc (classification) parameter : cost C = 0.25 Polynomial kernel function. Hyperparameters : degree = 1 scale = 0.01 offset = 1 But I just don't know/understand how to calculate the prediction myself, as I am not that confident with SVM to be honest... So I am trying to replicate manually: predict(svm_poly, pima.data[,-9], type ="prob") Thanks
