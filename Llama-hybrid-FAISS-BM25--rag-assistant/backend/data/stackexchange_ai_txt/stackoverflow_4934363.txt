As was commented by @igorw, the best way to manage it would be to wrap them up in a JSON object. Easiest way to do this would be something like... return Json(new {agent = Agents, channel = Channels}); This sends you the code back in a javascript friendly format, and keeps the two lists split apart into 2 pieces, so you can step through either of them by javascript, and still know which one is which.
