How do I stop jquery appending a unique id to scripts called via ajax?

I'm using jquery's ajax functions to grab a page fragment and display in a section of a page - this fragment includes html and references to external js files. The program flow looks like this: Main Page calls -> Fragment page which calls -> various large js files via script tags. I've turned on the cache option on my initial ajax call so that the fragement page gets cached (no unique IDs appended to the url), however when the fragment is loaded, it appears that jquery rewrites the script urls to include a unix timestamp so that the browser downloads a new copy of the scripts every time. The scripts i'm calling are around 250kb minified and it's really hurting the user experience as the browser locks up whenever they're called. Is this a desired behaviour of jquery? Is there a way to disable the url rewrites? Many many thanks for your help
