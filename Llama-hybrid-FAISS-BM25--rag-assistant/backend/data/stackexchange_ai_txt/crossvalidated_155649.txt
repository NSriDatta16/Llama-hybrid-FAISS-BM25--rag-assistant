Aggregate ts data with few observations

I am looking to predict the outcome of a business process (inherently complex). I have four years of data across 15 companies. I am trying to: (1) understand key drivers in this process (what variables have strongest impact on outcomes (2) look at these drivers across the samples to come up with a rough model My questions: (1) If I difference the data can I put them together into one seemingly long time series so I can employ lasso or random forest? In other words it's almost as if it were cross sectional/longitudinal combined... (2) If yes to 1, the data is still possibly not stationary after taking the difference of the ln (p-value of .26 on adf test)? Is there another way to deal with this? Any suggestions would be most appreciated!
