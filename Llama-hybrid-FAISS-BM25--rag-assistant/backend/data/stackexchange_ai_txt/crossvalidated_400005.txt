Yes, it is possible to have all positive coefficients in logistic regression. That doesn't say very much, if a covariable $x$ have a negative coefficient you can just replace that covariable by $-x$ and get a positive coefficient ... you would get a more useful answer if you told us about your real problem, your data, the context and research questions.
