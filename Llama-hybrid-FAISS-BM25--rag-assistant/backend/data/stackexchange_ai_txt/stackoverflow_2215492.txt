As an experiment I want to work a bit with AWS. How much might I expect to pay?

I'm about to go to Pycon, and while I have my hosting at Webfaction one of the tutorials (JKM) asks for students to have AWS instances. I've been trying to figure out what some minimum charge examples might look like? I'll have a lamp server with Django and a requisite amount of storage but next to no traffic. Anyone have some guidance/advice? My Google searches and look here did not turn up much useful info.
