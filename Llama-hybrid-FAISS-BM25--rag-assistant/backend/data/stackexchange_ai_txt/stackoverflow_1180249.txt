Something that is only mentioned in passing elsewhere - how to get the compiler to devote some storage space to a reference: class HasRef { int &r; public: HasRef(int &n) : r(n) { } }; This denies the compiler the opportunity to simply treat it as a compile-time alias (an alternative name for the same storage).
