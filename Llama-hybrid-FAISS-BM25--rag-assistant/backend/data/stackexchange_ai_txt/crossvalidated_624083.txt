Adaptive Metropolis For Multidimensional Parameter

Hi recently I want to implement the adaptive Metropolis algorithm. However I dont know how to deal with multidimensional parameters. The normal step of the adaptive MCMC is to update the covariance matrix of the parameters, which are usually scalar or vector. But what if I want to estimate the precision/covariance matrix in the multivariate normal distribution which is $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ ? The parameter has dimension $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ . So I have several idea: Flatten the parameter and use a $\mathbb{R}^{n^2\times n^2}$ matrix for adaptive MCMC, which is computational demanding. Treat this parameter as a scalar and use a scalar step size. But I need to design several if-else to check the dimension of the parameters. Could anyone help me in this case? This should have a answer but I did not find after search.. Thanks!
