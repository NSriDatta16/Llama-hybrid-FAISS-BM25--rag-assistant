The best solution to build a website mobile appliction use phonegap

I'm building an forum like website and also provide a mobile version, which will detect user agent and return page built on jQuery mobile. However, it will be great to have its mobile application for iphone, android and other platform so user can use their camera and gps from mobile to upload picture and determine their location.Therefore, I turned into phonegap. I'm new to phonegap and what I'm trying to do is: for reading my forum content, how can I reuse my mobile version Due to the cross domain communication, I'm thinking JSONP. But it's kind of waste to re-produce the page. (I need to parse JSON, and dynamically create DOM element) Since my mobile version's page has all page elements, can I simply load the page? or ChildBrowser? to load my mobile version website? Just heard Childbrowser today, can any one share experience? 2 . develop a post form page. I'm going to use phonegap's camera api. is it possible for this form page also load remotely?
