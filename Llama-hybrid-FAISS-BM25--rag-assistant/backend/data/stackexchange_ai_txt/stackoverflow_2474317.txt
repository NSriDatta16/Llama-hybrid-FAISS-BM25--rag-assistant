Based on your description, you are running ehcache under RMI mode w/ multicast automatic peer discovery. Sounds like Cache Event notification is working too. This is my speculation: Depending on expiry setting in your config, the element might have expired when you "get" from host B. In the documentation, http://ehcache.org/documentation/storage_options.html , under Memory Use, Spooling and Expiry Strategy: When there is a get or a getQuiet on an element, it is checked for expiry. If expired, it is removed and null is returned. you may take a look at your config file, check the value on eternal, timeToIdleSeconds and timeToLiveSeconds.
