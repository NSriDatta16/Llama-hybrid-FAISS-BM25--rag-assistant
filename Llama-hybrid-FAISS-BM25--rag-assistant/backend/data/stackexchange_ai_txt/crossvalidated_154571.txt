Features for Object Detection

I want to build a classifier for detecting Airplanes in images. It is important to note that size and shape of the Airplane does not matter in the image. So for training I might simply use the images from Google search corresponding to Airplanes. What would be the best features to be used for this purpose ? Also which model with fit my purpose best? Neural Nets ? Svm ?
