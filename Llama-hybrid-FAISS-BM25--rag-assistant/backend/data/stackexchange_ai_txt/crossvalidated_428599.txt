Why doesnt Conditional Variational AutoEncoders(CVAE) cluster data like the vanila VAE?

I have a hard time understanding why a Conditional VAE, doesn't cluster the data-points the way vanilla VAEs do! I was expecting to see the same or at least similar looking plots when I tried to visualize the latent variable z ? Here is how a vanilla VAE looks like : and this is how a conditional one looks like : both of them have around the same loss, and produce plausible outcome so its not like the Conditional VAE is not trained properly. What is the intuition behind this behavior? How should I interpret what is going on here? How does it know how to produce different classes( digits in my case), when everything seems to be messed up like this in the manifold?!
