How do I use CaptiveNetwork to get the current WiFi Hotspot Name

I need to get the name of the currently connected Wi-Fi hotspot, e.g. "BT OpenZone" I have been told it can be done with CaptiveNetwork specifically CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo My code so far: #import ... // Get the dictionary containing the captive network infomation CFDictionaryRef captiveNtwrkDict = CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo(kCNNetworkInfoKeySSID); // Get the count of the key value pairs to test if it has worked int count = CFDictionaryGetCount(captiveNtwrkDict); NSLog(@"Count of dict:%d",count); When the code runs on a device in a WiFi hotspot the captiveNtwrkDict is nil. Has anyone managed to get it working? I cant find much documentation or any example code examples on CaptiveNetworks... any help would be much appreciated.
