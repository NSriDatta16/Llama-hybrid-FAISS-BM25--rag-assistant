This is an effect due to the loading strategy of hibernate. You defined the relation "authors" as EAGER fetching, which will result in a JOIN of table AUTHOR. So avoid this you can either define this relation as LAZY (which may have other positive or negative effects on your application) or use a result transformer: criteria.setResultTransformer(Criteria.DISTINCT_ROOT_ENTITY);
