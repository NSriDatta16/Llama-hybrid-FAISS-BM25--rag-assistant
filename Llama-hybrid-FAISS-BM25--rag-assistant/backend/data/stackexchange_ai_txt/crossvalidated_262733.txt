That is a very common usage of logistic regression. Assign one alternative to 0 the other to 1 and compute a logistic regression (the simple two-case, not the complicated "ordered" for more then two alternatives). Usually this is interpreted as modelling the chance of one or the other alternative. Every two-alternative categorial variable can be viewed as ordered. For example you could consider the two states man and women as being ordered by being increasingly feminine or decreasing male-ish. Things only become difficult if there are more than two alternatives.
