Alternatives to Random Forest's Feature Importance for choosing best features

I have already established method using R's Random Forest tools for ranking most important features; for binary classification task. I'm looking for other methods for doing the same task. So that I can be sure that the features selection becomes more trustable. What are other alternatives to RF methods? (non-tree based?)
