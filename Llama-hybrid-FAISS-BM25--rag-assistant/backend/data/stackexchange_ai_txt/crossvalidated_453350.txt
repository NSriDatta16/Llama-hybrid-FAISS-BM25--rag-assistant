Is there a Bayesian Non-Parametric one-way ANOVA?

The rough idea is that I am trying to compare linguistic properties (e.g. readability) between pieces of texts from two authors essentially. For this, I thought using an ANOVA would be appropriate. But, I know my data does not follow a Gaussian distribution. Whilst I know that there is a frequentist non-parametric ANOVA test (Kruskal-Wallis), I was wondering if a Bayesian alternative exists so that I can also get the effect size? I am looking for either a package in Python or R if possible. I know the JASP software exists but I don't think they have a Bayesian non-parametric one-way (or even two way ANOVA yet). Any advice would be much appreciated.
