Can GLM( generalized linear method) handle the collinearity between the predictor variables in a regression-analysis?

I'm a beginner in Machine learning and I've studied that collinearity among the predictor variables of a model is a huge problem since it can lead to unpredictable model behaviour and a large error. But, are there some models (say GLM) that are perhaps 'okay' with collinearity unlike the classic linear regression? It is said that the classic linear regression assumes there is no correlation between its independent variables. This question arises because I was doing a project that said "If the input features are correlated with each other, it is better to use a generalized linear model since they would perform better than linear regression." Can someone explain this ?
