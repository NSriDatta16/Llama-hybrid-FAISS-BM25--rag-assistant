The libSVM faq speaks to your question: Q: Why grid.py/easy.py sometimes generates the following warning message? Warning: empty z range [62.5:62.5], adjusting to [61.875:63.125] Notice: cannot contour non grid data! Nothing is wrong and please disregard the message. It is from gnuplot when drawing the contour. As a side note, you can parallelize your grid.py operations. The libSVM tools directory README file has this to say on the matter: Parallel grid search You can conduct a parallel grid search by dispatching jobs to a cluster of computers which share the same file system. First, you add machine names in grid.py: ssh_workers = ["linux1", "linux5", "linux5"] and then setup your ssh so that the authentication works without asking a password. The same machine (e.g., linux5 here) can be listed more than once if it has multiple CPUs or has more RAM. If the local machine is the best, you can also enlarge the nr_local_worker. For example: nr_local_worker = 2 In my Ubuntu 10.04 installation grid.py is actually /usr/bin/svm-grid.py
