Error propogation through standard deviation

I am trying to determine the best way to propogate my error with two points if I want to either average or take the standard deviation of them. For example, lets say I have two points 10 +-0.5 mg/L and 14 +-0.6 mg/L and I want to take the average of these points, or even the standard deviation, how do I propogate the associated error? Do I just use the formulas for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division when necessary? (For clarification, the error that I already have is the instrumentation error and the error I am trying to get is after measuring replicates from the same sample) Thanks!
