When you say "10Gb C drive", do you mean it's a 10-gig disk or a partition? If the former, you should really be looking at replacing the drive - it's old , and I'd be starting to worry about how much longer it has to live. If the latter, then assuming that the C: drive restriction can't easily be worked around, then I'd look at increasing the size of the C: partition. Depending on how full the remainder of the drive is, this can take a while. I'd also be considering spending some tens of dollars ($40 or $50, I'd guess) on a partition manager from someone such as Acronis or Paragon. Kick it off just before you finish work for the day - it may take several hours, especially if the disk's fairly full.
