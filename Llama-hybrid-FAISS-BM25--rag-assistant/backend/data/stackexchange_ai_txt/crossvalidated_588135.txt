This is an interesting Optimal Experiment Design (OED) problem. Finding the best experimental parameters (i.e. numbers of sites and squares) requires to specify a cost function. For instance, your research question could be formulated as a Bayesian inference problem: Let us denote $x$ the mussels density and $y$ the density of other animals. Then the goal is to find a model that links both quantities, e.g. $$ y = f_{\theta}(x) $$ where $f$ is a function depending on a set of parameters $\theta$ . Assuming that you have $T$ observations $x_{1:T}$ and $y_{1:T}$ , your goal is to find the sites and squares that allow you to infer $\theta$ as precisely as possible, i.e. to minimize the variance or the entropy of the posterior distribution $p(\theta|x_{1:T},y_{1:T})$ . This approach is called Bayesian experimental design . Such a problem can be solved using brute-force simulations: Specify a set of ground-truth parameters $\theta^*$ Generate surrogate data $x_{1:T}$ and $y_{1:T}$ For different sites and squares, compute the posterior distribution $p(\theta|x_{1:T},y_{1:T})$ and study which experiment design has the best utility Repeat for different possible and realistic values of $\theta^*$
