initialize QTMovie for file dropped in NSTableview

Guys, I'm just lerning Objective C and writing software for table where I drag mp3 files and want to access their metadata and display artist, genre and etc. So I have class for "drag and drop" and class for "access metadata". I think problem is I don't know how to initialize QTMovie for file I dropped from finder to table. here is line of code: movie = [QTMovie movieWithFile:@"/* so, what i should write here??*/" error:nil]; thanks, A.
