More efficient? No, but more correct, probably. But it depends on how correct you want to be. Dates are not trivial things. Years do not have a constant length. Do you want the difference in leap years or normal years? :-) As you calculate you are always going to get a slightly incorrect answer. And how long is a day in years? You say 1/365.2425. Well, yeah, averaged over a thousand years, yeah. But otherwise not. So the question doesn't really make much sense. To be correct you have to do this: from datetime import datetime from calendar import isleap start_date = datetime(2005,4,28,12,33) end_date = datetime(2010,5,5,23,14) diffyears = end_date.year - start_date.year difference = end_date - start_date.replace(end_date.year) days_in_year = isleap(end_date.year) and 366 or 365 difference_in_years = diffyears + (difference.days + difference.seconds/86400.0)/days_in_year In this case that's a difference of 0.0012322917425568528 years, or 0.662 days, considering that this is not a leap year. (and then we are ignoring microseconds. Heh.)
