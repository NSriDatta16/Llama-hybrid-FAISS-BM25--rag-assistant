Common practice deploying/publish/debuggin a java webapp

I have always programmed my applications in php. But recenlty I discovered that best combination of language and server to achieve scalable comet functionality is Java + Jetty, because jetty support continuation, which eases the number of threads in the server. However, I'm slowly learning Java right now. I'm using Eclipse as my IDE with the plugin RSE(Remote System Explorer). When I used to program in PHP I just created a new php-file inside of htdocs in my Apache webserver, very simple to deploy. But now when I program in Java I have to compile the file too. Another flaw is that I cant create a Dynamic web project in RSE, so to deploy a webapp I have to drag all my file in my personal computer to my remote server and unzip and compile(manually via ssh). How do you guys deploy your java webapp in Eclipse? And yes I haven't found any good answer to this on the web yet before asking this question.
