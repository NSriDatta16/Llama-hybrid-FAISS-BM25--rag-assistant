You can still leverage all of your stored procedures/functions originally created for your solution with Linq2SQL. Using something like the strategies expressed in Micheal Feather's Working with Legacy Code you could create boundaries around regions of the application and update within those boundaries. The strategy I have used in the past is maintain/ignore the database and its objects. I then slowly iterate through the different ADO calls and replace with Linq2SQL calls until the entire application is using Linq2SQL. I then find it easier to transform the previous ADO calls that exposed and passed DataSets/DataTables into more appropriate entities. Another approach (for DataSet/DataTable heavy solutions) is to keep the ADO calls in place and instead use the extension methods AsQueryable() and/or OfType () to transform the ds/dt items into appropriate entities, then aggregate these changes into a more cohesive DAL.
