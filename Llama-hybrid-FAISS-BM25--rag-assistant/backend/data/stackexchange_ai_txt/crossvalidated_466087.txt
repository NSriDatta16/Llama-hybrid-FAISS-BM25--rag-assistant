You can build a time series model with the data you provided. However, you can choose what your time step is. If you always have 3 equal readings in succession for each weight (say every 20 minutes), you can change your time step to be one hour intervals. The main types of models you can try are integrated models like ARIMA, Forecast distance models like regularized linear regressions or tree-based models, or trend/decomposition models such as Prophet.
