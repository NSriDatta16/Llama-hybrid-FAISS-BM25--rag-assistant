To cluster data samples you need to define a dissimilarity measure . Depending on your choice which samples should be considered similiar - the dissimilarity measure should be chosen. (a) If you give importance to the ordering of the nodes visited - then i suggest to look into " time series clustering " In your case I recommend to use DTW as suggested in the answer to this question: Suitable distance metric for time-series clustering with respect to location of shapes (b) If you give importance only to "which nodes have been visited", then i suggest to encode the samples differently. For each sample, you create an array with the length of the number of all nodes in the network. Each position is a boolean (1 - true, 0 - false) which indicates whether or not this node has been visited. 2 3 3 4 - 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 4 5 6 - 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 3 5 6 6 6 - 1 0 1 0 1 1 Then finally you can choose an algorithm for clustering - which all have their pros and cons .
