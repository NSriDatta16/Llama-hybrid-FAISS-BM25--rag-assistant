Cluster before or after de-trend the data for time series data

I am working with a non-stationary time series finance data set. I would like to perform a clustering method on the data. My questions are, Do I need to de-trend the data first and then cluster it, or I can cluster the data first and then de-trend it? What is the best clustering method for finance data?
