Weird behavior of curl and facebook

Here is the code: $ch = curl_init( 'https://graph.facebook.com/btaylor'); curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, '' ); curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER ,true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); $data = curl_exec($ch); print_r( $data) ; curl_close($ch); It shows few informations from facebook. It works on my localhost, but when I try to run it on my server it just doesn't work, returns a blank site. I tried to use this code with others sites like example.com and It works, so I thought, that its becouse of facebook blocks my ip (i dont know why it would be true), so I checked it. I have run it with curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROXY, 'myproxy'); But it still doesn't show any information. I am trying to fix it all day, but its too difficult. Have you got some ideas?
