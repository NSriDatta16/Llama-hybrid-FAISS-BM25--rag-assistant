What is the range of values that can be expected in the result of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?

I want to normalize all of my preprocessing techniques between 0 and 1 so I want to know what the PCA range of values is so that I can apply a proper normalization to it. I applied PCA by using the result of SVD. For example, I saw that the SVD range of values was limited to positive values, so I feature scaled to normalize the values between 0 and 1. Is there any such range for PCA?
