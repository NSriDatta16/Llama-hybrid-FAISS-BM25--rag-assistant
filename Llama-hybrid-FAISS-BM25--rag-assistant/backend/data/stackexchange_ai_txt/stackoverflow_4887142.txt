Sunspot-Solr slowing down to a beast once my Application climbed to > 1000 objects [ Solr Logs Included ]

I'm curious if anyone noticed any scaling issues with Sunspot-Solr . Even if I remove all the searchable params, and its just counting against the raw class by itself; it still takes 5 to 8 seconds to load on my local, 4 to 5 seconds on production. Has anyone else been able to scale Sunspot-Solr ? What are some common problems? How can one look into this deeper? Here's the Solr Logs for a single request : Solr Select (208.1ms) {:rows=>20, :start=>0, :q=>"*:*", :sort=>"score desc", :fq=>["type:Organization", "published_b:true", "updated_at_d:[2009\\-02\\-03T16\\:11\\:55Z TO *]"]} Solr Select (5.5ms) {:rows=>20, :start=>0, :q=>"*:*", :sort=>"score desc", :fq=>["type:Organization", "published_b:true", "updated_at_d:[2009\\-02\\-03T16\\:11\\:55Z TO *]"]} Solr Update (12.6ms) User ActiveRecord::Base User 2 User Bob 2009-09-28T21:00:27Z Marley bob.marley@gmail.com Bob Marley Marley Bob bob.marley@gmail.com Bob Marley Solr Update (487.7ms) Completed in 12632ms (View: 11633, DB: 228) | 200 OK [http://localhost/organizations/search]
