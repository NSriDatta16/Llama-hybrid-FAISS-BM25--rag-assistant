For ID you could use __COUNTER__. From http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0084kay(VS.80).aspx : Expands to an integer starting with 0 and incrementing by 1 every time it is used in a compiland. __FILE__ and __LINE__ can be used to track where the event was allocated. But why do you want to track back the origin of these events? If this is for debugging purposes, you might want to look into embedding a stack trace, collected using StackWalk64, into your class when in a special debug mode - it'll give you a lot more useful information than just place of origin.
