It's a reasonable approach. We do it all the time in my lab. The average (and deviation) is useful for checking the variation of the stochastic process. However, as mentioned, I would take the best result for the final presentation (along with the other results in a table). Try it with different initial parameters as well. Make sure to also record the number of times you call your objective each run. For example, if you have 10 runs with 100 function calls, the total cost of your optimization is 1000, not 100. If it took 1000 to get that result, then that is the cost of optimization. In terms of finding the best result, you may consider trying different GO algorithms as well (GA, DIRECT, EGO etc.). Different algorithms work better on different problems. This a result from the "no free lunch theorem". Therefore, don't assume SA will work best for your particular application.
