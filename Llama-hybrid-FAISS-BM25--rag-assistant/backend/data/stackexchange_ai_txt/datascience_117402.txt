I would choose option 2 (Build an application(chatbot) on top of existing algorithms like GPT-3 or BERT) for your particular use case, specifically GPT. For your case, it seems that you are trying to build a chatbot, and for such purposes, it is better to use a large generative language model such as GPT as there are already many resources. GPT, after training has the ability to generate human-like responses to text input which is from what I can tell your use case. Additionally this won't require much machine learning knowledge as most of the heavy lifting is done by OpenAI for GPT-3 or you can use Transformers from HuggingFace for GPT-2, GPT-NeoX-20B and etc. For resources: How To Build a GPT-3 Chatbot with Python -> you can change the GUI as it utilizes an API implementation The AI Chatbot Handbook â€“ How to Build an AI Chatbot with Redis, Python, and GPT -> they use GPT-J-6B but you can change that and follow this as a guide.
