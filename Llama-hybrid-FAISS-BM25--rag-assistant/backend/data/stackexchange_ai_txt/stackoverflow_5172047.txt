Content overlapping when change doctype from HTML to XHTML

I want to change my doctype to XHTML but it breaks all the content in my page, how to resolve the issue..? I'll show you what was the change I've done on my document. from this doc to It causes overlapping the content throughout the site, I'm shocked :( CSS styles are working, I mean in color and font sizes, but paragraphs widen to the right side. Can anyone tell a solution..? I'm changing the doctype because something like a floating Ad is works only in XHTML format in IE it doesn't support the HTML format that is why. Thanks in advance! Paul
