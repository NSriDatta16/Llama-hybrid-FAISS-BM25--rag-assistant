The easiest way to test TFS2010 build template

I'm currently working on creating a build template for TFS2010 builds. However, I notice that I'm currently 'spamming' the source control with every change I make to the template (and lots more for all the fixes for those changes). I wonder what the easiest way is to test the build templates I'm creating? Is there a way to change the template file and custom activity dlls that doesn't involve checking them in? I currently have a build controller and agent running on my developer machine, which I'm using to test the template (test = start a build and hope for less errors than last time).
