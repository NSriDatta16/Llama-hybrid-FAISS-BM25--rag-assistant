How to combine two accuracy results?

If I am doing a machine learning experiment A and my accuracy lies in the interval of 0.8 +/-0.03 and I have a machine learning experiment B with an accuracy in the interval of 0.9 +/-0.1, how can I combine these two results into one? Are there any standard methods? (The accuracy numbers I gave are for test sets that contain a sample of a whole population. However, these are two totally independent populations and samples.)
