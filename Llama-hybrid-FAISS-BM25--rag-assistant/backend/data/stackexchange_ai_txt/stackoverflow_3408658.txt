I was looking on the web for information about the Dublin Core and if search engines used them and I came across the academic paper "Search Engines and Resource Discovery on the Web: Is Dublin Core an Impact Factor?" by Mehdi Safari: http://www.webology.ir/2005/v2n2/a13.html To quote his conclusions section: "it was found that using Dublin Core elements did not improve the retrieval rank of the web pages" and that "Dublin Core metadata, as a well-known metadata schema, is not widely accepted and used by search engine designers and the spiders do not consider its elements while ranking the web pages". This was back in 2005, but I am assuming this is still true.
