You cannot. Theoretically, you might involve dynamic sql here - some procedure will loop through all columns of your table (like, all_tabs_columns dictionary view in Oracle lists all columns of all tables), and form up you a query of select c1, c2 c3 ... c99 from tab , but I strongly discourage you of doing this. Will save you several lines of code, but make it hard to maintain. :)
