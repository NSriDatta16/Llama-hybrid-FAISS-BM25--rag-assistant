Uses for SQL Server schemas

It's my impression that schemas are mainly for organizing the tables, view, stored procedures, etc... in a SQL Server database. Do schemas play a bigger role (perhaps in database security, storage, etc)? Some clarification: I'm referring to "object" schemas. Sorry for the confusion. Thank you.
