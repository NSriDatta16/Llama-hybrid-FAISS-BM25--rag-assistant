Get Hidden Layers in PyTorch TransformerEncoder

I am trying to access the hidden layers when using TransformerEncoder and TransformerEncoderLayer . I could not find anything like that in the source code for these classes. I am not using hugging face but I know one can get hidden_states and last_hidden_state . I am looking for something similar. Do you know how I can access them?
