If you look for ability to share the SQL code try building a library of abstract functions. This way you could reuse some code which does generic things and keep business logic separate for each application. The same could be done with the views - they could be kept quite generic and useful for many applications. You will probably find out that there is not that many uses for common stored procedures as you go along. That said we once implemented a project which was working with a very badly designed legacy database. We've implemented a set of stored procedures which made information retrieval easy. When other people from other teams wanted to use the same information we refactored our stored procedures to make them more generic, added an extra layer of comments and documentation and allowed other people to use our procedures. That solution worked rather well.
