You can use http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splobjectstorage.php $product = new Product("cat"); $sales = new SplObjectStorage(); if(isset($sales[$product])){ $sales[$product]++; } else{ $sales[$product] = 1; } It's not a real array, but has a decent amount of array-like functionality and syntax. However, due to it being an object, it behaves like a misfit in php due to its odd foreach behavior, and its incompatibility with all the native php array functions. Sometimes you'll find it useful to convert it to a real array via $arr = iterator_to_array($sales); so it plays nice with the rest of your codebase.
