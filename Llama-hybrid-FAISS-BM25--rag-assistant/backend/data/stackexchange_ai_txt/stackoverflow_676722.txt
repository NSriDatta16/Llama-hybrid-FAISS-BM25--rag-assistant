Simple example: if cond if cond2 cmd else cmd2 Question: Where does the else belong to? For the human eye, the indentation says "to the second if " but that means nothing to a computer (except when using Python ;)). This is a shift/reduce conflict . A elegant solution is to treat the else as a left-binding operator of the highest precedence (which makes it "hang" to the closest if ). A reduce/reduce conflict is an ambiguity. I have no good example handy but it means that there are paths in the grammar where one token could cause two rules to reduce at the same time and there is no additional information to decide which rule should take precedence. [EDIT] The bison docs have an example for reduce/reduce .
