Embedding HTML in the email is not reliable, based on my experience. The problem is you cannot control what email clients your users use. Even with MS Outlook, some users may render their emails as plain text instead of HTML. In this case, all they see is bunch of ugly looking HTML tags. I don't like attaching screen-shots either simply because it takes up a lot of storage in the email accounts, and it's going to be problematic especially if your company email account has a quota. I have tried a few solutions, for me, the best approach is to send them a link that will bring them to the web report in the browser. It doesn't take up space in the email account and I can assure the report will get rendered properly.
