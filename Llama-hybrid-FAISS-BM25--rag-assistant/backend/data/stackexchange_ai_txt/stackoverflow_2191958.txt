You can calculate date difference in day, with a function like this function diff_date_day($day , $month , $year , $day2 , $month2 , $year2){ $timestamp = mktime(0, 0, 0, $month, $day, $year, 0); $timestamp2 = mktime(0, 0, 0, $month2, $month2, $year2); $diff = floor(($timestamp - $timestamp2) / (3600 * 24)); return $diff; } The make an assumption an average month is 30 days and calculate the number of months. It can be enough for some needs (displaying blog comment age, etc.) and totally unadapted for others.
