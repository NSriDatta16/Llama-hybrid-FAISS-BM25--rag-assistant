Applying PCA to Time-Series Emotional Data: Validity and Interpretation Concerns

I'm currently exploring the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to time-series data representing various "facial emotional expression" states (e.g., anger, happiness, sadness, etc.). My goal is to simplify the complex, multi-dimensional "facial emotional expression" data for better visualization and initial insights. However, I have several concerns regarding the validity and interpretation of PCA in this context: Dependence of Variables: "Emotions" are often interdependent. For instance, the presence of one "emotion" (like anger) might influence the manifestation of another (like happiness). How does this interdependence affect PCA's assumptions about variable independence? Time-Series Data: Since the data is time-series, each emotional state is not just a standalone observation but part of a sequence. Does PCA handle the sequential nature of such data effectively, or are there specific adaptations needed for time-series analysis? In exploring the application of PCA, let's assume, theoretically, we categorize the recognized 'emotions' into 'positive' and 'negative' groups. For example, based on typical human labeling, we could place emotions like happiness or surprise in one category and emotions like anger or sadness in another, and then apply PCA to each group separately. This theoretical categorization is not meant to be definitive but rather a simplified model for analysis. Would this approach, assuming such a split, help in providing clearer insights in the PCA results, or could it potentially lead to an oversimplification of the emotional spectrum? Overall Emotional Reflection: One aim is to visualize an "overall emotional reflection" through PCA. Can PCA effectively capture a composite picture of "emotional states" over time, or does it miss out on crucial nuances? I would appreciate insights from the community on these concerns, especially any guidance on how to best approach PCA for "emotional data" in a time-series format. Are there particular pitfalls or best practices I should be aware of? Additionally, if PCA is not the most suitable method for this kind of data, what alternatives might you recommend (except Hidden Markov) ? Thank you for your time and expertise! Important note: The emotional data used here originates from a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) algorithm that identifies various expressions like anger, happiness, sadness, etc. I understand the complexity and subjective nature of human emotions and recognize that these algorithmic classifications are not definitive representations of actual emotional states. They are, however, useful indicators for the purpose of this analysis. Also, Itâ€™s important to clarify that the aim here is not to fit a definitive model, but rather to use PCA as a tool for reducing the complexity of data for general visualization and gaining an initial understanding of the overall "emotional" trends.
