concatenating unknown-length strings in COBOL

How do I concatenate together two strings, of unknown length, in COBOL? So for example: WORKING-STORAGE. FIRST-NAME PIC X(15) VALUE SPACES. LAST-NAME PIC X(15) VALUE SPACES. FULL-NAME PIC X(31) VALUE SPACES. If FIRST-NAME = 'JOHN ' and LAST-NAME = 'DOE ' , how can I get: FULL-NAME = 'JOHN DOE ' as opposed to: FULL-NAME = 'JOHN DOE '
