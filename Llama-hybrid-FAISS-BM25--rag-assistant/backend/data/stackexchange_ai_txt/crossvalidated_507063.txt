You can relate Price to Year using time series regression . A time series regression model for the setting you mention could be formulated like so: $Price_t = \alpha_0 + \beta_0 Year_t + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t$ could be temporally correlated and t = 1, ..., n. For example, $\epsilon_t$ could follow an AR(1) process. In practice, you would need to determine what kind of process best captures the temporal dependence of the model errors. Usually, with data collected every year, people assume that the underlying process is something like an ARIMA(p,d, q) process and then they determine the values of p, d and q which are best supported by the data. See here for an example of time series regression with ARIMA errors in R: https://otexts.com/fpp2/regarima.html .
