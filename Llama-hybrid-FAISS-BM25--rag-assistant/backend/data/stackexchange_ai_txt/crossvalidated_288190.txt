Best linear predictors given ACF and Mean

I am working on the following problem and cannot seem to arrive at the correct solution: Let X1, X2, … be a stationary time series with mean μ=5 and ACF p(h)=(0.9)^|h|. Demonstrate that the best linear predictor for Xn+2 of the type aXn+b is a = 0.81 and b = 0.95 From my reading I understand that we use a MSE approach to find the appropriate a and b. Now if we had some data it would be straightforward to run a MSE and find them, but how would one express this solution in a purely analytical manner? Any resources or hints would be appreciated! :)
