When is it preferable to store data members as references instead of pointers?

Let's say I have an object Employee_Storage that contains a database connection data member. Should this data member be stored as a pointer or as a reference? If I store it as a reference, I don't have to do any NULL checking. (Just how important is NULL checking anyway?) If I store it as a pointer, it's easier to setup Employee_Storage (or MockEmployee_Storage ) for the purposes of testing. Generally, I've been in the habit of always storing my data members as references. However, this makes my mock objects difficult to set up, because instead of being able to pass in NULL s (presumably inside a default constructor) I now must pass in true/mock objects. Is there a good rule of thumb to follow, specifically with an eye towards testability?
