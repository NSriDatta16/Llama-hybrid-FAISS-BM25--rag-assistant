Standard Deviation and Mean

I have a very basic question about standard deviations. I have information on different units, $i$ over time horizon $t$ (I have panel data). Let me denote the variable of interest as $y_{it}$ which I observe for each individual. I want to see whether or not there is a relationship between the average value of $y_i$ across individuals and the standard deviation of $y_i$ . In other words, I want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of this variable for each individual and the see if there is a relationship between the mean and variability of this variable. I graphed these variables and I was surprised to see a very clear positive relationship between the mean and standard deviation. My question is: is it surprising? Did I make a conceptual mistake? I mean individuals with a higher mean value of $y_i$ will have a higher variance just because of the fact that their values of $y$ in general are bigger? In other words, should I standardize the mean as well? Thanks!
