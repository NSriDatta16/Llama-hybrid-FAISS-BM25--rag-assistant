MFC/OLE Drag & Drop - freeing Globally allocated memory

If using COleDataSource & COleDataObject, you allocate some global memory for each clipboard data format you wish to store data in the drag'n'drop operation. In the drop code, you query if the object has data in the format(s) you want and can then access & free that memory. But as a drop-target you can't know all the formats that might have data associated by the drag-source. So how can you clear all the memory allocated for the drag for every format? In fact, am I supposed to manually free this data on the drop, or let MFC/Ole do it automatically?
