Error bars when the variables are related

I am a stats novice so I'm sorry if my jargon is a bit off. I have several large samples of workers in different demographic categories from two different fields A and B. I want to compare the proportion of people in each sample (not of equal size) and try to figure out if there is a difference in the distributions the samples were drawn from. I computed the average percentage of workers in each demographic category for field A and field B. However, I wanted to construct error bars for my estimates. I realize that because I am dealing with percentages, the values in each category are all related. If one of the values is larger, the others must be small and so on. Does this affect the confidence intervals? Does it make sense to just compute the standard deviation of all "older males in field A" for instance and use that for my error bar?
