Bootstrapping a logistic regression in R, benefits?

I am currently researching the bootstrap approach and its different versions/ uses and am trying to code and explain a more intricate example of bootstrapping. I have chosen to work on a logistic regression of the titanic data set already available in the R package COUNT. I have managed to find coefficients, plot the bootstrapped results, and found the confidence intervals (just the percentile ones), however, I don't know how to explain what is being seen that is so much more interesting than when I used the bootstrap on a simple linear regression and it all feels very repetitive with 5 different confidence intervals and plots. Any suggestions on how to make more interesting discoveries or how to explain why using the bootstrap are so useful for a logistic regression would be much appreciated. here is my code so far: library(COUNT) data("titanic") set.seed(111) titanic$Survival
