Use the Factory Pattern to switch between implementations of a class? The object creation time can't be a concern now could it? When averaged over a long running time period, the biggest component of time spent should be in the main algorithm now wouldn't it? Strictly speaking, you don't really need a preprocessor to do what you seek to achieve. There are most probably other ways of meeting your requirement than the one I have proposed of course.
