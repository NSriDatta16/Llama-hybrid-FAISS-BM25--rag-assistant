XSLT: output into multiple xml files based on grouping

Let's assume, you have the xml below. The goal is to group by FirstName and export the Person into different xml files. Each output xml files should only contain up to X different FirstName. Below is an example of the desired transformation with X = 3 XML input: John Doe Jack White Mark Wall John Ding Cyrus Ding Megan Boing XML output 1 with 3 different FirstName John Doe John Ding Jack White Mark Wall XML output 2 with the 2 remaining FirstName Cyrus Ding Megan Boing It seems to me that the muenchian grouping can be used along with the to produce multiple output files. However, the core question is where we can set a threshold in number of person before exporting to a new file?
