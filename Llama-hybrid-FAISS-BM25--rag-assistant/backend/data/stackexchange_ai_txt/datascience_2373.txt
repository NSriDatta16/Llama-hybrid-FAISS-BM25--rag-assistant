Detecting Spam using Machine Learning

The most online tutorials like to use a simple example to introduce to machine learning by classify unknown text in spam or not spam. They say that this is a binary-class problem. But why is this a binary-class problem? I think it is a one-class problem! I do only need positive samples of my inbox to learn what is not spam. If I do take a bunch of not spam textes as positiv samples and a bunch of spam-mails as negativ samples, then of course it's possible to train a binary-classifier and make predictions from unlabeled data, but where is the difference to the onc-class-approach? There I would just define a training-set of all non spam examples and train some one-class classifier. What do you think?
