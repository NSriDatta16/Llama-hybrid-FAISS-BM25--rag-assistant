That should not happen. Two possibilities I can think off are maybe you have outliers, or maybe you have perfect prediction that messed up your logistic regression estimates. Since the LPM is just a linear model you can use all the diagnostics developed for that. I would use those to try to find influential observations. Perfect prediction is handeled differently in different software packages. In Stata you would get a warning, but it would still give you (problematic) estimates.
