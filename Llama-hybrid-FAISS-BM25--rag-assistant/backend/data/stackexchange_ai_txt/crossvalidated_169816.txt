Spurious regression /correlation

In a time series regression I am finding a certain predictor variable significant which should not be, according to the client. Could this be due to the higher variance that this predictor exhibits compared to the other variables in the model? In general, is there a relationship between variance and correlation and hence p-values in regression? In anothe time series regression model I am finding the log differences of a predictor (currency rates) to be significant. Our response is also log difference which fluctuates a lot.The thing is the actual currency rate moves only by a few cents a year. However we are using log differences of the currency rates and there seems to be a certain amount of variance here though not much. My question is :Can a relatively flat or constant variable be a significant predictor of something that fluctuates a lot? Doesn't taking the log difference of an almost constant variable introduce an artificial variance here, since very minor fluctuations seem to get amplified when we convert currency rates to the log scale? Note : by Log difference I mean take the log and then difference the variable.
