That is not such of a far fetched idea as it sounds. As an hosted application the organization has a bit more control over who sees the application. However, this way of going about the problem may create more problems than its worth. My suggestion is to go with an Web application. It would be easier to maintain, easier to make it asethically pleasing, easier to manage, and easier to move from server to server. Creating a distributed linux app for an small audience tends to require quite a bit of support and can lock your organization into legacy applications. Also... trust prebuilt frameworks [with web apps], don't reinvent the wheel.
