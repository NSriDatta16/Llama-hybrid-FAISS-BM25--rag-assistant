The fundamental difference is that iOS controls can have multiple actions for different events, but Mac OS X controls only have one primary action (in some cases, there are others that can be set up programatically). When you right-click on a button in a Mac nib, performClick: is under Received Actions ; it’s not an event. The only entry under Sent Actions is “selector”, which is the only thing you can connect to an action on another object. Because there is only one “sent event”, you’ll normally just control-drag/right-drag from the control to the target and select the action rather than control-clicking, selecting the event and dragging from that.
