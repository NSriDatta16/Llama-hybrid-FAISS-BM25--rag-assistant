How to concatenate the contents of all children of a node in XPath?

Is it possible with XPath to get a concatenated view of all of the children of a node? I am looking for something like the JQuery .html() method. For example, if I have the following XML: this is some text I would like an XPath query on "h3[@class='title']" that would give me "this is some text". That is the real question, but if more context/background is helpful, here it is: I am using XPath and I used this post to help me write some complex XSL. My source XML looks like this. Title Some text for this section Another paragraph Title 2 is complex Here is some text My output XML considers each as well as all tags until the next . I wrote the XSL as follows: ... ... The problem is that I use the text() method to identify h3s that are the same. In the example above, the "Title 2 is complex" title's text() method returns whitespace. My thought was to use a method like JQuery's .html that would return me "Title 2 is complex". Update: This might help clarify. After the transform, the desired output for the above would look something like this: Title Some text for this section Another paragraph Title 2 is complex Here is some text
