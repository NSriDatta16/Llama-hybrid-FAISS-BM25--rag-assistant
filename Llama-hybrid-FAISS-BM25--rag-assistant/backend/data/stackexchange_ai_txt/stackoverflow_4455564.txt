Change the three dots (ellipses) (...) to custom characters in VB.Net DataGridView when cell content is truncated

I am developing a project in VB.Net and I am using Gujarati fonts (non-Unicode). I have placed a DaraGridView (DGV) and displaying the data stored in database in DGV. In DGV, if the contents of the cell is truncated, the DGV shows ellipses (three dots) (...); but as the font is set to a Gujarati font, it displays a Gujarati alphabet "ઈઈઈ" instead of "..." because the Gujarati character "ઈ" is coded with the English "." (dot) character. In Gujarati font, "." can be generated with the English character "P". So, How can I change the ellipses to English "P" character? OR How can I remove the ellipses completely? I have found a similar solution by berc on Tuesday, August 31, 2010 1:33 PM : http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winforms/thread/95c8963f-9832-4e2d-b057-3590afe3b65d but I am not sure it is the perfect and/or the only way to do so, AND it will really work or not. If the solution on the above link of MSDN is fine, how much code from it I can remove and/or will I need more code to get it work fully?
