You can get away with not using Unicode, as long as your entire app assumes a fixed text encoding of windows-1252 (or ISO-8859-1 ). These are both pure single-byte character sets that cover all Western European alphabets. However, you should seriously consider Unicode anyway, because sooner or later you will be asked to expand text storage beyond the limits of windows-1252 . Not doing so would be like writing new code to store 2-digit years in the last decade of the 20th century.
