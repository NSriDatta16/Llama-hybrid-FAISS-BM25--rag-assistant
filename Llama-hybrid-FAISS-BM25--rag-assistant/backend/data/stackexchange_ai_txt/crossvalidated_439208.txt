Using a independent dummy variable in a multiple logistic regression model?

I'm running a multiple logistic regression model which includes as independent variables continuous, nominal dichotomous and polytomous variables (to be precise: 2 continuous, 4 nominal dichotomous and 1 polytomous). As dependent variable i use the clinical outcome at the end of follow-up. The polytomous variable refers to 6 different diagnostic subgroups; I wouldn't include this variable in the model using dummy coding because there isn't any reference group and i would like to explore the role of each diagnostic group on the clinical outcome. Can anyone help me to solve this problem?
