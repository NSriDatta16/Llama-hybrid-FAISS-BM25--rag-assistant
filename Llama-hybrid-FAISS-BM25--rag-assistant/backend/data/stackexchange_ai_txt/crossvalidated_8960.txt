How can I determine weibull parameters from data?

I have a histogram of wind speed data which is often represented using a weibull distribution. I would like to calculate the weibull shape and scale factors which give the best fit to the histogram. I need a numerical solution (as opposed to graphic solutions ) because the goal is to determine the weibull form programmatically. Edit: Samples are collected every 10 minutes, the wind speed is averaged over the 10 minutes. Samples also include the maximum and minimum wind speed recorded during each interval which are ignored at present but I would like to incorporate later. Bin width is 0.5 m/s
