An ordinal predictor is modeled with polynomials. That allows for a general shape of the association between the predictor and outcome. So "L" stands for the "linear" term and "Q" for the "quadratic" term with a 3-level ordinal predictor. Hazard ratios and p-values are those associated respectively with the linear and quadratic terms in the polynomial. If you use a numeric predictor as in your last example, the model assumes it has a linear association with outcome--in a Cox model, with the log-hazard. IF that association with outcome is truly linear, then the HR is that for a 1-unit increase in the predictor. If the association isn't truly linear, however,I'd be reluctant to call that an "average HR increase."
