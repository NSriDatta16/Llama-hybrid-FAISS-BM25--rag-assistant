Lagged values of features make sense with time series data, this is usually fundamental in time series analysis (because of autocorrelation). Now, whether you should include a lag or not of a feature is a different question, one that is very much data and model dependent, so we cannot answer this definitively. One thing you might check is the aforementioned autocorrelation, if a feature has autocorrelation then maybe you should include lags, if however there is no autocorrelation then lags are probably useless.
