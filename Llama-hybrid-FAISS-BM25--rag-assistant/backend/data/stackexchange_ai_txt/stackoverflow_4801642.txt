Java tutorial says I can have a package-private interface, but I can't

In the Java tutorial "Defining an Interface" , it says If you do not specify that the interface is public , your interface will be accessible only to classes defined in the same package as the interface. However, this interface PPInterface { void foo(); void bar(); } class NewClass implements PPInterface { void foo() {} void bar() {} } generates compiler errors in NewClass because I am 'attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public'. So the documentation is wrong, or I did something wrong, or I misinterpreted the documentation? I suppose I don't have to use an interface-- I like it because it keeps things nicely organized.
