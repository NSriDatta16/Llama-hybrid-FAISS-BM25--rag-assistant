Side effect / Volatile / Copy Constructor / Destructor

With reference to the discussion here $3.7.1/2 - "If an object of static storage duration has initialization or a destructor with side effects, it shall not be eliminated even if it appears to be unused, except that a class object or its copy may be eliminated as specified in 12.8." $12.8/15- "When certain criteria are met, an implementation is allowed to omit the copy construction of a class object, even if the copy constructor and/or destructor for the object have side effects." Is the above case, specific examples of a case, where even a volatile read/write may also be optimized away (e.g. if a copy constructor has a read/write to a volatile variable). So the question is "can a copy constructor be elided even if the copy constructor has a read/write of a volatile variable?"
