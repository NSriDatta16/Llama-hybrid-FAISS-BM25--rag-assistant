Answer to the question in hand All I would like to know is the overall mean (log odds ratio) and how groups A-F differ from that mean. So a couple of clarifications right away - firstly, you probably want to be comparing the group-level means to each other, not to the global mean. Certainly calculate it as a reference, but the group means contribute to the global mean, so aren't independent from it, so standard statistical tests wouldn't apply to that comparison. Secondly, every data point you've collected belongs to 2 groups: group1 is A, B or C; while group2 is D, E, or F. So you can compare A vs. B vs. C, or D vs. E vs. F, or you can compare all the unique pairs A&D vs. B&D vs. C&D vs. A&E... - but you can't simply compare your 6 groups to each other in one go. What I think you want to do is compare the proportions across groups, one variable at a time. The most direct way to answer that question is not logistic regression but a chi-squared test for proportions. The implementation in R is maybe less intuitive than the regression model, but you'll find plenty of examples, including here on Cross Validated . Here's one way to perform such a test on your data: dataset $outcome, dataset$ group1), ncol = 3))) prop.test(t(matrix(table(dataset $outcome, dataset$ group2), ncol = 3))) It shows the proportions are all very similar and none significantly different from any of the others on the A,B,C then the D,E,F dimension. Clarifications on regression Surely it's not a matter of having to estimate too many variables. As @Sextus Empiricus says in their answer, this is the issue here, and the problem is your categorical predictor variables ( group1 and group2 ) not the binary outcome variable. Basically, whenever you use categorical predictors, one of your categories needs to serve as the reference - if you supplied all the categories, your model would be over-specified (because I know if an observation isn't B and isn't C, then it must be A - you don't provide any more information by supplying A explicitly). In your case, the reference categories are A for group1 and D for group2. Your use of + 0 in the formula is basically cosmetic in this case, simply relabelling the intercept group1A (it should really say ANDgroup2D ). The way to interpret this intercept is that it is the log odds of getting 1 for an observation belonging to those reference categories. You can add the other terms to predict the log odds for another observation, so say you have group1 = B, and group2 = D, you would add the group1B coefficient to your intercept to get the log odds for that observation.
