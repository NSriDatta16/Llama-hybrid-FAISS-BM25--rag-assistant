Finding very high cumulative Poisson probabilities?

I have to find the probability of a Poisson distributed problem where the average rate of success is 40 and I need to find the probability of something being > 50. Normally I'd just either add the probabilities together manually or look at Poisson probability tables. But adding 50 probability calculations together manually takes a while. And the tables only go up to 15. So how do you find the probability when you are dealing with "large" numbers.
