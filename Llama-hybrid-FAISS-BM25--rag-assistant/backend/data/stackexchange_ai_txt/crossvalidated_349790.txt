No am not familiar with JMP software. The first analysis you describe assumes that the after measurements are independent of the before measurements and this is clearly not the cases (you have paired data). Blocking by subject will provide you with the correct test of the effect of the treatment. A simpler approach, however, is a paired t-test. This tests the null hypothesis that the average within-subject change over time is zero. There are plenty of examples and info on the paired t-test online.
