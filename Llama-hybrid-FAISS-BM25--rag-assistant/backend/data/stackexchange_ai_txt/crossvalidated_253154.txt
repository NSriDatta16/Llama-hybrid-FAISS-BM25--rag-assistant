Kalman Filter with non-contemporaneous sensors

I have spent quite a bit of time on "well-behaved" Kalman filtering problems where, say in a case with 2 sensors, we observe outputs for both sensors at each time step. However, I am struggling to extend this to a slightly different case, where, say, we run a Kalman update() for each sensor as data comes in (i.e. Kalman update() based on output from only one sensor at a time). An example application for this might be financial trade time series data, where one observes buy and sell trade prices that are some noisy estimate around a true value 'midpoint' for a stock. I'd like to update my Kalman true value estimate on updates on either buy or sell 'sensor' observations. So state is 2-D vector x might be [fair_value, bid_ask_spread_around_fair_value] and observations are 2-D vector z = [buy_trade_price, sell_trade_price], but z in practice is only a scalar (based on whatever side the trade is). Is there a recommended way to adjust the Kalman update() step to accommodate updates on each sensor independently? Is there an intuitive way to think about how the resultant covariance matrix of the state variables P is changing with this type of update step?
