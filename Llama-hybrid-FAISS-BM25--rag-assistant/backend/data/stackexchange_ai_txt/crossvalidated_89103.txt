from a Bayesian probability perspective, why doesn't a 95% confidence interval contain the true parameter with 95% probability? Two answers to this, the first being less helpful than the second There are no confidence intervals in Bayesian statistics, so the question doesn't pertain. In Bayesian statistics, there are however credible intervals , which play a similar role to confidence intervals. If you view priors and posteriors in Bayesian statistics as quantifying the reasonable belief that a parameter takes on certain values, then the answer to your question is yes, a 95% credible interval represents an interval within which a parameter is believed to lie with 95% probability. If I have a process that I know produces a correct answer 95% of the time then the probability of the next answer being correct is 0.95 (given that I don't have any extra information regarding the process). yes, the process guesses a right answer with 95% probability Similarly if someone shows me a confidence interval that is created by a process that will contain the true parameter 95% of the time, should I not be right in saying that it contains the true parameter with 0.95 probability, given what I know? Just the same as your process, the confidence interval guesses the correct answer with 95% probability. We're back in the world of classical statistics here: before you gather the data you can say there's a 95% probability of randomly gathered data determining the bounds of the confidence interval such that the mean is within the bounds. With your process, after you've gotten your answer, you can't say based on whatever your guess was, that the true answer is the same as your guess with 95% probability. The guess is either right or wrong. And just the same as your process, in the confidence interval case, after you've gotten the data and have an actual lower and upper bound, the mean is either within those bounds or it isn't, i.e. the chance of the mean being within those particular bounds is either 1 or 0. (Having skimmed the question you refer to it seems this is covered in much more detail there.) How to interpret a confidence interval given to you if you subscribe to a Bayesian view of probability. There are a couple of ways of looking at this Technically, the confidence interval hasn't been produced using a prior and Bayes theorem, so if you had a prior belief about the parameter concerned, there would be no way you could interpret the confidence interval in the Bayesian framework. Another widely used and respected interpretation of confidence intervals is that they provide a "plausible range" of values for the parameter (see, e.g., here ). This de-emphasises the "repeated experiments" interpretation. Moreover, under certain circumstances, notably when the prior is uninformative (doesn't tell you anything, e.g. flat), confidence intervals can produce exactly the same interval as a credible interval. In these circumstances, as a Bayesianist you could argue that had you taken the Bayesian route you would have gotten exactly the same results and you could interpret the confidence interval in the same way as a credible interval.
