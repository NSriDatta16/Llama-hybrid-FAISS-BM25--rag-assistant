You might want also to have a look at jmx4perl . It provides java-less access to a remote Java EE Server's MBeans. However, a small agent servlet needs to be installed on the target platform, which provides a restful JMX Access via HTTP with a JSON payload. (Version 0.50 will add an agentless mode by implementing a JSR-160 proxy). Advantages are quick startup times compared to launching a local java JVM and ease of use. jmx4perl comes with a full set of Perl modules which can be easily used in your own scripts: use JMX::Jmx4Perl; use JMX::Jmx4Perl::Alias; # Import certains aliases for MBeans print "Memory Used: ", JMX::Jmx4Perl ->new(url => "http://localhost:8080/j4p") ->get_attribute(MEMORY_HEAP_USED); You can also use alias for common MBean/Attribute/Operation combos (e.g. for most MXBeans). For additional features (Nagios-Plugin, XPath-like access to complex attribute types, ...), please refer to the documentation of jmx4perl.
