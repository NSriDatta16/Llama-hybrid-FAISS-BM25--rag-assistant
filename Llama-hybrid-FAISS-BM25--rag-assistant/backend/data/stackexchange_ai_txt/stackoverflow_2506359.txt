JQuery Two colour slider control automatic move

I am creating a slider control with two colours for media player streaming. [Covered portion with one color remaining with another] Working: i can drag/ move the slider manually. Needs: I want to move the slider automatically.(1. Once the control is ready and 2. After changing the position of the slider, from that position it has to move automatically) Code: var slider1 = new Control.Slider('handle1', 'track1', { animate: true, range: $R(0, 10), max: 10, min: 0, sliderValue: 5, startSpan: 'span1', onChange: function(v) { handleSliderChange(v); } }); Plugins: Edit: Is there any other slider control with these qualities? Geetha.
