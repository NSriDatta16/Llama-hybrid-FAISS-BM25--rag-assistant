JAVASCRIPT First, let me point out that most mobile devices have the ability to disable Javascript. Now, the most common form of redirection for mobile devices is through Javascript. (Apple's website uses this method.) When the page begins to load, a script is run to determine the User Agent, a browser-specific (and os-specific) string that details the browser type, device type, and/or operating system. This string is then matched against known mobile devices. For example: This script would redirect any browser with a user agent containing "iPhone" or "iPod" to "mobile.myurl.com". This would need to be checked for a bunch of other devices.
