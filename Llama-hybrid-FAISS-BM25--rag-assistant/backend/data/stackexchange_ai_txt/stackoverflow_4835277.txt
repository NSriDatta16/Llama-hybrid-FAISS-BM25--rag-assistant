You should be fine, if your images are not too big. If the average size of one image is about 100K, you'll need something in the order or 210MB, which would be fine. Not ideal, but fine. However, if the average size is 1MB, you're looking at roughly 2GB storage. The low end iPhones have 8GB of storage. Users take considerable amount of that space for music, pictures and apps. 2GB for single app is way too much, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get that space.
