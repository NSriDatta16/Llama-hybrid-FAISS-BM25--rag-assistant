With financial data, the question you raised was first addressed in the 1980s by Robert Engle who later got a Nobel Prize for his contributions to econometrics, as well as Tim Bollerslev. They formalized exactly what you think makes sense: the greater the change in the asset price, the more volatility will endure. Models of these type are called autoregressive conditional heteroskedastity models , or ARCH for short, and they say that variance at time $t$ is a function of the magnitudes of shocks in prior periods: $$ \sigma_t^2 = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \alpha_2 \epsilon_{t-2}^2 + \ldots + \nu_t $$ with understanding that coefficients in this model are positive. There's been an unimaginable number of extensions this model has received, including all soft of transforms, putting lags of $\sigma_t^2$ into the model, treating positive and negative shocks differently, specifying thresholds, etc. These are reduced form models, in the sense that they may not provide a clear message about the mechanism, but they fit financial data very well, and in particular generate the desirable heavy tail distributions even with $\epsilon_t$ are conditionally $N(0,\sigma_t^2)$. The heteroskedasticity test in this context would of course be the test that $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \ldots = 0$.
