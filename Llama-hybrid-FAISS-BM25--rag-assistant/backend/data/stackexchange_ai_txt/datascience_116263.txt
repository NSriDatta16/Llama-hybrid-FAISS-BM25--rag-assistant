I would use mixed effects logistic regression here; it was designed and built for things like this. Y is binary here per comment so you can use logistic regression. Energy 1 and 2 should the fixed effects here; we want to know the effect of increasing energy_1 by 10%. The random effects can be person_id and study. Person and study are just a collection of potentially infinite possibilities. We don't care what the "effect" of having person A vs Person B taking the test. By treating them as Random effects, we save degrees of freedom and can estimate the effect of energy better. Finally, note mixed effects logistic regression has a unique interpretation you should know: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/mixed-effects-logistic-regression/#:~:text=Mixed%20effects%20logistic%20regression%20is,both%20fixed%20and%20random%20effects .
