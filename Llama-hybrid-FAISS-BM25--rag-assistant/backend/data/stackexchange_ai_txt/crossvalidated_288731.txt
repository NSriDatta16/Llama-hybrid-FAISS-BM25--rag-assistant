Cross validation is the way to find if your model fits the data generating process well. As the Gaussian Processes are part of Bayesian methodology all the rules of Bayesian applies here. But your case, one data point in not good enough for GP's or for that matter any Machine Learning model. And, kernels are function's of data points, I'm sorry but you would get nothing out of this.
