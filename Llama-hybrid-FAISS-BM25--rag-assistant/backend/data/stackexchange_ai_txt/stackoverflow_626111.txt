Did you have a look at Microsoft's “What's new” document? IMHO, the benefits are gigantic because .NET 3.5 offers the Linq framework. I can't speak for ASP.NET but in general, Linq to Object is extremely powerful and increases productivity. The costs, on the other hand are relatively small (again IMHO) since Microsoft offers an effordless installation of the new .NET framework via the auto update function of Windows.
