I cannot hardcode the ID so I create a sub select to get the ID from another table. The sub select only returns one ID. Most likely, gathering statistics on the small table (while it contains a single row) will help, since that should help Oracle realize that it is small and encourage it to use the index on ID. However, it sounds like this is really not the right solution to your original problem. Generally, when one wants to perform a query repeatedly with a different lookup value, the best way is to use a bind variable. The basic method of doing this in SQLPlus would be: SQL> variable id number SQL> exec :id := 1; SQL> select * from ci.my_slow_view where id = :id ; SQL> exec :id := 2; SQL> select * from ci.my_slow_view where id = :id ; The details of implementing this depend on the environment you are developing in.
