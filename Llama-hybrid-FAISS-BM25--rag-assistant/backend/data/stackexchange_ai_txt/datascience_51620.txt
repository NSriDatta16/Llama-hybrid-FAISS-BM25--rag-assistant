What is the minimum amount of data required for sales prediction with ML

I have historical data from the MySQL DB which contains 33 months of data. The features in the data are state, depot, product type, purchase date, salesperson name, volume, and price. Using this information, I would like to predict/forecast product sales weekly, monthly, and yearly. Since I only have 34 months of data, I do not think that I can apply statistical modeling techniques like Exponential Smoothing or ARIMA. So, I just wanted to check if this data is sufficient for Machine learning modelings such as Linear Regression, SVM, or Random forest? Or any kind of feature engineering. Note: I am unable to get more data, as DB has only 34 months of data. Please suggest.
