The term deep neural nets refers to any neural network with several hidden layers. Convolutional neural nets are a specific type of deep neural net which are especially useful for image recognition. Specifically, convolutional neural nets use convolutional and pooling layers, which reflect the translation-invariant nature of most images. For your problem, CNNs would work better than generic DNNs since they implicitly capture the structure of images. If you want a good layman's introduction to deep learning and CNNs, there's a great Nature paper (if you search "deep learning nature" on Google, it's one of the top links).
