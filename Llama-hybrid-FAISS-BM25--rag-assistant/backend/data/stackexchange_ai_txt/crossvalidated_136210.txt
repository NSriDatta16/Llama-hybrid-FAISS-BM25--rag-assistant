I've been working on answering my question by calculating manually the odds and odds ratios: Acceptance blue red Grand Total 0 158 102 260 1 112 177 289 Total 270 279 549 So the Odds Ratio of getting into the school of Red over Blue is: $$ \frac{\rm Odds\ Accept\ If\ Red}{\rm Odds\ Acccept\ If\ Blue} = \frac{^{177}/_{102}}{^{112}/_{158}} = \frac {1.7353}{0.7089} = 2.448 $$ And this is the Backgroundred return of: fit At the same time, the (Intercept) corresponds to the numerator of the odds ratio , which is exactly the odds of getting in being of 'blue' family background: $112/158 = 0.7089$. If instead, I run: fit2 The returns are precisely the odds of getting in being 'blue': Backgroundblue (0.7089) and the odds of being accepted being 'red': Backgroundred (1.7353). No Odds Ratio there. Therefore the two return values are not expected to be reciprocal. Finally, How to read the results if there are 3 factors in the categorical regressor? Same manual versus [R] calculation: I created a different fictitious data set with the same premise, but this time there were three ethnic backgrounds: "red", "blue" and "orange", and ran the same sequence: First, the contingency table: Acceptance blue orange red Total 0 86 65 130 281 1 64 42 162 268 Total 150 107 292 549 And calculated the Odds of getting in for each ethnic group: Odds Accept If Red = 1.246154; Odds Accept If Blue = 0.744186; Odds Accept If Orange = 0.646154 As well as the different Odds Ratios : OR red v blue = 1.674519; OR red v orange = 1.928571; OR blue v red = 0.597186; OR blue v orange = 1.151717; OR orange v red = 0.518519; and OR orange v blue = 0.868269 And proceeded with the now routine logistic regression followed by exponentiation of coefficients: fit Yielding the odds of getting in for "blues" as the (Intercept) , and the Odds Ratios of Orange versus Blue in Backgroundorange , and the OR of Red v Blue in Backgroundred . On the other hand, the regression without intercept predictably returned just the three independent odds : fit2
