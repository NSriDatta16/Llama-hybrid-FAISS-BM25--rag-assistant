How to use principal components in R to apply a multinomial logistic regression?

Context: I have an original dataset of +- 20k rows (samples) and 253 features (deletions, insertions and substitutions). These columns/dimensions/features are called SNVs (single nucleotide variants from different SARS-CoV-2 strains). After adjusting some of the variables, I was left with +- 19k samples and 19 variables (insertions, deletions and substitutions). The 1st variable is the "clade"(groups such as Delta, Omicron variants, etc) : 1 19A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 20B 4 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 3 20A 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 20B 4 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 5 20A 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 I've used the library factoextra and factominer to apply the PCA and I've gotten these results: A matrix with this output: Dim.1 Dim.2 Dim.3 Dim.4 Dim.5 1 0.8093387170 -6.3198529745 -1.0274428559 -9.027631e-02 0.4655408780 2 0.7784308534 -5.2043922005 -0.1307601776 2.086402e-01 -1.1093766380 3 0.5896404096 -5.7720340307 -0.9180944507 -6.990509e-02 0.6177750772 4 0.7784308534 -5.2043922005 -0.1307601776 2.086402e-01 -1.1093766380 5 0.5896404096 -5.7720340307 -0.9180944507 -6.990509e-02 0.6177750772 6 0.5896404096 -5.7720340308 -0.9180944507 -6.990509e-02 0.6177750772 7 0.4240139051 -5.3435222802 -0.5281714944 7.112027e-02 -0.1740873901 8 0.5896404096 -5.7720340308 -0.9180944507 -6.990509e-02 0.6177750772 9 0.6148153756 -5.4065982562 -0.7704924684 -1.560130e-01 0.6866722240 10 0.9721157126 -5.0066038782 -0.2534396294 2.053737e-01 -1.0174806249 ....

And I got this graph: I'd now like to apply a Multinomial logistic regression . The goal is to pass a specific sequence to this logistic regression model and predict the SARS-CoV-2 variant/strain. How could I train this model using the results from 2 or 3 principal components (the first 3 dimensions, for example) from the factoextra package? I was trying to use the multinom in R, but I'm not sure how I could pass the dimensions and split them into training and testing data Thank you in advance!
