Let me try and answer the question: "However, how does the author identify the matrices' priors in Q, W, and S (in pg. 13) and, for example, choosing the value 40 (the training sample) as the variance for our prior?" Specifically, let me try to explain the the prior for Q. The author states that his choice for the prior of the state error variance, Q, is an inverse Wishart distribution: $Q \sim IW(\Sigma,T)$, where $\Sigma$ is the scale matrix and $T$ the degrees of freedom. Two things are crucial in this distribution: (i) its interpretation and (ii) how to use pre-sample information in order to parameterize the prior. (i) The inverse Wishart, like the Wishart, can be interpreted as generating sums of squares from samples of size $T$ of observations drawn from the multivariate normal distribution (check Nydick, 2012 , for a quick read on these distributions.) $\Sigma$, as Primiceri hints at on the first paragraph of page 831, can be interpreted as the population value of the variance/covariance matrix of the multivariate normal. So if $T\rightarrow\infty$, by the Law of Large Numbers, your sample sum of squares should be equal to the population sum of squares. Hence, the higher is $T$, the tighter is your prior. What is the relationship of the IW with $Q$? Note that the expected value of a variable $X$ distributed according to IW is $E(X) = \frac{\Sigma}{T - p -1}$, where p is the dimension of $X$. As you can see, if $\Sigma$ is a sum of squares, $E(X)$ is a variance, which is what we are trying to model (Primiceri, 2005, actually clears this up in footnote 20 on page 842.) (ii) To set the value of $\Sigma$, the scale matrix for the prior of the state error covariance, Primiceri (2005) uses the OLS estimate of the VCV of parameters, $Var(\hat{B}_{OLS})$. Since $\bf{Var(\hat{B}_{OLS})}$ is a variance, he must multiply it by the pre-sample size, in order to obtain the pre-sample sum of squares . Since he used a pre-sample of 40, in my view, the number of degrees of freedom should be $40-p-1$, where $p$ is the number of parameters he is estimating, just like he does for the other two matrices (although I assume that this is of little consequence for the results.) Therefore, the expected value of his prior is $\frac{Var(\hat{B}_{OLS})\times(T-p-1)}{T - p -1} = Var(\hat{B}_{OLS})$. Hope this helps
