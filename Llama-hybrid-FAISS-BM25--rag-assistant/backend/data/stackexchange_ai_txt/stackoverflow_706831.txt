I write a log file as well as have an email sent to a common address that will never go away. Neither are bullet proof but I would think that if our mail system is down or the email server changes we would know about it. I do have some apps that write to both a database and a flat file and send the email. So one of the 3 is going to work. I found one of my apps was writing to a db for the log and in the catch it was writing to the same db and the only way I found it was the app was failing because of some changes in the db connection. I made sure to modify that catch statement do the email instead of the db. The only problem I have with flat files is file system storage, we have a lot of applications that write flat files for logs so we are constantly backing them up and saving them or just plain deleting them.
