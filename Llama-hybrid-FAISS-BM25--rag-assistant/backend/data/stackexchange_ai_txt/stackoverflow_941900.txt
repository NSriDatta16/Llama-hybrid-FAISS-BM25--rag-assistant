First get familiar again with pointers, references, etc. Then I'd just stick with Qt. Qt's documentation rules and IIRC, Qt's containers are even more efficient than STL's. The fact that the code for your Qt GUI is then even more elegant also adds to Qt's appeal. Add to the fact that Qt's docs also contain many simple and some relatively advanced code examples which you can play with, and you should be up to speed again in no time. It wouldn't hurt to know/use STL/Boost though. But stay (far) away from GTK.
