building an app to cater for WP7,Iphone & Android

I am about to start building an app that will be used across all platforms. I will using monotouch and monodriod so I can keep things in .net I'm a little lazy so I want to be able to reuse as much code as possible. Lets say I want to create an application that stores contact information. e.g. Name & Phone number My application needs to be able to retrieve data from a web service and also store data locally. The MVVM pattern looks like the way to go but im not sure my approach below is 100% correct Is this correct? A project that contains my models A project that contains my views,local storage methods and also view models which I bind my views to. In this case there would be 3 different projects based on the 3 os's A data access layer project that is used for binding to services and local data storage Any suggestions would be great. Thanks for your time
