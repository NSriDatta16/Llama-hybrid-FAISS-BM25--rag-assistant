Require.js is great tool, you can use it also on the client side. But be careful when you use it on mobile. In such case you should either use the editor to navigate better in one file or use thing like sprocket . It is a "precompiler", does not put any additional library to your code. I passed through your sliced up code. Probably you should define the different parts as modules, read the requirejs documentation for defining modules , it gives good assistance. But think twice whether you really need for organizing your code an extra library.
