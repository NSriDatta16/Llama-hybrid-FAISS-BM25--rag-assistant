Clustering algorithms based on lists of most similar items?

I'm a beginner to machine learning. I have a large dataset of items, each with a limited set of most similar items in the dataset, which I would like to create clusters of, preferably each having the same size, although this isn't necessary. Could someone point me in the right direction? Thanks.
