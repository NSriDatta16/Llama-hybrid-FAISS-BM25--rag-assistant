xgboost - what is the difference between the tree booster and the linear booster?

I am aware of gradient boosted trees. The extreme-gradient boosting algrithm is widely applied these days. What excactly is the difference between the tree booster (gbtree) and the linear booster (gblinear)? What I understand is that the booster tree grows a tree where a fit (error rate for classification, sum-of-squares for regression) is refined taking into account the complexity of the model. What is done differently in a linear booster?
