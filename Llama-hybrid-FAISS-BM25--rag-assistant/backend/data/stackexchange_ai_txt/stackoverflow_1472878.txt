Detecting horizontal swipes in a UIScrollView with a vertical scroll

I have a UIScrollView that's around 600 pixels in height and 320 in width. So I'm allowing the user to scroll vertically. I'm also trying to capture horizontal swipes on the view. The problem seems to be that when a user swipes horizontally with some accidental vertical movement, the UIScrollView scrolls and my touchesEnded delegate method never gets called. Here's my code: - (void)touchesEnded: (NSSet *)touches withEvent: (UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; if (currentPosition.x + 35 gestureStartPoint.x) { NSLog(@"Left"); } else if (!self.dragging) { [self.nextResponder touchesEnded: touches withEvent:event]; } [super touchesEnded: touches withEvent: event]; } Does anyone know how I can get this to work even when there is vertical drag involved?
