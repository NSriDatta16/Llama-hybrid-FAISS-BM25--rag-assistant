There are many variations on this theme. For good information, please read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication . Then read this: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2617 Generally: You only store a digest. Never a password. Following RFC2617, you should store a digest of username, realm and password. The client ("agent") takes username, password, realm, etc., and creates a digest, which it sends to your server. Your server, based on username, looks up it's version of the digest. If their digest == the digest saved in the server, you agree on the password (and everything else). If their digest != the digest saved in the server, you disagree on the password (or something else). Which means they didn't get the realm or username right, or they didn't get the nonce right, or something else went wrong. They can't be trusted. The full RFC2617 includes other data to compute a digest of other stuff and the password digest just to be absolutely sure that the client is doing the responding.
