How to completely dump the data for Django-CMS

I have an instance of Django-CMS already running in a production environment. I would like to dump all the data related to the CMS (PAGES and PLUGINS) so that I may load it back into my development environment. When I do python manage.py dumpdata cms it dumps most of the data, but not all of it. None of the content for the plugins is dumped. When I look at the django-cms source, I see that the plugins are organized in a different folder than the rest of the models - I'm sure this has something to do with the behavior of dumpdata . Does anyone know how they would achieve what I am trying to do? Thanks for your help/answers!
