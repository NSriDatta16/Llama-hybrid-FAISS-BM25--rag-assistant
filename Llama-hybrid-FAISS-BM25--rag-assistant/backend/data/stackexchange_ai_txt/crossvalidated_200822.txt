binary logistic regression p values problem

i made different models . in first I took a dependent variable and four independent variables . in second model I took different dependent variable and similar independent variable like wise I made four models but when I ran binary logistic regression I found similar p values in all models despite of different dependent variables could this happen or am I making any mistake actually I code the dependent variable as 0 and 1 in all models and independent variables in all models are same as bmi, whr, age and % body fat then p values in binary logistic regression become similar I am confused here rather the dependent variables are also linked with each other but in original test results they have different values
