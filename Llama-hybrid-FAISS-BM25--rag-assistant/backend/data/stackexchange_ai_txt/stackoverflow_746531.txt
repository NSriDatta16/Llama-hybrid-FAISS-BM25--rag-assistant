Is it wrong to change a block element to inline with CSS if it contains another block element?

I know it's wrong to put a block element inside an inline element, but what about the following? Imagine this valid markup: This is a paragraph Now add this CSS: div { display:inline; } This creates a situation where an inline element contains a block element (The div becomes inline and the p is block by default) Are the page elements still valid? How and when do we judge if the HTML is valid - before or after the CSS rules are applied? UPDATE: I've since learned that in HTML5 it is perfectly valid to put block level elements inside link tags eg: Heading Paragraph. This is actually really useful if you want a large block of HTML to be a link.
