The caret package does not implement the random forest algorithm itself, it calls external functions. In this case I guess it calls the ranger package . Together with the most traditional splitting rules like gini, information gain or variance also allows to consider extra trees as splitting rule, described here , which basically "splits nodes by choosing cut-points fully at random".
