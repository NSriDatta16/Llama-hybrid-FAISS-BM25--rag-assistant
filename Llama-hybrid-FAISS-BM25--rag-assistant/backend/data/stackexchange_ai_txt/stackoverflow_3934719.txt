I know you are not looking for alternatives, but using a MessageQueue (such as MSMQ) could be a good solution for this problem in the future. Using multithreading in asp.net is normally discouraged, but in your current situation I don't see why you shouldn't. It is definitely possible, but beware of the pitfalls related to multithreading ( stolen here ): •There is a runtime overhead associated with creating and destroying threads. When your application creates and destroys threads frequently, this overhead affects the overall application performance. •Having too many threads running at the same time decreases the performance of your entire system. This is because your system is attempting to give each thread a time slot to operate inside. •You should design your application well when you are going to use multithreading, or otherwise your application will be difficult to maintain and extend. •You should be careful when you implement a multithreading application, because threading bugs are difficult to debug and resolve.
