On the Frequency of Severe Terrorist Events This paper attempts to model the likelihood that a terrorist attack of any given severity occurs. The conclusion is that terrorist events follow a power law distribution, which is 'tail heavy'. What this means is that most terrorism related deaths happen due to things like 9/11, which appear to be outliers, or, as the author puts it The regular scaling in the upper tails of these distributions immediately demonstrates that events orders of magnitude larger than the average event size are not outliers, but are instead in concordance with a global pattern in the frequency statistics of terrorist attacks. The chart likely does not account for this - it seems to be simply counting the number of people who have been killed by terrorists. By way of analogy, the vast majority of earthquake deaths in California came from a single quake in 1906. Modelling the threat posed by earthquakes has to take into account the risk of really big earthquakes, modelling the risk of terrorism has to take into account the risk of really big terrorism.
