You will find no fully automated way of doing this. The structure and business rules of your database will be required in order to determine how to reduce the data. I would suggest running through your highest level tables that have a good spread of data picking a few and working from there. In order to actually perform the data import/export. I would actually consider taking a backup and copy of the database, then running a bunch of delete statements until it's down to your required size. Then re-organising, shrinking and backing up again to restore locally.
