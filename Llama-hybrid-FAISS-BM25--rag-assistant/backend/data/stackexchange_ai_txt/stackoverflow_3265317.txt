File system access with JavaScript in the browser is not allowed - it basically violates the sandbox policy. See this previous SO post and this article . JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the web. Browser authors contain this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. What you're talking about doing can be done with a Silverlight app, ActiveX control (ugh!), Adobe Flash/AIR (I don't really know that platform), etc. Something with local storage that runs as essentially a plug-in to the browser. If you don't want to go that route, then I think all you can do is store the data in a hidden value in your markup...but I wouldn't advise it. I agree with jAndy - go with serverside db storage.
