One option is to model the target variable of "sustained participation” as an index. An index is a compound measure that aggregates multiple indicators. Examples of indexes are index funds which aggregates many stocks and gross domestic product (GDP) which estimates the total market value of a country. In your example, you would create a separate model that estimates the "sustained participation” index. That model could be a collections of handcrafted rules or could use machine learning. The advantage of creating an index is having a single, continuous valued number that could then used as a target in regression.
