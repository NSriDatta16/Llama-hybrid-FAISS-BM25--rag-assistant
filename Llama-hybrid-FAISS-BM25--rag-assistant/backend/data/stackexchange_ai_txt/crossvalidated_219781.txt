I quite like the example by Nassim Taleb (which was an adaptation of an earlier example by Bertrand Russell): Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird's belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race "looking out for its best interests," as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief. Some mathematical analogs are the following: knowledge of the first few Taylor coefficients of a function does not always guarantee that the succeeding coefficients will follow your presumed pattern. knowledge of a differential equation's initial conditions does not always guarantee knowledge of its asymptotic behavior (e.g. Lorenz's equations, sometimes distorted into the so-called "butterfly effect") Here is a nice MO thread on the matter.
