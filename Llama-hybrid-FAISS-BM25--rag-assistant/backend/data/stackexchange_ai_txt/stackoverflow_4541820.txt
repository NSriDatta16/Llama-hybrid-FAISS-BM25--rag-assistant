You will want to change your url match logic to a regular expression based one where you check to see if the first part of your url matches the expected sequence for this "category". This is of course assuming that each page within a category is organized so that the url indicates what "category" it is in: ex. http://www.mysite.com/cars/priceguide.html http://www.mysite.com/cars/listings.html http://www.mysite.com/buses/priceguide.html In the example above the first two links are in the "cars" category and the last is in the "buses" category.
