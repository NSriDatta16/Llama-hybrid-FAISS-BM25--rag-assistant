Why wouldn't you treat each grade as a separate feature of the same model? student['age'] = 23 student['gender'] = 'male' ... student['grade_in_organic_chemistry'] = 'B+' student['grade_in_classical_physics'] = 'A-' I guess I'm not seeing why you would want to "aggregate" or join together multiple classifiers when the grades can just be distinct features? (Please excuse the lame psuedocode above, but just trying to demonstrate my point)
