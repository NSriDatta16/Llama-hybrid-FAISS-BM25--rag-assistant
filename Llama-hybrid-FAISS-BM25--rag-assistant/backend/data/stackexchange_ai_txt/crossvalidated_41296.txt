Cointegration testing with a dummy variable

I have the model: $y_t = \alpha + \beta_1 x_t + \beta_2 D_t x_t + \epsilon_t$ With $y_t$ and $x_t$ as $I(1)$ processes, and $D_t =1$ during a large financial crisis, $D_t = 0$ during non-crisis periods. I have been asked to test this equation for cointegration. When I test whether $\hat{\epsilon}_t$ is $I(0)$ as you would in the 2-step Engle-Granger methodology, which test am I using? I've heard that ADF is biased under 2-step Engle-Granger. * *Third link in the Google search. When the word document opens go to page 3 and look for the paragraph that begins with " The initial studies ... "
