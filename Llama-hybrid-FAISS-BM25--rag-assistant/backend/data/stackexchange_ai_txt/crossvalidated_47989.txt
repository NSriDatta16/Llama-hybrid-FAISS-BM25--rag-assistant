Count explanatory variable, proportion dependent variable

I am having a little trouble coming up with a way of analyzing my data. If there is a short answer (i.e., "use logistic regression, dummy") you can just post that and I'll do some digging on my own - I just need to be pointed in the right direction... My independent variable is a count and my dependent variable is a ratio. Here is the data: success IIRC, It's wrong to do a simple linear regression of ratio ~ count... so what method should I utilize here? Thanks for the help. Okay, so here's some of the code I ran after following gung's advice of employing the use of the GEE: subject Does this look correct? And, if I am interpreting it correctly, there is a significant effect of count on the proportion.
