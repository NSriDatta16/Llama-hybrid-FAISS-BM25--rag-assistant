If $p$ represents the probability of YES, so that $$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$$ is the log odds of a YES, then $1-p$ is the probability of a NO. This means that the log odds of a NO is $$\log\left(\frac{1 - p}{1-(1-p)}\right) = \log\left(\frac{1 - p}{p}\right) = - \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$$ So the log odds of a NO is the negative of the log odds of a YES. Therefore, in the context of your logistic regression, the log odds of a NO is $$ 3.70 - 0.02 \times Age - 0.17 \times Gender $$
