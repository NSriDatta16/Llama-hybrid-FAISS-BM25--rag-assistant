There are probably some jupyter notebook plugins like this that can do that but it seems very expensive to keep track of the history of every object update made in a big notebook (which seems to be your case). A suggestion I would make is to try to keep a more organized approach to you notebook development. Notebooks are a great tool to develop code in the process of data analysis and exploration but if you are creating processing steps that should be applied on your data, data scrutures or models maybe it is easier to develop this code in a separate .py script and import the function inside your notebook. This way you are always using the same version of your function and changing it would change every time you apply it (of course the problem of having to run the whole notebook again could appear).
