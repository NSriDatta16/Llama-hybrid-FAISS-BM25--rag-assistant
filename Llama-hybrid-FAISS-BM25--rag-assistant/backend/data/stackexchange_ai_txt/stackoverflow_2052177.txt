I would typically expect the reverse... Is it possible that there are big swaths of code inside preprocessor included blocks that only get included in release builds? Template code is especially suspect in this case. Update I think that the issue is most likely caused by linking to static libs in release mode, and shared libs in debug mode... +1 karoberts
