ecologists, if I have diversity data (Shannon's index) for years and sites how can I produce data just for the sites (explained better below)

I have 3 sites each split into the same 3 zones. With abundance data taken on 4 different years. I have produced diversity index readings for each zone at each site, for each year. If I'm not trying to look at the change over time, how would I go about calculating the values for each zone/site (using each year as a replication). I contemplated using the diversity readings I have already produced to calculate the mean biodiversity at each, i.e. the average diversity over the years at a particular zone/site. or do I rectify the code to sum all the year data for a specific zone/site, and calculate its biodiversity then? I am unsure about this as I cant tell whether doing such would produce an accurate reading as I don't know if doing so would treat the years as replications for the data collection.
