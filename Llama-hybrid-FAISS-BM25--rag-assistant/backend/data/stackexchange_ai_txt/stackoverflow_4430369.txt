You should wait (but not long!) for a new failing test. At the moment you've turned your test green with a fake, you've got exactly the knowledge you need: you know what you're trying to develop, you know that you have a little unit test coverage for it, and you know that it's easy to fake out that test. And you know you've faked it. So this is the moment to figure out another test that the current fake won't pass. Bring your bar back to red - and now you've got another decision to make: fake it more or make it right? If it's easier to keep the fake going, fake it some more and iterate. But if it's easier, finally, to write the code you know you need: write it. You'll be writing it safely, with just enough test coverage to feel good about it. Perfect!
