template for documenting technology stack

I have to document the technology stack for my platform on which products are built by other groups and organizations. Do you guys suggest any templates (standard or not) for this? I believe there are templates out there but googling did not help much I am also trying to find an article that was posted on www.javalobby.com sometime ago that had all the categories I need and also the suggested libraries. For e.g for Category=caching, library=ehcache. If anyone of you are aware of than article, please provide the link. This is not a subjective question. I am just looking for various ways of documenting the stack. thank you.
