By its very nature, Neural Networks are used to only approximate one given function. So it will work quite well for tasks where you do not need very precise information to perform, for example to recognise a picture you do not need to actually know every details of the picture. However, in your case, you really want to know the exact value of a specific function F (here n-> n^2). Thus in general you can not do that, except if your NN already contains the function F in itself (or with parameters). For example, usually NN uses very transcendental functions as tanh, for which I do not see how can produce a polynomial for you.
