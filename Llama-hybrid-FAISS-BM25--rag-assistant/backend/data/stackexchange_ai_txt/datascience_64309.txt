How to create list of multi value in a list format of each field in a single column?

I am very new to programming and python; coming from functional background. I am currently using a tutorial: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/04/predicting-movie-genres-nlp-multi-label-classification/ The purpose of this tutorial is to build a model that can predict genre of a movie just using the plot details (available in Text Form). I am mapping this concept to create tag/prediction of customer complaint register . For example: 1 Movie --> Many Genres (horror, fantasy) 1 complain --> many Genre (Warranty, Air Conditioning) I am currently up to the stage to make the genre into list format then get the genre tags in a list (unique) but I don't how to achieve it in Python. i.e. line 0 i showing Warranty and Heating/Cooling as 1 value instead of having its own quote ''?
