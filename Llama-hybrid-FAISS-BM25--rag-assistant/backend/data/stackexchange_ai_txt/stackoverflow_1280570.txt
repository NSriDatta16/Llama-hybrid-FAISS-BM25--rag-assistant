I don't think there's any good solution to your question, I mean, other than the obvious tools that you're obviously aware would mediate the issues you're running into. It's not a fun situation to be in but we've all been there. Try to work the words "source control" and "testing" and such into your conversations with the other developers and maybe it will start to sink in. Until then, just realize that all these less elegant methods you're using to cover your ass are going to make you a better developer once you get into a better work environment... and look for another job. ;)
