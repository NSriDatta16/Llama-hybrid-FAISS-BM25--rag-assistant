What's the best approach to embed RegEx in Oracle or SQL Server 2005 SQL?

This is a 3 part question regarding embedded RegEx into SQL statements. How do you embed a RegEx expression into an Oracle PL/SQL select statement that will parse out the “DELINQUENT” string in the text string shown below? What is the performance impact if used within a mission critical business transaction? Since embedding regex into SQL was introduced in Oracle 10g and SQL Server 2005, is it considered a recommended practice? Dear Larry : Thank you for using ABC's alert service.
