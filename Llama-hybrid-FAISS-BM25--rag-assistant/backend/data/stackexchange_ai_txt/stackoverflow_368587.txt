Sending HTML emails that renders correctly in Notes 7

Does anyone here has any experience on how to send HTML emails that renders correctly on a Lotus Notes Client 7? My email has a couple of complex CSS files and I tried embedding them on tags, but it doesn't seem to work. The thing is that the email renders perfectly in version 8 and on other email clients. Any hints or pointers? Thanks!
