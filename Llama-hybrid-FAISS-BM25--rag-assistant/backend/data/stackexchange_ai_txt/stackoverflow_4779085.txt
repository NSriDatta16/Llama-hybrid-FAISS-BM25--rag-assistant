You need to pass Greater to sort_heap as with all the other heap operations. sort_heap (v.begin(),v.end(), Greater); As @Blastfurnace mentions, std::greater () is preferable to defining your own function. Besides the elegance factor, there is a performance issue: when you pass a function by reference for implicit conversion to a functor, it is first implicitly converted to a function pointer, which can result in less efficient execution due to an indirect branch instruction.
