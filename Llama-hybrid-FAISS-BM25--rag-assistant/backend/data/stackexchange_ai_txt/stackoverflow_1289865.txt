Off the top of my head (and I was not able to find any information online), I would think that if you are using an SVN client that supports the file:// protocol ( TortoiseSVN , for example), it should work correctly. However, and unfortunately I cannot find the document, I do remember there being certain problems with the file:// protocol and SVN. If possible, I would suggest setting up an SVN server ( VisualSVN works very nicely and is easy to setup) rather than relying on a Windows share. Edit: I found this discussion on Stackoverflow. It seems as though there is not a problem using the file protocol. Edit 2: Neil's link is what I had read awhile back and does discourage the file protocol. However, if using the file:// protocol means the difference between using and not using source control, I would recommend at least using that. Some source control is better than nothing.
