SVM and SMO main differences

I am unable to clearly see the main differences between SVM & SMO . While I get the fact that SMO provides better algorithm for QP solvers but I see that when I use this in Weka on my MacBook it nearly took 12 hours for 46 features (â‰ˆ40K feature vectors) of size 5MB dataset (whereas SVM took about 50 minutes). Where does the optimization kick in? or Whats the catch. FYI, I am trying to build a binary classifier.
