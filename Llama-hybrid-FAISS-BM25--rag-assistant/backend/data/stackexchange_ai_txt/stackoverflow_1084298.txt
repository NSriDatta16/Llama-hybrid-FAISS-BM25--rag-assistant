Your statement: A Dog is a mammal. It may Bark and Run. To Run it uses its feet to move forward. It does Lay. Doesn't sound like a real natural language, but a form of controlled language . Two examples which have machine comprehensible semantics are Attempto Controlled English which maps to conceptual graphs , and Gellish which is used as a data modelling language. I can't think of a direct translation of your statements about 'A Dog', as the first statement appears to be talking about the sub-type of mammals which are dogs, but then you start talking about a single instance; you'd need to be a bit more rigorous to use existing controlled languages, something like. Every dog is a mammal. Every dog may bark, or run. To run is a forward movement. Every dog uses its feet to run. Every dog does lay. ( though this loses any idea of from time to time about the laying ) What would "uses" imply? What did "uses" imply in your example? And I was describing the instance methods of the object “Dog”. I never said anything like “Spot is a Dog. Spot starts to run.” Is "A Dog" an object, or were you referring to the class of all dogs? You appeared to be referring to all dogs, and most controlled languages require that distinction. "A Dog is a mammal" vs "A Dog is in the garden". It's called "the elephant problem" in nlp books. To me this would create the instance and tell the instance to run. I don’t know how I would describe a static method for a dog. There's no such thing as a 'static method' in natural language, so why would you expect to be able to describe such a thing in something derived from a natural language? You can scope define a relation which has a scope "If the topic of discussion is Dogs, then bark is a verb", but there isn't much call for defining the scope of a relation ( a static method is just a function with its scope defined within a class ); normally its not ambiguous.
