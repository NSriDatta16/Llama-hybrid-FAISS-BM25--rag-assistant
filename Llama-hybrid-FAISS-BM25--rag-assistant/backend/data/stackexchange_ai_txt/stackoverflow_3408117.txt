Yes. It would be too hard for a COMPLETE beginner to take on. Where complete beginner = just learning to program. If you have some other background (General CS knowledge, Database experience) then you could probably do it. JavaScript doesn't sound necessary for what you are describing. I would suggest going through a couple tutorials on web application development so that you understand the basic concepts, and then decide whether you know enough to start building your game app. Here are a couple tutorials for various development environments: http://webproject.scottgu.com/CSharp/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.aspx http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/community/tutorials/BuildJ2EEWebApp/BuildJ2EEWebApp.html http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/WebApp.html You should probably at least read through some of those to get an idea of what you should know.
