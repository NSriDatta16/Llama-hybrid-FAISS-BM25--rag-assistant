This is exactly what one of the goals of Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) is. It allows you to abstract your authentication code away with different providers. They have a very complete developer training kit , and there are modules avaiable to authenticate with all kinds of different protocols (OpenID, OAuth, Facebook, LiveID...) or you can use ACS to provide the abstraction around all the different protocols.
