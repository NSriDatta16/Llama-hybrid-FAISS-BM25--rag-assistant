Choice of priors to connect a half-life random variable with a Bernoulli trial

In my application ( spaced-repetition system for quizzes), I have an unknown half-life (in units of time), $h>0$. This half-life governs a Bernoulli trial $X$, such that $P(X=1) = 2^{-t / h}$, for some known, deterministic time $t>0$ (same units as $h$, this corresponds to when the Bernoulli test was conducted). I’d like to know what prior to place on $h$ such that the posterior $P(h | x)$ is conjugate, i.e., $h \sim \, ??? $ such that $π = 2^{-t/h}$, a deterministic function, and $x \sim Bernoulli(π)$, so that the posterior $p(h | x) \propto p(x | h) \cdot p(h)$ has same structure as $p(h)$, i.e., conjugate. I’d be happy to give $h$ a Gamma prior, because that’s conjugate to the Exponential distribution, which $π$ appears to have, up to a constant factor, but my experimental result, $x$, is binary-valued, not a count as expected by an Exponential random variable. I’d also be happy to give $π$ a Beta prior, since that’s the conjugate prior to the Bernoulli distribution, but I can’t find a neat way to convert a Beta-distributed $π$ into any kind neat distribution on $h$. I’d like everything to be conjugate to allow for quick updates for online updates (i.e., successive $x$ will come irregularly as a student learns a fact). If I must do MCMC, that’ll greatly expand the memory/storage requirements between updates.
