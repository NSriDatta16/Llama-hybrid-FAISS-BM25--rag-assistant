EDIT I'll leave this attempt for posterity, but please note that it is incorrect and will not work. One "clever" way you could do it would be to insert zeros between the components, parse into an unsigned long, average the numbers, convert back to a hex string, remove the zeros and finally parse into an unsigned int. i.e. convert #AARRGGBB to #AA00RR00GG00BB This method involves parsing and string manipulations, so will undoubtedly be slower than the method you proposed. If you were to factor your own solution carefully, it might actually look quite clever itself.
