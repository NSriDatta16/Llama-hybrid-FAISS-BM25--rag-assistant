If you are trying to secure a web application, you should keep current with information on OWASP . Here's a blurb; The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501c3 not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license. You'll find everything about OWASP here on our wiki and current information on our OWASP Blog. Please feel free to make changes and improve our site. There are hundreds of people around the globe who review the changes to the site to help ensure quality. If you're new, you may want to check out our getting started page. Questions or comments should be sent to one of our many mailing lists. If you like what you see here and want to support our efforts, please consider becoming a member. For your deployment (server configuration, roles, etc...), their have been a lot of good suggestions, especially from Bob and Jeff. For some time attackers have been using backdoor's and trojans that are entirely memory based. We've recently developed a new type of security product which validate's server memory (using similar techniques to how Tripwire(see Bob's answer) validates files). It's called BlockWatch , primarily designed for use in cloud/hypervisor/VM type deployments but can also validate physical memory if you can extract them. For instance, you can use BlockWatch to verify your kernel and process address space code sections are what you expect (the legitimate files you installed to your disk).
