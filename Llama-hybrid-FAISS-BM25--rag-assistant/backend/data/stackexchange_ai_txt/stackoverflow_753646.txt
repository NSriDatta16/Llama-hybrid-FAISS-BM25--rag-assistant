Can i write a file on the client's PC using silverlight

I need to write a web application that allows the client to download a file from the server, so far so good, but the file must be kind of encoded, so i need to decode it on the client and write it on a file on the client's PC. Can i do this using Silverlight? and how? If it is not possible, there is another way to do it?. Any suggestions? Thanks Edit: As exposed for Brian Genisio, i can ask for user permision to save the file, so i think that the open and save Dialogs are ok for my case. But in case that that's not enough, is there a way to, with or without user interaction, to save the file outside of the isolated storage, for example emulating a new download for the user?
