Targeted goodness of fit assessment as Dimitris has stated is usually preferred. Another example is here . When there are only one or two covariates you can compare model estimates of survival probabilities at fixed times when overlapping moving windows of corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimates, with smoothing of the K-M estimates from each window. This is shown here . In terms of comparing non-covariate-adjusted K-M estimates with model-based estimates, you can get a predicted survival curve for each person, and average these curves. You don't need to do any kind of subsetting with regard to censoring. In the case where one is worried about the fit of one categorical predictor in a Cox model, such as treatment, and you think the fit is OK for all the other covariates, you can show estimated survival curves for each level of the categorical predictor, adjusting all the other covariates to constants such as medians and modes. Then do the same but this time stratify on the categorical predictor instead of modeling it as a covariate. This is "adjusted K-M curves" as shown here . A better approach is to specify a Bayesian model that allows for departures from assumptions by adding more parameters, but putting priors on those added parameters to tilt them towards what you hope is true. For example you could have departures from proportional hazards that have a skeptical prior to reduce overfitting when the number of events is not large. The Stan survival analysis system is state-of-the-art.
