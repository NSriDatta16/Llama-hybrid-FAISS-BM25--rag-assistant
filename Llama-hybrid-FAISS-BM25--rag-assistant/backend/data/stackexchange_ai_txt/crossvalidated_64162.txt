How to choose the scaling matrix in ABC (without cheating!)?

I am doing a numerical experiment involving comparing Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) with other methods. I am simulating data $\boldsymbol{y}$ from a model and I'm using ABC to get a sample from the posterior of the parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. The summary statistics $S(\boldsymbol{y})$ are on very different scales, with covariance strongly dependent on the parameters $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$. To take this into account, in the acceptance step I use the quadratic form: $$ (\boldsymbol{s_i}-\boldsymbol{s}_0)\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{s_i}-\boldsymbol{s}_0) So far I have "cheated" and I have used $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}_0}$ where $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$ are the true parameters. I thought that the choice of the scaling matrix was secondary (of little importance as $\epsilon \rightarrow$ 0) but it turns out that in my case if I don't estimate $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ really close to $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$ the algorithm is simply stuck (extremely low acceptance rate and few statistics dominating everything). Does anybody know any practical method that can be used to choose the weighting matrix when the real parameters are unknown? Thanks
