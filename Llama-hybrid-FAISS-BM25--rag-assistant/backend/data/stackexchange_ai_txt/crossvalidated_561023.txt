The weakness of the OLS regression is that it is extremely sensitive to outliers, (the influence of the outlying points on the loss function grows as the square of their distance from the regression line). One of the possible alternatives for making regression more robust (i.e., less sensitive to the outliers, see Robust regression ) is using loss functions that give less weight to the outlying points, such as Huber loss or Tukey loss (see also M-estimator ). Student-t distribution with its long tails is also a potential candidate with distinct advantages and disadvantages: It is more difficult to work with analytically than Huber or Tukey loss functions It is a real probability distribution (unlike Huber and Tukey, which are somewhat ad-hoc choices), and smoothly fits, e.g., with Bayesian methods.
