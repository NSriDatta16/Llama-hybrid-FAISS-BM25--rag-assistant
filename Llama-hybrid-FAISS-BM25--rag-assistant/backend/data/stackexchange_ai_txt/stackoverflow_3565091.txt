Pretty .Net GUI Library Like using in Yahoo Messenger

Please, advise me any .net gui controls library for create user interface like in Yahoo messenger or like Trillian. May be this will be easy skin-based interface library or other. I need only simple controls ex. buttons, listview combobox, checkbox and other therefore library must be small. I know DevExpress and Infragistics libraries but they are too big.
