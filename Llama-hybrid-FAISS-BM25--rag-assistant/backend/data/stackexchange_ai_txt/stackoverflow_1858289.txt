I haven't heard of one. Do you know of any such library for any other languages? That way you could leverage their documentation and tests. If you can't find one, write a bunch of testcases, then we can help you fill out the parsing code. Google must have one, try searching for 5.5billion * 10, but I don't think they have opensourced anything like that. Depending on how you need to use it, you might be able to use Google to do some of the work ;)
