Hey, I'm not sure (as I'm not very familiar with the inner workings of Magento), but it occurs to me that _rewrite() checks whether a call to this specific action is being redirected (rewritten in a mod_rewrite kind of way) to a different controller/action. In this light, it would make sense that events for the original action would not be fired, since the whole request gets handled by a different action.
