Compile everything you use with -D_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 option. It is so by default in VS 2010 Release mode, but some things are still built with other options and so are not binary compatible. In older visual studios there was _SECURE_SCL and i am not sure if some of code may still use it. Put somewhere (say into stdafx.h) a static check that these match. #if _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL == 0 && _SECURE_SCL != 0 #error _SECURE_SCL != 0 when _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL == 0 #endif If you want to see what value _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL has then you can use some #pragma message in code to tell you.
