Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Nowadays I am trying to understand LDA. I have read a lot but something is missing. For instance, when I have a vector with three different variables (buy order, sell order, volume) respectively: [14,34,23] And have over 12 Million records per each customer. I want to profile them by using LDA. How should I organize my data? What will be the analysing process? Furthermore, how will I interpret the results? I could not find any numerical (not topic modeling) examples. Thanks in advance.. Teitia
