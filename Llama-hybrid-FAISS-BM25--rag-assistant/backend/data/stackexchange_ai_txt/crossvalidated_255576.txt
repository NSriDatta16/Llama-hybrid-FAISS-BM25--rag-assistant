How do I interpret the results of a log-linear regression involving constructed personality trait independent variables?

The following model was estimated: Linear regression Number of obs = 1,027 F(45, 981) = 17.85 Prob > F = 0.0000 R-squared = 0.4268 Root MSE = .46636 | Robust lunpaid | Coef. Std. Err. t P>|t| ropen1 | .0257707 .0140323 1.84 0.067 rextra1 | .0208155 .0128139 1.62 0.105 ragree1 | .0210167 .0175203 1.20 0.231 rcon1 | .0494945 .0180238 2.75 0.006 rneur1 | .0154446 .0133066 1.16 0.246 where lunpaid (the dependent variable) is equal to the log of unpaid overtime, and ropen1 - rneur1 correspond to the big 5 personality traits openness extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism. (A number of controls were included in the model however I have excluded them from the picture.) These independent variables were generated by taking an average of 3 likert measured traits from 'does not apply to me' to 'applies to me perfectly'. big5: forgiving nature | Freq. Percent Cum. ----------------------------+----------------------------------- does not apply to me at all | 16 0.64 0.64 2 | 78 3.13 3.77 3 | 173 6.94 10.71 4 | 319 12.80 23.52 5 | 649 26.04 49.56 6 | 910 36.52 86.08 applies to me perfectly | 347 13.92 100.00 ----------------------------+----------------------------------- Total | 2,492 100.00 The average of forgiving nature + 2 more traits looks like this: agree | Freq. Percent Cum. ------------+----------------------------------- 2 | 3 0.04 0.04 2.333333 | 14 0.19 0.23 2.666667 | 33 0.44 0.66 3 | 78 1.03 1.70 3.333333 | 90 1.19 2.89 3.666667 | 161 2.14 5.03 4 | 233 3.09 8.12 4.333333 | 324 4.30 12.41 4.666667 | 490 6.50 18.91 5 | 675 8.95 27.86 5.333333 | 848 11.25 39.11 5.666667 | 1,117 14.81 53.93 6 | 1,304 17.29 71.22 6.333333 | 1,135 15.05 86.27 6.666667 | 554 7.35 93.62 7 | 481 6.38 100.00 ------------+----------------------------------- The age variable was then regressed on each generated personality variable and the residuals were used as the explanatory variables in the regression (in order to remove age effects). My question is, how should I interpret the coefficients? I realise that conscientiousness is the only statistically significant result. Is this interpretation correct: A unit increase in trait conscientiousness is associated with a 5% increase in unpaid overtime hours supplied, and this result is highly significant at the 1% level.
