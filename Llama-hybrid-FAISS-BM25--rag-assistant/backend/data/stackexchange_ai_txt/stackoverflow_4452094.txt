Drag and drop disables input textfield! Help me?

i have a input textfield within a container. This container is draggable, but now i cant input text into the textfield anymore. Probably because you have to click inside the textfield to type, and now mouse down means drag! Or maybe its something completly different Does anyone know how i can solve this? Thanks in advance you can check the code out here, but its pretty much.. http://www.jsfiddle.net/AVG5a/
