Constructing a Sorted List with priority items

I have a list of news unsorted items, some of which have a priority flag. I need the priority items to float to the top of the list, and then sort the rest by a date. So, the end result is a list of news items that has the priority items showing at the top and the remainder sorted by date. There has to be a better way to do it than this but I'm not sure what the best way would be - foreach (var newsItem in newsItems) { if (newsItem.isPriority) { addToPriorityList(newsItem); } else { addToOtherList(newsItem); } } foreach (var priorityItem in priorityList) { addtoMainList(priorityItem); } OtherList.SortbyDate(); foreach (var otherItem in otherList) { addtoMainList(otherItem); } Is there a more elegant way to pull this off? I assume I could use LINQ but I'm very new to it so I'm not comfortable with the syntax.
