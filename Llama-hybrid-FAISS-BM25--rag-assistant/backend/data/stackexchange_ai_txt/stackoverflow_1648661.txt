There are two different ways you could handle this look, and you've kind of overlapped them both! I'm assuming you want to stop when 'name' is NULL. for(details_t* it = emp_details; (*it).name != NULL; it++) { printf("..", (*it).name, (*it).data); } or: for(int i = 0; emp_details[i].name != NULL; i++) { printf("..", emp_details[i].name, emp_details[i].data); } There is one other alternative. You could not a NULL at the end, and get the size of emp_details by doing: int size_of_array = sizeof(emp_details)/sizeof(details_t); However, I would personally advise against this, as I find it fragile in practice.
