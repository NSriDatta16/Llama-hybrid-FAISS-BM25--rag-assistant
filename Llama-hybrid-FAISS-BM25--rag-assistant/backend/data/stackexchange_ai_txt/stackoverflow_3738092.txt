C string literal storage between multiple copies of process or library

What is the behavior of various systems when you have more than one copy of a particular program or library running, do string literals get stored once in RAM or once for every copy of the process/library? What if they are stored in an array like: static const char *const foo[] = { "bar", "baz", "buz" }; Does the static change the behavior of the memory storage at all? Edit: Since it is likely platform specific, what is the behavior on Microsoft compiler on Windows or GCC on linux (x86)?
