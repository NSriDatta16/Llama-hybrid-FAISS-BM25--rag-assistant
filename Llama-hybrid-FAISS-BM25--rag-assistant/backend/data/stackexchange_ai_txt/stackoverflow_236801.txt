Should operator<< be implemented as a friend or as a member function?

That's basically the question, is there a "right" way to implement operator ? Reading this I can see that something like: friend bool operator is preferred to something like ostream& operator But I can't quite see why should I use one or the other. My personal case is: friend ostream & operator But I could probably do: ostream & operator What rationale should I base this decision on? Note : Paragraph::to_str = (return paragraph) where paragraph's a string.
