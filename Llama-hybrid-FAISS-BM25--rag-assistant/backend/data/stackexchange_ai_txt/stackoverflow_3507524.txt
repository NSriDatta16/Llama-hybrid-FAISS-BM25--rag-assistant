At least for the top down drop in I think the solution is somewhere in setting the box class to draggable and link it to the sortable object. $(".box").draggable({ tolerance: 'point', connectToSortable: '.column', snap:false, helper : 'clone', }); This example creates a duplicate of the box but it does allow me to drag box 1 up to page 2 and slowly drag it down above box 5 and get placed into the top spot. It is very sensitive though. You may need to adjust the grids and snap to get it to work consistently for the casual user. I can certainly imagine that a sortable object wouldn't expect something to come down from the top, because it expects things to be sorted from within the container. Droppable on the other hand expects things to enter from any direction.
