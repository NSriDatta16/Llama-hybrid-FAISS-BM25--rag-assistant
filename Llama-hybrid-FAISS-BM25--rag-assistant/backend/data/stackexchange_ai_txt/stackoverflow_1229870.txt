The meaning of API

Could anyone please tell me the meaning of API in following paragraph, that's actually about Transfer Object : If it's likely that a business service might be asked to send or receive all or most of its data in a big, coarse-grained message, it's common for that service to provide that feature in its API . Thanks in advance.
