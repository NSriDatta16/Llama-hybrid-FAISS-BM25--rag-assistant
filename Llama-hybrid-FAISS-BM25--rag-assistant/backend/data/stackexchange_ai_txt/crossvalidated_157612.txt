So the statistical question would be "does the average approval percentage rate differ between the two groups?" The hypothesis can be answered using a student's t test, which will give you the estimate of the difference of the means between the two groups and also the variance of this estimate. It can be used to produce a confidence interval of the difference and if this confidence interval does not contain zero, then you can say that they do statistically differ.
