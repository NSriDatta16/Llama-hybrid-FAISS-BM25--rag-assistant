Users requesting GET when my form method is POST

I'm seeing an intermittent problem on our web site. Some users are trying to submit forms via GET when my form method is POST . The errors always come from IE users. I have noticed a few UA strings have a reference to "yie8," which I am assuming is Yahoo's IE8 package. I think the Yahoo! toolbar might have something against me, but I can't replicate the problem on IE7 with the toolbar installed. The problem happens not only on this form, but various others, many of which are submitted via Ajax using the jQuery form plugin load() function with an object parameter passed. This example isn't one of those. A simple fix would be to just take out all of my AcceptVerb() attributes, but that would be totally lame. Anyone ever come across something like this or have any ideas with dealing with it? Here's an example exception log entry. We've got a Web problem! Exception thrown: http://my.web.site/User.mvc/ResetPassword Method: GET User: UserAgent: IE 7 (Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0;Windows NT 5.1;.NET CLR 1.1.4322;.NET CLR 2.0.50727;.NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)) Exception: System.Web.HttpException Message: A public action method 'ResetPassword' could not be found on controller 'MyApp.Controllers.UserController'. Here's the HTML as it is rendered to the browser. User Name Email Address &nbsp; And here's the signature of my ResetPassword action. [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult ResetPassword(string username, string email) (and yes, the email address is required to match the one we have on file)
