Drag+Drop with physical behaviour

I'd like to implement a dragging feature where users can drag objects around the workspace. That of course is the easy bit. The hard bit is to try and make it a physically correct drag which incorporates rotation due to torque moments (imagine dragging a book around on a table using only one finger, how does it rotate as you drag?). Does anyone know where I can find explanations on how to code this (2D only, rectangles only, no friction required)? Much obliged, David EDIT: I wrote a small app (with clearly erroneous behaviour) that I hope will convey what I'm looking for much better than words could. C# (VS 2008) source and compiled exe here EDIT 2: Adjusted the example project to give acceptable behaviour. New source (and compiled exe) is available here . Written in C# 2008. I provide this code free of any copyright, feel free to use/modify/whatever. No need to inform me or mention me.
