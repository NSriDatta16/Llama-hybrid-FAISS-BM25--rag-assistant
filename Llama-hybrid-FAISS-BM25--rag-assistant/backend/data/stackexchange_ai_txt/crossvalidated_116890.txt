The $n$ in $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ has nothing to do with how you estimate $\sigma$. It has to do with the fact that the average of $n$ iid random variables $X_i$ has variance $\sigma^2/n$ when $\mbox{Var}(X_i) = \sigma^2$. If $\sigma$ is unknown, you estimate it using $s = \sqrt{\frac1{n-1}\sum (X_i-\bar X)^2}$, so that your estimate of the standard error is $$ \hat{SE}(\bar X) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(X_i-\bar X)^2}{n(n-1)}} $$
