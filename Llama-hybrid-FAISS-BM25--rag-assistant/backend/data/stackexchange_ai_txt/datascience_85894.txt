Dropout is used to improve the generalization performance of the model. Generalization is achieved by making the learning features independent and not heavily correlated. Natural images are highly correlated (the image is a spatial data structure). The feature maps in CNNs also exhibit a strong correlation. pixel and its surrounding pixels. Surrounding pixels across the feature maps. To avoid this is to dropout an entire feature map (picked randomly with a probability of dropout_rate). For example, if there are N feature maps, the shape would be (N x Height x Width). With a dropout of 0.5, you force activations of N/2 feature maps to "0".In this way, correlation is alleviated across the feature maps, but there is a correlation within a single feature map which is necessary for efficient object localization.
