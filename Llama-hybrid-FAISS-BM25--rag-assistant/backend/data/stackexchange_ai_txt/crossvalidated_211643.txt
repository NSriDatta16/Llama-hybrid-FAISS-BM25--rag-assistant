How to determine time complexity of EM algorithm of probabilistic PCA?

I was studying probabilistic PCA from Bishop's book. There an EM algorithm is provided to calculate principal subspace: Here $\mathbf M$ is $M\times M$ matrix, $\mathbf W$ is $D\times M$ matrix and $(\mathbf x_n âˆ’ \mathbf x)$ is vector $D\times 1$. Later in the book there is statement regarding the time complexity: Instead, the most computationally demanding steps are those involving sums over the data set that are $\mathcal O(NDM)$. I was wondering if anyone can help me understanding the time complexity of the algorithm.
