Posting this again here.. OK, I had the same problem with the disabled 'Renew' button against my Team Provisioning Profile. This worked for me. 1) Deleted the expired Team Provisioning Profile from the Xcode Organizer. 2) Deleted the same thing from the developer provisioning portal. 3) Again from Xcode organizer check marked the auto provision and clicked 'Refresh'. it asked for the credentials and in a few seconds added the renewed Team Provisioning Profile. 4) It also added the new profile in the developer provisioning portal.
