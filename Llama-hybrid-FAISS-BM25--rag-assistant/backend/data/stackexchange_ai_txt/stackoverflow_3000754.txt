Note that there need not be any relation between the server that's running Hudson and the slave machines that are building your software apps. Due to the magic of Java, you can connect the disparate slave machines to the master using JNLP. (one example) So, whether they are physical or virtual machines, you can have one running Windows, another Linux; one 32-bit, another 64-bit; etc -- whatever your apps require. As long as they all have the JRE installed they can connect to the Hudson master and report the status of the builds.
