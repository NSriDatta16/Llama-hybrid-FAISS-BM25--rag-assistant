sending data is a misleading description. It actually includes both the time spent executing the query and the time spent sending the result over the wire. source 1 source 2 source 3 Since both queries generate approximately the same amount of data, the difference must be in the execution stage. There are a few possibilities: Maybe the three indexes don't generate a useful intersection in the right order when location_id is 18260. Try adding a multi-column index as @Ike Walker suggested. Maybe the rows to be returned in the second query are fragmented all over the disk. This would make MySQL spend a considerable amount of time just waiting for the disk to seek to the next location. Try optimizing your table. Fragmentation can also happen with heavily used indexes, so also try dropping and recreating some indexes.
