Language translation with convolutional neural network

Many examples of language translation neural networks: "the cat sat on the mat" -> [model] -> "le chat etait assis sur le tapis" use RNN, and in particular LSTM. See for example Sentences language translation with neural network, with a simple layer structure (if possible sequential) and A ten-minute introduction to sequence-to-sequence learning in Keras . Are there (not too complicated) attempts of doing language translation with CNN only and no RNN/LSTM? Would you have an example in Keras?
