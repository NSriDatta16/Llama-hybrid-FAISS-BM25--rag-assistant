As others have mentioned already, there's no clear separation between statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and so on so take any definition with a grain of salt. Logistic regression is probably more often labeled as statistics rather than machine learning, while neural networks are typically labeled as machine learning (even though neural networks are often just a collection of logistic regression models). In my opinion, machine learning studies methods that can somehow learn from data, typically by constructing a model in some shape or form. Logistic regression, like SVM, neural networks, random forests and many other techniques, does learn from data when constructing the model. If I understood correctly, in a Machine Learning algorithm, the model has to learn from its experience That is not really how machine learning is usually defined. Not all machine learning methods yield models which dynamically adapt to new data (this subfield is called online learning ). What is the difference between logistic regression with the normal regression in term of "learning"? Many regression methods are also classified as machine learning (e.g. SVM).
