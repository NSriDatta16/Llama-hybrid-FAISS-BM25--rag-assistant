It looks like there are two ways to solve my problem. First one: I can use rich:recursiveTreeNodesAdaptor and in my recursive getter function I can skip some nodes. This aproach may be hard to use with drag and drop for moving items in the tree. Second one: Attach detach some nodes on the server side. Disadvantage of this approach is a lot of Java code for recursive iterations through the tree. I think I'll use the second way since I need drag and drop tree editor. The same question was discussed in the JBoss comunity forum one year ago: http://community.jboss.org/message/64929 and the second way was also advised
