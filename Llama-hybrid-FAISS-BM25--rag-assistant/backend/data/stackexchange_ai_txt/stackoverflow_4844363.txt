It sounds like you haven't imported the files correctly. Have another look at where you added the files to you project, if you have at all. (If not, you need to drag them into your project first!) If you try to compile the project without the file added to the project, it will fail. Simply adding a path is not enough. You need to drag it into Xcode... Add it to the project... And then your code should build. I hope this helps!
