I would try BIC and compare the results with AIC. In my experience, BIC yields better and smaller models than AIC. If you are using R, try these: install.packages("BMA") library(BMA) In BIC, the Bayesian approach yields top 5-10 models that explains the data set. It allows you to investigate the models individually. Models are rated by posterior probability indicating their goodness of fit etc.
