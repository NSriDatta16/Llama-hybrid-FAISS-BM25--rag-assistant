For a measure theory based introduction to probability I recommend Durrett's "Probability: Theory and Examples" (ISBN 0521765390) with Cosma Shalizi's "Almost None of the Theory of Stochastic Processes," (helpfully freely available http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/almost-none/v0.1.1/almost-none.pdf ). I have not come across a perfect self contained book for everything after that. Some combination of MacKays's book (good for neural networks: http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.html ), the Koller and Friedman graphical models book (ISBN: 0262013193) and a good graduate level mathematical statistics book might work.
