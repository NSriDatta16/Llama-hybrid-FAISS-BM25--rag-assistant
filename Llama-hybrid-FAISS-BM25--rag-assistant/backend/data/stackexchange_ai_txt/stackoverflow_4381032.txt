Run a script on a specific date?

I want to run a php script on christmas that will email my family and friends merry christmas while I am out of town and un-able to contact them. The way I just set it up was I have a cron run the script every day, and then the script checks to see if the date is Dec 25th. If it is then the script sends the emails out. Is there a more elegant way to do this. Or a way to have linux just send run the script on the 25th rather than checking everyday. I know it's not that big of a deal, but still just for the sake of knowing.
