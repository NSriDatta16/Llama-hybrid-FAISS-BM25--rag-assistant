Entity Framework model and foreign key property

I have 2 tables that I import to EF model. First table has a property [section] that acts as foreign key to the second table. When I map this property in model to the table and try to compile I get this error: Problem in Mapping Fragments starting at lines 158, 174: Non-Primary-Key column(s) [Section] are being mapped in both fragments to different conceptual side properties - data inconsistency is possible because the corresponding conceptual side properties can be independently modified. If i remove this property from the model it passes, but when I query the data I don't have the section field. I know that I can get it by using the navigation field and reading this property from the second table, but to make it work I must include the other table in my query. var res = from name in Context.Table1.Include("Table2")... Why do I need to include the association just for one field? UPDATE To make it more clear: Table 1 has fields: ItemId - key section - foreign key title Table 2 has fields: SectionId - key Name When I set the associations the section property from the first table must be removed.
