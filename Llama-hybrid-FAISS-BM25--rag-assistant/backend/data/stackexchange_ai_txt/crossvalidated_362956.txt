Here is an explanation for the described behavior and when it would happen, though I don't find it intuitive. First, the $2$ principal axes are orthonormal eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $C$. This is explained and proved in an answer by amoeba . Thus, the behavior is guaranteed iff each eigenvector of the covariance matrix is given by $t\left(\begin{gathered}1\\ 1 \end{gathered} \right)$ or $t\left(\begin{gathered}1\\ -1 \end{gathered} \right)$ for some $t\in\mathbb R$. Since the dataset given to PCA in this case is standardized, the variance of both features (aka variables) is $1$. As $C$ is symmetric , there exists an $a$ such that $C=\left(\begin{matrix}1 & a\\ a & 1 \end{matrix}\right)$. If $a=0$ (i.e. the variables are uncorrelated), then $C=I$. Thus, $\left(\begin{gathered}1\\ 0 \end{gathered} \right)$ and $\left(\begin{gathered}0\\ 1 \end{gathered} \right)$ are eigenvectors, and the behavior is not guaranteed. Otherwise, $a\not=0$. Let's find the eigenvalues of $C$: $$\begin{gathered}\left|C-\lambda I\right|=0\\\left|\left(\begin{matrix}1-\lambda & a\\ a & 1-\lambda \end{matrix}\right)\right|=0\\ \left(1-\lambda\right)^{2}-a^{2}=0\\ \left(1-\lambda+a\right)\left(1-\lambda-a\right)=0\\ \lambda=1+a\,,\,1-a \end{gathered}$$ So by definition, $\left(\begin{gathered}x\\ y \end{gathered} \right)$ is an eigenvector of $C$ iff $\left[C\left(\begin{gathered}x\\ y \end{gathered} \right)=(1+a)\left(\begin{gathered}x\\ y \end{gathered} \right)\text{ or }C\left(\begin{gathered}x\\ y \end{gathered} \right)=(1-a)\left(\begin{gathered}x\\ y \end{gathered} \right)\right]$, which (by doing the algebra) holds iff $x=y$ or $x=-y$. In other words, $\left(\begin{gathered}x\\ y \end{gathered} \right)$ is an eigenvector of $C$ iff $\left(\begin{gathered}x\\ y \end{gathered} \right)$ is given by $t\left(\begin{gathered}1\\ 1 \end{gathered} \right)$ or $t\left(\begin{gathered}1\\ -1 \end{gathered} \right)$ for some $t\in\mathbb R$. Therefore, the behavior is guaranteed. By the same reasoning, we could show that the behavior is guaranteed in any case such that $C=\left(\begin{matrix}b & a\\ a & b \end{matrix}\right)$ and $a,b\not=0$. i.e. we would get the behavior also in cases where we only center the dataset, the features aren't uncorrelated, and have the same variance.
