it's not an encoding problem. The issue is plainly seen on this page, which has the correct utf-8 meta tag: http://www.jp41.com/internet-explorer/chinese/ . The problem is that IE8's default font for Chinese is set to nothing! Here's the fix. Push alt to bring up the file menu. Go to /tools/internet options/fonts/ Set the "Language Script" to Chinese Simplified Select the only option - Arial Unicode MS Accept the changes- problem solved. This oversight affects Chinese Traditional, Korean, Japanese, and probably most other asian languages.
