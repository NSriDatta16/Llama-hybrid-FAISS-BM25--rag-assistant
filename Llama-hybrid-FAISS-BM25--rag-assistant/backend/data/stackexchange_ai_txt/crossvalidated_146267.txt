"Complete" classification using decision tree

While exploring the examples from " Practical Data Science with R ", I am using a decision tree to classify the spambase dataset. It works fine, but I am trying to "abuse" the model in order to have accuracy of 1. I know it is meaningless, and that my code example skips the train/test split, but this is merely for educational reasons. I tried to lower the control parameter cp to as low as 0, and also to allow any split by lowering minsplit to 1, but I still get accuracy of 0.9989133. Can you please help me? This is my code: require(rpart) spam.data and my results are: > c.m prediction actual FALSE TRUE FALSE 2786 2 TRUE 3 1810 > accuracy [1] 0.9989133 I hope my code lines and other formatting will work. I am not a very experienced user... Thanks!
