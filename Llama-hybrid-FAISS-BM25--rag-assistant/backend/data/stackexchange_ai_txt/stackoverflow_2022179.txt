C quick calculation of next multiple of 4?

What's a fast way to round up an unsigned int to a multiple of 4 ? A multiple of 4 has the two least significant bits 0, right? So I could mask them out and then do a switch statement, adding either 1,2 or 3 to the given uint . That's not a very elegant solution.. There's also the arithmetic roundup: myint == 0 ? 0 : ((myint+3)/4)*4 Probably there's a better way including some bit operations?
