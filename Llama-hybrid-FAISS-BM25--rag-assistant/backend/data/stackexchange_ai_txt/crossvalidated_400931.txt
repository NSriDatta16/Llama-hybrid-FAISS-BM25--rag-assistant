Correlation between constrained and unconstrained ordination axes

I am comparing several attributes between two types of things. My goals are (1) hypothesis testing and (2) to summarize the information from multiple attributes. PCA is an option, but this method is agnostic to the groups which I would like to directly compare. Discriminant analysis also seems not appropriate as this is geared towards classification. I think that constrained ordination, e.g. RDA or CCA should be appropriate, and so I am specifying the matrix of attributes as the response variables and a dummy variable for type as the explanatory variable. My question is: how can there be a positive correlation between the constrained axis and the first residual axis? The code I am using is this: > library(vegan) > sample data type trait1 trait2 trait3 1 1 1.758808 2.435267 1.0193438 2 2 1.856269 2.531002 1.0926777 3 2 1.792604 2.470863 1.0203008 4 1 1.842596 2.419813 1.0078421 5 2 1.867928 2.540830 1.0499309 6 2 1.899811 2.530313 1.1007924 7 2 1.943430 2.432563 1.0344759 8 1 1.808498 2.465469 1.1102114 9 1 1.773386 2.349574 0.9659113 10 1 1.800390 2.444265 1.0380732 11 2 1.826511 2.533739 1.1153933 12 1 1.895856 2.539948 1.0701774 13 1 1.873971 2.543685 1.0622794 14 1 1.819450 2.508187 0.9820533 15 1 1.848569 2.512621 0.9966571 16 2 1.855092 2.490199 1.0482279 17 2 1.907723 2.500366 1.0839503 ord There is a clear positive association between the constrained axis (called RDA by the output) and the first residual axis (called PCA1). I thought that a feature of constrained ordination was that residual variance should be uncorrelated with the constrained variance. Is this somehow an artifact of having a single explanatory variable and multiple response variables?
