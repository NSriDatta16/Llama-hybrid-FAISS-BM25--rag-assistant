Global Javascript files and naming conventions (unobtrusive Javascript)?

I am trying to reorganize my Javascript into JS files and clear out my js from my html... The way I see if is the following.... I would really like some input or any documentation/information confirming my plans - a little uncertain. Basically if I have a Home.htm file then I will have a home.js file also, notice they are named the same. The home.js will be like the bootstrapper for that page and will assign events ( onclick etc)... I was planning on doing this with all files i.e. login.htm > login.js ... I was also thinking about have a global.js file which will be included in EVERY page that contains items that are needed in every file.. I also plan on having other js files which I plan on producing in a namespace so that my bootstrapper files can call classes in that namespace to do things like date manipulation etc.. I know JS is not a true OOP language but i have some helper js which allow to create namespaces and better class structures. Does anyone have a better idea? Am completely going in the wrong or right direction? I would really like some input, I am trying to separate all my js into separate files but I don't want to repeat myself so I thought of creating those bootstrapper files to take care of everything for the page..
