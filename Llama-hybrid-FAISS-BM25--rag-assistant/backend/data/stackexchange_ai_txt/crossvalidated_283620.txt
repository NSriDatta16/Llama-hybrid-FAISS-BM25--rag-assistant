For the first problem, unless you are in a Bayesian course, we think that parameters are unknown fixed quantities and they don't have a 'distribution'. So I guess the answer is the last one. P.S. This problem is not designed properly because you might understand this but fails to catch what the professor wants to test you. In an epidemiology test I met multiple choice problem like "To monitor effects of an assigned exposure which one is the best" with choices such as 'cohort' and 'experimental' and I was deeply confused. Later I realized that this is a stupid English problem because of the word 'assigned'. You don't need to do stupid conceptual problem right to understand the concept of statistics, let alone to practice it.
