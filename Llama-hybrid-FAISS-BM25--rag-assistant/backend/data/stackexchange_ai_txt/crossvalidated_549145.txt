How to find a turning point of quadratic term for different categories?

I have built a logistic regression with polynomial relationship with variable age , which I include in the model as an interaction with variable sex . I also have other independent and control variables. The main question is: How do I find a turning point for age variable for female and male separately? The model looks like this: model |z|) (Intercept) -9.701e+00 1.525e+00 -6.362 1.99e-10 *** poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexmixed 4.245e-02 3.492e-02 1.216 0.224112 poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexmixed -2.285e-05 4.216e-04 -0.054 0.956773 poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexfemale 1.487e-01 3.608e-02 4.122 3.76e-05 *** poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexfemale -1.937e-03 4.527e-04 -4.278 1.88e-05 *** poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexmale 6.715e-02 3.116e-02 2.155 0.031164 * poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexmale -4.762e-04 3.179e-04 -1.498 0.134089 --- The dependent variable represents success . mixed is a reference level for sex (here mixed refers to observations that are related to group of people combining both males and females, but I am only interested to find a turning point for female and male ). From the summary I can calculate: the turning point of age for female : 0.1487/(2*0.001937)=38 years old the turning point of age for male : 0.06715/(2*0.0004762)=70.5 years old. But it doesn't seem to be right, because when I visualise it below: ggplot(data %>% filter(sex %in% c('female', 'male')), aes(age, success, color = sex)) + geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.007, width = 0)) + stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = binomial), formula = y ~ poly(x,2), alpha = 0.2, size=0.5, aes(fill = sex)) I get this plot, showing that turning point for men must be at ~58 years old. If I build model including sex separately, I receive this: model |z|) (Intercept) -1.799e+01 4.511e+00 -3.988 6.67e-05 *** poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexmixed 3.634e-01 1.675e-01 2.169 0.030084 * poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexmixed -2.969e-03 1.593e-03 -1.864 0.062353 . poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexfemale -2.533e-02 5.670e-02 -0.447 0.655083 poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexfemale -8.760e-05 6.261e-04 -0.140 0.888740 poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexmale 8.733e-02 3.335e-02 2.619 0.008829 ** poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexmale -6.543e-04 3.369e-04 -1.942 0.052097 . --- For female it reproduces an error. The turning point of age for male: 0.08733/(2*0.0006543)=66.7 years old (also wrong). If I include the age also in the model, it gives: model |z|) (Intercept) -1.799e+01 4.511e+00 -3.988 6.67e-05 *** poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexfemale -3.887e-01 1.753e-01 -2.218 0.026565 * poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexfemale 2.881e-03 1.695e-03 1.699 0.089244 . poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)1:sexmale -2.760e-01 1.691e-01 -1.632 0.102586 poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE)2:sexmale 2.314e-03 1.612e-03 1.436 0.150994 --- the turning point of age for female : 0.3887/(2*0.002881)=67.5 years old (wrong) the turning point of age for male : 0.276/(2*0.002314)=59.6 years old (somewhat close to visualisation assumption) How do I need to use intercept or the base level coefficient ( mixed ) for finding the turing points for female and male ? Also should I include the age and/or sex with interaction term in my case?
