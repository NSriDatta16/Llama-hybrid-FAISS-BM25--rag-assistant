You should certainly impute those values with zeros or data statistics if you are supposed to apply regular PCA. The same is valid for non-linear reduction tools, too. However, if you are OK with applying some modifications of PCA which are robust to missing data, a brief literature tour gave me few articles about the subject. Among them this paper had some interesting notes. For instance, it illustrates a technique called GowPCoA which does not consider the missing values during computation.
