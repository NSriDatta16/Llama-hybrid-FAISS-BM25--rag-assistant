This is a strange question. "What does the output vector for a single sample look like?", well, you write the model, so you decide how you chooses to code "the output", which I take to mean $Y$, the response variable that you want to predict. So for your examples: predict the age (in days) of the person in the image. Output is one number, the age (what else?). But see Convolutional Neural Network Scale Sensitivity classify the person's gender: Most people still think that gender is binary, so 0/1 coding should do. If in Canada, maybe more complicated ... classify country of origin (say, out of only 7 possible options): This is a categorical response, so you could use a dummy encoding. predict (x,y) coordinates of person's nose within the picture (where each coordinate is a value between 0-1, indicating percentage of the distance from top left corner of the input image): Just encode $(x,y)$ in the obvious way, as a pair If I have misunderstood the question, just explain better.
