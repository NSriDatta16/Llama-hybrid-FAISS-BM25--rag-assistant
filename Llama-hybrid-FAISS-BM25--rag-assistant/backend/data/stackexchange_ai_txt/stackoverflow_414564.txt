Generated documentation is nearly always totally worthless. Or, as a corollary: Your API needs separate sets of documentation for maintainers and users. There are really two classes of people who need to understand your API: maintainers, who must understand the minutiae of your implementation to be effective at their job, and users, who need a high-level overview, examples, and thorough details about the effects of each method they have access to. I have never encountered generated documentation that succeeded in either area. Generally, when programmers write comments for tools to extract and make documentation out of, they aim for somewhere in the middle--just enough implementation detail to bore and confuse users yet not enough to significantly help maintainers, and not enough overview to be of any real assistance to users. As a maintainer, I'd always rather have clean, clear comments, unmuddled by whatever strange markup your auto-doc tool requires, that tell me why you wrote that weird switch statement the way you did, or what bug this seemingly-redundant parameter check fixes, or whatever else I need to know to actually keep the code clean and bug-free as I work on it. I want this information right there in the code, adjacent to the code it's about, so I don't have to hunt down your website to find it in a state that lends itself to being read. As a user, I'd always rather have a thorough, well-organized document (a set of web pages would be ideal, but I'd settle for a well-structured text file, too) telling me how your API is architectured, what methods do what, and how I can accomplish what I want to use your API to do. I don't want to see internally what classes you wrote to allow me to do work, or files they're in for that matter. And I certainly don't want to have to download your source so I can figure out exactly what's going on behind the curtain. If your documentation were good enough, I wouldn't have to. That's how I see it, anyway.
