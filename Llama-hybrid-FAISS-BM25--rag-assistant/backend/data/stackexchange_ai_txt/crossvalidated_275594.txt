Who has done research on marital status? I am running a logistic regression analysis

I have NLSY97 data and specifically look at a cross-section (2013 data), where respondents are between 28-32 and who got married and who didn't. I want to see which of the independent variables are significant in predicting marital status and which one predicts the highest log odds. This is the model I run in R: glm(formula = married ~ Female + age + Black + Hispanic + Msa + rel_pref + yinc + hrs_wrkd + degree + degree_fem, family = binomial(link = logit), data = nlsy2) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.4025 -1.0825 0.4939 1.0455 2.1968 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -5.585e+00 5.717e-01 -9.768 exp(coef(married1)) (Intercept) Female age Black Hispanic Msa rel_pref yinc 0.003755289 1.583298625 1.184297429 0.278581731 0.745073838 0.597713776 1.691114349 1.000010068 hrs_wrkd degree degree_fem 1.000026891 1.108001765 0.967370363 Some of the odds make sense, I am a little confused with the coefficients for Black and Hispanics and want to make sure I am interpreting these right: If I look at the coefficient for Black, does that mean that odds for a Black person to get married are higher by 0.27 times as compared to Whites, which is the base group?
