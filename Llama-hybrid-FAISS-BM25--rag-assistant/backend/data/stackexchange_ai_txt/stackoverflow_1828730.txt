JQuery UI: Drag-and-drop disables mouseover events?

I'm trying to have both mouseover events and drag-and-drop using JQuery and JQuery UI. I currently have a working prototype here: http://dan.taeyounglee.com/othersites/m-p/ch18.php . As you can see, if you move your mouse over the images, through a hover event that's bound to the artworks on the left, a separate corresponding div is hidden/shown. This works fine. But once you drag-and-drop one of the artworks onto the dotted-line areas, the hover no longer works. Here's the hover code: $(".artwork").hover(function () { var hoverid = $(this).attr('id'); var hovernum = hoverid.split("img")[1]; $('.explanation').hide(); $("#explanation" + hovernum).show(); }, function() { $('.explanation').hide(); }); It seems that something in JQuery UI is disabling the hover effect? I'm not sure how to fix this, and I've tried using mouseover/mousestart; it's the same. Any ideas? Thanks!
