Sorry to hijack this question. But for anyone starting with bindings, if you are using the stable Spark 1.1.0, I think there are a couple bugs regarding bindings with # and child::*. The fix being to use the development spark build. If this is not the case, hopefully Robert will correct me. But if it is, then perhaps this will allow beginners (like myself) to avoid some initial confusion.
