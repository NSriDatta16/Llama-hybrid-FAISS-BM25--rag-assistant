I think I have close to the answer for you. Fonts of this type are of the Embedded Open Type (EOT) format that follows the PowerPoint Binary File Format spec. You can read more about the details of EOTs on the W3C's Embedded Open Type (EOT) file format . I tested a few fonts against this, like Calibri Bold and Chiller , doing both the instructions you gave above for PowerPoint and then also using the Microsoft Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT). They both create the same file sizes, but the encryption appears to be different - I'm guessing that WEFT is applying some different encryption due to how it builds the EOTs for specific websites. The W3C page above may have more details on encryption. The good news is that, at least in a web page, you can use the PowerPoint-generated one "as is". In the PowerPoint embedded font I created of the Chiller font which is font1.fntdata when embedded, I just took that and created a web page using it and it worked just fine: Chill @font-face{ font-family: Chiller; src: url('font1.fntdata'); } .Chiller{ font-family: Chiller; font-size:60px; color:#000; } Cold Beer Free! I haven't gone so far as to test as to whether or not these can be used directly in WPF/Silverlight but at least now you know what you're dealing with.
