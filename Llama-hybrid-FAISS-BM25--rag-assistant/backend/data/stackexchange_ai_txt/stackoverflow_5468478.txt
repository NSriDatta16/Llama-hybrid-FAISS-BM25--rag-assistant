Comparing multiple Mysql Tables to find modified records

I have three tables as a SQLITE3 Dump. products,tax,inventory From these tables preparing a csv file to import into magento products section. SO that part is over. Now have to run a daily script which updates the inventory,tax, modified product details(SKU will not change at any case). In this update section. For example, i have 12000 records, in that only may be 400 or 1000 records varied/modified/updated in inventory table,tax table,products table from the last day's Database. The remaining rows will remain same. So i added the last days tables as old_products,old_tax,old_inventory . And tried to write sql query to extract only modified records from the two set's of tables (Note: Both sets of tables available in Same Db.) Please can anyone help me how to write a sql query to extract the modified records by comparing two sets of tables.
