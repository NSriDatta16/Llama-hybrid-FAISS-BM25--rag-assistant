draggable pushpin windows phone 7 bing maps control

Just wondering if there are any decent resources on how to program a draggable pushpin for a map in a windows phone 7 application. I've had a good look and can only find information about how to do it for a browser application. Ideally I want the user to be able to click on a pushpin and drag it to a location on the map however, at the minute the only way I can think of doing this is for the user to drag the map and the pushpin remains at the centre of the map.
