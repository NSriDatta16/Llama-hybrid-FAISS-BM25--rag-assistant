I'm not sure I'd call this stratified sampling, but your calculations for precision and recall make sense. It's as if you cluster negative examples into 1K groups and choose a representative among them and calculate approximated statistics based on these ones. Of course, the effect of this procedure on the training is another issue, e.g. for bayesian approaches, your priors will be calculated differently. So, you may need to account for sample weights.
