Yes; If you're testing the functionality of the underlying compiler/virtual machine, your test is too simple. Unless, that is, you do not trust that particular piece of the compiler/virtual machine that is being exercised. But, of course, the reality of tests is a bit more complex than just a yes/no answer to this question. As noted in another answer, if you have already written the tests, don't delete them. But you also should not use them in a code coverage context as an argument for confidence.
