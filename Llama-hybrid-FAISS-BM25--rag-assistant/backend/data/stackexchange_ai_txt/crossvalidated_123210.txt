Algorithm does not converge in R

I am doing a logistic regression in R, where I am modeling how potholes and weather correlate to accidents. When I run a logistic regression, I get the message "Algorithm does not converge" The problem I think I have is that I have 24,000 accidents with only 350 potholes related to these accidents. Is this to small of a sample size? The other possible issue I thought of, is that when I look at sample logistic regressions, the outcome is either zero or one, but the only outcome I have is the outcome of one, or accident in my case. I do not have any non accident data in my set, could this be what is causing the problem? I will attach my current code and its output. require(ggplot2) require(sandwich) require(msm) mydata head(mydata) Date Pothole Rain Snow Accident 1 1/1/2012 0 0 0 1 2 1/1/2012 0 0 0 1 3 1/1/2012 0 0 0 1 4 1/1/2012 0 0 0 1 5 1/1/2012 0 0 0 1 6 1/1/2012 0 0 0 1 > summary(mydata) Date Pothole Rain Snow Accident 1/8/2014 : 87 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.00000 Min. : 0.0000 Min. :1 1/30/2013 : 82 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:0.00000 1st Qu.: 0.0000 1st Qu.:1 3/21/2013 : 77 Median :0.0000 Median :0.00000 Median : 0.0000 Median :1 12/21/2012: 76 Mean :0.0173 Mean :0.08077 Mean : 0.1129 Mean :1 3/10/2013 : 66 3rd Qu.:0.0000 3rd Qu.:0.00000 3rd Qu.: 0.0000 3rd Qu.:1 12/13/2013: 59 Max. :8.0000 Max. :3.32000 Max. :11.1000 Max. :1 (Other) :23606 > mylogit
