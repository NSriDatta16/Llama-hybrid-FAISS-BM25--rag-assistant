I would guess that when you are naivgating from that page you are either serializing something or saving something in IsolatedStorageSettings . This uses the DataContractSerializer internally to convert objects into something that can be persisted. Either make sure that the object can be serialized or serialize it yourself. If you can do it yourself using a different/faster method you may be able to improve performance overall. The DataContractSerializer is quite fast with simple types like strings.
