Here, we are apparently assuming a normalization exercise based on available and accurate (expressly for the reference population, which could be a pooled aggregate of the more 'advanced' countries in achieving longevity) age-specific mortality statistics. The latter are appropriately weighted by a country's percentage population by age-grouping. To assist in interpretation, I postulate a perhaps implicit model, namely: $${Country_c\text{ } Mortality\text{ } Rate = AdjFactor_c * (Weighted\text{ } Average\text{ }Age\text{-Specific}\text{ }Mortality\text{ }Rate)}$$ For the reference population, the cited adjustment factor is unity. The model inherently assumes a uniform factor severity adjustment across age groups. For some countries, this could be appropriate in measuring the impact of say natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fire, hurricanes, ..) or perhaps wars, which may decimate a population without respect for age differentials. However, for heat waves or some pandemics or wide spread starvation, there could be selectivity for the old or very young. Noteworthy, for poor countries, there is a significantly higher infant/child mortality rate. As such, care should be exercised in judging the meaning of adjustment factor by country. For countries with more elderly that are particularly subject to a pandemic, or pre-existing conditions, which may be more present in countries without socialized medicine, the implicit model's Adjustment Factor, per the equation above, would likely be harder to assess for parameter accuracy/bias. On the question: "Or am I supposed to choose for myself, for example taking the age-specific mortality rates from last year and apply those to the standard population?", Yes. Using the last years mortality rates, with ample disclosure and perhaps part of my modeling assumptions, may assist in assessing results.
