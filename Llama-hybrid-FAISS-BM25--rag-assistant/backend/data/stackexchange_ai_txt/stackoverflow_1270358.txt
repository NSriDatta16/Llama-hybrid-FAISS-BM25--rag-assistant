I think that this is important step for jQuery. Of cause jQuery is very dom centric lbrary. And that is why it achieves so much attention over the world, but it is hard to build complex solutions basing on it only. You can not use all the benefits of OOP and so you must to have all the code in a head - all of your programmers must. I suppose jQuery is the most easy solution - thats why everybody likes it, but now it wants to be enterprise solution. I think this can make enterprise client side development faster and that is great:)
