Setting apart subtle issue with face validity (or concept close to the coverage and acceptability of the questionnaire), changing the number of response options will likely affect the variance of the response pattern matrix, hence any estimate for the internal consistency of the scale (Cronbach alpha or Guttman $\lambda_6$ ), especially when they are calculated on item variances and total test variance, i.e. using the covariance matrix. Here is a toy example using the R software, where I recode a subscale of a personality inventory originally scored on a 6-point scale to a 3-point scale: library(psych) ## personality test: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, ## Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Opennness. ## 25 items (5 factors) scored on a 6-point response scale: ## 1 Very Inaccurate 2 Moderately Inaccurate 3 Slightly Inaccurate ## 4 Slightly Accurate 5 Moderately Accurate 6 Very Accurate. data(bfi) d So, the Cronbach alpha drops down just because I (artificially) reduced the variance of item and total score. Moreover, although there are lot of debates about the optimal number of response options for Likert-type items (5 to 7 appear to be the most frequently solution), the problem is not so much how it affects the reliability of scale scores or internal consistency as how it affects the problems of transition from one response modality to another, in probabilistic terms, which are known as threshold reversals in, e.g., the Partial Credit Model.
