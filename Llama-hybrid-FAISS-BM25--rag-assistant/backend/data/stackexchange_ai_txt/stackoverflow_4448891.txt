Test coverage in teamcity with Django

I have got teamcity working and it builds and runs a custom testrunner ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/teamcity-messages ) I loosly foolowed this post: TeamCity for Python/Django continuous integration My run_suite method looks like this: from teamcity import underTeamcity from teamcity.unittestpy import TeamcityTestRunner return TeamcityTestRunner().run(suite) I currently use django_coverage with coverage.py and I would like teamcity to get the test coverage data. I am not bound to teamcity but I prefere using it as a CI server but I can change to another if it is easier. How can I get the data that ./manage.py test_coverage prints in teamcity?
