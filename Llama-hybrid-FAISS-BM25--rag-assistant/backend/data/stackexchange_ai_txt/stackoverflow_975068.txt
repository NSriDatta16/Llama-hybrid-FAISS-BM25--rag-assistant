No, there is no appreciable difference between an View XIB and an Empty XIB with a Custom View dragged in. There are no connections in a View XIB initially, so no connections to "remake". What you describe will work fine, there is no difference between that and creating a View XIB, deleteing the view and continuing from step 2. You can actually open the .xib files in BBEdit and compare them to see the trivial differences between the XML.
