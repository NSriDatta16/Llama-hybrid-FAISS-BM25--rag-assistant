Choosing the number of principal components to retain before training a neural network for classification

I am working on neural networks and I am currently creating a perceptron that will work as a classifier for a data set of images with faces. I am required to perform pca (principal component analysis) to my data set before dividing the samples into two different sets for training and testing. By doing this, I am lowering the dimensionality of the data and at the same time I am compressing the size of the images. However, I am not a statistician and I have some problems defining the number of principal components to use for the pca method without any specific formula. My data set is an array of 4096x400, 400 being the number of the sample images and 4096 being their dimension. Is there a way to be more precise and accurate about the number of principal components to use during pca? I am working on matlab so I am using princomp .
