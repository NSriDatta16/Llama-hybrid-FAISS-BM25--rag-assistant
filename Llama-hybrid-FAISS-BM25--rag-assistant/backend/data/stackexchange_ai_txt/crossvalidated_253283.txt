Reference examples in psychology of Bayesian prior updating for multiple studies?

I'm new to applying Bayesian parameter estimation techniques in my research and am also hoping to help others in my area transition from frequentist to Bayesian methods. One thing that I am hoping to locate is several reference examples from the psychology (preferably social, health, or organizational psychology) or communications literature that uses results from a first study to update priors for subsequent studies in the same paper. Preferably, examples using likert-type survey day and where the process of how the priors were updated is relatively easy to understand for an audience new to Bayesian statistics. Anyone have any go-to references on this, or other great resources for simple examples using likert-type data?
