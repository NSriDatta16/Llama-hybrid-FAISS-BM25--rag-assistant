Check sqlce database existence as per web.config

Refer to the question How to check for the existence of a DB? I was trying to detect the existence of a DB as per in web.config connection string, but out of luck. I was using the last answer of the above as my trial. Trial 1: connection string in the web.config I got the error: Keyword not supported: 'initial catalog'. Trial 2: without the keyword string conString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["sqlCEConnString"].ConnectionString; using(SqlCeConnection cnn = new SqlCeConnection(conString)) { cnn.Open(); using (SqlCeCommand com = new SqlCeCommand("select count(*) from sys.databases where name = 'db.sdf'" , cnn)) { int j=com.ExecuteNonQuery(); Response.Write("Result:" + j); } } This time I got the following error: The specified table does not exist. [ @@sys.databases ] What I am doing wrong?
