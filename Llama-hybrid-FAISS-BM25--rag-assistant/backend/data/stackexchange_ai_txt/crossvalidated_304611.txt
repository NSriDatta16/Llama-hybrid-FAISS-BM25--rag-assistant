Calculate the likelihood, which is the probability than an exponential distribution with rate $\theta$ has a sample greater than $y'$: $L(\theta \mid y>y') = e^{-y'{\theta}}$. This is an exponential distribution with rate $y'$, i.e., a gamma with shape 1 and rate $y'$. The posterior is therefore $\alpha$ and $\beta + y'$. This is just the Bayesian update of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which gives a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha+1$ and $\beta + 100$.
