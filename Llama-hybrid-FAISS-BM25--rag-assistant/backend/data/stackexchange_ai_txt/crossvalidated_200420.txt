Combining one class classifiers to do multi-class classification

I am working on a 3-class classification problem. The classifier I'm using is Bayesian Networks which provides me with a classification accuracy of around 60%. When I do a two-class classification, I get 80% accuracy for differentiating between class 0 & class 1 and between class 0 & class 2. Also, I get only 60% accuracy for classification between class 1 & class 2. I believe the best way to do 3-class classification in this case would be combining the 2 two-class classifiers with 80% accuracy. What comes to my mind is using some sort weighted averaging scheme on the results of the two individual two-class classifiers. I have not solved such a problem in the past and am facing a dilemma as to how I should implement this. Any help/suggestions in this regard would be highly appreciated. Please fell free to suggest other alternatives if you think they may work.
