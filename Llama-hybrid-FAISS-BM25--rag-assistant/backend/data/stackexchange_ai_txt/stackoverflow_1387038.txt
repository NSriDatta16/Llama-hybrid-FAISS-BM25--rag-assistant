Is there a way to get a Curried form of the binary operators in SML/NJ?

For example, instead of - op =; val it = fn : ''a * ''a -> bool I would rather have - op =; val it = fn : ''a -> ''a -> bool for use in val x = getX() val l = getList() val l' = if List.exists ((op =) x) l then l else x::l Obviously I can do this on my own, for example, val l' = if List.exists (fn y => x = y) l then l else x::l but I want to make sure I'm not missing a more elegant way.
