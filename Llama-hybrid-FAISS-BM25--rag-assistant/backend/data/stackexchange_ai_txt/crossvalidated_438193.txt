One possiblity - that seems in a sense a bit backwards, but would probably work - is to use some model to predict the UMAP embedding and look at what features play a role in the prediction. Since the the embedding is potentially a highly non-linear transformation, I would think about using a neural network (either with some normalization before hand - e.g. rankgauss - or a batch normalization as the first layer, followed by a few dense layers) and having a look at which of the inputs are get meaningful activation for any of the examples. Other prediction tools that can deal with non-linear transformations such as xgboost/LightGBM etc. may be even better options, because they do not need input normalization and allow easy interogation using SHAP values .
