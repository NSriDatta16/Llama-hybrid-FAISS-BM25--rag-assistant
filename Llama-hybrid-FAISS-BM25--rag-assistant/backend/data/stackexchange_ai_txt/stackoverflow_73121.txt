I like to keep things simple, so I don't stuff a bunch of methods in a class. Within a class, I usually have the most commonly used (or modified-by-me ;-)) methods listed first. As far as specific code organization goes, each set of methods belongs to a class, so it organizes by itself. I make use of my editor's search feature, and code folding to navigate through large source files. Similarly, I make use of search features to find things in other contexts too. A grand organization scheme never suited me, so I rely on the power of search in all things, not just code.
