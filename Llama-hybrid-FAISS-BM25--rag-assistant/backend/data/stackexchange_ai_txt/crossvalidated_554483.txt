Machine Learning Models for Classification with Categorical Variables

To start, I'd like to say I have very little experience in machine learning, or statistics/computer science in general. I am interested in a list of models to classify a binary dependent (response/output/Y) variable with non-ordered categorical independent (explanatory/input/X) variables. I know the list at https://topepo.github.io/caret/train-models-by-tag.html#Neural_Network that has been super helpful, but I can't tell which models use quantitative or ordered variables, or a quantitative output variable. I've used a random forest and neural network model to some great success, but I'd like to find some other models that I can play/learn with.
