If you take your menu as an example, then menus by nature can be hierarchical, and an HTML list is specifically designed for marking-up a hierarchical list of items. It is the semantically correct mark-up for that type of item and will be easily understood by any type of user-agent whether CSS is enabled or not (think of screen readers, web robots etc.) There absolutely no reason you should find it harder to style a nested list as a sequence of 'flat' divs. In fact, quite the contrary, since you CSS syntax is designed to easily differentiate nested items.
