How to organize the directory used for a distributable Python module?

I'm creating a Python module. My question is how can I organize the distribution such that it has a directory structure similar to most of the standard Python modules. Is there anything similar to MakeFile in Python which has setup.py file name? Directory Structure: pymodule_x-y.tar.gz/ + pymodule/ + __init__.py + pymodule.py + setup.cfg + setup.py + test/ + test_case.py
