Property as parameter? C#

So I've got a whole bunch of options, every different page/tab can have their own local options. We'll have maybe 10-15 pages tabs open tops. I need to implement a way to show the global defaults, weather the all the tabs have consistent values. I'm working on the model/viewmodel portion of a WPF app. I'd love to find a way that is more elegant since I'm having to cut and past roughly the same code 20+ times and just change property names. Maybe this is the problem Dynamics solve, but right now this feels both wrong and painful. Here is an example of my current solution: public class Foo { private bool fooVar1; private bool fooVar2; //lots of these private decimal fooVar23; public Foo() { } public bool FooVar1 { get; set; } //you get the picture... } public class FooMonitor { private Foo defaultFoo; private List allFoos; public FooMonitor(Foo DefaultFoo) { defaultFoo = DefaultFoo; } public void AddFoo(Foo newFoo) { allFoos.Add(newFoo); } public void AddFoo(Foo oldFoo) { allFoos.Remove(oldFoo); } public bool IsFooVar1Consistent { get { Foo[] tempFoos = allFoos.ToArray(); foreach (Foo tempFoo in tempFoos) { if (tempFoo.FooVar1 != defaultFoo.FooVar1) return false; } return true; } } } Or am I approaching this problem entirely incorrectly. As I'm writing this question (After about 2000 lines of code) I'm thinking of how I read that WPF itself implements Dictionary look ups that crawl up to the parent to see if a Property is present and what the value should be.
