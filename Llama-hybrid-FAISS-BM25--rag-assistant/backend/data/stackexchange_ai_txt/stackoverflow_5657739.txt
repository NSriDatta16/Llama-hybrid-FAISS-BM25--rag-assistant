download it as a xls file. use xlrd to read the content and xlwt to write back. See python-excel for example: import xlrd wb = xlrd.open_workbook('myworkbook.xls') b.sheet_names() sh = wb.sheet_by_index(0) col = sh.col_values(0) ..... just refer to the documents of the package =========================== EDIT : if you want a more "elegant" way, that is google' own api, you can check this link . But it seems google only provides java API.
