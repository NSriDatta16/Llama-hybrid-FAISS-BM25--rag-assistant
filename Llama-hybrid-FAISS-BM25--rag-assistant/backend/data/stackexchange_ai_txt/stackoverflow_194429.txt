In my personal experience with Ubuntu, the two places that I consistently found help were Ubuntu Forums and Ubuntu Wiki . These two sites demonstrate just how helpful, organized, and motivated the Ubuntu Community is. An additional resource is also the Ubuntu channel on IRC . Whenever I was stuck with an issue that I felt warranted a discussion with someone (or a handful of people), IRC was always a good place to go. Lastly, I tend to learn a lot from reading blogs from people that are heavily involved in Ubuntu's development. Planet Ubuntu is a pretty good feed to keep in your reader. It's essentially an aggregation of a number of blogs. The majority of the posts are related to Ubuntu; however, there are occasional posts that are just about the developer's thoughts and opinions.
