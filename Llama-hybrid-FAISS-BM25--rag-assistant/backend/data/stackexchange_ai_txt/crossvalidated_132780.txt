Bisecting K-means using Dynamic Time Warping

I'm trying to cluster time series of different length and I came up to an idea to use DTW as a similarity measure, which seems to be adequate, but the thing is, I cannot use it with K-means, since it's hard to define centroids based on time series which can have different length/phase. So I was thinking about Hierarchical clustering, since it seems appropriate to combine with DTW, but it's not scalable. So my next thought is to try with bisecting k-means that seems scalable, since it is based on K-means step repetitions. My idea is next, by steps: Take two signals as initial centroids (maybe two signals that have smallest similarity, calculated using DTW) Assign all signals to two initial centroids Repeat the procedure on the biggest cluster In this way I could use DTW as distance measure, that could be useful since my data may be shifted, skewed, and avoid calculating centroids. At the end I could take one signal from each cluster that is the most similar with others in cluster (some kind of centroid/medioid). What do you think about this approach and about the scalability?
