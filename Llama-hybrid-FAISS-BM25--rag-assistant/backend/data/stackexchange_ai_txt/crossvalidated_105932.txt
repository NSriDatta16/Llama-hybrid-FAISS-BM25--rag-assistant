SVD decomposition of a mtrix is in general not unique. If U and V are a decomposition of a matrix, then for any diagonal matrix with only -1 or 1 as diagonal elements, UM and M^TV will also be valid SVD decomposition. Different implementations maybe just randomly choose one or the other one. The PCA decomposition has the same issue: only the orientations but not the directions of the eigenvectors (singular vectors) are unique.
