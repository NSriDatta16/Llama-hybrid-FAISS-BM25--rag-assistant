Is there anything like Environment.SpecialFolder but for registry paths

I want to store some app information in the registry and I'm not sure where should I store it. I want the info to be for all users so I wouldn't use HKEY_CURRENT_USER. Maybe HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE but then I'm not sure where in there. I don't know what are the standards for this and something like Environment.SpecialFolder but for registry paths or folders would be a lot safer and more elegant.
