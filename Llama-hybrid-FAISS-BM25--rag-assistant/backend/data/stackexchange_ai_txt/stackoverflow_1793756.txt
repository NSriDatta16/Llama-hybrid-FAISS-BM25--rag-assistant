If this is just a case of storing "a bunch of files" you might just need a simple key/value store like BDB which could scale up quite easily to any RDBMS including MySQL, SQLite, or even a key/value store like Tokyo-Cabinet. Any reasons for SQLite being such a problem? A robust data storage mechanism might be a much better approach to the 'pile of files' system.
