mySQL Query JOIN in same table

Table structure goes something like this: Table: Purchasers Columns: id | organization | city | state Table: Events Columns: id | purchaser_id My query: SELECT purchasers.*, events.id AS event_id FROM purchasers INNER JOIN events ON events.purchaser_id = purchasers.id WHERE purchasers.id = '$id' What I would like to do, is obviously to select entries by their id from the purchasers table and join from events. That's the easy part. I can also easily to another query to get other purchasers with the same organization, city and state (there are multiples) but I'd like to do it all in the same query. Is there a way I can do this? In short, grab purchasers by their ID but then also select other purchasers that have the same organization, city and state. Thanks.
