Who said that dimensionality reduction is the goal of these methods? Their purpose is to relate a set of feature variables to a set of classes identified in the training data so as to classify objects in their correct categories as best as possible. Dimensionality reduction would only enter into this if you are picking subsets of the features to include in the NN or the SVM. Then you could reduce the number of features used if you find that it does not have a major impact on the classification problem.
