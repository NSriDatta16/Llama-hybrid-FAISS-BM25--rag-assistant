What is the difference between a moving average and a regression of a time dependent variable?

Suppose that you have a time dependent data generating process which you are trying to model using either a moving average model or a (linear) regression. I have a couple of questions for these models: Are both of these two approaches appropriate to reflect changes in the data over time? That is, are they appropriate to model the time dependency of the data generating process like for example changes in the mean or variance of the process? Can we say that the moving average model uses a local window to describe the data and that the regression model uses a global window? Are there any simple rules/ criteria to help me decide when should I use a moving average model and when a regression?
