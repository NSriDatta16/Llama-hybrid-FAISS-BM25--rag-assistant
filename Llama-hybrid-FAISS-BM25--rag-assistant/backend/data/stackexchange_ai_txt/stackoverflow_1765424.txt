This just isn't encouraged. When you're talking about a sequence, "null" should generally have the same semantics as "empty list." Also, it's impossible to design the language to work in the way you'd like it to work here without extra syntax, since what if you were to hit a " yield return [whatever] " and then a " return null ?"
