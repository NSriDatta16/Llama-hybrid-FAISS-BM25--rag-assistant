Automatic translation of text using CultureUI information

I have a windows with many controls in it, which are organized in containers, and would like to translate the UI (i.e the "text" property). What is the best way to do it? I tried to iterate over all the controls in the form, but came into troubles, since each container provides different way to access its children. Is there more sophisticated way? I'm already using the ResourceManager with different Cultures, so it would be great if I can use it for my goal. EDIT: My problem is that I can't use recursion because of the MenuStrip control, for instance, which gives access to its items using the "Items" property rather than "Controls". The StatusStrip control is similar. I have posted my solution in https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/721/automatic-translation-of-forms - I'd love to hear your reviews!
