What to do with an outlier that once removed prevent model convergence?

So, I'm performing generalized linear mixed models with a poisson distribution and an offset. When looking at the Cook's distance, I found gigantic values (above 3000). When removing the concerned observation, the model fail to converge. Note that all independent variables have been scaled. I would like to include my data for an example, but I don't know how to do that here. If someone can point me how-to, I will improve my question 1- Am I doing something wrong here? Like, using a function I'm not supposed to use. 2- What does it mean? 3- What should I do with this outlier? The model, that converges: mod1 Calculating cook's distance: imod1 Removing the outlier, the model doesn't converge: temp mod2
