Is the ValueStack life cycle across the application in struts2?

I can set a property on ValueStack in several ways. ValueStack stack = ActionContext.getContext().getValueStack(); stack.getContext().put("resultDTO",resultDTO); //1. creates a different branch //parallel to root stack.set("resultDTO", resultDTO); //2. pushes on root as a Map? stack.push(resultDTO); //3. pushes on root myActionClass.setProperty(); //4. normal action accessor I need to be able to get all these values back in JSP, freemarker and java like stack.findValue() or stack.findString(). I want to know about the life cycle of each of these 4 setting methods. Is it across application. Is the ValueStack created every request and the application and session values are set in it for every request? I know the 4th method is the most common approach but i may not be using that in all places, where action class is not easily accessible. I have another doubt about accessing in JSP I also want to know how 5th point works in both stack.getContex().put() and stack.set() ? I understand that in 6th the resultDTO I am accessing, is a different root and in 7th, it's the child of default root, which is ValueStack. In 8th it starts to search from default root. I went through http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11.1/docs/ognl.html , http://struts.apache.org/2.1.2/struts2-core/apidocs/com/opensymphony/xwork2/util/ValueStack.html and rather confusing this link http://www.opensymphony.com/ognl/html/DeveloperGuide/introduction.html#embeddingOGNL Having said all these I am little inclined to using stack.getContext().put() method as I can clearly see the values in by setting the url as ?debug=browser . Advise me if I am going wrong.
