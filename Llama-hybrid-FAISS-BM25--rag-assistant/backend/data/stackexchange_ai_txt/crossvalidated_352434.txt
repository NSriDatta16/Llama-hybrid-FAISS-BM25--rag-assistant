I think you raise a valid question, which is that "without an initial time-aligned pair of datasets, how can CCA perform well?" My guess is that the answer is that "CCA doesn't perform well in the first step". The reason I say this is because the initial estimates "CCA" projectors don't require time-alignment, because PCA is used for each data matrix ($X,Y$) separately to estimate their initial "spatial" projections, respectively ($V_x, V_y$). According the (Zhou and de la Torre 2009) : The algorithm starts by initializing $V_x$ and $V_y$ with identity matrices. Alternatively, PCA can be applied independently to each set, and used as initial estimation of $V_x$ and $V_y$ if $d_x\ne d_y$. In the case of high-dimensional data, the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved by regularizing the covariance matrices adding a scaled identity matrix. The dimension $b$ [referring to the reduced dimension, i.e., number of canonical/principal vectors] is selected to preserve 90% of the total correlation. In other words, the first DTW is applied to the "high variance" portion of each dataset. From there onward, the first DTW estimate is used to align the matrices. Also, note that according the paper, when the data dimensions match ($d_x=d_y$), identity matrices are used for the initial CCA projections, meaning that in effect DTW is applied first. So, whether PCA is used or not, the CTW algorithm always applies CCA to an initially time-aligned sequence.
