As you have described it, you have a problem which is extremely general. So general that almost every classification problem in machine learning can be expressed in this fashion. Your algorithm seems ok, but the field of machine learning isn't just that algorithm. Just about every single technique can also be applied to your problem. I think you should check whether the ID cards break up into clusters, say driver's licenses and company ID cards. Your current method essentially assumes that IDs form one spherically symmetric cluster about the average, but if the data naturally breaks up into 2 or more clusters then you could do better by checking membership in each cluster separately. If there are a few outliers, you might want to use a median instead of a mean. It's not clear to me why you are using Pearson correlation instead of Euclidean distance. Perhaps it makes sense if you expect the inputs to be scaled by some brightness factor, and you want to assign the same likelihood value to brighter or darker versions of the same image. Either way, you can also scale the dimensions separately from each other, and I think a reasonable scaling would be by the standard deviation of the training set.
