t-SNE versus MDS

Been reading some questions about t-SNE ( t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ) lately, and also visited some questions about MDS ( Multidimensional Scaling ). They are often used analogously, so it seemed like a good idea make this question seeing there are many questions on both separately (or compared to PCA ) here. In short what makes t-SNE and MDS different? eg. What niceties of the data hierarchy they explore, different assumptions, etc. Rate of convergence? What about use of kernels, do both comply?
