You can replace an entire component, but you also have to consider that the same markup might not work for both a label and a text field. But you can always replace a fragment with another fragment, so if you wrap your field and label in a fragment each, you can switch between them anytime. However you're better off using a dedicated component for this purpose, I seem to remember an Ajax field component in either core Wicket or Wicket Extensions that did it. It is called AjaxEditableLabel
