The USC WebGIS Geocoder ( https://webgis.usc.edu ) is free. It has API's that you can call from scripts or you can upload and process databases (mdb, csv, etc.). The accuracy levels depend on where your addresses are. For example, in Los Angeles County parcel centroids are available, while in other parts of the country only TIGER/Lines are. A coverage map of reference data sources is not available at this time, but is in development. The underlying tools are planned to be open-sourced in the future once more development is completed as well.
