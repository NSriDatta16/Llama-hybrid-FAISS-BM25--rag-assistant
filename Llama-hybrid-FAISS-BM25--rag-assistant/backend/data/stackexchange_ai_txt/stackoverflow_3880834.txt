Polyline disappears while setting PolylineStyle property of a line series in a Silverlight chart

I have a silverlight chart which has multiple line series that was dynamically created. When I assign a PolylineStyle of the dynamically created LineSeries the lines in chart disappear. Only markers are shown. It is odd because when I assign the same style from xaml everything works as it should. I'm using the following code to assign the style: agentSeries.PolylineStyle = (Style)AgentsChart.Resources["AgentResultChartLineStyle"]; this style contains only one setter - StrokeThickness = 2. Am I doing something wrong here? Why do the lines disappear when I set the PolylineStyle from code on the dynamically added LineSeries?
