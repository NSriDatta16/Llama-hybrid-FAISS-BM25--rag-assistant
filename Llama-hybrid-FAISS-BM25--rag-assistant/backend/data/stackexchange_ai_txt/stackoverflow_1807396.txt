It's not a classic book (was originally published in the 90s), but I learned MIPS asm from Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface by Patterson and Hennessy (ISBN: 0123706068). The book isn't strictly about assembly; it's a computer architecture textbook. But MIPS is a decently clean architecture. Although I suppose if you're asking for a classic, you're probably looking for something that goes fairly indepth into the works.
