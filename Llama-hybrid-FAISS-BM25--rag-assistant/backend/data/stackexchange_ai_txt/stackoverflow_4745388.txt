How can I suppress the output to console when importing packages in RPy2 in Python?

Whenever I run a script importing packages with import in RPy2 in Python, there are always some extra lines popping up in the console. I pasted in an example below. How can I suppress that behavior? CookieJar:r cookies$ python script.py ‘tseries’ version: 0.10-24 ‘tseries’ is a package for time series analysis and computational finance. See ‘library(help="tseries")’ for details.
