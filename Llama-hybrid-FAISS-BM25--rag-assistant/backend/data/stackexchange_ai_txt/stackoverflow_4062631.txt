How to create a static NSRange?

It is really a stupid question, but I really don't know how to. I have a utility class and need to define some pre-defined variables. Here's how my class looks. #pragma mark File header part definiation (start offset, length) NSRange HEADER_VERSION = NSMakeRange(0, 4); /* 0,4 */ NSRange HEADER_IDENTIFIER = NSMakeRange(4, 18); /* 4, 18*/ ... @interface ParserUtil : NSObject { } /*Parse Paper instance from file*/ +(Paper*) parsePaper:(NSURL*)file; @end The compiler tell me the second and the third lines are error: initializer is not constant. What is the best practice of defining the variables?
