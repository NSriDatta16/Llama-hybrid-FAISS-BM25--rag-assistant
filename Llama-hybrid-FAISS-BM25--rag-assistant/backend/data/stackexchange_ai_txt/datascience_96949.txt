Be aware that PCA is a linear dimensional reduction algorithm, whereas t-SNE or UMAP are non linear (=gaussian). Consequently the results are usually better with t-SNE or UMAP, even with a large number of features. Then, you should be carefull with the features because not all of them have the same weight, and some are too noisy, which creates bad results (no clear clusters). I usually recommend using less features or simplified data, see if the results are correct, and then increase the number of features or the data complexity. Then, the main advantage of UMAP is that clusters are correlated to each other, but t-SNE could be better in correlations point to point. Note that t-SNE could require data normalisation, whereas UMAP doesn't.
