Apply some trends and seasonality extraction technique , and analyze the trend. The seasonality extraction can obviously only detect wave lengths shorten than a few decades. For instance, suppose that you detected than in past 50 years the temperature is increasing. Great, does it mean that it will keep doing so in next 50 years? Perhaps that would be a reasonable conclusion, but perhaps not. What if there is 200 year cycle in temperature and we're at the peak? In this case in next 100 years we'll have a decline in temperature. You will not be able to detect this in data. I hope you're not into DIY climate "science" here. If you're interested in application of time series analysis to similar series, then Shumway Stoffer text has several examples of techniques applied to "global" climate data series. They have examples in R.
