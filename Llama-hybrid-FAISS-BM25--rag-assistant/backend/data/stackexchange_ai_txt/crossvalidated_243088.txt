Judging from the original plot, your time series does not contain a unit root. The series oscillates around a constant level of approx. 1000, which does not look like a random walk. Therefore, you should not difference at all. You could probably try a logarithmic transformation as the positive spikes are higher than the negative ones, i.e. there is asymmetry. Then try to identify the "right" AR and MA lags (if you fail to do that manually, you may always use the function auto.arima in the "forecast" package in R), and you will be good.
