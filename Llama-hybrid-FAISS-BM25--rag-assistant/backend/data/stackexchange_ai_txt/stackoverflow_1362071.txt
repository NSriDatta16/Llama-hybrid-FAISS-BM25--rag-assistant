Well, you have the problem of directly embedding styles and scripts into your content. The primary mantra here is the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle. You may use a script or particular style in multiple places. When that style or script requires modification, you now get to go on a scavenger hunt for all the places where that code exists. Keeping your styles and scripts in a common place is ideal. On the other hand, if it is a minor style issue (pixel pushing or something related to just that one view), it's probably okay.
