Have you considered using adversarial training for this? The basic idea is that the network has an adversarial branch that tries to discriminate between samples in different domains (i.e. in your case, tries to identify which person the sample is from). The main part of the network is then trained to perform your main task while selecting features that try to prevent the adversarial branch from succeeding. The loss function minimizes the target loss while maximizing the adversarial loss. The maximization can be achieved by inserting a gradient reversal layer (which simply reverses the sign of the gradient) between the adversarial part and the feature extractor. Ganin et al.'s Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks introduces this idea for domain adaptation, while Xie et al.'s Controllable invariance through adversarial feature learning uses a similar idea to train models that are invariant to a multi-valued feature.
