Natural Language Processing in C++

I'm working on a project that already has a C++ base. I would like to have a plug-in for some natural language processing. I really like GATE but I'm not sure if it's worth launching the JVM and splitting the project into C++ and Java portions. I noticed UIMA has a C++ framework, but have not tried it but seems to have less features than GATE. Does anyone know of a better option than trying to wrap GATE somehow in C++ (eg better NLP library in C++)? If I do wrap GATE in C++, what is the best way? SOA? Thanks
