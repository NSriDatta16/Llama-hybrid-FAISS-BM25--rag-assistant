Binning: Selection of Range (Cutoff) for a Variable

In a current modeling work, we only use facilities with the secured portion % in the range of 70-100% (the range can be from 0-200%). These facilities (in the 70-100% secured percent range) are used for computing the average loss of facilities. Facilities with a secured portion not in the range of 70-100% are not considered. We are interested in getting a range (can be other than 70-100%) using some statistical/quantitative method instead of the current 70-100% range, which is based on judgment. Any general ideas/approaches on how to go around this? Even if you need some extra data/fields for this analysis, assume that you have it and just mention it in the answer. User2974951 Question: Why/how did you select this range from 70 to 100 in the first place? What question did you ask to arrive at this answer? Answer: Our data is segmented based on the primary collateral of the borrower (like Fixed Assets, Accounts Receivable, Residential Real Estate, etc). So a facility that has Fixed Asset as the primary collateral will be put in the Fixed Asset primary collateral group. Ideally, we should use only 100% secured facilities as they are not under-secured ( 100%) but the number of facilities by primary collateral (with a count greater than 15) after a 100% filter is too low. So to have a good count of facilities by each primary collateral, we use 70-100% instead of only 100%. This is a loss given default exercise.
