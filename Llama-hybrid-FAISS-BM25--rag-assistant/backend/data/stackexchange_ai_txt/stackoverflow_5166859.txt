I got a solution from the above answer for this but i want to give all details about this so others can benifit . First download a fbconnect project from this site Then make your own facebook project and save the downloaded project folder in the same directory as your project Then go to target>get info>Build>header search and make a new field as ../src(or whatever you name the downloaded project folder) Drag the Fbconnect folder to your xcode and mark the copy check box (It must include the FBConnect bundle) Run.
