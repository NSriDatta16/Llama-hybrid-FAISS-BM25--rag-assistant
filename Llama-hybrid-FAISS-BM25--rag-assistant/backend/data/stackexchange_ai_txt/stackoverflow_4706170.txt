Objective-C: Get size of a PDF that loads inside a webpage from NSURLResponse

How can i get the size of a pdf that loads inside a webpage? Usually I use the headers from the NSURLResponse to distinguish the size, but in this case I dont know how to do. The header i get looks like: response headers: { "Cache-Control" = "max-age=3600, private, must-revalidate"; "Content-Disposition" = "inline; filename=000164702760379530.pdf"; "Content-Type" = "application/pdf; charset=UTF-8"; Date = "Sun, 16 Jan 2011 14:47:45 GMT"; Pragma = ""; Server = "AtyponWS/7.1"; "Transfer-Encoding" = Identity; "X-Webstats-Respid" = b0324d930da3307597086eafb0e149c5; Does anyone know how to get the size of the whole page including the pdf or just the pdf?
