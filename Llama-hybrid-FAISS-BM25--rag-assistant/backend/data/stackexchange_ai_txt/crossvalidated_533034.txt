Is the SSIM a good loss function for an autoencoder in Image Compression?

Is it reasonable to use SSIM as a loss function for an autoencoder (e.g. here )? In my opinion, SSIM alone is not a good loss function as it depends only on the mean and the variance. Thus, it does not produce stable gradients towards the original image. Alternatively, I can well imagine that the SSIM in combination with a pixel-wise comparison (e.g. RMSE ) produces good results. Am I missing something?
