Confusing Holt-Winters parameters

I have got a model for forecasting using holt-winters. However the parameters confuse me... The parameters show that there is no trend or seasonality even though there is definite trend and seasonality in the data, the forecasts also match the pattern of the data so the parameters really do not make sense. M This shows the time series with the forecasts where you can see definite seasonality and trend Are these parameters normal for holt-winters?
