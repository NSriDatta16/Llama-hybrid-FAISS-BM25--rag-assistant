Best way to organize MATLAB classes?

MATLAB has two ways of organizing classes: @-directories: @ClassName\ ClassName.m Method1.m Method2.m Single files: ClassName.m: classdef ClassName methods % all methods included here end end The first style existed before the new classdef syntax, but seems to be a more structured way of doing things. The second style (everything in a single file) is new. Which method do you use, and why?
