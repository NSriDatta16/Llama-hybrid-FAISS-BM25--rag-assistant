IQR is 0 but mean is not 0

I have a dataset where the 5 number summary is: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -0.0082630 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000059 0.0000000 0.7966557 I'm not quite sure how to visualize this/whether this is even possible! It is saying that the IQR is 0, while the average value is not 0?
