Can a MonoDevelop user benefit from optional parameters while still targeting at 3.5?

As stated in this question , thanks to some compilation trickery, Visual Studio 2010 allows a project targeting at .Net 3.5 to benefit from optional parameters. Is it possible to achieve similar behavior with MonoDevelop 2.6b1? EDIT: This problem doesn't however affect xbuild which can successfully leverage dmcs (C#4.0 compiler) to target a 3.5 profile.
