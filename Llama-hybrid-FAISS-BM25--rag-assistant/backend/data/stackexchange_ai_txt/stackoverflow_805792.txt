Snap to nearest street

You guys have been helping out solving some of my problems with a Google Map lately, and thank you for that. I am almost done with this - only one problem is left. When I place the first marker on the map, it snaps to the nearest street (which is fine!) but when I drag the first marker to another place, directions suddenly mess up. And the markers get mixes. You can see an example on http://dev.korebogen.dk/gmap/ I need to make it possible to move the first marker (still snapping) and when I place the second marker, the directions first load. But in order to make the first marker snap again, I have to load the directions. I hope some of you have a solution. Thanks in advance.
