ASP.NET: external custom config file in a virtual directory - how to?

I know that there at least two approaches to leverage the web.config file: using the configSource attribute which was introduced in .NET 2.0 - here is a good blog entry about it. The file attribute of the appSettings tag which lets you point to an external file with a relative path. Described in the MSDN documentation on the appSettings element . Now, my problem is that both approaches work well only for physical paths . But I need to address a config file which is in a virtual directory . Which other method could I use to put my config resources in a virtual directory? Note: I want to do it this way, because I have multiple instances of my web application on the same server (and that on many servers). To keep deployment easy and clean, I want to keep one directory for all the files (aspx, ascx, images, css, js etc.) and point the web apps in IIS for different customers (=domains, https etc.) to this single directory. In every IIS web I would have a virtual directory called "custom" which points to a different folder for each web. Update: I'd like to point out that this virtual directory "custom" is not suited to contain an inherited web.config - that web.config would be valid only for the custom folder which doesn't contain aspx/ascx files.
