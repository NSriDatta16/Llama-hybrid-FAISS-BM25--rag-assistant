Load testing using Visual Studio 2008 : troubles with analyzing results

I use Visual Studio Team System 2008 Team Suite for load testing of my Web-application (it uses ASP.MVC technology). Load pattern:Constant (this means I have constant amount of virtual users all the time). I specify coniguratiton of 1000 users to analyze perfomance of my Web-application in really stress conditions.I run the same load test multiple times while making some changes in my application. But while analyzing load test results I come to a strange dependency: when average page response time becomes larger,the requests per second value increases too!And vice versa:when average page response time is less,requests per second value is less.This situation does not reproduce when the amount of users is small (5-50 users). How can you explain such results?
