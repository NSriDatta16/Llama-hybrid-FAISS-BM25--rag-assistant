After the development of Probability Theory it was necessary to show that looser concepts answering to the name of "probability" measured up to the rigorously defined concept they had inspired. "Subjective" Bayesian probabilities were considered by Ramsey and de Finetti, who independently showed that a quantification of degree of belief subject to the constraints of comparability & coherence (your beliefs are coherent if no-one can make a Dutch book against you) has to be a probability. Differences between axiomatizations are largely a matter of taste concerning what should be defined & what derived. But countable additivity is one of Kolmogorov's that isn't derivable from Cox's or Finetti's, & has been controversial. Some Bayesians (e.g. de Finetti & Savage) stop at finite additivity & so don't accept all of Kolmogorov's axioms. They can put uniform probability distributions over infinite intervals without impropriety. Others follow Villegas in also assuming monotone continuity, & get countable additivity from that.
