If you've setup your MKAnnotation object with a setCoordinate method properly, then in the didChangeDragState method, the new coordinate should already be in the annotation object: - (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView annotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)annotationView didChangeDragState:(MKAnnotationViewDragState)newState fromOldState:(MKAnnotationViewDragState)oldState { if (newState == MKAnnotationViewDragStateEnding) { CLLocationCoordinate2D droppedAt = annotationView.annotation.coordinate; NSLog(@"dropped at %f,%f", droppedAt.latitude, droppedAt.longitude); } } For reference, see the "Marking Your Annotation View as Draggable" section in the docs here . If your app needs to work in an OS earlier than 4.x, the dragging requires more manual work. The link in the docs also points to an example of how to do that if you need to.
