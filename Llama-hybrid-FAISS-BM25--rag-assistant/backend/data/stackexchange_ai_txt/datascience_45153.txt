What machine learning model should be used to predict coincidence factor

I have coincidence factor for different sizes of groups and the associated attributes (e.g. building usage type and floor area) for each consumer in the group. I want to predict coincidence factor for new groups using the attribute for each consumer in the new group and the number of consumers in the group. What machine learning method can solve the problem? :) Defintions: Coincidence factor is the peak of a system divided by the sum of peak loads of its individual components
