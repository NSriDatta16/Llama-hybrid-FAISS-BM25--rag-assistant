t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is often used for dimensionality reduction in word embeddings. t-SNE maintains the relative relationships between the vectors. Most often t-SNE is used for visualization, thus reducing the dimensions to 2 or 3. It could also reduce the dimensions down to 50.
