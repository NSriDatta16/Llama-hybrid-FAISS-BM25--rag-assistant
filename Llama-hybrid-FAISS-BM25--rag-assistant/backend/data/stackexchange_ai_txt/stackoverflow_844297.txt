That is very interesting topic. The question is how many keywords do you need to define one PDF. If you say: 3 to 10 - I would check methods of text categorization such as bayesian classifier or K-NN (that method will group PDF files into clusters which are similar). I know that similar algorithms are used to filter spam. But it is a system that need input for example if you add keywords to 100 PDF this system will learn the schemas. I am not an expert but this is one way to do it. more than 10 - then I would suggest brute force -> filter common words -> get most frequent words for a specific document. I would explore first option. You must surely check such methods as "text categorization", "auto tagging", "text mining", "automatic keyword extraction".
