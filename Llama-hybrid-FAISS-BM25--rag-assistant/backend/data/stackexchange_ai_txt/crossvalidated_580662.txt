Applied Bayesian Statistics - Textbooks

I understand the bayesian statistics, but I don't see many textbooks approaching the bayesian statistics in a practical way. Some book recommendations on Bayesian Practical Applications would be great. Something like how to apply the bayesian methods in different scenarios like Experimentation - A/B testing Predictive analytics Causal inference Any other Modelling etc with practical examples
