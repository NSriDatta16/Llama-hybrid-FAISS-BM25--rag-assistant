Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the best performing models by far on image data. Use a pretrained model that you train the last layer of, and you might get OK results. You may need to change the image size to fit one of the pretrained models. 128x128 and 96x96 are common small sizes. You can start with a small model such as MobileNet to see if the approach works. Here are some examples of pretrained networks in Python using Keras: https://keras.io/applications/
