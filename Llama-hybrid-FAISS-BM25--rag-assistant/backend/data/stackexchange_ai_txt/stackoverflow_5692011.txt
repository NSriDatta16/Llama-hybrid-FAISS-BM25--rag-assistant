Just built a website based on your code fragments. Some thoughts on it: Your class is named TemplatePage in code behind but refered as TemplateMasterPage . There is no control AnotherBtn . There is Submit_Btn only. There is no control Btn . There is Submit_Btn only. I get no errors on InputControls_Div or AfterSubmission_Div . So all I can say, that your compiler is right and you have to add the missing buttons or rename the code to make it compile successfully.
