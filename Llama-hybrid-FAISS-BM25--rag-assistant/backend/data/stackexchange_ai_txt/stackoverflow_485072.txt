How do you stop Copy/Paste in a flash form

I work for a medical transcription company and our medical transcription test we administer to our applicants is an older flash forms app that stops copy and paste by emptying the clipboard when you enter the form. This worked great in IE 7, but recently it has come to my attention that it does not work so well in Firefox. Or perhaps it is the version of flash, since flash should be browser independent. I'm not by any means a flash developer, in fact I'm quite terrible at it. So what I need to know is how to stop the copy and paste using action script. Based on the comments apparently some additional information is necessary. What the test actually does it plays a voice file (Basic MP3) that they have to transcribe as the listen to it. The copy and paste problem comes in when their transcriptionist buddy has already taken the test and just emails it to their friend so they can skip over it.
