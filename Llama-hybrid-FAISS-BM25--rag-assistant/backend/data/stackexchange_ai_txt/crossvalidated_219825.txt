Mathematical and statistical prerequisites to understand particle filters?

I am currently trying to understand particle filters and their possible uses in finance and I'm struggling quite a bit. What are the mathematical and statistical prerequisites I should revisit (coming from a background in quantitative finance) in order to (i) make the basics of particle filters accessible, and (ii) to later understand them thoroughly? I have a solid knowledge of graduate-level time series econometrics, with the exception of state-space models, which I have not covered yet. Any hints are much appreciated!
