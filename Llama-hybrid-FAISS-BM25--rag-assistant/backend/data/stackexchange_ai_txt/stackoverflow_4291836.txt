If you remove something from the middle of a vector it will move all the following elements one position towards the beginning. It will not reallocate. You don't have to consider reallocations at all because they are amortized to give O(1) time per insertion. deque is not much better than vector. Removing from the beginning or end is efficient. Not from the middle. If you remove from anywhere, then it will hopefully be twice as fast a vector, but not faster. Since it's a more complicated structure it'll probably be even slower. deque doesn't guarantee continuous storage, so although indexing is allowed and done in O(1) time, you still can't reliably convert it to a pointer. Anyway it smells like premature optimization. Use vector. Since the order of clients is not significant, you can speed up the erasure of clients by swapping the element that you want to remove with the last element in the vector and calling pop_back() after that.
