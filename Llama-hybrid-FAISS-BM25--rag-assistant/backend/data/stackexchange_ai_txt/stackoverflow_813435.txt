The HEAD/GET pattern looks like a web accelerator plugin/proxy of some kind - HEAD-ing a link to see if it exists/is modified and then fetching it. Assuming you don't have some other web server in front of your JBoss, then it's unlikely to be your fault. Also, I don't think that's actually a real user-agent string (real IE6 UAs on XP generally send their CLR version as well), which would support the theory that it's a broken proxy server.
