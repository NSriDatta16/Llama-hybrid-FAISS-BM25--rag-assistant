I bet your misunderstanding the concept of cast. A cast means the AddressVM instance is an Address instance... which i assume it's not. You will probably have to "convert" or instantiate the AddressVM object from the Address object. try this : public ViewResult List(int id) { var db = new ModelEntities(); var addresses = from a in db.Addresses.Where(x => x.CustomerID == id) select new AddressVM(a); return View(addresses ); } [edit] According Brian's answer , you can cast an object if there is an implicit conversion between your actual type and the target type.
