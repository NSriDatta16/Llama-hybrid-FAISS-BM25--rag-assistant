No. As you mention yourself: However, Organizational Units are just an abstraction for the administrator, and do not function as true containers; the underlying domain operates as if objects were all created in a simple flat-file structure, without any OUs. You can copy a file to another location in your file structure, however you can only have a given user only once in the directory forest. Therefore you can't add it to multiple OUs. And in my opinion there is no use in adding a user to multiple OUs, since they don't serve as real AD groups. If you really want some hierarchy then you should build a hierarchy of OUs.
