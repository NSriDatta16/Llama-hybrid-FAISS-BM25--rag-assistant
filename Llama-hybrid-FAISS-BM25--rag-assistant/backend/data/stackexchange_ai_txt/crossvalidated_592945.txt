No . Bayesian Network perfect maps need not be chordal. And your example is a case in point. At least, if chordality is really defined as the chordality of the undirected version. So this is a bit confusing. But in the text following the cited statement, what they actually use is the fact that the undirected components of the chain graph $\mathcal K$ are chordal . So my guess is that that's what they refer to by " $\mathcal K$ is chordal". Then, in your example, $\mathcal K$ would be the chain graph: and the only nontrivial undirected component present is: And this component is indeed chordal. And that, IIUC, is all they need in their proof of Theorem 3.10.
