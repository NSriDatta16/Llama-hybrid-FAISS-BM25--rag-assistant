The REAL answer is go get one of E.F. Codd 's books and brush up on relational algebra . Then get a good book on Big O notation . After nearly two decades in IT this is, IMHO, one of the big tragedies of the modern MIS or CS degree: Very few actually study computation. You know...the "compute" part of "computer"? Structured Query Language (and all its supersets) is merely a practical application of relational algebra. Yes, the RDBMS have optimized memory management and read/write but the same could be said for procedural languages. As I read it, the original question is not about the IDE, the software, but rather about the efficiency of one method of computation vs. another. Even a quick familiarization with Big O notation will begin to shed light on why, when dealing with sets of data, iteration is more expensive than a declarative statement.
