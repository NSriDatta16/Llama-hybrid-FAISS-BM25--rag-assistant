When using x86 machines with at least SSE, and if you need to approximate only, you could use the assembly instruction PAVGB (Packed Average Byte), which averages bytes. See http://www.tommesani.com/SSEPrimer.html for explanation. Since you've got 5 values, you would need to be creative in calling PAVGB, since PAVGB will only do two values at a time.
