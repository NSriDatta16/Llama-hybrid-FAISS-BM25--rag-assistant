Markov chains #2

A very new European “Rapid Reaction Force for Fire” has been created today and begins operation between three Countries “A”, “B” and “C”. It’s main resource is a super aircraft “Funderbird2” with a massive water cannon that even carries a small mini-submarine for fighting fires at sea. Unfortunately, it can only be in one Country at a time. What is the matrix representation of this problem? The probabilities of going to a fire in another Country, given that the force are in a given Country to begin with, are shown on the sketch above (any resemblance to any particular Country or Nation is purely coincidence and not intended). The probabilities were obtained as a weekly average using statistics for fires over many recorded weeks. When will the plane take up permanent residence in one Country? Footnote: The final time computed here is the “Laplace transform” of the rate of rescue operations for country C. In this question the matrix approach is used to represent the differential calculus. This is my homework. I need help from where to start. Would like you to give me directions and to be solved by me, so that I can learn something. I think I have solved under a) but I am not sure if matrix is correct. [1.0 0.0 0.0] [0.1 0.6 0.3] [0.1 0.4 0.5]
