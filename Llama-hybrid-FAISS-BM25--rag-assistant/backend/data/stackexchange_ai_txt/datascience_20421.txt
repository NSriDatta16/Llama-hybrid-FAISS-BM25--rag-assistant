Multi Label Classification for a large number of labels

I am working on a problem where my input feature vector is of dimension 2 and I have to predict labels corresponding to each input. The set of labels is quite huge, I have about potential 1500 labels for each input. The way I approach it now is that I make vector representation for labels as 1's and 0's, with 1 corresponding if that label is present in the input example. However, the size of the vector would be about 1500. I tried using Logistic Regression on this and it gave very bad results, with precision being 0.0006 and recall being 0.0011. I also used a deep learning approach, where I passed the input feature of dimension 2 through some embedding layers and then predict/classify labels with these complex features. Loss function I used for deep learning model is binary_crossentropy. But still, it does not perform better. Please direct me to some resources that discuss the problem of multi-label classification with a very large number of labels.
