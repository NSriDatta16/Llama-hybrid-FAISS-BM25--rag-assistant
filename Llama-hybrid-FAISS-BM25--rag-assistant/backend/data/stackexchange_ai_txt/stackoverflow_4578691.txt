Javascript Redirect window.location.href - IE

Trying to do a redirect with javascript using the following code (works fine in ALL browsers except IE8 and IE7): if (confirm('Are you sure you wish to clear your basket?')) { window.location.href = '/basket/clear'; if (navigator.userAgent.search('MSIE') > -1) alert('Your basket has been cleared.'); } I have added in the second alert stating that the basket has been cleared so that the code works in IE. If I remove the alert then it doesn't work. Any ideas or solutions would be greatly appreciated.
