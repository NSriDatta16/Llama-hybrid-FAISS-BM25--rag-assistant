How to transform and which machine learning algorithm to use on strange target variable (skewed, non symmetric distribution with spikes)?

I have a classic, simple regression problem - predict continuous target variable y based on the number (100s) of predictors. See sample of the data set below. I am dealing with the following distribution of target variable (strange form, skewed, non symmetric, with spikes (please see picture below). What to do with this target (how to transform it)? Which machine learning algorithm to use (it is a regression problem)? I have hundreds of predictors and I am trying to predict continuous target using a regression model. Target represents purchase value in USD (rounded to whole number/integer). I have 100000 cases/observations with hundreds of numeric predictors (some continuous, some factors already coded as integers). For distribution/values of target please see below picture. Data looks something like this (it has more columns/predictors, y is a target variable (above is it's distribution), continuous/numeric):
