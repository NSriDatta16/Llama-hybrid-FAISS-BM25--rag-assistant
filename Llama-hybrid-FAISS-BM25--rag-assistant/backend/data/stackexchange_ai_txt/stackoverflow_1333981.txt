This is one of the "what would happen if that were true?" questions. It has nothing to do with the operating system, the points apply equally to any general purpose computer. Imagine that there were a way to somehow create an immutable file. What's there to stop someone from filling up a file system with an immutable file (or many of them)? What if someone were to create immutable files with pathnames the operating system needs (Windows example - NTUSER.DAT for some user, *nix example - /bin/ls, etc.)? What if the operating system decides it must move the file (e.g., while defragmenting or otherwise reorganizing the file system)? What if a piece of malware replaces a system file with a copy of itself then makes that file immutable to prevent anyone from ever cleaning the system? I feel the question is incomplete as it is now. Could you edit it to include more details about the underlying problem you're trying to solve?
