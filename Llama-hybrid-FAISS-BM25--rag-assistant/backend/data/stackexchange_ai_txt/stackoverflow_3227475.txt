You need several things to make this work. If you drag the table from the Data Sources view you end up with a few different things on your GUI: a dataSet a bindingSource the TableAdapter a tableAdapterManager a BindingNavigator With these in place you can look at the source code to see what hapens beind the scenes. You'll need the EndEdit (as Baldi said before) but you need a little more: private void UpdateGridView() { // validate that data types corresponds to database table column this.Validate(); // ends edit on the graph table this.graphBindingSource.EndEdit(); // ends edit on the graph table this.intervalBindingSource.EndEdit(); // connect to the database - and exceute changes this.tableAdapterManager.UpdateAll(this.diagramDBDataSet); } Hopefully this gets you started. If you want to learn more - you can follow this .NET database slide show with the complementary database tutorial . Good luck!
