If the product seen on home or search page can be just a result of randomly scanning the page by the user and might not necessarily mean that the user expresses an interest for the product, while something that has been seen on the product page means that the user clicks into that page, I think it would be interesting to represent this information in one-dimension by applying PCA, and check if the most variance in the component does come from the variable z. If so, you could probably use the PCA component scores as an indication of interest level.
