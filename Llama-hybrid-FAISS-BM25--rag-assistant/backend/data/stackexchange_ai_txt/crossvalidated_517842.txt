Chatterjee's Correlation: Understanding & Implementation

As a lay person I'm having trouble understanding how Chatterjee's formula as defined produces a correlation between two time series when it only references one of them. Pearson's/Spearman's correlations both reference the separate series $(X,Y)$ , but this one doesn't. Let $r_i$ be the rank of $Y_{(i)}$ , that is, the number of $j$ such that $Y_{(j)} ...additionally define $l_i$ to be the number of $j$ such that $Y_{(j)} >= Y_{(i)}$ There are only 3 unique terms in the formula: $r_i$ , $l_i$ , and $n$ (which seems to be just the # of elements). So based on what the formula itself shows, X never seems to be used. $$ E(X,Y) = 1 - \frac{n \sum^{n-1}_{i=1}{|r_{i+1} - r_i|}}{2 \sum{^n_{i=1}l_i(n-l_i)}} $$
