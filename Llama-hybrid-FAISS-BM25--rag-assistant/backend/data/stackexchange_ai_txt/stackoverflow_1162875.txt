We had this exact debate on my current project a while back. I really don't have a preference, but consistency is an important consideration. The first (there are several) definition of "state" in my Sharp PW-E550 (an awesome dictionary, I might add) is "the particular condition that someone or something is in at a specific time." The first definition of "status" is "the relative social, professional, or other standing of someone or something". Even the second (and last) definition of "status" is inferior to "state" in this context: "the position of affairs at a particular time, esp. in political or commercial contexts." So if we wanted it to be as easy as possible for someone using my dictionary (it uses the New Oxford American Dictionary, 2001), "state" would be the best choice. Furthermore, there is a design pattern described in the Gang of Four's book called the State Pattern, firmly establishing the term in the computing lexicon. For these reasons I suggest "state". P.S. Is that you DDM? Are you still bitter about "state" versus "status" ?!!!!!!! LMAO!
