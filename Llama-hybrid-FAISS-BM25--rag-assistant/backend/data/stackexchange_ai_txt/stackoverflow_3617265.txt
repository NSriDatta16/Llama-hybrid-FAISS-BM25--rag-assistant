I think the right thing to do is follow David Lyod's advice. It's much better organization and you always know where your shared files are. However, you can still use the same concept by placing the partial _people.html.erb in the views/persons directory. Then in the people view file that uses it render :partial => "persons/people" Hope this helps.
