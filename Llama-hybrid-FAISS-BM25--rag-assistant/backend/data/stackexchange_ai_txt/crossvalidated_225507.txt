One big advantage to including all the data points rather than just analyzing the average value at each time point or concentration is that you get information on the variability of the measurements. In analytical systems this is a very important characteristic that one often wants to determine. Including all the data points also will provide more reliable estimates of the errors in the coefficients for the calibration curve, as the information about measurement error is pooled among all the data points rather than confounded into the average values at each concentration or time point. It's almost never a good idea to throw away information. Now that we are no longer limited by the hand-operated calculators that were the norm half a century ago, the issue of computational intensiveness seldom matters except with immense data sets.
