This question conflates population and sample. If your question is, as you state what order they would be in by average score then that is easy: A, D, C, B. Class size doesn't matter and no inferential statistics need be done as you have the whole populations. You've already done all the necessary calculations. Proposals about ANOVA or whatever would be about whether the differences are significant, and about how much sampling error there is. These are inferential questions, they presuppose that the classes are random samples from four different populations. That seems unlikely, but possible: If, every year, classes are split according to the same formula, then I guess it's possible to argue that these are a sample.
