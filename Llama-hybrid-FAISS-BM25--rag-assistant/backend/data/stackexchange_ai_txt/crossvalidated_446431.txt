Assuming that by binary encoding you mean the one explained here , I would advice against using it. Seems an ill-advised idea, I will explain why. First explaining shortly the idea: Suppose (only for simplicity) your categorical variable have $p=2^q$ levels, for the example I take $q=3$ . Then code the levels with the binary numbers $0=000_2, 1=001_2, 2=010_2, 3=011_2, 4=100_2, 5=101_2, 6=110_2, 7=111_2$ . Then, for each of the 3 bits, introduce one column in the design matrix, recording just that bit (so 0 or 1.) What is wrong with this? The 8 possible levels is represented in a 3-dimensional linear subspace, introducing (many!) linear restrictions! Those restrictions will depend on how you associate levels to binary numbers. In short: do not ever use this idea . That makes your main question here moot ... About applying PCA to a matrix of one-hot vectors encoding a categorical variable, there is many posts here, search, I don't know. But I would in its case looking into using correspondence analysis in place of PCA, but see Doing principal component analysis or factor analysis on binary data .
