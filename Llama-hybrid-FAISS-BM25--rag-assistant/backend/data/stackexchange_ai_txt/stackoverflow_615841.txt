This answer uses the built in Quarter and DaysInMonth functions: #createDate(year(now()), (quarter(now())*3), daysInMonth(createDate(year(now()), quarter(now())*3,1)) )# It might be easier to read if its broken out a bit. EDIT (@Sam Farmer: I took the liberty to transform your suggestion into a CF function)
