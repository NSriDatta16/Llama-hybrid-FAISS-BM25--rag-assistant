Give me a calendar to select the date with a mouse. And let me type the date in with the keyboard. Accept as many formats as possible. If I need to enter December 21, 2012, let me use: Dec 21 2012 21DEC2012 December 21 2012 12/21/2012 (or 21/12/2012, pick one, perhaps depending on what country I'm using the software in) 12212012 (same parenthetical fragment as above) Etc. Whatever you decide to do to solve the localization issue, make sure it's obvious what you expect. Give me an example, or a template with MMDDYYYY that I can type over. Please don't give me pull-down boxes where I have to scroll, especially through years. If I'm old, and I'm entering my DOB, I don't have enough time left in my life to scroll down to the bottom of your pull-down box. Pull-down boxes are a good pattern to use when I don't know what the options are, but if it's something I'm very familiar with, like my birth date, then pull-down menus are a hassle. Now, WRT time inputs (Big pet peeve), don't assume that I meant 3 am. If I enter 3 for the time, assume I meant 3 pm. Make me do extra work to schedule something at 3 am. If you're uncomfortable with assuming that much on my behalf, at least alert me that I've scheduled something for 3 am so I can fix it now instead of later when someone on my event invitation list emails and says "You moron, you scheduled our D&D Meetup for 3 am!"
