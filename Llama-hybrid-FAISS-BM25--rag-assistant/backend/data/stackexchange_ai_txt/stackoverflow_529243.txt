I think you're making the right call by keeping a single repository for your many projects, so I would only make a change to your deployment process: Your svn repo would look like (your first option.) /svnrepo/project1/trunk /svnrepo/project1/trunk/htdocs /svnrepo/project1/trunk/css ... /svnrepo/project1/branches/branch1 /svnrepo/project1/tags/blah /svnrepo/project2/trunk /svnrepo/project3/trunk When you want to deploy use a script to copy the file(s) to where they ought to be deployed. This way, you're keeping an artificial barrier (a folder) up to organize your thoughts between projects rather than having just a big mess of files. edit:accidentally saved & additional directories added for clarity
