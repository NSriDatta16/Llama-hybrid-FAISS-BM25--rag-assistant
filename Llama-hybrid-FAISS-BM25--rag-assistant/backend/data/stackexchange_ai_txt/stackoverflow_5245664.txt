If you're using the InnoDB storage, you should not just use 'an index' but make use of FOREIGN KEY . Thus, you will also decrease potential integrity problems. Suggestion: do not use restaurant as a name. Add some more tables and it will be difficult to keep track what references what. Why not call it user_id ? (This is a matter of personal preference, though.)
