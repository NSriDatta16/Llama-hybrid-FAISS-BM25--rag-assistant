How to best define a "contrast" in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?

I have been studying how to interpret principal components. I recently came across an example of a particular eigenvector: $$e_j^T = \left[ \frac{\sqrt{2} }{2}, \frac{-\sqrt{2} }{2}, 0, \dots,0 \right]$$ I am under the impression that, often in social sciences, "this is called a contrast." From what I can see, we have the difference between $X_1$ and $X_2$ (variables in our original dataset) playing a role in the $j$th eigenvector. What can this say about the relationship between $X_1$ and $X_2$, with respect to this eigenvector? There is clearly something going on with the equal, yet opposite, contribution of these independent variables, to our (possibly first) principal component. I guess the answer to this is the answer to the question, "what is a contrast?" Strangely enough, googling hasn't coming up with much of anything aside from dense discussion such as found on the Wikipedia page.
