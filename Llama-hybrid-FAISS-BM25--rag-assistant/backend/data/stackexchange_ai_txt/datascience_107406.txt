Few points to not here: Multicollinearity effects linear model much more as compared to Random forest as it is picking up different set of features (read sampling with replacement) for every model and every model/tree see different data points. Feature importance may be impacted a little by multicollinearity Multicollinearity does not impact model performance negatively but effects interpretation of feature importance When we add polynomial features we are increasing the model complexity model starts performing better but be cautious about overfitting So, its perfectly fine and expected that model performance is increasing as you are introducing polynomial features but be very cautious about overfitting and while interpreting feature importance
