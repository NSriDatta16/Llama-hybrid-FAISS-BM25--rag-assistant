Why can't certain USB Mass Storage Devices be detected by some hardware?

I am trying to modify a mass storage driver using the composite usb framework to allow an embedded mass storage device to be visible on my Xbox 360. I have confirmed that this is not a simple VendorID/ProductID block. I would like to understand what specifically prevents some devices, say the Xbox 360, from seeing certain mass storage devices. Although my question is specific to the Xbox, a generic answer that explains why a device cannot see certain types of mass storage, would also be acceptable. I made the observation that out of the flash devices I own, the ones that do not work are those with only 2 Endpoints defined (Bulk IN, Bulk OUT). Whereas all mass storage devices containing 3 Endpoints (Bulk IN, Bulk OUT, Interrupt IN) have worked. Is this a relevant observation or coincidence?
