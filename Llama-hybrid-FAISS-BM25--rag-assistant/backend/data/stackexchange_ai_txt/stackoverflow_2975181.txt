I've never been a big fan of embedding information of the type of an object into its name, so I would not use I as a prefix anyway. But if you are doing it is a good idea to keep with the convention, but based on your example I would also consider how you name your interfaces, because from what I can tell you would have an IJQuery and a JQueryImpl . I would consider naming your interface something like JavaScriptLibrary and then name your implementing class JQuery or Prototype . In Java: public interface JavaScriptLibrary { ... } public class JQuery implements JavaScriptLibrary { ... } public class Prototype implements JavaScriptLibrary { ... }
