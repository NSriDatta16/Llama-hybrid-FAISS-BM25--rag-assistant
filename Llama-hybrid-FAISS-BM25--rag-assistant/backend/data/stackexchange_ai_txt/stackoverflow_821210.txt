Just gotta save up a little money ;-) Although I thoroughly agree with the consensus: get a Mac , I just wanted to add a little based on this comment you left: If you are planning to enter the iPhone arena to do one of those Cinderella ten-million downloads at a buck a pop stories you hear about, you'll need a killer app, something new and exciting. Good luck with that; I'm not gonna share my ideas with you, 'cause I'm trying to do the same. :) That said, I'm in the same boat as you -- I don't have the extra green to buy a Mac -- so I will share some general advice that might help. Rather than enter the iPhone arena, I've been looking into leveraging my Java skills on the Android phone first. Once I make a few bucks doing that, I'll buy a Mac and learn Objective-C and port my program(s) over. Since Android uses Java and is free/open source, I'm only out the twenty-five bucks to create a publisher account; I can do the rest with Eclipse on any platform I have. I don't know if it will help you much, but it might be a more cost-effective way to write your Cinderella story. :)
