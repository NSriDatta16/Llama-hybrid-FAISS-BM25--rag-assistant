Is there any paper shown how to solve an one class SVM by SMO type algorithm

The one class SVM can be used as an outlier rejection. An example can be found on. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3041295/ Generally one class SVM is shown as a constrained quadratic optimization problem. Support vector machine (SVM) optimization problem can be solved by quadratic programming. However, we have another efficient (low memory requirement) algorithm sequential minimal optimization (SMO) for solving SVM. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/59ee/e096b49d66f39891eb88a6c84cc89acba12d.pdf The question: is there any paper which shows how to solve one class SVM by SMO type algorithm? Any reference or suggestion would be highly;y appreciated.
