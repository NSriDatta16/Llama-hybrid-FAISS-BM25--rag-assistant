Prototype: Detect Chrome and Add Class

Okay, I have a jQuery line of code, that I need to convert to work with Prototype. $(document).ready(function(){ if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Chrome')!=-1) { /* Applying a special chrome curosor, as it fails to render completely blank curosrs. */ zoom.addClass('chrome'); } }); zoom is the classname and I want to add the class chrome to it if chrome is detected. So far for Prototype I have this: document.observe("dom:loaded", function() { Object.prototype.addClass = function(className) { if (!this.hasClass(className)) { //if the class isn't there already this.className += (' ' + className); //append it to the end of the class list } } }); But unfortunately, that's as far as I can get with Google searching. Anyone have a solution?
