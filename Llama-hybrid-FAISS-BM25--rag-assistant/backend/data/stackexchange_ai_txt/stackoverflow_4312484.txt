Alfresco for financial data (forms and data lists)

I need to build a solution for financial data analysis comprised of: * storage * forms * ACL * workflows * reports * custom logic It mainly needs to present forms to different users, collect structured (form) data over different workflows, report do different users etc. I'm investigating Alfresco as a base platform. It already has the Alfresco repository for storage with built in ACL and Workflows, and also there is the forms module . The recent data lists feature seems a good fit, maybe complemented by the WCM . I am wary as the data list feature is pretty young (and incomplete here there). How does the Alfresco Repository scale against the reporting needs (intense reads, grouping, computing averages &c)? Has anyone tried to take alfresco on this path (forms/data/reports platform), is it a good fit, any hurdles on the road, alternative ideas (build your own, use this other solution)?
