To summarize the useful information provided in comments: you don't necessarily have to use a mixed model, but you do have to take the lack of independence among the measurements into account in some way. Robust standard errors and generalized estimating equations (GEE), as discussed by Mc Neish et al. (linked from a comment by @mkt ), and generalized least squares are alternatives in many situations. Your situation, with trees nested within transects nested within shelterbelts, would seem best represented by a multi-level model. The inability to distinguish any particular random-effect estimate from 0 in a mixed model isn't important. More important is the variance among those random-effect values, which are modeled as coming from a Gaussian distribution. For example, consider this adaptation of a simple example from the lmer help page: library(lme4) (mod Notice that the random effects are reported first, with a standard deviation for the random intercept. In this example, that standard deviation is about the same magnitude as the residual standard deviation. The variance (square of the standard deviation) among those random-effect intercept values is what the model primarily estimates. That's what you should primarily pay attention to, in terms of "random effects" being "different from zero" (Question 1). Yes, you can extract the individual random-intercept estimate from the model, but the fact that you can't distinguish any individual values from 0 doesn't mean that the random effect as a whole is unimportant (Question 2). It's possible to have such low dispersion among the individual random-effect values that your model can't reliably estimate their variance and you end up with a singular model fit. That does not, however, appear to be the case with your data. As described on this page , linked from a comment by @dipetkov , that's typically seen when you try to fit more combinations of random effects than your data allow. How to proceed in such a case requires evaluation of what in particular is leading to the problem. The lack of independence among correlated observations still needs to be taken into account. Otherwise you do suffer from "pseudoreplication" (Question 3).
