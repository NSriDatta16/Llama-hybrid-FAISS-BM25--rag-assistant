Embedding multiple instances of a flash component in a Flex application

I have a flash application (pure AS, no Flex framework) that I'd like to embed inside of a flex application using SWFLoader. Embedding one instance works well. However, when I try to embed multiple instances (each with a separate SwfLoader), there is really strange behavior that seems to be caused by clashes among the class definitions of the multiple instances. This flash application is written with a lot of singleton classes, so my guess is that these singletons are overriding each other and causing the weird behavior. I tried loading the flash application into a child applicationdomain, but that doesn't seem to help much either. Has anyone faced this problem?
