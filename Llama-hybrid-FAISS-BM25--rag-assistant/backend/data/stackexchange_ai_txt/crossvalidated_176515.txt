Resources for learning about multiple-target techniques?

I am looking for resources (books, lecture notes, etc.) about techniques that can handle data that have multiple-targets (Ex: three dependent variable: 2 discrete and 1 continuous). Does anyone have any resources/knowledge on this? I know that it is possible to use neural networks for this.
