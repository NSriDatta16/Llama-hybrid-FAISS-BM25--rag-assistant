Crossvalidating for number of hidden layer nodes or not?

I have come across a paper where the number of nodes in a one hidden layer neural network is being "empirically" derived as some function of the number of input and the number of output nodes. Since the number of nodes of the hidden layer is a hyperparameter of the model, I would assume that it would have to be crossvalidated for - or is the "empirical" approach also valid? Thanks
