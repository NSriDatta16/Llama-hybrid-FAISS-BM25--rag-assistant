To answer your first question, it generally does not matter if you use margin or padding to add spacing between elements, however if you apply a border to an element and use padding to make a space it will push out the border that far. To answer you second issue just take a look at this code and maybe play around with it: Box Model Tests /* Just to get rid of the annoying padding/margin setting that is default in most browsers on the body tag from messing up our experiments */ body{ margin: 0px; padding: 0px; } p{ margin: 0px; padding: 0px; } /* It appears that if you modify the ul padding it tends to remove the bullet points, that is if you set the paddign to zero */ ul{ margin: 0px; } Paragraph. List item. Another list item. List paragraph. Keep in mind that in the example above all the remaining space has to do with properties of the font, which can be changed using the same methods as any other element. And to the third: I think 'garrow' is right about the empty I don't run into this issue that often as I use less and less in my layouts however this article looked very interesting, and I think offers a better explanation than W3C did.
