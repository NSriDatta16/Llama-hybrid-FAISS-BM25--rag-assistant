1D Convolution in Neural Networks

I understand how convolution works but I don't get how 1D convolutions are applied to 2D data. In this example you can see a 2D convolution in a 2D data. But how it would be if was a 1D convolution? Just a 1D kernel sliding in the same way? And if the stride was 2? Thank you!
