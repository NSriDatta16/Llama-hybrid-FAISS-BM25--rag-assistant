(Update 24-8-2014: Added things on Markov Chains). I doubt that there is a single "textbook" that covers all this. So partial suggestions for just three of these topics: For Markov Chains , I provide first two math.SE links that contain many suggestions: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/15431/good-introductory-book-for-markov-processes and https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/27514/nice-references-on-markov-chains-processes/27516#27516 I was able to refresh some of these texts, and they confirmed my impression that Markov Chain books are always much more advanced mathematics than anything else (sometimes, not even the Introduction contains more words than mathematical symbols). It appears that the most accessible (relatively speaking) is "Markov Chains and Mixing Times" (2008) by D.A. Levin, Y. Peres, and El.L.Wilmer , which is also officially available for download (with a separate file with Errata). At least it contains a picture with a frog in the first page of the first chapter, and the general title of Part II of the book is "The Plot Thickens" -so we have been given fair warning. For MarkovChainMonteCarlo, if you type "Introduction to MCMC" in a search engine you will be hit by almost $10$ freely downlodable .pdf files (written by academics and for educational purposes in their respective universities). I would suggest to examine every one of them, and check for level/style that suits you. It does not need necessarily to be a published book. For GeneralizedLinearModels , Dobson, A. J. (2002). An introduction to generalized linear models (2nd ed). CRC press. is, I believe, a good (and tested) choice, and has topics relevant to, and some examples directly related to, the insurance field (shouldn't you also go into Extreme Value Theory though?). From the introduction: The original purpose of the book was to present a unified theoretical and conceptual framework for statistical modelling in a way that was accessible to undergraduate students and researchers in other fields. and There is an emphasis on graphical methods for exploratory data analysis, visualizing numerical optimization (for example, of the likelihood function) and plotting residuals to check the adequacy of models.
