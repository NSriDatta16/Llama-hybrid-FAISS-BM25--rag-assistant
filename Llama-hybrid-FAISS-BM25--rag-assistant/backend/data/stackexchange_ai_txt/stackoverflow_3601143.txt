Android - TextView height issue according to content (text)

I have a RelativeLayout whose layout_height is set to "wrap_content" and inside that I have a TextView whose text is set at runtime. I have set android:layout_height="wrap_content" to my TextView, but it doesn't seems to change the height of the Textview even if the content is larger than 1 line. It only takes the height of single line and displays 1 line, and all the remaining lines appears to be marquee vertically which is seen when I drag it manually... So plz anyone can help me out.
