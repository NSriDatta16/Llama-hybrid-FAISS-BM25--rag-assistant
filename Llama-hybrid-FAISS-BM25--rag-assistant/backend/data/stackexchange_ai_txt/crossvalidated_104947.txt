Two come to mind. Morey and Rouder present "Bayesian t tests for accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis". The reference paper is here , there is a handy web interface , and an R package . There are also equivalent programs for ANOVA and correlation. John Kruschke claims that "Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test" ("BEST"). The reference paper is here , a web app by Rasmus B책책th here , and of course an R package . For more, see the web page , including a Python implementation. Rasmus B책책th has implemented a range of further tests in this tradition, but also provides a very readable explanation of BEST . The primary difference between the two, BEST and Rouder/Morey's test, is that Morey and Rouder present their approach explicitly in the tradition of hypothesis testing , whereas BEST is parameter estimation . Under the hood, the two are not too dissimilar - default priors, MCMC sampling - but the outpood is quite different; the first gives you the Bayes Factors for or against your hypothesis, the other focuses the graphical presentation on the credible interval for the estimated parameter.
