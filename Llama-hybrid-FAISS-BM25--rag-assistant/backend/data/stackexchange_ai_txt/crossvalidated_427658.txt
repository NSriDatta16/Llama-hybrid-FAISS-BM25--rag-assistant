How to predict the time of next trajectory for users

I am working with the Geolife dataset and would like to create a statistical model to predict when users will go on their next trip. The implication is to see if we can build a model to be able to better predict a good time to send a reminder to someone about to drive. The data I have is approximately 10000 trajectories from ~ 70 users. The data that I have includes the start time, end time, mode of transportation, and the location they started and stopped. I also have all the points in between the start and endpoints of the trajectories. I would imagine that some kind of Markov Chain model would work the best but I am unsure how I would create the model to produce a continuous output.
