Covid-19 Data in R - Setting Day 0 when number of cases equals n = 100

I am wondering if anyone might be able to provide me with some guidance regarding how I should reformat data related to Covid-19. I have the country data already and have been working with it for a few days, but I can't recall or simply don't know how to make it so that I can (in r) set Day 0 equal to the day that the n'th death was measured in a country, much like in the image that I have attached below. My knowledge of working with time series in R is rather limited and I have not been able to find the answers online. I've tried some examples, but to little to no avail and they're definitely not worth sharing. I am using data from the Our World in Data database: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
