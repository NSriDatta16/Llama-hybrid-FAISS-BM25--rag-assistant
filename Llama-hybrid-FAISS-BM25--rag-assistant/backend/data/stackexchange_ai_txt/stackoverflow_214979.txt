I agree with HS that this is likely due to websites using a Flash version sniffer that excludes your player. This has been a problem for me in the past. To check if this is the case for you I suggest you view the source of the page and search for the path to the swf file. This could be inside the object tag or within a line of javascript. I usually do a find for .swf and copy the whole path into the browser address line. If the video plays when you do this I suppose you could send an email to the site admin asking them to fix their swf embedding.
