After a lot of digging, I seem to have found a solution for now. It involves hacking ui.draggable.js, but currently it doesn't look like there is any other way. To see my full answer, have a look at my post on the jQuery forum: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/draggable-nested-inside-draggable-drags-both-when-dragging-child-in-ie Hope this helps someone with a similar issue. Thanks, ~Matt
