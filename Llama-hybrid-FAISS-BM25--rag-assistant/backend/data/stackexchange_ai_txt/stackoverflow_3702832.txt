When you connect your device to your computer, the organizer window in Xcode will allow you to view crash logs from the device. These can be helpful in locating the source of the problem. If you run your app on the device by debugging from Xcode, you should be able to use bt in gdb when the debugger breaks at the point of the error. This will print a backtrace that shows where the error happened. You can move up the back trace to the point in your code that had the error by typing up in gdb.
