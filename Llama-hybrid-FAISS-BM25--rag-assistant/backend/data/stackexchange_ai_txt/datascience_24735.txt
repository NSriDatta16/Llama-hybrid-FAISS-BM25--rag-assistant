You can continue to use machine learning for this model-combination step too. You're describing a form of ensembling. How about: set aside some purchases as your validation set V, and keep the remaining as training set TRAIN for TRAIN, use k-fold cross-validation to create your separate models use TRAIN again with k-fold cross-validation to ensemble the models together report performance of the ensembled models on V Ensemble techniques will take into account the predictive quality of each individual model.
