How to test a curvilinear relationship in a logistic regression

I was looking for some information about curvilinear relationships (quadratic function, to be precise) in logistic regression online, and couldn't really find much about it. I am interested if that could be done, and if so, how can I do it in SPSS? Do I just square the variable that I want to test for a curvilinear relationship and add it into the model like any other variable? Or is there some special way of doing it?
