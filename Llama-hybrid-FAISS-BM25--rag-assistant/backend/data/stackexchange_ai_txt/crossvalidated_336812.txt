There is no such a thing as a single list of assumptions, there will be at least 2: one for fixed and one for random design matrix. Plus you may want to look at the assumptions for time series regressions (see p.13) The case when the design matrix $X$ is fixed could be the most common one, and its assumptions are often expressed as a Gauss-Markov theorem . The fixed design means that you truly control the regressors. For instance, you conduct an experiment and can set the parameters such as temperature, pressure etc. See also p.13 here . Unfortunately, in social sciences such as economics you rarely can control the parameters of the experiment. Usually, you observe what happens in economy, record the environment metrics, then regress on them. It turns out that it's a very different and more difficult situation, called a random design. In this case the Gauss-Markov theorem is modified also see p.12 here . You can see how the conditions are now expressed in terms of conditional probabilities, which is not an innocuous change. In econometrics the assumptions have names: linearity strict exogeneity no multicollinearity spherical error variance (includes homoscedasticity and no correlation) Notice that I never mentioned normality. It's not a standard assumption. It's often used in intro regression courses because it makes some derivations easier, but it's not required for regression to work and have nice properties.
