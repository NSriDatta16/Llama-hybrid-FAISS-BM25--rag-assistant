"Multi-level" social network analysis?

I am very new to social network analysis and working on a project here that I am not sure what's possible to model. I don't want to quite call this multi-level because I am not exactly looking at variability over multiple levels (although maybe I am), but here is what I am interested in. The exact context here is community health workers who put on programs in their community with the help of local non-profits. I want to see what kinds of networks between non-profits are built by the community health workers. For example, maybe there has never been collaboration before between two non-profits and that has changed due to the effort of the health worker. It's a silly example but this is the type of data I would think I would want to collect -- individuals and the entities they worked with. After that, I am not sure how I would model this as I'm interested in a network of organizations as "connected" by individuals. Like I said I am new to this area so if I'm overlooking something, not explaining this well or just all wet, let me know! Thank you.
