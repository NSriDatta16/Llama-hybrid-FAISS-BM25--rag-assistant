As an addition to the main answers, which are good, comprehensive and accurate, I would like to comment about the article you reference - the one that says "throwing exceptions in destructors is not so bad". The article takes the line "what are the alternatives to throwing exceptions", and lists some problems with each of the alternatives. Having done so it concludes that because we can't find a problem-free alternative we should keep throwing exceptions. The trouble is is that none of the problems it lists with the alternatives are anywhere near as bad as the exception behaviour, which, let's remember, is "undefined behaviour of your program". Some of the author's objections include "aesthetically ugly" and "encourage bad style". Now which would you rather have? A program with bad style, or one which exhibited undefined behaviour?
