Reinforcement leaning, what are bounded and ubounded action space mean?

Current policy gradient methods usually focus on MDPs with unbounded action spaces. So, here what are the bounded and unbounded action space mean? For bounded action space, is it mean there are limited actions for agents to choose from? And For unbounded action space, is it mean there are infinite actions,for example, actions take from a range $(0, 1]$?
