You do not need a Jacobian in your transform because it is a probability distribution on $y$, not on $\theta$. It must integrate to one in $y$, whether you use $\theta$ or $\phi$: $$ \int p(y|\theta)\text{d}y = \int p(y|\phi)\text{d}y = 1 $$ It is only when you include a (Bayesian) measure on $\theta$ that the Jacobian appears. That is, if $p(\theta)$ is the prior on $\theta$, then the posterior density of $\theta$ is $$p(\theta|y)\propto p(\theta) p(y|\theta)$$ and the posterior density of $\phi$ is $$p(\phi|y)\propto p(y|\phi)p(\phi)=p(y|\theta(\phi))p(\theta(\phi))\left|\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \phi}\right|\propto p(\theta(\phi)|y)\left|\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \phi}\right|$$which does involve the Jacobian $\left|\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \phi}\right|$.
