Peter Flom raises a very important question, one that needs to be addressed before any methodological strategy. In fact, it is quite common that the 0s mean something by themselves. For example, one can think of smoking where the continuous variable represent dosage, but where non-smokers will have a 0 value not because it represents a measured quantity, but because it represents lack of exposure. Another example would be a measurement instrument where a measure is below a detectable levels. In these cases it's often easier to include a dummy variable in the model representing presence/absence of characteristics together with the continuous variable (both have to be coded appropriately). A good reference is: Robertson C, Boyle P, Hsieh CC, Macfarlane GJ, Maisonneuve P (1994) Some statistical considerations in the analysis of case-control studies when the exposure variables are continuous measurements. Epidemiology 5 (2):164-170 and, Leffondré K, Abrahamowicz M, Siemiatycki J, Rachet B (2002) Modeling Smoking History: A Comparison of Different Approaches. American Journal of Epidemiology 156 (9): 813–823
