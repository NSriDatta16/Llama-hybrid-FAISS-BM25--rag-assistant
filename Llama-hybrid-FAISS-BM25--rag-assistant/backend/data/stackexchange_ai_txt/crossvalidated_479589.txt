Relative Error is not normally distributed

I have this model in machine learning, and in the end, I calculate the Relative Error to find out how off the model is from predicting based on the real data. This is the histogram that I obtain from the model. What to do when the Relative Error curve of a Model in the Machine Learning is not normally distributed? Does this mean that the model is not well trained?
