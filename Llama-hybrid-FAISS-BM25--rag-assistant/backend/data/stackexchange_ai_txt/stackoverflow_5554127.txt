What is the LogWriter.ShouldLog(LogEntry) method behaviour based on?

What is the LogWriter.ShouldLog(..) method behaviour based on? Or what is the real intention of its usage? Its documentation page is rather sparse and doesn't provide much insight. Quoting it: Queries whether a LogEntry shold[sic] be logged. ( Complete with same typo in all versions of the Enterprise Library, makes me wonder if the authors paid much attention to it. ) The method seems rather ethereal to me. Should I always check it before logging? Currently I only check LogWriter.IsLoggingEnabled(..) which is based on an explicit setting in configuration. This represents a concrete scenario: the logging is either turned on or off.
