GAN: Discriminator converges, generator learns almost nothing

In my GAN, the discriminator loss goes down steadily, while the generator loss oscillates / does not converge. I suspect this is due to the vanishing gradient problem. Theory: as the discriminator loss doesn't start out big to begin with, the generator will never be backpropagated small gradients into, and therefore it doesn't learn to generate better images. What are some remedies to resolve this and make the generator actually work?
