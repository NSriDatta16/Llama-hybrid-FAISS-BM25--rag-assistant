Keras del stuck with constant loss and accuracy

I am trying to train a keras CNN against the Street View House Numbers Dataset. You can find the project here . The problem is that during training neither loss nor accuracy change over time. I have tried with 1 Channel (Gray Scale) images, with RGB (3 channels) images, with wider (50,50) and smaller (28,28) images, with more or less filters in the convolutional layers, with wider and smaller patches in the pooling layers, with and without dropout, with bigger and smaller batches, with smaller and bigger learning step for the optimizers, with different optimizers, ... Still the training gets stuck to constant loss and accuracy
