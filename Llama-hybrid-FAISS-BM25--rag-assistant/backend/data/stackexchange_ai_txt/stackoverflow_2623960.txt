First, it's possible to setup a simple, non-EAV model with Magento . You still need to do some configuration and setup, but it's much less complicated than a full on EAV store. Second, if you're storing information specific to users you can throw it in a session object. I can't recall the syntax right now (will update later), but search through your codebsae for ::getModel followed by the phrase "session". Third, you still have access to all the old PHP tools you'd normally have. Writing/reading out of a file or memcached space (or bringing in a third party Model library) is another option.
