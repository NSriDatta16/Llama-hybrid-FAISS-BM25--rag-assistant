Isn't that what hidden parameters are for to start with...? I wouldn't count on any browser retaining any existing query string in the action URL. As the specifications ( RFC1866 , page 46; HTML 4.x section 17.13.3) state: If the method is "get" and the action is an HTTP URI, the user agent takes the value of action, appends a `?' to it, then appends the form data set, encoded using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type. Maybe one could percent-encode the action-URL to embed the question mark and the parameters, and then cross one's fingers to hope all browsers would leave that URL as it (and validate that the server understands it too). But I'd never rely on that. By the way: it's not different for non-hidden form fields. For POST the action URL could hold a query string though.
