First of all, an absolute path must work. It's not question of Netbeans or Glassfih, or JSF - it's a browser thing. And if your browser had a fault preventing it from fetching Javascript from valid urls, you would have noticed. So if your Javascript does not load, there's a 99% chance it's a plain typo, a stupid mistake (forgetting directory name, adding an extra slash or such things), and nothing to do with any of the mentioned technologies. The other theory (just a theory - I don't have enough data to prove it) is that you have a standard mapping, showing all the faces files in a "virtual" faces directory ( /faces/ *). So that when you put your index.xhtml in the main directory of a Foo project, you see it under: localhost:8080/Foo/faces/index.xhtml . The "faces" part of path does not represent any real directory, it's just a mapping. So if you have a js file sitting by an index.xhtml, you would address it like: '../yourjavascript.js' ; the ../ is to compensate for the virtual directory part. Anyway, I strongly encourage you to drop your script loading dillemas and use the official and nice way of loading resources such as javascript is to put them into a directory called "resources" (make one under the "web pages" node in Netbeans, it will end up in the top directory of your .war); to get a path of any file saved under resources, you use EL like: #{resource['filename.css']}. You will load your script by: If you use the resource directory, you can do many more things, read up on some detailshere
