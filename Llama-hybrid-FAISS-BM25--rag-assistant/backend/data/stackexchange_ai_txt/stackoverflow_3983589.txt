The glitchy behavior was happening when the views were dragged out of the content area, released, and then tapped/dragged again before the scroll views bounced back. This could happen, for example, when the view was scrolled by several small swipes. One of the scroll views would get confused and try to decelerate (bounce) while simultaneously being dragged, causing it to jitter back and forth between the origin and where it had been dragged to. I was able to fix this by reversing the nesting of the scroll views (paging view inside of the vertical scrolling view) and by adding the delegate to the paging view's UIPanGestureRecognizer instead of to the scrolling view's gesture. Now it scrolls naturally as if it was a single scroll view while still conforming to paging only in the horizontal direction. I don't think it was intended for scroll views to be tricked into scrolling simultaneously like this, so I'm not sure if the original glitchy behavior was the result of a bug, or just a consequence of doing something unintended.
