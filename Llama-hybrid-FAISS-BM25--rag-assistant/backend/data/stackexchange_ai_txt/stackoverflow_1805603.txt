Your problem is that QA and Dev are separated teams. If you want strong cohesion, close collaboration, team spirit, etc, put QA guys and Dev guys into a same team, include QA in the development process. Your problem is an organizational problem (that you've likely inherited from an outdated organizational model) and that you won't solve with an exercise. The solution is to change the organization.
