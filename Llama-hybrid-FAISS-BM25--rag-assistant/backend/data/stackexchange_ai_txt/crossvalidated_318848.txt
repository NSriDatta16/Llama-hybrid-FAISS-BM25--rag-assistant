Your formula is incorrect. Odds can be converted to probability using the equation above. However, odds ratios are ratios of two different odds representing distinct probabilities. The model estimates from a logistic regression are additive on the log-odds scale . Create predictions on this scale using the appropriate coefficients, then transform the linear predictor using the inverse logit: $$\text{expit}(\alpha + x\beta) = (1+\exp(\alpha +x\beta))^{-1}$$. This is the probabilistic prediction equation from a logistic regression. The intercept $\alpha$ is the log odds for response when all covariates are 0. The slope $\beta$ is the log odds ratio for adjacent groups in discrete or continuous $x$.
