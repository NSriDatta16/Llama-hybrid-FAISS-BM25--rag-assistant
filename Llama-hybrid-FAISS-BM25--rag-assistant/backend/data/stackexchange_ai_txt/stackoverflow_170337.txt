Django signals vs. overriding save method

I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this. Right now I have some models that looks kind of like this: def Review(models.Model) ...fields... overall_score = models.FloatField(blank=True) def Score(models.Model) review = models.ForeignKey(Review) question = models.TextField() grade = models.IntegerField() A Review is has several "scores", the overall_score is the average of the scores. When a review or a score is saved, I need to recalculate the overall_score average. Right now I'm using a overridden save method. Would there be any benefits to using Django's signal dispatcher?
