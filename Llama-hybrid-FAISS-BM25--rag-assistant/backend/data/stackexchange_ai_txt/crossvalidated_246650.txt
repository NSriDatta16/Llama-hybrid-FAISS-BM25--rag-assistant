SEM: factor analysis and categorical data

Lets say I want to run the following model in R/lavaan: F1 =~ V1 + V2 + V3 F2 =~ V4 + V5 + V6 F1 ~~ F2 V1-3 are continuous indicators, V4-6 are categorical (binary, nominal/not ordinal). Sample size ~1000 An example of the F2 factor might be trying to capture something about a person's level of fitness, so indicators might be: Did you ride your bicycle or drive to school today? (Response: Bicycle/car) Did you go to the gym today? (Response: yes/no) From what Ive learnt so far, categorical indicators will work if you can safely assume that theres an underlying continuous normal distribution driving the categories. If you cant meet that assumption, say if V4-6 are nominal/categorical like the examples above, what would be the recommended approach? Can you introduce some form of logistic regression? And if so, how would that be done using lavaan and how would you interpret the output? Which estimator should be used in a case like this?
