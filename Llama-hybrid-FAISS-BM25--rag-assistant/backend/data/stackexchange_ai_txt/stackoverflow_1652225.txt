NCover not covering an assembly?

I am having trouble getting NCover to properly cover a .dll. I have several test projects that use XUnit.NET and SubSpec to execute BDD-style specifications. All but one of these test suites runs perfectly in the version of NCover that comes with TestDriven.NET (1.5.8). However, I have one that refused to profile the actual tested assembly. I have verified that the assembly names for the /a option are correct, that the .pdb file exists, and that there are no exceptions being thrown during execution. All of the 8 tests pass, which can be seen when the NCover console app is executed. The assembly references the WPF assemblies PresentationCore , PresentationFramework and WindowsBase . I am not sure if that might be causing problems, but I am completely baffled by NCover's refusal to profile this assembly. Command line: "C:\Program Files (x86)\TestDriven.NET 2.0\NCover\1.5.8\NCover.Console.exe" //reg //w "E:\Campus.Core\Specs.Campus.Windows\bin\Debug" //a Campus.Windows "E:\Campus.Core\ThirdParty\xUnit.NET\v1.5\xunit.console.x86.exe" Specs.Campus.Windows.dll /html Specs.Campus.Windows.html NOTE: Problem seems to have solved itself ! I don't know what changed, but the assembly is now being covered properly, and its at 100% coverage! Thanks for those of you who threw in some input. I appreciate it!
