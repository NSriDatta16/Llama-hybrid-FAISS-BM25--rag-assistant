The term Multi-Scale used in CNNs is mainly associated with the feature extraction part. To put it simply we can say that we take an input image and resize it to various resolutions and apply a Convolution block to it to perform feature extraction. Multi-Scale feature extraction can be done via: Dilated Convolutions Feature Pyramid Network Multi-Sized Filter Kernels (3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9)
