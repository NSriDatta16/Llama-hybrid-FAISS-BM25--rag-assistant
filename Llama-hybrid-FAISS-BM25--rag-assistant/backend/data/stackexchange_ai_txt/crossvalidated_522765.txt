If $p(x)=\tilde p(x)/Z_p$ , computing $Z_p$ using uniquely a sample from $p$ is not feasible by importance sampling: $$\int \tilde p(x) \,\text dx=\int \frac{\tilde p(x)}{p(x)} p(x)\,\text dx=Z_p\int p(x)\,\text dx= Z_p$$ does not help since the importance weight ${\tilde p(x)}\big/{p(x)}$ is equal to $Z_p$ , unknown! When looking at either $Z_p$ or at the inverse of $Z_p$ , the impossibility of finding unbiased estimators is clear: if $$\mathbb E_{p}[\ell(X)]={Z_p}\quad \text{and}\quad \mathbb E_{p}[h(X)]=\frac{1}{Z_p}$$ then \begin{align}\int \ell(x) p(x)\,\text dx&=\int\ell(x) \frac{\tilde p(x)}{Z_p}\,\text dx= {Z_p}\\ \int h(x) p(x)\,\text dx&=\int h(x) \frac{\tilde p(x)}{Z_p}\,\text dx= \frac{1}{Z_p}\end{align} implies that $$\int \ell(x) \tilde p(x)\,\text dx=Z_p^2\quad \text{and}\quad\int h(x) \tilde p(x)\,\text dx=1$$ both of which cannot hold since $\tilde p(\cdot)$ is known up to a constant. This difficulty is discussed for MCMC samples in a 2008/9 BA paper I wrote with Jean-Michel Marin. And solutions are compared in this 2009/10 survey of ours . All based on additional samples $^1$ from different distributions (except for the infamous harmonic mean estimator!). See also the solutions based on reverse logistic regression (Geyer, 1991/4), noise contrastive estimation (Guttmann and Hyv√§rinen, 2010/2), sequential Monte Carlo, path sampling, &tc. (Also discussed in this X validated question .) $^1$ The closest to an exception may be Chib's method (or the candidate formula, cf. Besag) since the representation of the marginal is based on a single sample from the posterior, but this is an augmented posterior based on latent variables.
