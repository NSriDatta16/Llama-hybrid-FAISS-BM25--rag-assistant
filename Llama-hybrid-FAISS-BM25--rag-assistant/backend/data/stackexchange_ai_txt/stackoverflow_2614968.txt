Silverlight doesn't prompt to increase quota

I am trying out Silverlight's Isolated Storage feature. Currently running Silverlight thru ASP.NET page. I have written some code to request an additional storage but I am not being prompted to add more. private void requestButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { using (IsolatedStorageFile store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { if (store.AvailableFreeSpace >= 1000*1024) return; long usedSpace = store.Quota - store.AvailableFreeSpace; if (store.IncreaseQuotaTo(usedSpace + 1000*1024)) statusTextBlock.Text = string.Format("Quota has been increased to {0}", store.Quota); else statusTextBlock.Text = "You have denied quota increase... you Inglorious Basterd..."; } } Silverlight's Application Storage tab doeslist the localhost ASP.NET page hosting Silverlight as shown below. According to the screenshot, http://localhost:54389 has 1.0MB of available storage area. Is there a restriction set on localhost websites that a prompt is ignored? What are the required steps for Silverlight to prompt users to increase quota?
