How do i forecast a time series is about to cross a certain threshold

I have data coming in 10 seconds apart which is the temperature of a given room. It has a seasonality of 6 hours as it has 2 AC switching back and forth. Sometimes the AC in this room fails and thus it will push the temperature up to a given threshold and sends out an alert. I would like to create an algorithm to give an early detection alert with a confidence percentage as soon as it can. I have contemplated monitoring the rate of change of temperature for every 3 minutes (18 observation) and summing up the rate of change to see if it exceeds a certain percentage of the average sum of rate of change. Is this a good way to go? But i have no confidence percentage this way. Are there any more simple or more complex solutions? Many thanks :)
