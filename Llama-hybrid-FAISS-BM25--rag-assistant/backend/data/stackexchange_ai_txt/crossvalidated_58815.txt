Why can the margin of SVM be approximated by 1?

The separate function of SVM is : $wx+b=0$ The function distance of support vector to the separate plane is : $|r| = wx_i+b$ And we can normalize the $w$, then the distance can be write as : $\frac{|r|}{|w|} = \frac{wx_i+b}{|w|}$ And then approximate $|r|$ by 1. So we should get the maximal $\frac{1}{|w|}$. Actuarially, I didn't understand why can the $|r|$ be approximated by 1. Because the $|r|$ is also include the factor $w$.
