Correlation reverses when deflated by the same amount

Assume that we have two variables, $a_{i}$ and $b_{i},$ measured across individuals $i.$ They have a strong, positive correlation, say $corr(a_{i},b_{i})\approx0.9$ . Now, there is a another variable, $c_{i}$ , which varies across individuals. Note also that $$ 0 We compute, then, for each individual: $$ A_{i}=\frac{a_{i}}{c_{i}} $$ and $$ B_{i}=\frac{b_{i}}{c_{i}} $$ We notice that $corr(A_{i},B_{i})$ becomes strongly negative! This is a bit perplexing, but the only reasonable explanation I can come up with is this- across individuals, when $b_{i}$ increases, although $a_{i}$ increases, $c_{i}$ increases by more than $a_{i}$ increases on average, rendering this correlation negative. Is this reasoning correct? Is there perhaps a formal condition linking $a,b$ and $c$ which can capture the essence of this reverse in correlation?
