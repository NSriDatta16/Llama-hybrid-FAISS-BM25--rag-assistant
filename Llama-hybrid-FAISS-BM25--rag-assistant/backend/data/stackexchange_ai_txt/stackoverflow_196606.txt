Supporting DPI and Default Font Changes

So I'm trying to figure out how the Form's AutoScaleMode property can possibly help to support a system with a font or DPI that is different from my work development machine. From the SDK: AutoScaleMode Enumeration public enum AutoScaleMode None Automatic scaling is disabled. Font Controls scale relative to the dimensions of the font the classes are using, which is typically the system font. Dpi Controls scale relative to the display resolution. Common resolutions are 96 and 120 DPI. By default .NET 2.0 Forms use AutoScaleMode.Font. So I designed a sample form on my Windows XP, Tahoma 8 pt, 96 DPI development machine. Then I tried it out on a 14 pt Segoe UI 96 DPI machine 14 pt Segoe UI 150 DPI machine The results were not encouraging, as you can see in this screenshot: The AutoScaleMode property was not designed to enable a .NET Form for support of different font or DPI settings. So what is the proper way to support different font and DPI settings?
