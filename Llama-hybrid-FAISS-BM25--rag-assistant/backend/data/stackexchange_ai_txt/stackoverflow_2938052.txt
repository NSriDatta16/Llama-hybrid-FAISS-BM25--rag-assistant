This will not be an exhaustive answer, as I don't have any experience with Android development, but I just wanted to add my thoughts on your GPS questions: Question 2: Normally speed is calculated in the GPS hardware, simply by dividing the change in distance over the change in time. (See comments below) Speed is usually reasonably accurate as long as there is GPS coverage, and you should definitely be able to tell if someone is on foot or on bicycle. You should even be able to tell between normal walking (6 km/h) and slow jogging (12 km/h). Question 3: There is an infinite number of locations at 100m from the current location. Only if you add a bearing, you would be able to derive a destination point. The formula is the following ( Source ): lat 2 = asin(sin(lat 1 )*cos(d/R) + cos(lat 1 )*sin(d/R)*cos(θ)) lon 2 = lon 1 + atan2(sin(θ)*sin(d/R)*cos(lat 1 ), cos(d/R)−sin(lat 1 )*sin(lat 2 )) d/R is the angular distance (in radians), where d is the distance travelled and R is the earth’s radius You may want to check out the following Stack Overflow post for a JavaScript implementation of the above, which I think should not be difficult to port: How to calculate the latlng of a point a certain distance away from another?
