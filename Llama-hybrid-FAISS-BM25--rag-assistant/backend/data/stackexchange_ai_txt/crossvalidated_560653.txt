Noise does not have negative connotations in statistics or machine learning. In both cases, we are dealing with random variables, so if $\mathbf{x}$ is a random variable, then any function of it $f(\mathbf{x})$ will be a random variable as well. In such a case, the output of the function would be random, non-deterministic, or “noisy”. It is not the loss functions that are noisy. Loss functions are evaluated on random variables, and any functions of random variables are noisy. Optimizing a noisy function is hard because it is non-deterministic. You have no guarantee that the function evaluated on one sample would have the same minimum or maximum as when evaluated on another sample. So when optimizing it, you need somehow account for the fact that you're dealing with a random variable. This is where the the complexity comes from. As for literature, any literature on statistics, machine learning, or optimizing noisy functions would be dealing with this subject. It's too broad to give a specific answer.
