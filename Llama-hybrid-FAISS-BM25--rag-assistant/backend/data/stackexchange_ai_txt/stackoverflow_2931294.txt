My journey is a bit different from yours as I did my Bachelor's straight out of high school. I graduated with a high enough average to get a few scholarships and ended up with CS as one of my majors and Combinatorics & Optimization as my other one. I graduated in 1997 and this was about the time of the dot-com boom so while it did take a few months I did eventually get a job. Could some of your college credits count towards a Bachelor's degree? Have you considered seeing if there is a Bachelor of Information Systems that may suit you better than a general CS program? Those are a couple of questions that I'd put out there as I'd likely think the key is finding that program that works for you is the key point I'd have as while some places may have that Bachelor's degree as a requirement, there will likely be places that wouldn't have that as a requirement so I kind of second Jason's reply on that point.
