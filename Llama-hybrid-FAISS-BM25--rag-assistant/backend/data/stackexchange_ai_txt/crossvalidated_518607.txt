In theory, yes. Since you have categorical measured variables (i.e., items), I would suggest Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (DWLS) or Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML). If you only had a handful of factors (e.g., 3 or 4), you would be in better shape. However, I would be skeptical of fitting such a complex model (i.e., 13 latent variables) with such a small sample. It is still worth a shot, however! Finally, given your small sample, I would also consider the Bayesian framework, if none of the above suggestions work. Though I do not believe LISREL accommodates Bayesian methods, so you would need to look elsewhere (e.g., R and Mplus ).
