I think you're looking for the clipsToBounds property of UIView. I've used it successfully with UIScrollView: scrollView.clipsToBounds = NO; However, the dragging you want to do from the scroll view to the game view may require you to remove the icon view from the scroll view, place it in the superview at a position corresponding to its visible position within the scroll view (calculated using the scroll view's origin and content offset), and have that track the user's finger movements. On a release of the touch, either drop it on the game view at the proper position or return it to the scroll view.
