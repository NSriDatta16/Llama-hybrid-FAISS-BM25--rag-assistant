Graphviz is the best option in my opinion. Graphviz is the premiere graph rendering/layout library; it's mature, stable, open-source, and free of charge. It is not a dedicated flowchart or diagramming package, but its core use case--i.e., efficient and aesthetic rendering of objects comprised of nodes and edges, obviously subsumes flowchart drawing--particularly because its api allows the user to set various constraints on the layout to encourage rendering in the various formats--eg, you can require all nodes of the same level (same number of parents from the root) to be rendered in a single center-aligned row. Graphviz is not a python library (it's written in C); however there are high quality python bindings available. The python-Graphviz library I am most familar with is pygraphviz , which is excellent. The other two are pydot and yapgvb . I have used both of these at least a few times. Each is smaller than pygraphviz (which might be an advantage depending on your use case); in addition neither is documented as well as pygraphviz. Fortunately, all three of these python libraries are thin wrappers over Graphviz , so none conceal the lightweight, elegant Graphviz syntax (the dot language). Here's the code (in graphviz' dot language) I used to create the small "flowchart" below: digraph { node [ fill=cornflowerblue, fontcolor=white, shape=diamond, style=filled]; Step1 [ color=darkgoldenrod2, fontcolor=navy, label=start, shape=box]; Step2; Step3a [ style=filled, fillcolor=grey80, color=grey80, shape=circle, fontcolor=navy]; Step1 -> Step2; Step1 -> Step2a; Step2a -> Step3a; Step3; Step3a -> Step3; Step3a -> Step2b; Step2 -> Step2b; Step2b -> Step3; End [ shape=rectangle, color=darkgoldenrod2, fontcolor=navy]; Step3 -> End [label=193]; }
