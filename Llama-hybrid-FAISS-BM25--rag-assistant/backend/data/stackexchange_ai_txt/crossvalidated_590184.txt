Yes --- The terms "prior" and "posterior" are always relative to the evidence you are considering, so if you have already incorporated previous evidence and are now considering new evidence, then the "posterior" from your previous analysis becomes the "prior" for your present analysis. One of the properties of Bayesian updating for a sequence of data is that it can be done equivalently either by incorporating the data "all at once" or by incorporating the data sequentially with each posterior forming the prior for the next recursive update (see e.g., these notes by Lauritzen 2009 , esp pp. 1-4).
