Bind FlowDocument to my FlowDocumentScrollViewer

I'm a bit of a WPF/XAML newbie, so it is probably a very obvious question. I added a new item to my project of the FlowDocument type. Let's call it CrappyFlowDocument.xaml : Woo, my first paragraph! I put it in a seperate file because I want to avoid putting big blobs of text in the middle of my PrettyInfoWindow . Now, in my PrettyInfoWindow , I am stumped. I can't find anything on the net about this kind of 'include' functionality, but probably my search-fu is horrible. If this isn't the intended purpose of a FlowDocument.xaml file, then what is?
