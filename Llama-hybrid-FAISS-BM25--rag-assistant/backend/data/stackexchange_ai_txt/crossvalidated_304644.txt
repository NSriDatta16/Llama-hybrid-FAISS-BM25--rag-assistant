Are random samples from a markov chain independent samples from the target distribution?

When doing MCMC, samples are not independent. The normal strategy is to retain every Nth sample for some N. The result samples should be samples from the target distribution. What if we kept all the samples and then at the end randomly (uniformly) sampled from those? Would we be sampling from the target distribution?
