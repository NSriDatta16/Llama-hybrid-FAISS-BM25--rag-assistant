A list of common time series tests?

I am reviewing my time series knowledge and looking for a document that has the commonly-used time series tests, what they are used for, how to use them, etc. e.g. Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test, PACF tests, etc. I found a wikipedia page of common statistical tests, but I am looking for a list of such that is specific for time series analysis. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Common_test_statistics Thanks!
