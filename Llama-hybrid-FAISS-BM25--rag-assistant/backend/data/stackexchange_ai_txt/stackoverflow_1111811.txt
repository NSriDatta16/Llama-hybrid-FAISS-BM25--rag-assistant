Another possibility, although probably not the most elegant, would be to create a new ActiveX com object in Delphi which in turn calls your C# class by either method which you already have working. Since you stated that this is for an existing Delphi 7 application, you might want to just use Com Interop on the C# side, expose the object as com visible, and the consume it directly from your Delphi 7 application. The first option would probably allow you to get by with minimal changes to your existing application, but does add an additional layer that most likely is not necessary.
