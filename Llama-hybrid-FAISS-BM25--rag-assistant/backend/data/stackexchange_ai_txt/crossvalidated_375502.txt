Welcome to the site. If you don't have counts, you don't have a contingency table and you shouldn't use Fisher's exact test. It looks like you are modeling satisfaction related to income and that satisfaction is on some sort of ordinal scale. I suggest that a good starting place, at least, would be ordinal logistic regression.
