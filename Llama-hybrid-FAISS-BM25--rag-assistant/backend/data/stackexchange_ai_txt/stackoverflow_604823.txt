@id thanks for the solution but something is also hidden in org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.prefs So in order to solve the problem close eclipse go to {workspace-directory}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings remove the files org.eclipse.wst.server.core.prefs and org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.prefs Tomcat 5.5 I order to be able to use the tomcat5.5 server you need to have a writeable catalina.policy file as mentioned in http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.webtools/msg16795.html (= add a READ and WRITE permissions to the files in directory "{$tomcat.home}/conf" (chmod -vR a+rw {$tomcat.home}/conf/*). To be more specific, on the file "catalina.policy". After that, the Tomcat server can be added in the Eclipse servers) (dead link) http://webui.sourcelabs.com/eclipse/issues/239179 and to have the tomcat5.5 stopped before entering eclipse and started afterwards. Tomcat 6 In order to be able to use the tomcat6 server the proper solution is to have a user instance of the tomcat6 server as described in /usr/share/doc/tomcat6-common/RUNNING.txt.gz RUNNING.txt (on the WEB) My configuration is Debian/Sid, Eclipse 3.4.1.
