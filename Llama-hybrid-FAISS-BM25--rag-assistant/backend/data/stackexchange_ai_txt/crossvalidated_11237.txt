one more piece of advice: make sure the full 6-item composite scale is reliable & that none of the included items reduces scale reliability. If those conditions aren't satisfied, you shouldn't be averaging them even in cases where data are complete. If these conditions are satisfied, then using a subset of items for cases w/ missing data isn't going to bias your result (assuming you are averaging or adding z-score transformation of items, as you always should in forming aggregate likert scale); it is just going to make it noisier than it should be (b/c you are relying on fewer items & thus cancelling out less of the random measurement error associated with each individual item). (Best solution, though, is multiple imputation, again assuming composite scale is reliable.)
