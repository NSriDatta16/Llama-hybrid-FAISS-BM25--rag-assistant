SDCC doesn't support assignment and returning structs yet (if their Wiki is up-to-date): Not yet implemented in sdcc: Data type double. Structures and unions can not be assigned, passed as function parameters or return values. register storage class specifier in function parameters. Maybe you should make a void GetName(MyStruct* ret_name, int i); function instead. That said, you should put the function prototype before the main and after the MyStruct . If there's no prototypes a function will be assumed to return int . MyStruct GetName(int i); void main(void) { ... (Also, the main function should be an int main(void) or int main(int argc, char** argv) . It shouldn't return void .)
