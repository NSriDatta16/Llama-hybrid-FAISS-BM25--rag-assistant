The old app still works OK, other than the fact that no one at the company can maintain it. You have your argument right there. If there's no one able to maintain the application then if there's a problem you are completely stuck. It won't be a case of the application being down for a couple of hours, it will be down forever - or at least until you hire someone who can fix it or do the re-write. Finding and hiring someone at short notice is likely to cost more than the average. And a re-write under pressure isn't going to be a good re-write either which will end up costing more in continued maintenance. Try to convert these into numbers, you know your local contractor rates for example, and present those to management.
