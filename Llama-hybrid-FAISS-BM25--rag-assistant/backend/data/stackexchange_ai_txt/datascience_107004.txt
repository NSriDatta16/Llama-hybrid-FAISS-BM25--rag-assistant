Advice / Good practises | CNN poor image diversity

I am currenty working on a project that involves multiple cameras fixed on the ceiling. Each time I take a picture, I check whether there is a "cart" right under the camera. I would like to use a Convolutional Neural Network (binary) in order to determine if the image contains a cart or not. Now, what I am wondering is, since all the carts look exactly the same from the camera's top-down view and that all the images also look pretty much exactly the same (some lighting and slight angle differences but that's it.) Will this poor image diversity give me any problems ? (such as overfitting) ? If so, what could I do to prevent it ? And.. Do I even want to prevent overfitting in this case ? Since even the real data is going to be pretty much the same.
