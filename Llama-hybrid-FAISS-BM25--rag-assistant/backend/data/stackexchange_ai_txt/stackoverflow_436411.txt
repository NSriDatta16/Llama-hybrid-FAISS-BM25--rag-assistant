Where should I put tags in HTML markup?

When embedding JavaScript in an HTML document, where is the proper place to put the tags and included JavaScript? I seem to recall that you are not supposed to place these in the section, but placing at the beginning of the section is bad, too, since the JavaScript will have to be parsed before the page is rendered completely (or something like that). This seems to leave the end of the section as a logical place for tags. So, where is the right place to put the tags? (This question references this question , in which it was suggested that JavaScript function calls should be moved from tags to tags. I'm specifically using jQuery, but more general answers are also appropriate.)
