Large samples property of bayes procedures

I was reading through Wasserman's All of Statistics and I came across this property in the Bayesian statistics chapter: I think I don't really get what is supposed to be the intuition behind it, and the "appropriate regularity conditions" even less so. I would get it if a connexion between the MAP and the MLE existed because the posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood times the prior, but why is the posterior approximately normal with the MLE as its mean most of the time?
