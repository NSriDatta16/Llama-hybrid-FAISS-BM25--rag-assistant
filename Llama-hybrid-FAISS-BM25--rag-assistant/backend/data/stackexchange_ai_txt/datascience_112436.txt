I have had great success with Haystack . Haystack provides state-of-the-art T5 models with many features such as Retriever, Reader, Generator, preprocessing, etc to simplify many NLP processes. Moreover, they also have the option of using pipelines which in turn use DAG (directed Acyclic Graphs) that determine how to route the output of one component into the input of another. Their tutorials are really good. Check out them! Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with Haystack, just a dude using their OSS.
