As documented in the element in the documentation's Appendix B , you can set the errorPage attribute to forward to a custom JSP. This could be your login page or whatever else you want. Keep in mind that at this point, the user is already logged in, so forwarding them to the login page (again) may be confusing. As Raghuram suggested, you can also implement AccessDeniedHandler yourself, but I'd hold off on doing that unless you really need to.
