.NET Neural Network or AI for Future Predictions

I am looking for some kind of intelligent (I was thinking AI or Neural network) library that I can feed a list of historical data and this will predict the next sequence of outputs. As an example I would like to feed the library the following figures 1,2,3,4,5 and based on this, it should predict the next sequence is 6,7,8,9,10 etc. The inputs will be a lot more complex and contain much more information. This will be used in a C# application. If you have any recommendations or warning that will be great. Thanks EDIT What I am trying to do i using historical sales data, predict what amount a specific client is most likely going to spend in the next period. I do understand that there are dozens of external factors that can influence a clients purchases but for now I need to merely base it on the sales history and then plot a graph showing past sales and predicted sales.
