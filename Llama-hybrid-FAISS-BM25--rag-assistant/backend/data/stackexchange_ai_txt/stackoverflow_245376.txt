If you want to see just how easy it is to look at the code in a silverlight app just run SilverlightSpy link text by FirstFloor . As long as your have .NET Reflector installed you will be able to see (as you interact with the app) all the source code including the xaml files. Since the code does get downloaded to the client (and even trying to prevent it with pragma no-cache won't work since they can hit the URL) you will need to protect your code by keeping important logic on the server.
