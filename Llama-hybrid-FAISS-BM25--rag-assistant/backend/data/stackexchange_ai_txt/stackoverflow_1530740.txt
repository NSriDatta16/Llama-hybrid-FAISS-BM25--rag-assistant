I am happy to have the understanding team and management. So when something cannot be done or can only be done badly with consequences, I just bluntly tell it. Important is to tell as soon as possible, not a day before the deadline. It also helps if other team members support your position and can express their opinions to confirm your point of view. When you're putting it forward, bring arguments, provide explanation, talk about consequences. Something like "If we do it the code will look ugly" will not cut it. Saying it like "Doing this will require reorganization of the module Y which will need M weeks time to accomplish and N weeks time to retest it otherwise there will be numerous errors and the potential for customer data corruption" will be more convincing.
