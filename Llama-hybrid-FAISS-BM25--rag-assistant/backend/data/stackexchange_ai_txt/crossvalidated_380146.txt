What kind of analysis?

I'm doing a research about perceptions on terrorism. I will be having 6 different stories (each story with different ethnicity and group affiliation) that I will be randomly giving to participants about the arrest of someone committing violence, and the participants will be deciding if they want to label the violence as "terrorism" or "mass shooting". So, terrorism and mass shooting will be the dependant variables and the independent variables will be the difference between the groups (ethnicities, group affiliation and control group). Does logistic regression sound like a fitting analysis to use?
