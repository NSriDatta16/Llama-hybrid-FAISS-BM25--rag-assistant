When you use header() in PHP with Location, it doesn't send any headers straight to where you set the Location. Instead, it sends headers back to the browser (the "Response" headers), then the browser makes another request to the indicated Location with a new set of "Request" headers. Only the user agent has control over the Request headers. This means you'll have to make the request from the client perspective-- either with JavaScript, or more appropriately in this case, cURL (allows PHP to make additional HTTP requests from within a script). EDIT: To spoof a referer with cURL, you would create a cURL resource then use this before executing the request: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_REFERER, 'fakereferer.org');
