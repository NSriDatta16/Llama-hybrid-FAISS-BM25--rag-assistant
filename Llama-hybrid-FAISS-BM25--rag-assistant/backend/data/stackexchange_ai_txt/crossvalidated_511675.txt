Let me try to answer this without giving any equations. Q) What is the purpose of a neural network having a non-linear activation function? It is not necessary to add non-linear activation function to a neural net if the situation being modelled is linear. However in reality, complicated relationships cannot be represented by a straight line. Most real-world problems are non-linear. In order to help the model converge upon the solution for such cases, we need to bring in an element of non-linearity. One of the ways this can be done is to add functions/layers that are non-linear. Now the model has more power to find solutions Q) Is it correct to say that the non-linear activation function's main purpose is to allow the neural network's decision boundary to be non-linear? Yes that is the only purpose as explained above. The decision boundary now need not be a simple straight line but can be a circle or any other complicated shape. Now that you have provided the model with great deal of flexibility to 'fit' solutions, you should be careful and take precautions against overfitting
