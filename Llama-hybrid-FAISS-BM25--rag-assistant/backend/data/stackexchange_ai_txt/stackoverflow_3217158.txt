This sounds like something you may want to use a message queue for. .Net provides a number of classes in the System.Messaging namespace , including MessageQueue that meake it easy to interact with message queues (which are available as part of the OS). You can also use WCF to program against messages queues and dynamically retrieve and dispatch messages based on their content. Message queues support transactions, guaranteed delivery, and storage of arbitrarily large objects. However, they are not intended as a repository - so if you need to persist or retrain the data of messages, or index or search against them after they have been processed, they may not be the right solution for you.
