bayesian curve fitting

On Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book, equation 1.68 says $p(t|x,X,T) = \int p(t|x,w) p(w|X,T) dw$ Here t is the target value, (X,T) is training dataset. I do now understand how the RHS came from LHS. Intuitively it makes sense. My confusion is from $p(t|x,X,T) = \int p(t|x,w,X,T) dw$, should not RHS be $\int p(t|x,w) p(w)$? I know $w$ is dependent on $X$ and $T$, we have to estimate $w$ from training data. But how it came mathematically?
