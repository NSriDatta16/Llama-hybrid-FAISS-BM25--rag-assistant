If your external regressors are causal for $y$, but not the other way around and do not cause each other, then ARIMA is definitely appropriate. VAR makes sense if your different time series all depend on each other. For auto.arima() to work with external regressors, collect your regressors into a matrix X , which you feed into the xreg parameter of auto.arima() . (Of course, X must have the same number of rows as the time series y you are modeling.) For forecasting, you will need the future values of your regressors, which you then again feed into the xreg parameter of forecast . The help pages are ?auto.arima and ?forecast.Arima (note the capital A - this is not a typo. Don't ask me...).
