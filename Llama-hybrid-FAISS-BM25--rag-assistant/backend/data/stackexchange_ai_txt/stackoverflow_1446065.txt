What language can a junior programmer implement an interpreter for it?

My college is going to start soon, but I want to do something in the remaining weeks :) I've taken a course last semester about programming languages and I want to bring my knowledge into reality. What simple , elegant language can a junior programmer implement an interpreter for? I don't mind if the language is very small or experimental.
