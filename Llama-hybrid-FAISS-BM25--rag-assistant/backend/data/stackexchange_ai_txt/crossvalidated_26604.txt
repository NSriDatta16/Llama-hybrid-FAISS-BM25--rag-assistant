You could create tables where the y1 is shifted by 0,1,2,3,4 weeks. Then you run an analysis on them. For instance, you could make a neural network that tries to predict y1 from x. For some ideas, you can give Weka a spin. Then, you have some measure of predicting y1 from x for each lag. Using this, you can find the lag that fits best. Alternatively, you can create one table that includes x from the current week, x from the previous week, ... and y1. Then do a analysis of influence (e.g. PCA ) to see which week and which variable has the most influence.
