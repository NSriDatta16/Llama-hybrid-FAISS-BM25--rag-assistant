JQuery UI's droppable() lets you define a function to run whenever an acceptable draggable() is dropped onto that droppable(). The demo on this page was what helped me understand how to code it. Look at their code by clicking "View Source." Especially this part: $gallery.droppable({ accept: '#trash li', activeClass: 'custom-state-active', drop: function(ev, ui) { recycleImage(ui.draggable); } }); You should be able to create a drop function to clone the row you want, for example, but not delete it from its original location.
