You are using ThisIs_Sheet1_Test as a variable to hold a value (even though you don't explicitly declare the variable). You can't just assemble a string with the same name and expect it to somehow know what you want (to get the value held in the variable). I'm assuming you are trying to do this because each sheet might have different values to track. In that case, here are a few options: Explicitly declare a public string array, with enough values for each of your sheets. Then you can track each of your values using the index number of the worksheet you are on. Instead of using a variable, pick a hidden spreadsheet cell to hold the value, then you can just use Sheets("Sheet1").Range("Z100").Value or something similar. This is a bit "hacky", and also fragile (because the user can overwrite the cell if it isn't locked or hidden), but might work the best without a bunch of other code. Use "custom properties" of the worksheet. This would look something like: Dim mySheet As Worksheet Set mySheet = ActiveSheet 'mySheet.CustomProperties.Item(1).Delete mySheet.CustomProperties.Add "ListboxValues", "one,two,three" MsgBox mySheet.CustomProperties.Item(1).Name & " = " & _ mySheet.CustomProperties.Item(1).Value If you only use a single custom property like my example, they are pretty easy to use. Once you have more than one, then you have to loop through to find the custom property with the correct name, and use that.
