The version of Indy 10 that shipped with D2010 is NOT the latest Indy 10 revision that is available. The Indy code you have quoted as being broken does not exist in the current version anymore. TIdTrivialFTP was re-written awhile back ago to fix a lot of issues (I forgot to check it in at the time, though. I have done so now). Please download the latest Indy 10 snapshot from Indy's SVN server or Fulgan mirror (you will have to wait a day for it to catch up). Download links are available on Indy's website.
