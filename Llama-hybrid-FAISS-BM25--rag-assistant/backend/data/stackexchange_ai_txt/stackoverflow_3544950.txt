One part of the solution is to capture the version of each of your code modules and their corresponding data resources in a single location, and compare them to ensure consistency. For example, an increment in the version number of your, say, customer_comments module will require a corresponding SQL delta file to upgrade the relevant DB tables to the equal version number for the data. For an example, have a look at Magento's core_resource approach as documented by @AlanStorm. Cheers, JD
