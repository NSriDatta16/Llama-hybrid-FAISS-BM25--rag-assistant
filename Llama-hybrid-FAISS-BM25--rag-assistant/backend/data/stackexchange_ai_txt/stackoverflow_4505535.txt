Have you just tried using curl? You can get back the headers and also the content, if desired. $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 10); $useragent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/ 2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5"; curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $useragent); $output = curl_exec($ch); $info = curl_getinfo($ch); This will chase redirects, which isn't always desired. Look at http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-getinfo.php to see what you get back in $info . You can try just doing a HEAD request instead of a GET (the CURLOPT_NOBODY option), but I have run into problems with some servers that deny HEADs for some reason.
