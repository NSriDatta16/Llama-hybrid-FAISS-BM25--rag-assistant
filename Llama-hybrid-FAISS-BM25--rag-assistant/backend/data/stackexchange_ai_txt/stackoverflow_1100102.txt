If the Emulation tag isn't working, there's a very good chance that the page is sending back different data based on the User-Agent string. The user-agent string sends "7.0" when a site is in the compatibility list, but sends "8.0" when the site uses the META tag (because the request has already been sent by the time the server asks for IE7 mode). You can use Fiddler (www.fiddler2.com) to troubleshoot this, or try the User-Agent picker addon ( http://www.enhanceie.com/ietoys/uapick.asp )
