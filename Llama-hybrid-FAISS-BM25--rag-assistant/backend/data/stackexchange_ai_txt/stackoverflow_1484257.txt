Trouble with Pan by dragging in Silverlight

Possible Duplicate: Grab-to-pan in Silverlight app I have a Canvas inside a ScrollViewer; the Canvas will have several objects drawn on it. I would like to be able to Pan -- scroll -- the Canvas using the mouse: LButtonDown - move mouse - LButtonUp. In the .xaml, I have a TranslateTransform for the Canvas. Code: private void MapCanvas_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { ClickPosition = e.GetPosition(MapCanvas); Debug.WriteLine("LButtonDown: " + ClickPosition.ToString()); MapCanvas.CaptureMouse(); IsMouseCaptured = true; e.Handled = true; } private void MapCanvas_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (IsMouseCaptured) { Point point = new Point(e.GetPosition(MapCanvas)); Debug.WriteLine("\t" + point.ToString()); MapPanTransform.X = point.X - ClickPosition.X; MapPanTransform.Y = point.Y - ClickPosition.Y; } } This results in some strange points appearing in MapCanvas_MouseMove: LButtonDown 557,469 556,469 368,472 555,469 367,472 554,469 365,472 553,469 Any ideas on what's going on? Thanks.
