My solution to this is to not use the Preview handlers, instead I use MouseDown, MouseMove and MouseUp. The sequence of events is: * MouseDown (set up for possible drag) * SelectionChanged (remember any selection change) * MouseMove (here we might go into a drag operation) * MouseUp (if we went into a drag operation, all done, otherwise process the multiple selection stuff)
