Elegantly handle site-specific settings/configuration in svn/hg/git/etc?

I've been looking for a better way to deal with site-specific settings (in this case, the django settings.py file). The settings.py structure and fields are fairly consistent, but the values differ between the developer's boxes, the integration, QA, testing, and production environments. What's an elegant way to have the settings source controlled while still allowing changes between different boxes? I'm also concerned about having sensitive data (eg. database passwords) in source control, but I do want automated deployments. Examples of what we've used: settings.py sets the common values then loads a secondary settings file based on the hostname or the username . injecting values into the settings.py file using a deployment script. But this simply shifts the problem to managing the deployment scripts instead of the settings.py script. Anyone have a particularly elegant approach?
