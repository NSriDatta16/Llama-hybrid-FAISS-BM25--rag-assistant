For swipe-to-delete functionality, you have to implement -(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete) ; // Delete. } EDIT: I didn't read the question well enough. I have noticed that to do a swipe drag in the simulator I have to press and pause for a second while it selects the cell, and only then can I swipe right successfully.
