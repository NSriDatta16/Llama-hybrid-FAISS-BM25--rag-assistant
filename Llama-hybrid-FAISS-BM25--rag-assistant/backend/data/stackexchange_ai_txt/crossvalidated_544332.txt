The difference is that with full posterior you estimate the distribution of the parameters. With MAP you find only the mode of the distribution. You cannot really compare them, it’s like asking how all the people’s age differs from the average age of the whole population. It obviously does. Another difference is practical, you use different algorithms for both cases, so it can happen that if you estimate the full posterior and than estimate it’s mode it would differ from the results of an optimization algorithm that only looked for the mode. This is especially the case since in most cases for full posterior you would either draw MCMC samples from it and approximate the mode using the mode from the samples, or use other way of approximating the posterior and find the mode of the approximation.
