Logistic Regression + Adaboost?

In Adaboost, each sample is given a weight and the machine learning model will be trained with these weights. I want to use logistic regression model in Adaboost, but how can i use these weights in logistic regression? I mean the classic logistic regression model do not use the weight of sample, how can I change the model to make the weight useful? Any help would be appreciated!
