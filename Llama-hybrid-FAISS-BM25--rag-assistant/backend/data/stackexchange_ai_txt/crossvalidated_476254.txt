Consider the bayesian network: X -> Y -> Z $X$ is out of the Markov blanket of $Z$ (which is $\{Y,Z\}$ ), yet $Z$ (unconditionally) depends on $X$ . On the other hand, d-separation is what you are looking for. From Pearl's Causality book , you can read: d-separation is a criterion for deciding, from a given a causal graph, whether a set X of variables is independent of another set Y, given a third set Z. You can use an empty conditionning set to check whether two variables are (unconditionally) independent. The Bayes-Ball algorithm is a practical algorithm based on this criterion for deciding whether or not two variables are independent.
