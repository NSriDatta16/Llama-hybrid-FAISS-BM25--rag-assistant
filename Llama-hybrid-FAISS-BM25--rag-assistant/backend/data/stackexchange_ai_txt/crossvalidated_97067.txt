There are many clustering algorithms and manifold learning techniques. Realistically the sensible thing to do with most datasets is to run PCA on it because it is likely that your features have some linearities and share some signal, so running PCA to remove that sort of feature is probably sensible. After that, you can easily try mutliple techniques to determine what is best for your data. You should also read about the No Free Lunch Theorum which basically states that it is impossible to determine the optimal technique for your situation without actually trying something.
