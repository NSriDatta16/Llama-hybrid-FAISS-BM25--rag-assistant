What are the benefits of changing the temperature parameter in the chatgpt api?

(Cross-posted from: https://ai.stackexchange.com/q/39813/57463 after a week of no satisfactory answer) TLDR : What are the benefits of increasing the temperature in the chatGPT API ? Context (can be skipped) I believe that it is recommended to have a tiny bit of temperature with GPT 3 even for noncreative tasks like 0.2 or something (I am not entirely sure why). Last I checked, and if I remember correctly, the examples from openai on their GitHub page use 0 temperature. Is there any benefit in choosing a non-zero temperature for the chatgpt API when the query does not request a creative task? If so, are there some categories or examples?
