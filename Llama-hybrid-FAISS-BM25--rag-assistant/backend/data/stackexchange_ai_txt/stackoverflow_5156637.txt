Well, yes, profile, but don't use just any old profiler. You need to look at lines of code that are on the stack a good percent of the time, because that is how much you could potentially save by optimizing them. To find them, you should use a profiler that takes wall-clock-time stack samples (during I/O as well as CPU time), when you want them (when it's being slow, not all the time), and reports by line of code (not just by function/method) the percent of samples containing that line (not count, not self time, not average time - percent ). A good one is Zoom . Another very simple method is random-pausing .
