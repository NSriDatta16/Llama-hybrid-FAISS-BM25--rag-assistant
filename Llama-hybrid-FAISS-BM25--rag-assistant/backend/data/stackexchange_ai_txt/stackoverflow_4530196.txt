This kind of thing is often required for e-commerce applications where the bank/whatever doesn't allow linked CSS, e.g. WorldPay. The big challenge isn't so much the conversion as the lack of inheritance. You have to explicitly set inherited properties on all descendant tags. Testing is vital as certain browsers will cause more grief than others. You will need to add a lot more inline code than you need for a linked stylesheet, for example in a linked stylesheet all you need is p { color:red } , but inline you have to explicitly set the color on all paragraphs. From my experience, it's very much a manual process that requires a light touch and a lot of tweaking and cross-browser testing to get right.
