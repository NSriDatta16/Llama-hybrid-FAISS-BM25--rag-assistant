You should keep the data as counts, and not reduce it to percentages. Then it have the format of a contingency table (specifically, a 2 times 9 table: 2 genders and 9 floors). Then you can use a chisquared test of independence. As pointed out by user @gung in a comment, you can also use logistic regression, which in its most basic form corresponds closely to the chisquared test, but admits for extensions (like using the floor number as a predictor). For the relationship between logistic regression and the chisquared test, see for instance Logistic regression vs chi-square in a 2x2 and Ix2 (single factor - binary response) contingency tables? and chi square test vs logistic regression result
