Random variables with known ratios

I have $n$ samples with $m$ random variables in each: $\{x_{i\alpha}|i=1..n, \alpha=1..m\}$ . The variables are expected to obey known ratios (they are fractions of an unknown quantity), e.g. $x_{\alpha}/x_\beta = f_\alpha/f_\beta$ , where $f_\alpha$ are known constants. Due to noise some of the variables are way off: I would like to discard them and replace by the numbers based on the measurements that I deem reliable. For now I apply ANOVA and t-tests to $x_\alpha/f_\alpha$ , treating measurements for each $\alpha$ as a group. What kind of test could I use when $n$ is small (there might be situations where $n=1$ , however $m\geq 3$ always)? What is the smoother procedure for penalizing the outliers? (I am interested in some weighting scheme rather than simply throwing them away.) I am mainly interested in well studied/standard/canonical procedures (my background is in a quantitative field other than statistics). Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches are of interest.
