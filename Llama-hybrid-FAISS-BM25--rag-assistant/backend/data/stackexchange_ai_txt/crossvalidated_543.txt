In addition to what has already been said above about summated scales, I'd also mention that the issue can change when analysing data at the group-level. For example, if you were examining life satisfaction of states or countries, job satisfaction of organisations or departments, student satisfaction in subjects. In all these cases each aggregate measure (perhaps the mean) is based on many individual responses (e.g., n=50, 100, 1000, etc.). In these cases the original Likert item begins to take on properties that resemble an interval scale at the aggregate level.
