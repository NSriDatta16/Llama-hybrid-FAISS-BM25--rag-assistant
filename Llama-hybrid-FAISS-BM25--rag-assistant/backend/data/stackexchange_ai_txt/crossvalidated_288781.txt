Instead of a correlation you could use a chi-square or likelihood ratio statistic (testing the hypothesis that the distribution of the concept, stratified according to driver $x_i$, after correcting for drivers $x_j$, $x_k$..., is different or the same). Then you can calculate this statistic for each driver based on the average over all permutations, and it will express the degree in which the variable explains a variation in the distribution of the outcome variable. You can use this averaged value to make your ordering. If you want to express the significance (and don't care about elegance) then you can use a Monte Carlo approach to compare each driver against a large collection of random drivers. This answer might become less general if some numerical example and more specific background is given.
