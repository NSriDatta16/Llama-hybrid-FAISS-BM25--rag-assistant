Easiest way to temporarily store key-value pairs in a form using JQuery

How can I temporarily store an array of string values most elegantly in a form? I have a form, where a user can edit an article - and add tags, which are simply string values. I don't want to persist it until the user actually saves the entire article, so I need to be able to temporarily ...: Display the list of selected tags Add a tag to the list Remove a tag from the list Submit the list of values when I save the form I could store everything in just a comma-separated hidden field, but it seems ugly, and I would prefer something stronger typed. What is the right way to do this? Pointers to examples very welcome.
