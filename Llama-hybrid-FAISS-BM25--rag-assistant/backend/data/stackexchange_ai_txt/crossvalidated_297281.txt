The answer is DOWN based upon the equation I don't write r code .... EDITED AFTER OP'S COMMENT: When dealing with a single time series there are a number of possible features/elements/items of a useful model. AUTOBOX a piece of software that I have helped to develop pursues a broad strategy of item selection. First and primary is should memory be used OR should dummy predictors ( level shifts , time trends , seasonal pulses , other time-oriented fixed effects )be used OR should thee be some combination. Secondly are their any anomalies/pulses that need to be treated/adjusted ? Thirdly is there evidence of non-constant error variance and if so should we transform the data OR use weighted least squares to render the model error variance to be homogeneous ALL while validating the assumption that parameters have not varied over time. Upon running heuristics/model diagnostics in an Exploratory Data Manner , the program iteratively assesses significance by optimizing the sequence of approaches culminating in a possible useful model. The model can be "understood" by examining the ultimate design matrix which was ferreted out by the diagnostics. Here it is . . The model suggests two time trends 1-18 and 19-38 both clearly visually visually supportable. The model suggests a level shift i.e. an intercept change at or about period 26 The model suggests an unusual value/pulse at period 16 The model suggests less randomness in the residuals at or about period 17 The freely available parametric software in R does not pursue sufficient global strategies i.e. testing for possible non-gaussian violations and providing remedies often ( nearly always in my biased opinion !) mis-analyzes data. 1 Corinthians 13:11 has words to this effect. If you search in my previous postings on se you will get further examples of results like this. The human eye is often a great modelling tool and the question is can software proxy the clear eye in identifying meaningful structure. In this case I would have to say a definite yes. Ad hoc approaches as suggested by others in an attempt to do feature engineering is time-wasting and largely unproductive. This is not to say that holiday effects and other calendar effects should not be used . They should ! See my most recent post for an example of that ARIMA model has trouble forecasting next month . Other posts illuminate how holiday effects can be automatically formed and you might also look at http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/53-capabilities-presentation .. slide 49-68 .
