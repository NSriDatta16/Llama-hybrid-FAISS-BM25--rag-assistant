I think the psuedocode below would do it.. DELETE FirstTable, SecondTable FROM FirstTable FULL OUTER JOIN SecondTable ON FirstTable.Field1 = SecondTable.Field1 ... continue for all fields WHERE FirstTable.Field1 IS NOT NULL AND SecondTable.Field1 IS NOT NULL Chris's INTERSECT post is far more elegant though and I'll use that in future instead of writing out all of the outer join criteria :)
