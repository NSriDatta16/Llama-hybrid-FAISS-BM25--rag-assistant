OLS vs Random Effect

I am running my regression on Stata. Because I am observing 9 countries over 4 years, I am using panel data. Following the suggested steps from the literature, I have first run an OLS model with countries and year dummies and got an R-squared of 0.8149. Subsequently, I run GLS Random-effect (RE) with month dummies and i(country), overall R-squared 0.7409. If I include country variables in the latter my r-squared becomes 0.8355. After performing the Breusch-Pagan test (xttest0), the results confirm in both cases to pursue RE. My questions are: Do I need to include month and country variables in RE? If the R-squared for OLS is > than the RE one but xttest0 still support the RE, which one should I pursue? Thank you.
