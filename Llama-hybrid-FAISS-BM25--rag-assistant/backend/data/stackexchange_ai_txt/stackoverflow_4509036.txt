Try to make use of JavaScript events . You can register any function to be called when a certain event occurs. Either utilise some of the predefined events to signal the completion of your code or use something like some Yahoo! library to create custom events which could represent the completion of the server request (found the last one with a short Google search, but looks promising). I expected JS to have a built-in custom event architecture but obviously it has not. Thus you need to use external libraries like this Yahoo! thing. Maybe this changes in the near future. This is above my knowledge. But I can surely recommend using events because they solve exactly the problem you described. (Alternatively you can do busy wait like Thariama described. Either with sleep cycles or not busy waiting in general is discouraged where possible.) Illustration: // register function b() for custom event function a() { //upload // (takes time... but no busy wait) //fire custom event } function b() { //do some other code }
