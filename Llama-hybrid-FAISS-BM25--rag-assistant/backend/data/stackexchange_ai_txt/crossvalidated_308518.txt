This is simplistic, but I always start there... Suppose you have 100 friends and 5 posts. And suppose each post gets 20 comments. At one extreme, 20 of the same people all commented on each post. At the other extreme, 20 different people commented on each post. In the first case the average number of comments per post for those 20 people was 1.0, and the same metric was zero for the other eighty. In the second case, everyone made .2 comments per post all 100). My thought is to tunnel in from the count of the number of people who commented divided by the number of posts. Some people will score 1.0 (they comment on every post), and some will score lower (they only comment once or none). If plotted from highest score to lowest, you will get something akin to a 'scree' plot. Wouldn't that possibly get you pretty far?
