How to fix page so it displays correctly in IE7?

A reader has just brought to my attention that IE7 on Windows XP Professional, ver 2002, SP 2 displays pages such as http://beachpaper.com/issues/current/page28.html to look like beachpaper.com/zimgnav/bperror.jpg, by pushing the large JPG to the right. However, the home page, beachpaper.com, displays correctly for him and it's built from the same template. I built it using GoLive on a Mac and it looks fine in that outdated IE and all other browsers I've ever tried, so I'm at a loss at what to do. I ran it through the W3C validator and didn't see any likely suspects. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
