haven't used twisted before, and the twisted/trial documentation isn't stellar from what I just saw, but it'll likely take you 2-3 days to implement correctly the test system you describe above. Now, like I said I have no idea about Trial, but I GUESS you could probably get it working in 1-2 days, since you already have a Twisted application. Now if Trial gives you more coverage in less time, I'd go with Trial. But remember this is just an answer from a very cursory look at the docs
