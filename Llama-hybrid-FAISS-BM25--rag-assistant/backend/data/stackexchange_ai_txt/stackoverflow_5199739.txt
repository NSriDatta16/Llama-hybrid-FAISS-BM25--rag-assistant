equals() and hashCode() contract in Java

The SCJP 6 Study Guide from Bert Bates and Kathy Sierra states on page 554 (among other requirements) that x.hashCode() != y.hashCode() requires that x.equals(y) == false . But the Javadoc for Object doesn't mention such requirement explicitly. Quote: If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. Should I take what Javadoc says as a material implication, such as eq -> hc ? Then there would be no conflict between these two sources.
