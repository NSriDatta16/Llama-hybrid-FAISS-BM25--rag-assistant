If I were you, I'd use your system to take three pictures by hand right now so you can check your assumptions before going much further. My guess is that you will need a slight translation even if you don't intend any movement. Vibration of equipment, wind and even heat expansion might be enough to throw you off by a pixel or two which would ruin a straight pixel-to-pixle compression. Other factors could be light change due to a cloud passing across the sun or heat magnification wafting off the ground or even jpeg compression artifacts. I'm not saying it's not going to work, just that I'd run one by hand first. Storage is so cheap, you are going to get much more bang for the buck by adding a larger sim card (or whatever) to your camera.
