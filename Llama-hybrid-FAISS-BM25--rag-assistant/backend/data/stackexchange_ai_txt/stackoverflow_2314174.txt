Common adjectives in front of quicksort are deterministic and randomized. Deterministic means that the quicksort will always sort the same set of data in the same fashion while a randomized quicksort uses randomization and will rarely sort the same data in the same exact fashion (unless the data set is very small - then it is more common). Deterministic It comes down to how the pivots are chosen. In a deterministic quicksort, the pivots are chosen by either always choosing the pivot at the same relative index such as the first, last, or middle element or by using the median of any number of predetermined element choices. For instance, a common method is to choose the median of first, last, and middle elements as the pivot. Even with the median-of-3 method I just described, certain datasets can easily give O(N^2) time complexity. An example dataset is the so-called organ pipes set of data: array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] Randomized Randomizated quicksorts can choose just a random pivot or use the median of some number of randomly chosen pivots. There is still the possibility of O(N^2) time complexity, but the probability is much, much smaller and becomes smaller with increasing dataset size.
