From reading your question, it seems you are currently investigating a lot of tools to get a e-learning site up and running. Seems like you are also spending time getting stuff ready on a machine. Keeping this in mind I would recommend you check out Google App Engine . You can use Java or Python. In my opinion it will help you concentrate on your solution rather then spending your time setting up stuff so you can actually start programming. And guess what else, it is FREE. :) As far as storage, I would recommend a database. Check this stackoverflow question for uses cases for NOSQL.
