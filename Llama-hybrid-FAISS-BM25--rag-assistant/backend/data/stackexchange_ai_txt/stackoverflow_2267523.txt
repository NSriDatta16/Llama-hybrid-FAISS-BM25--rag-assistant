I want to embed Facebook in an IFrame one way or another

Does anyone know of a solution for this that i may be able to purchase? Ok Well facebook no longer allows you to embed into an IFrame and my company wants to have facebook show up on our application which we do by creating a Iframe and embedding. But on Feb 5th facebook took away that ability. So I am looking for someone who has worked around this sollution but no matter what the sollution has to embed within an IFrame...
