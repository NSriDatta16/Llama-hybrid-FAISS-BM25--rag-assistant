Well, the other answer gives an example, when the log-transform is used to reduce the influence of extreme values or outliers. Another general argument occurs, when you try to analyze data which are multiplicatively composed instead of addititively - PCA and FA model by their math such additive compositions. Multiplicative compositions occur in the most simple case in physical data like the surface and the volume of bodies (functionally) dependent on (for instance) the three parameters lenght, width, depth. One can reproduce the compositions of an historic example of the early PCA, I think it is called "Thurstone's Ball- (or 'Cubes'-) problem" or the like. Once I had played with the data of that example and had found that the log-transformed data gave a much nicer and clearer model for the composition of the measured volume and surface data with the three one-dimensional measures. Besides of such simple examples, if we consider in social research data interactions , then we ususally think them as well as multiplicatively composed measurements of more elementary items. So if we look specifically at interactions, a log-transform might be a special helpful tool to get a mathematical model for the de-composition.
