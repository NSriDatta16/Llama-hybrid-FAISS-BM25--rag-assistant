What is the long run variance?

How is long run variance in the realm of time series analysis defined? I understand it is utilized in the case there is a correlation structure in the data. So our stochastic process would not be a family of $X_1, X_2 \dots$ i.i.d. random variables but rather only identically distributed? Could I have a standard reference as an introduction to the concept and the difficulties involved in its estimation?
