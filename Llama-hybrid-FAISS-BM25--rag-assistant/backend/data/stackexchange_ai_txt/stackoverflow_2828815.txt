To paginate in CakePHP you need to pass select conditions to the paginate() call. Other data manipulation should be done in afterFind(), in your model file. If you don't need these changes to be done in every single retrieval, you might as well consider creating a new model file pointing to the very same table as the current one, and adding an afterFind() method to that new file.
