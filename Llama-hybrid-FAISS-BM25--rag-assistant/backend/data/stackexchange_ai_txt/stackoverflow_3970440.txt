Neural Networks: Minimal, open source example with exhaustive training data?

I am currently searching for a neural network (toy) example, that I might optimize using GPU kernels. I need clean & minimal code (no fancy optimizations, max. a few thousand sloc) ample testing data C/C++ open source Does anybody has an adequate hint? There's a bunch of examples on the net, but with insufficient testing data (there's no sense in GPU-optimizing code, that executes in a few seconds anyway)
