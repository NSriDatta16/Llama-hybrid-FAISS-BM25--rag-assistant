Adding to D.W.'s answer with an even more practical example (for L2 loss function as well): Imagine a small village made of 4 houses close to each other (e.g. 10 meters). At 1 kilometer from those, you have another very isolated house. Now, you arrive in that town and want to build your own house somewhere. You want to live close to the other houses and be friend with everybody. Consider those two alternative scenarios: You decide to be at the location where the average distance to any house is the smallest (i.e. minimizing a L1 loss function). If you put your house at the center of the village, you will be around 10 meters away from 4 houses and 1 kilometer away from one house, which gives you an average distance of about 200 meters (10+10+10+10+1000 / 5). If you place your house 500 meters away from the village, you will be around 500 meters away from 5 houses, which gives you an average distance of 500 meters. If you place your house next to the isolated house, you will be 1km away from the village (4 houses) and around 10 meters away from 1 house, which gives you an average distance of about 800 meters. So the lowest average distance of 100 meters is reached by building your house in the village. More specifically, you will build your house in the middle of these 4 houses to gain a few more meters of average distance. And it turns out that this point is the " median point ", that you would have obtained similarly using the median formula. You decide to take a democratic approach. You ask each of your five future neighbors their preferred location for your new house. They all like you and want you to live close to them. So they all state their preferred location to be the spot just next to their own house. You take the average of all the voted locations of your five neighbors, and the result is "200 meters away from the village" (average of the votes: 0+0+0+0+1000/5 = 200), which is the " mean point " of the 5 houses, that you would have obtained similarly using the mean formula. And this location turns out to be exactly the same that mimimizes the sum of squared distances (i.e. L2 loss function). Let's just do the math to see it: At this location, the sum of squared distances is: 200^2 + 200^2 + 200^2 + 200^2 + 800^2 = 800 000 If we build the house in the center of the village, our sum of squared distances would be: 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 1000^2 = 1 000 000 If we build build the house at 100 meters away from the village (like in 1), the sum of squared distances is: 100^2 + 100^2 + 100^2 + 100^2 + 900^2 = 850 000 If we build the house at 100 meters away from the isolated house, the sum of squared distances is: 900^2 + 900^2 + 900^2 + 900^2 + 100^2 = 3 250 000 So yes, it is interesting to notice that, a bit counter-intuitively, when we minimize the sum of the distances, we don't end up being in the "middle" in the sense of the mean, but in the sense of the median. This is part of the reason why OLS, one of the most popular regression models, uses squared errors rather than absolute errors.
