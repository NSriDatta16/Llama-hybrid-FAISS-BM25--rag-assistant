This paper offers one way to integrate the fractional integrated process where $d\in(-1/2,1/2)$ : Reisen, V. A. and Lopes, S. (1999) Some simulations and applications of forecasting long-memory time series models; Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 80, 269â€“287 You can find it here . The idea's that when you have ARFIMA(p,d,q) process like: $$\Phi(B)(1-B)^dX_t=\Theta(B)\varepsilon_t$$ with $B$ - backshift operator, you can represent it as infinite AR process: $$X_{t+k}=-\sum_{j=1}^\infty\pi_jX_{t+k-j}+\varepsilon_{t+l}$$ They have an equation for coefficients $\pi_j$ as a function of integration order. For instance, for a ARFIMA(0,d,0) you'd get: $$\pi_1=-\frac 1 {d+1}$$ then $$X_{t+1}=\frac 1 {d+1}X_{t} -\dots +\varepsilon_{t+l}$$ I wound't do it manually, and instead get a stat package that does it for me.
