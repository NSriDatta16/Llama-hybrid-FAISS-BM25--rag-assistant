TCP sockets do have the concept of sender port number but it doesn't have much use in application level protocols. That said, considering the last paragraph of the OP, I think you're looking for some way to call back the client. The ports I said previously cannot be used for that. Asynchronous requests are identical to synchronous ones running on a separate thread, nothing special about them.
