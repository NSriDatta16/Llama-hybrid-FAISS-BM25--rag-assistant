Python: Calculating the averages of values in a text file

When I run my code below I get a: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0.977759164126' but i dont know why file_open = open("A1_B1_1000.txt", "r") file_write = open ("average.txt", "w") line = file_open.readlines() list_of_lines = [] length = len(list_of_lines[0]) total = 0 for i in line: values = i.split('\t') list_of_lines.append(values) count = 0 for j in list_of_lines: count +=1 for k in range(0,count): print k list_of_lines[k].remove('\n') for o in range(0,count): for p in range(0,length): print list_of_lines[p][o] number = int(list_of_lines[p][o]) total + number average = total/count print average My text file looks like: 0.977759164126 0.977759164126 0.977759164126 0.977759164126 0.977759164126 0.981717034466 0.981717034466 0.981717034466 0.981717034466 0.98171703446 The data series is in rows and the values are tab delimited in the text file. All the rows in the file are the same length. The aim of the script is to calculate the average of each column and write the output to a text file.
