Is my Neural Network chain rule correct?

Suppose I have the following architecture Where $ HA_i$ and $OA_i$ are the activated values of the hidden and output nodes respectively, and $W_i$ are the weights between nodes. I want to find the derivative of the error $e$ w.r.t. $W_1$ . Then my chain rule is the following: $$ \frac{\partial e}{\partial W_1} = \left( \frac{\partial e}{\partial OA_1} \frac{\partial OA_1}{\partial O_1} \frac{\partial O_1}{\partial HA_1} \right) \frac{\partial HA_1}{\partial H_1} \frac{\partial H_1}{\partial W_1} + \left( \frac{\partial e}{\partial OA_2} \frac{\partial OA_2}{\partial O_2} \frac{\partial O_2}{\partial HA_1} \right) \frac{\partial HA_1}{\partial H_1} \frac{\partial H_1}{\partial W_1} $$ Is this correct?
