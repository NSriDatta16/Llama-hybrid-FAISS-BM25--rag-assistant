why implement and test mock repositories when I could use the real ones with mocked data? I guess it really comes down to how much code coverage you think you need to have. If you feel the repository is sound and you can use it for testing, go for it. Perhaps the repository unit tests can be run prior to the mock database unit tests, so that you can use the real repositories for testing and feel confident that the testing is still valid.
