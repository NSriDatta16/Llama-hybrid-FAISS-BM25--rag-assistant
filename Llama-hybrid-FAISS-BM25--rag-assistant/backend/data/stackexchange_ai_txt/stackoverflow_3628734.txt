Is 256MB Ram cloud server enough to run a simple web application in PHP?

I have written a simple web application mostly full of static web pages with several you-tube embeddings. Few forms and so on. All this is developed using CodeIgniter. The site is very similar to Academic Earth. With videos served from Youtube. It has got 400 users only 30-40 are active. I am not interested in shared hosting and want a machine with root access. My budget allows me to hire RackSpace cloud server with 256MB Ram. Is it sufficient to run my application? Or should this question go on ServerFault.
