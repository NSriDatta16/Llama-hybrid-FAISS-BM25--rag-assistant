Minimum PHP version for running Magento Web Service APIs

Can anybody please suggest how to know the minimum PHP version, for working of the Magento v1.4.x.x Web Services? EDIT:- My problem is that I am trying to run an API Web Service (having tried both V2 & normal SOAP) for downloading Store Lists. But nothing is returning, no error, no display nothing. I have also tried with run-time configurations (using in-built function " ini_set() "), but in vain:- soap.wsdl_cache_enabled = 0 soap.wsdl_cache_ttl = 0 display_errors = 1 Thanks in advance.
