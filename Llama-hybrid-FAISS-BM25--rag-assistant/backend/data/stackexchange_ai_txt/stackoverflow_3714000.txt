"Pyramidizing" an array/list (in Ruby, but general solutions could probably be implemented)

I'm not sure what the best word to use here. By "pyramidizing", I mean: [1,2,3,4].pyramidize # => [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4] ["a","b","c","d"].pyramidize # => ["a","a","a","a","b","b","b","c","c","d"] To represent visually, it could be thought of as: [ 1,1,1,1, 2,2,2, 3,3, 4 ] Is there a way to do this that maximizes elegance? A most ruby-like way? I came across the "need" to do this in a project of mine. After thinking about it, I gave up and decided to work around the problem in an ugly way. I was wondering if there was a pretty way to do this. So far, to do it directly, I've ended up making a separate array for each index and stretching out each array the appropriate length and combining them together. But I don't know how to do this so it looks pretty; my solution is pretty ugly. Added code golf tag because any solution in one line would probably make my day, but it doesn't have to be. It doesn't really matter if your solution makes the first index the "base" of the pyramid, or the last index, because I could just reverse the array before running it.
