I believe you are looking for ordered logistic regression (though it goes by other names depending on the field), which will allow you to regress your ordered DV onto your 3 IVs while maintaining the scales prescribed order. Similarly, you could try multinomial logistic regression, which does not presuppose a particular (e.g., the data imply a 2,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 order to the scale as opposed to 1-10). However, this will result in less power. See the links below for more information. https://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/Logit.pdf https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/
