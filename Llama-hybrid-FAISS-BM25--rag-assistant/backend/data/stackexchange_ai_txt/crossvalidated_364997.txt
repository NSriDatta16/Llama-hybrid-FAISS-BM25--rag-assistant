What is intuition behind high variance of Monte Carlo method?

I'm studying Reinforcement learning from lectures of David Silver , where he says that Monte Carlo method is not biased and has very high variance. But I don't understand in which sense the bias and variance are defined. In this article the reason behind high variance is explained as: The fact that we are taking many steps before finishing an episode and only then updating our estimates introduces a high amount of variance into the updates. But can anyone give an intuitive example of this type of scenario? I also don't understand how Monte Carlo method is not biased.
