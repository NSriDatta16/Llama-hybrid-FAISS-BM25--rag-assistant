In my humble opinion, Bayesian statistics suffers from some drawbacks that conflict with its widespread use (in SPC but in other research sectors as well): It is more difficult to get estimates vs. its frequentist counterpart (the widest part of classes on statistics adopt the frequentist approach. By the way, it would be interesting to investigate if this is the cause or the effect of the limited popularity of Bayesian statistics). Very often Bayesian statistics imposes choices about different ways of dealing with the same problem (e.g., which is the best prior?), not just click-and-see (anyway, this approach should not be encouraged under the frequentist framework, either). Bayesian statistics has some topics which are difficult to manage by less than very experienced statisticians (e.g., improper priors ); It requires sensitivity analyses (usually avoided under the frequentist framework), and exceptions made for some topics, such as missing data analysis. It has only one (laudably, free downloadable) software available for calculation. It takes more time to be an autonomous researcher with Bayesian than with frequentist tools.
