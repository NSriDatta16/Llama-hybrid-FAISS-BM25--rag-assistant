ObservableCollection Databinding performance

I would like to know why according to this article and observable collection binds significantly faster(20 ms vs 1685ms, that's 800X faster) than a List<> collection in WPF. I looked at the internals of ObservableCollection and it uses a List as it's storage collection object(I used reflector and saw this in the constructor) public Collection() { this.items = new List (); } So what's going on here?
