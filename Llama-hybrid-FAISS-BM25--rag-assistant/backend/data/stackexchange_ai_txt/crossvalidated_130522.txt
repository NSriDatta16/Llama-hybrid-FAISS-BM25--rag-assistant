a mathematical explanation of what are some Bayesian methods I can use to test the difference between the mean of two samples. There are several approaches to "testing" this. I'll mention a couple: If you want an explicit decision you could look at decision theory. A pretty simple thing that's sometimes done is to find an interval for the difference in the means and consider whether it includes 0 or not. That would involve starting with a model for the observations, priors on the parameters and computation of the posterior distribution of the difference in means conditional on the data. You'd need to say what your model is (e.g. normal, constant variance), and then (at least) some prior for the difference in means and a prior for the variance. You might have priors on the parameters of those priors in turn. Or you might not assume constant variance. Or you might assume something other than normality.
