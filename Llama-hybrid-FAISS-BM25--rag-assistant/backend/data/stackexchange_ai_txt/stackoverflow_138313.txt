How to extract img src, title and alt from html using php?

I would like to create a page where all images which reside on my website are listed with title and alternative representation. I already wrote me a little program to find and load all HTML files, but now I am stuck at how to extract src , title and alt from this HTML: src ="/image/fluffybunny.jpg" title ="Harvey the bunny" alt ="a cute little fluffy bunny" /> I guess this should be done with some regex, but since the order of the tags may vary, and I need all of them, I don't really know how to parse this in an elegant way (I could do it the hard char by char way, but that's painful).
