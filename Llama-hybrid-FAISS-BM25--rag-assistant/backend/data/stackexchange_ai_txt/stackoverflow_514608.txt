COM is OLE evolved. OLE was a set of interfaces and data storage mechanisms to facilitate sharing data between applications. COM was the natural extension of using interfaces not only to share data, but runtime functionality - where the data was fronted by actual mechanisms to facilitate use. I've always pictured it roughly as the difference between C and C++, where with C, you can share header files and structures, and with C++ you share encapsulated objects. As a bit of a soapbox, I still miss OLE Structured Storage, since there is something nice about sharing opaque data storage between collaborating systems. Seeing as drag-and-drop/clipboard still depends on it, I wonder what the .Net replacement will be?
