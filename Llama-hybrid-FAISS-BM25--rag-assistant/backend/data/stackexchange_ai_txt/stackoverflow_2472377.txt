I've had a similar issue, it seems if there is no '#' in the location already, adding it dynamically will cause IE to reload the page. If there is already a '#' in the current location, you can change / append to the fragment without a refresh. So you could make sure all links to that page end with a #, and/or onload add the # if it doesn't already exist (which will cause the page to double refresh once when it's loaded).
