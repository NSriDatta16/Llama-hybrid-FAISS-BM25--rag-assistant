Classification with randomForest in R - always predicts 0

I have a data frame of approximately 11500 records. Each row of the frame has a response variable, isfastes , and a number of other predictors (size, cores, timeout, queue, and selection) and two other variables, name and 'loggedtime'. The data was generated by running a command on a provided input (identified by name) with various arguments (the predictors). I am trying to find out which combination of arguments typically leads to the fastest execution time ( isfastest ) regardless of the input. When I run a random forest as randomForest(isfastest~cores+queue+timeout+selection+size, data=data) the results are: 0 1 class.error 0 11392 0 0 1 118 0 1 Essentially, the randomForest method is always predicting "no". At the very least I'd expect cores alone to be significant, as when I look at the set of isfastest == 1 rows, there are far more records where cores == 64 than otherwise (as I would expect). What could be causing randomForest to consistently return 0?
