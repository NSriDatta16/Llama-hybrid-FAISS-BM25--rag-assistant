In Symon Haykin's "Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation" book there is the following explanation from which I quote: For the learning time to be minimized, the use of non-zero mean inputs should be avoided. Now, insofar as the signal vector $\bf x$ applied to a neuron in the first hidden layer of a multilayer perceptron is concerned, it is easy to remove the mean from each element of $\bf x$ before its application to the network. But what about the signals applied to the neurons in the remaining hidden and output layers of the network? The answer to this question lies in the type of activation function used in the network. If the activation function is non-symmetric, as in the case of the sigmoid function, the output of each neuron is restricted to the interval $[0,1]$. Such a choice introduces a source of systematic bias for those neurons located beyond the first layer of the network. To overcome this problem we need to use an antisymmetric activation function such as the hyperbolic tangent function. With this latter choice, the output of each neuron is permitted to assume both positive and negative values in the interval $[-1,1]$, in which case it is likely for its mean to be zero. If the network connectivity is large, back-propagation learning with antisymmetric activation functions can yield faster convergence than a similar process with non-symmetric activation functions, for which there is also empirical evidence (LeCun et al. 1991). The cited reference is: Y. LeCun, I. Kanter, and S.A.Solla: "Second-order properties of error surfaces: learning time and generalization", Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 3, pp. 918-924, 1991. Another interesting reference is the following: Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, G. Orr and K. Muller: " Efficient BackProp ", in Orr, G. and Muller K.
