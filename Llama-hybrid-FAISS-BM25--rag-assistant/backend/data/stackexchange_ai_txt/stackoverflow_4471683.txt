Setting errorPage in Umbraco

I am developing a web application using Umbraco. I create a content called PageNotFound and, in the errors section of umbracoSettings.config file, I put the node id of that for 404 error404. The problem is that, with IIS 7, IIS always looks for the HttpErrors section in web.config and does not pay attention to umbracoSettings.config. What should I do?
