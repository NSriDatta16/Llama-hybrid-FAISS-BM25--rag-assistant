POST data is not an HTTP header, but it is sent as part of the TCP stream which makes it just as easy to read/forge as an HTTP header. If you intercepted an HTTP request it would look something like this: POST /path/to/script HTTP/1.1 Host: yourdomain.com User-Agent: Mozilla/99.9 (blahblahblah) Cookie: __utma=whateverthisisacookievalue;phpsessid=somePHPsessionID data=thisisthepostdata&otherdata=moredummydata&etc=blah So as others have said, POST and cookies (and GET data, i.e. query strings) are all easy to spoof, since they're all just text in the same HTTP packet.
