Is there any difference between feature extraction and feature learning?

It appears to me that "feature extraction" and "feature learning" are equivalent concepts, however there are 2 separate wikipedia articles dedicated to them that are notably different. In particular, only in the Feature Learning article Neural Networks/Deep Learning are mentioned. However, it seems like they would be equally appropriate for either because autoencoders extract features from the raw (typically image) data and those now extracted features feed into the next layers. So, what's the real difference between these terms?
