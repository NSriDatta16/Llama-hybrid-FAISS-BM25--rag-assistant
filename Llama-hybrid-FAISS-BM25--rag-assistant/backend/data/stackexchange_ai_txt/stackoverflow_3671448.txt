Flex tree view with wrapped text on nodes

I've spend hours searching for a way to put one paragraph of text in one tree node in Adobe flex. How can I do it? I created a simple tree view but the text is cut after the right border. So I tried to create a tree renderer. In the renderer I specified width=100 and the text wrapped. But the height of the nodes was not being calculated properly, so the text over consecutive nodes overlapped and got messed. So how do i do wrapped text in a tree node? Thank you
