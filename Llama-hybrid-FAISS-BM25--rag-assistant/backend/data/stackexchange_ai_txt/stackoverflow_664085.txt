You didn't specify the size of your characters, or what is the size of your character set so it is difficult to estimate the size requirements. I would store the bitmaps in a straight array format, depending on the size of the characters, it might store fairly efficiently without the need to pack/unpack elements. For example, if we take a 36 character alphabet with a 8x6 character, you need 216 bytes of storage for the array. (6 bytes/character * 36 - Each byte would be a vertical slice of the character). For the parsing, it is simply a matter of doing offset in the table. The old (char - 'A') and (char - '0') tricks do quite well. The other question is where to store the bitmap array. In ROM is the obvious answer, but if you need to support other glyphs it might need reprogramming, which you don't specify if it's an issue. If the glyphs must be programmed dynamically, then you don't have a choice but to put it in RAM.
