Pytorch: Starting with a high loss value, but the loss converged at the end. I dont know if the model could start with a loss > 100. Help!

I have been trying to attempt plant disease detection using transfer learning methods. I chose ResNet50 first. I also performed a baseline model which is a CNN model. In resnet50, I used cross entropy loss and trained the model for 30 epochs. I did batch normalization too. Initially epoch 1 loss was 112.5250 and the training loss was 87.512. But, for the last epoch it was 2.1660 and Validation loss was 1.8905 with Validation accuracy as 0.995. The overall accuracy of the model was 98.8% and the model doesn't seem to overfit too. Before training the model, I performed hyper parameter optimization where I optimized Learning rate and momentum using Bayesian optimization. I optimized weight decay using Cross validation. I performed batch normalization. Before that, I trained the model without any optimization. I just assumed the learning rate to be 0.001, same loss function and trained for 30 epochs. In this case, the model started with a loss value of 114.2 and validation loss was 130.46. It converged to 9.9038 with accuracy of 97%. So, my question is, it is possible for the model to start with such a high loss value despite giving a good accuracy at the end? Does the magnitude of the loss have nothing to do with the correctness of the model nor the accuracy? If the model started with a huge loss, but gave a good accuracy, is my model bad?
