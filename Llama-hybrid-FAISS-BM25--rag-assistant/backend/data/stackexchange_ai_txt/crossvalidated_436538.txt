You can't know the distribution of $Y$ without assuming a prior on $x$ (and $w$ if conducting a fully Bayesian analysis). However, given $x$ , the target (i.e. $Y$ ) will be distributed according to Laplace distribution with its mean shifted by $\alpha+\beta x$ . This will result in a more robust regression if your data has outliers because compared to Normal, Laplace distribution has heavier tails, which assigns more probability mass to large noise values. Also, the closed-form solution does not exist, you may need to solve iteratively.
