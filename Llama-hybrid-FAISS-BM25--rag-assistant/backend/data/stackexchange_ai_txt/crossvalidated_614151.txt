Confidence score random forest classification

I have a classification task for which I have a binary outcome -- however, I need to know the level of confidence in classifying each individual in with medical record (previously referred to as row). The specific classification problem is how to ascertain if someone is pregnant based on medical records (there are approximately 200 available predictors: ICD codes, procedure codes, age, etc.). I will be using a random forest classification tree algorithm. Confidence could be a residual for the row, specificity, sensitivity/Recall, or f-score for the decision node for associated with a rows terminal node. Note that I am using ensemble learning a neural network and logistic regression are already included.
