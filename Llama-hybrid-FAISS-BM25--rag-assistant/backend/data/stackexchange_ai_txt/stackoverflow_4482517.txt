I'm assuming you've created an EBS-backed instance and added to that (attached) a further EBS volume as a chunk of extra storage. In which case, when you terminate the instance, the boot EBS volume is released and deleted, but attached EBS storage is only released - it remains in the 'Available' state after the instance has been destroyed and its' data contents are left intact. You can then access whatever is on it by simply attaching it to another running instance.
