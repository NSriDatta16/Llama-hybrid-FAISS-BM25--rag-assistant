I don't think that there's a simple way to do this. There is an MSDN article on implementing a SoapExtension to perform schema validation. This is the route I took, with a few enhancements. It's unfortunate that there is no automatic mechanism to validate against the WSDL, especially since the service inherently knows the schema already. I would be interested to know if this situation has changed in WCF: I'm porting my services now and would love it if they've solved this problem more elegantly.
