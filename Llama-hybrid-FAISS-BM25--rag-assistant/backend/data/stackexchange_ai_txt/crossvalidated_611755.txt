Numerical integration over a Random Forest Regression Model

I am trying to compare the accuracy of a polynomial model and a Random forest regression model in predicting a variable Y but also the integral of this variable , With the polynomial model, it is clear how to compute its integral, however, I am wondering if applying a numerical integration over the prediction range will make sense in the case of Random forest regression model,
