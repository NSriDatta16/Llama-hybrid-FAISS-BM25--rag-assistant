How can I check if the mouse button is released, and THEN execute a procedure once in Borland Pascal 7.0?

I use Borland Pascal 7.0, and I would like to make a slots game (If 3 random numbers are the same, you win). The problem is that when I click on the start (Inditas) button on the menu, the procedure executes many times until I release the mouse button. I was told that I should check if the mouse button is released before executing the procedure once. How can I do that? Here's what the menu looks like: procedure eger; begin; mouseinit; mouseon; menu; repeat getmouse(m); if (m.left) and (m.x>60) AND (m.x 120) and (m.y 60) AND (m.x 160) and (m.y 60) AND (m.x 240) and (m.y Thanks, Robert
