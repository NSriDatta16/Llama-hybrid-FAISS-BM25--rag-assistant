You may want to take a look at these Java cheatsheets for C++ programmers: http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/java/syntax-differences-java-c++.html http://www4.ncsu.edu/~kaltofen/courses/Languages/JavaExamples/cpp_vs_java/ However, I recommend you get a Java book as well as an Android one. Although the internet (and stackoverflow) is great for lots of stuff, having a few good books can be a huge time saver, imho. You can search for questions on stackoverflow on what are good Android and Java books. There are even free pdf books available online. To answer your question specifically, yes, it's important to know Java - after all that's the language you're going to use - but you do not need a deep understanding of it, at least initially. For example, you don't need to know the more advanced stuff you'd get from a book such as Effective Java. Do keep it mind that most of the ways of doing things for Android is constrained by the Android framework, so knowing Java will help but will not suffice. To sum things up, I'd say read a good Java and a good Android book, follow the Google tutorials, and a last piece of advice: don't forget you can download the actual Android source code , which will help you in many ways.
