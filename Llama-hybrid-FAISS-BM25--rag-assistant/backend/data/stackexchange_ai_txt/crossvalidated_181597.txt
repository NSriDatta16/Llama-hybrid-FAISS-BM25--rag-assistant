One useful thing to do is plot the pairs; it makes sense to do it on the log-scale. We can see, for example, that the values near the 1:1 line actually tend to lie substantially above it; and the ones near the 1:2 line tend to lies even further above it; there's a distinct deviation from both hypotheses. However, both seem to be parallel to those lines on the log-scale, suggesting that a constant average ratio would describe both quite well.
