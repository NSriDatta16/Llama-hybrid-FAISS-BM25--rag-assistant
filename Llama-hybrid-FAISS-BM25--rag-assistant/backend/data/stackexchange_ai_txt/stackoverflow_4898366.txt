Passing parameter to stylesheet with saxon

I am using net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl to do some transformation to multiple XML files. I am using the collection function to get the XML files. What I want to do, and don't know if it is possible, is to pass a variable to the stylesheet which contain the path of the directory where my XML files are. I want to pass that variable from my Java code.
