I recently had a similar question as yours. My answer would be to stack the images. Here is how it works: When you stuck the images, your image pairs will be treated as one image with multiple channels. For instance, if you stack two 3-channel images, your stacked image will be treated as one image with 6 channels. You would probably feed your image pairs in a convolutional layer. For the first CNN layer, if you have a filter size of 4x4, your filters would have the shape of 4x4x6. 6 is the depth of the images (2x3 channels). This is how it works in pix2pix. You feed the fake image together with the conditioning image, these two images are stacked and a filter with a depth of the sum of these two images are used to perform the convolution in the discriminator. I hope it helps.
