Finding optimal parameter values using a Bayesian model

I have a problem with the following setup. I've been reading "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R and BUGS" and it seems like the Bayesian approach is a good one, but I'm not entirely sure how to model it. I've got roughly 20 events that I'd like to analyze. Each event should be similar, and I can apply the same analysis to each. I'll assume that the events are independent (they might not be, but I'm not worried about that). For each event, I have a function of three parameters: threshold, s, and t. Threshold is a continuous variable between 0 and .5, and I'm guessing that the useful values are around .1. s is an integer between 15 and 2, and t is an integer between s and 1. I can run the function over all values of s and t and a sample of values for threshold, probably .05, .06, ..., .2 (or whatever, this is flexible). The function gives me a raw score, where higher is better, and negative values are, well, negative; they represent an actual loss. It will be straightforward enough to normalize the raw score to a value between 1 and -1. What I want to know is what are the best values for the parameters (or, technically the distributions of the parameters) that will lead to the best(ish) score(s), after looking at all the events. What I'm thinking I'll do is the following: Model threshold as a normal-like variable - using either a normal distribution, or beta, or gamma. I'm leaning towards a beta or gamma distribution because it is fairly easy to model my high uncertainty about the prior, and I don't expect the distribution to be perfectly bell-shaped, or even symmetric. Similarly, model s and t as normal-like distributions (again, leaning towards beta or gamma, for the same reasons). Even though the values are integers, it's no big deal at the end of the day if the mean of the posterior distribution is, say 8.6 - I can work with that. If there were distributions that handled discrete values, that would be cool, but, again, not necessary. I realize the binomial distribution is discrete, but it's more about modelling binary outcomes, if my understanding is correct, so I'm going to steer away from it in this particular instance. My question is, how do I utilize the score, either in raw form (guessing not that useful) or the normalized form (hopefully useful)? It seems like the most important piece of information, but I don't know how to incorporate it. I'm not trying to build a regression model; I'm looking more for the optimal results. And I don't want to do a logistic regression; again, it's not a prediction, but also because it's not a simple yes or no - best score or not - I want to weight parameters that give a normalized score of say .98 nearly as high as the ones that produce a 1. If I were doing this without Bayesian analysis, I think what I would do is something like, for each data point, for each parameter, add a value equal to normalized score for that data point. Then, at the end, look at, say, the top 3 or 5 values for each parameter, and try to make a decision based on that. But I'd like to understand how to model this in a Bayesian way. Any advice appreciated, and thanks in advance!
