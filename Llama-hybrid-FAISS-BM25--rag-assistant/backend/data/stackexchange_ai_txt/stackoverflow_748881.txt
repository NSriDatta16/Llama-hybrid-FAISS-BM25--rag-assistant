How to create a bulleted list in ReportLab

How can I create a bulleted list in ReportLab? The documentation is frustratingly vague. I am trying: text = ur ''' item 1 item 2 ''' Story.append(Paragraph(text,TEXT_STYLE)) But I keep getting errors like list index out of range . It seems that I can't put more than one in a single call to Paragraph() ? I also tried setting TEXT_STYLE.bulletText="&bull;" but that doesn't work either...
