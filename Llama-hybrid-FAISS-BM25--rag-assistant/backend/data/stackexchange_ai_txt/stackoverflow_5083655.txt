Perl Help...Read file..do math...write file? New at Perl

I have a file that is as such: DATA_SET1 INFO1 INFO2 INFO3 = ### ### ### INFO4 = ### INFO5 = ### INFO6 = ### INFO7 = ### INFO8 = ### DATA_SET2 INFO1 INFO2 INFO3 = ### ### ### INFO4 = ### INFO5 = ### INFO6 = ### INFO7 = ### INFO8 = ### etc... I need to do some statistics of the numbers. EX: the average of the INFO4 number from DATASET1, DATASET2, etc... Then I have to write the average to another file: STATISTICS: INFO4 Average: ### I am VERY VERY new to PERL. This is probably very easy to do, I just have no idea where to start. Thank you for you help!
