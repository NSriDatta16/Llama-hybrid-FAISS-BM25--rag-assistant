How to get FileInputStream for file in internal memory in android which is not inside applications default file directory. You can't, unless the file in question is created using openFileOutput() with MODE_WORLD_READABLE , and that's not a very good idea (since any app can now read that file). As the file was created by camera activity as a result for startActivityForResult() for MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE intent. The camera activity should be storing the file out on external storage, not internal storage. Use the EXTRA_OUTPUT extra to indicate where the file should go. So is there any way I can change this permissions ? Assuming "camera activity" is referring to the one in the Android firmware, you will need to modify the firmware.
