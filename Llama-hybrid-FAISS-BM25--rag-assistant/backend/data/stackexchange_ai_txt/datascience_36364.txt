As far as the time evolution model is concerned, you have: A linear growth/decline. You increase/decrease of a constant value (in units, dollars,...) A exponential growth/decline. You increase/decrease of a constant rate (in %) A logistic growth/decline. You are filling a limited niche, and the increase in % is proportional to what remain to be filled. Higher level of model (Bass-diffusion models,...), approximations (polynomials,...) or adaptive methods (moving average, exponential smoothing, ARIMA,...) You can easily test exponential growth by fitting the log of your data on a linear regression, but other models require more sophisticated techniques.
