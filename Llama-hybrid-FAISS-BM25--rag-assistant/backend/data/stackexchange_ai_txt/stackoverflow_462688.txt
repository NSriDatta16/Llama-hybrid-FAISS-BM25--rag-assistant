Just so long as you don't use to form paragraphs, you're probably alright in my book ;) I hate seeing: ...lengthy first paragraph... ...lengthy second paragraph... ...lengthy third paragraph... As for an address, I would do it like this: 1100 N. Wullabee Lane Pensacola , Florida 32503 But that's likely because I love jQuery and would like access to any of those parts at any given moment :)
