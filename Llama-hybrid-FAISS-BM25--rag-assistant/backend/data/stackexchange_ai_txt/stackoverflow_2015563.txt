Replace newlines with paragraph and with tags

So I know how to replace newlines in my C# code. But replacing a newline for a tag isn't always very correct. So I was wondering what kind of strategy do others use? The correct way I guess would be to use tags and tags. Here are some examples of the results I would like to get. If there is no newline I want the text to wrapped in a tags. This text contains no newlines This text contains no newlines If the text contains a newline I want it to be replaced by a tag and be wrapped in tags. This text contains 1 newline This text contains 1 newline. If there are 'double newlines' I want that block to be wrapped in tags. This is a text with 'double newlines' at the end. This is a text with no newline at the end. This a text with 'double newlines at the end. This is a text with no newline at the end. I could write more examples/combination but I guess it's somewhat clear what I mean. Thanks in advance.
