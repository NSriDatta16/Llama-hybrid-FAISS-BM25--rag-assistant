I'd hook into the Shopping Cart price rules engine for this. The system is designed to apply a set of rules an alter the price of a cart. I'd Figure out where the pricing rules are applied Override that method using the config override system built into Magento Have the override method first call its parent, so that all original pricing rules are applied Once that's done, include you custom logic at the end Next, and related to #4, create new model objects that keep track of which products are buy one/get one, and (optionally) create a UI in the admin to manage these relationships. These are the models you'd be looking at in #4 to apply your rules. Good luck.
