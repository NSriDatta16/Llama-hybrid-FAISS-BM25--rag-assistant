I am not sure if you are using python, but sklearn's documentation has a few good suggestions on commonly used feature selection techniques: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html You also may want to look into decomposition techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS).
