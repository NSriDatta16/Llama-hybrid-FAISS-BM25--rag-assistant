Finding the causal representation $x_t = 0.8x_{t-1} - 0.15 x_{t-2} + W_t - 0.30 W_{t-1}$

I'm having troubles finding the causal representation of the ARMA model $x_t = 0.8x_{t-1} - 0.15 x_{t-2} + W_t - 0.30 W_{t-1}$ . I began by removing the redundancy in the model such that $\phi(B) = (1-0.5B)(1-0.3B)X_t$ and $\theta(B) = (1-0.3B)W_t$ becomes $(1-0.5B)X_t = W_t$ but I'm not sure how I should expand it out in terms of $\psi = \phi^{-1}(B) \theta(B) $ . Any ideas? Thank you!
