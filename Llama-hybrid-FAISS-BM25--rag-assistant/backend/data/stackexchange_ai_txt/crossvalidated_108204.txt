Im sure you've already found your solutions as this post is very old, but for those of us who are still looking for solutions - I have found Multinomial Probit and Logit Models in R is a great source for instructions on how to run a multinomial logistic regression model in R using mlogit package. If you go to the econometrics academy website she has all the scripts, data for R and SAS and STATA I think or SPSS one of those. Which kind of explains how/why and what to do about transforming your data into the format of the "long" format vs "wide". Most likely you have a wide format, which requires transformation.
