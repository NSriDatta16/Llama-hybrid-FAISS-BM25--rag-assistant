You probably want to look at these packages: ff for 'flat-file' storage and very efficient retrieval (can do data.frames; different data types) bigmemory for out-of-R-memory but still in RAM (or file-backed) use (can only do matrices; same data type) biglm for out-of-memory model fitting with lm() and glm() -style models. and also see the High-Performance Computing task view.
