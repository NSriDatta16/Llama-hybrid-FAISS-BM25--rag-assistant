Altought maybe not that important now, but there is a SharePoint addon on CodePlex now that allows files to be uploaded by Drag & Drop into SharePoint document libraries. Available here: http://dndupload.codeplex.com/ Works in Firefox & Chrome, uses FileApi from HTML5, supports both SharePoint 2007 & 2010.
