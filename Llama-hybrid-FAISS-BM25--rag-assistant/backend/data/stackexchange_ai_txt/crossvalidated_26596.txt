The short answer is that glm doesn't work like that. The lm will create mlm objects if you give it a matrix, but this is not widely supported in the generics and anyway couldn't easily generalize to glm because users need to be able to specify dual column dependent variables for logistic regression models. The solution is to fit the models separately. Assume your IVs and DVs live in a data.frame called dd and are labelled the way they are in your question. The following code makes a list of fitted models indexed by the name of the dependent variable they use: models To examine the results, just wrap your usual functions in a lapply , like this: lapply(models, summary) ## summarize each model There are no doubt more elegant ways to do this in R, but that should work.
