From the theory on counting processes and survival analysis, we find (informally) a simple relation between the hazard rate and the intensity function (refer to [1]). Definitions Let $X_1,\cdots, X_n$ be a sample of $n$ uncensored continuously distributed survival times (e.g. time of failure after repair) with density function $f$ and distribution function $F$ . Hazard rate $\alpha$ The hazard rate $\alpha(t)$ is the probability that the event $X_i$ happens at time $t$ given that it has not happened before $t$ . Loosely, this means: $P(X_i \text{ happens at time }t \text{ given the past})=P(X_i\in [t,t+dt)\vert X_i\geq t) =\alpha(t)dt $ and $\alpha$ can be expressed as $\alpha = \frac{f}{1-F}$ . Event-counting process $N(t)$ Now, let's define $N=\left(N(t)\right)_{t\geq 0}$ as the event-counting process related to $(X_i)_i$ , i.e. $N$ counts the number of events $X_i$ that occurred before or at time $t$ : $$N(t)=\# \{ i : X_i\leq t \} $$ Intensity process $\lambda$ Then, the intensity process $\lambda$ of $N$ is " a measure of the rate of change of its predictable part " [2]. Loosely put, $\lambda(t)$ is the instantaneous ( $dt\rightarrow 0$ ) expected number of events counted in the interval $[t,t+dt)$ given the past (which is represented by the $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{F}_{t^-}$ ). This yields $$\lambda(t)dt=\mathbb{E}\left(N(t+dt)-N(t)\vert \mathcal{F}_{t^-}\right)$$ Expected number of observations in $[t, t+dt)$ In terms of $\alpha$ Looking informally at the expected number of events to be observed in the interval $[t,t+dt)$ (with $dt$ small) given the past, we have: $$\mathbb{E}\left(\# \{ i:X_i\in[t,t+dt)\}\vert \mathcal{F}_{t^-}\right)=\#\{i:X_i\geq t \}\cdot \alpha(t)dt \qquad (1)$$ In terms of $\lambda$ The left part of equation $(1)$ , $\mathbb{E}\left(\# \{ i:X_i\in[t,t+dt)\}\vert \mathcal{F}_{t^-}\right)$ , is the expected number of events to be observed in the interval $[t,t+dt)$ . Thus it is equivalent to $\mathbb{E}\left(N(t+dt)-N(t)\right)$ by definition of $N(t)$ , which counts events prior to $t$ . So $N(t+dt)-N(t)$ count events in the interval $[t,t+dt)$ and we know that this equals $\lambda(t) dt$ . Hence we have $$\mathbb{E}\left(\# \{ i:X_i\in[t,t+dt)\}\vert \mathcal{F}_{t^-}\right)=\mathbb{E}\left(N(t+dt)-N(t)\vert \mathcal{F}_{t^-}\right)=\lambda(t) dt$$ The number at risk is the link between the intensity process and the hazard rate If we define the process $Y$ as $Y(t)=\# \{ i:X_i\geq t\}$ which represents the number at risk at time $t$ (i.e. the number of events $X_i$ that have not yet been observed at $t$ ), we have that $$\lambda(t)=Y(t)\alpha(t)$$ Which gives a nice relation between the intensity function $\lambda$ and the hazard rate $\alpha$ . More details, including the consideration of censored random times, can be found in [1, section II.1]. References [1] P. K. Andersen, Ã˜. Borgan, R. D. Gill and N. Keiding.
