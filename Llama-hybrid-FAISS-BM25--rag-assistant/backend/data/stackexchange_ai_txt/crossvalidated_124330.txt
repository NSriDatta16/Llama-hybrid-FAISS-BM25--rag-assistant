I listened the first parts of this specialization and I was quite disappointed. They seemed to me boring and not very interesting. After that I went through this course Data Analysis and Statistical Inference . In my opinion this one is much more interesting, enthralling and clear. I highly recommend it to everyone who is interested in data science and R. Also EdX recently starts the course Foundations of Data Analysis . Now I'm listening it, in my opinion it is a little easier than Data Analysis and Statistical Inference, but some exercises very interesting and allow to look to the same thing from different side. Also you can have a look at reviews on coursetalk.org to understand what courses worth you time and money.
