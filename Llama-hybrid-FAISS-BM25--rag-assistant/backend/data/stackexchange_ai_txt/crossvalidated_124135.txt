Choosing Variance for Gaussian Prior

I'm relatively new to bayesian inference , and was trying to apply a bayesian model in a real-world scenario. Let me describe the model in brief: We have $N$ i.i.d. random variables $D =(X_1, X_2, ... X_N)$ ~ $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. In a bayesian framework, we want to find the posterior distribution of $\mu | D$. $$ P(\mu|D) \propto P(D|\mu)*P(\mu) \\ P(\mu|D) \propto \Pi_{i=1}^{N} P(X_i|\mu)*P(\mu) \\ $$ We put a Gaussian prior distribution on $\mu$ : $P(\mu)$ ~ $N(\mu_o, \sigma_o^2)$ In the above setting, $\sigma, \mu_o, \sigma_o$ are known quantities. My notions of statistical variability are still weak, and I wanted to know how are the values of $\sigma$ and $\sigma_o$ chosen in real world scenarios?
