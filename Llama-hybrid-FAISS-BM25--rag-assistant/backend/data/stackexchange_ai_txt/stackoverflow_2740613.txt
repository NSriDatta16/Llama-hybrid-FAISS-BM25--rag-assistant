Here is an example where the process_file subroutine prints out blank-line-separated "\n\n" paragraphs that contain foo. sub process_file { my ($fileHandle) = @_; my $paragraph; while ( defined(my $line = ) and not eof( ) ) { $paragraph .= $line; last unless length($line); } print $paragraph if $paragraph =~ /foo/; goto &process_file unless eof($fileHandle); # goto optimizes the tail recursion and prevents a stack overflow # redo unless eof($fileHandle); would also work } open my $fileHandle, '
