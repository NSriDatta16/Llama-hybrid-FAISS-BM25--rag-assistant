I've met the same problem too. But seems you don't need to drag two .a files into the app project to solve this problem. This is what I did: Drag the static library project into app project's framework group "Get Info" for the target in app project Set the direct dependency of static library Make clean all unnecessary builds(for example the simulator build) in the static library project Build in the app project
