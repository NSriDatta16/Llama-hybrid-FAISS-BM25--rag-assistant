Best practice of data validation in enterprise application

I'm studying e-Commerce like web application. In one case study, I’m in trouble of mass data validation. What is the best practice of that in enterprise application? Here is one scenario: For a cargo system. There is a “Cargo” object, which contains a list of “Good” to be shipped with. Each “Good” have a string field, named “Category”, specifying what kind of “Good” it is. Such as “inflammable”, “Fragile”. So, there are two chances for the validation to take place. The creation of the object. Or the storage in the database of the object. If we only validate at the storage stage, when some “Good” validation fails, the “Cargo” storage fails too, and the previously stored “Goods” need to be deleted. This is low efficient. If we also validate at the creation stage. There will be duplicated validation logic(a check of foreign key as I stores those “Category” in the database, and a check in the constructor).
