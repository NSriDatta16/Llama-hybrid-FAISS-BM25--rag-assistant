Looking for SQL Server Performance Monitor Tools

I may be approaching this problem from the wrong angle but what I'm thinking of is some kind of performance monitor tool for SQl server that works in a similar way to code performance tools, e.g. I;d like to see an output of how many times each stored procedure was called, average executuion time and possibly various resource usage stats such as cache/index utilisation, resultign disk access and table scans, etc. As far as I can tell the performance monitor that comes with SQL Server just logs the various calls but doesn't report he variosu stats I'm looking for. Potentially I just need a tool to analyze the log output?
