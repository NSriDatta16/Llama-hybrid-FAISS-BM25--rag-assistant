It depends on the complexity of the application. I would go with Linq to Sql. But then using Linq to Sql does not necessary provide a good abstraction between the business layer and the data access layer. But I find that using Linq to Sql you can quickly retrieve the data out of the storage and display it on the screen. Also, if you want fast UI then take a look at dynamic data website. That also uses Linq to Sql or Entity Framework. One question you must think is that if you need good design or RAD.
