You may also consider constructing your class like so that constructors can leverage each other reducing the amount of code duplication: public class Box { private int length, width, height; public Box(int length) { this.length = length; System.out.println("Line created with length of " + length + "."); } public Box(int length, int width) { this(length); this.width = width; System.out.println("and the width of " + width + "."); } public Box(int length, int width, int height) { this(length, width); this.height = height; System.out.println("and the height of " + height + "."); } } Although not appropriate for this use case (as per the reasons given by extraneon) the following is an alternate possibility, useful if you have a variable number of parameters. public class Box { private int length, width, height; public Box(int... param) { if(param.length > 0) { length = param[0]; System.out.println("Line created with length of " + length + "."); } if(param.length > 1) { width = param[1]; System.out.println("and the width of " + width + "."); } if(param.length > 2) { height = param[2]; System.out.println("and the height of " + height + "."); } } } Both of these approaches work with the following: public class Demo { public static void main(String[] args) { //new Box(1); new Box(1,2); //new Box(1,2,3); } } To give you the desired output: Line created with length of 1. and the width of 2.
