How to add a Code-behind page to a Partial View Seems this wasn't particularly tricky, and is quite do-able. This answer worked for a Partial ViewUserControl but the same should apply for a Normal MVC ViewPage as well Add a new Class file with the convention of .cs (i.e. view.ascx.cs ) Add using System.Web.Mvc; to the class Change the class to Inherit from ViewUserControl<> . i.e. public class Foo:ViewUserControl Add the following to the View's header: CodeBehind="View.ascx.cs" Inherits="Project.Views.Shared.View" Copy the files out of the solution and drag back in to re-associate the two together. This may not be necessary in VS 2010+ and MVC 2+. For this to work with a normal MVC View, you just need to inherit the class from "ViewPage"
