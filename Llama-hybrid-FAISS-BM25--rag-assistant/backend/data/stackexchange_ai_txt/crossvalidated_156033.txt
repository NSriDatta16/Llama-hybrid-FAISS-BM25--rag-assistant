If I have read your question correctly, there is a simple way to rescale your variables into the interval $[-1,1]$. Let $M$ denote the mid-range i.e. the average between the lowest and the largest observations, and let $R$ denote the range which is defined as the difference between the largest and the smallest observation. Then, for every $X_i$ define the new (rescaled) variable $$Y_i=\frac{X_i-M}{R/2}$$ and it can be readily verified that $Y$ will be constrained in the interval $[-1,1]$. Here is an extremely simple example in R. x You can wrap it up into a function and apply it at will!
