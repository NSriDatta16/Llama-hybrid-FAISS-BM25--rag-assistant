How do I determine if the difference between treatment and control is significant when they have different sample sizes?

I am currently performing a test in C. elegans mortality. In my extract and negative control, different sample sizes of worms (25-30 worms) were used due to the degree of difficulty of transferring the worms in exact numbers. To ensure accuracy, 3 replicates with same treatment were performed. Currently my dataset looks like this: Mortality of C. elegans in Plant Extract: Replicate 1: 12/27 worms Replicate 2: 13/26 worms Replicate 3: 4/25 worms Mortality of C. elegans in Negative Control Replicate 1: 0/25 worms Replicate 2: 0/27 worms Replicate 3: 0/26 worms Now my problem is I need to determine if there is a significant difference in terms of death between my extract and negative control. I cannot use the conventional input of death in SPSS or averaging of death due to difference in populations. What method should I use to determine if there is a significant difference between the plant extract and the negative control?
