Is there a way to watch a mysql database for changes using perl?

I'm looking for a solution similar to the inotify method of watching files for changes. I'm aware that I could watch the binlog file of the mysql database and run queries to pick out the new results but that seems very inefficient and inelegant; as does simply doing masses of queries in a loop waiting for new results.
