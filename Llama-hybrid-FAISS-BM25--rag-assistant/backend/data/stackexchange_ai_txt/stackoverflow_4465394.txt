This is well explained in this article: List of variables like $(SourceDir) . For the workspace mapping dialog you can only use two variables to help with expansion: $(BuildDir) - Expands to BuildAgent.BuildDirectory $(SourceDir) - Expands to $(BuildDir)\Sources by default The directory "Sources" is not hard-coded and may be changed by modifying the TfsBuildService.exe.config file on the build agent. If you open that file there will be an application setting called "SourcesSubDirectory". If you need a shorter path you may change this key to something like "s" instead of "Sources". If you made this change then the $(SourceDir) variable would expand to $(BuildDir)\s.
