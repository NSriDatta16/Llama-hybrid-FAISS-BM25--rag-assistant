sklearn - combining decision trees in a Random Forests

I have a decision tree algorithm running on a microcontroller to do real time classification. I transpiled it from a sklearn decision tree into C . I now want to try a random forest and I need to understand how the classifications from each tree in a forest are combined into a single result. I assume that if a data point has different classifications across the trees then the entropy or gini values are combined/compared in some way? Or is there another mechanism? Thanks for your help.
