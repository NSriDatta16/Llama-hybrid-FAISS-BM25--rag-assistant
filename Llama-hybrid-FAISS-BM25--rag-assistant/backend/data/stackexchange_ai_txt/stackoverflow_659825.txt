System::Windows::Forms::Form::ShowDialog()

I have a 2 forms setup my first form will call another form with the ShowDialog() method when I receive data from the serial port ShowDialog() throws InvalidOperation with additionnal information "DragDrop registration did not succeed" any hints on how to solve this?
