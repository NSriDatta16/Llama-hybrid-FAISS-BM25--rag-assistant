Flex ArrayCollection Detecting Duplicates by property value

I'm curious of the best way to detect that an arraycollection contains duplicate objects as determined by an object's property value. For example, var _myArrayCollection:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection([{name: "name1", value: "value1"}, {name: "name2", value: "value2"}, {name: "name1", value: "value3"}]); Notice that this arraycollection has 3 items. 2 of the items have the same value for the name property. I would consider this a duplicate. Any ideas what the body of this method would look like? I have ideas but none of them feel very elegant. private function containsDuplicates(ac:ArrayCollection, property:String):Boolean
