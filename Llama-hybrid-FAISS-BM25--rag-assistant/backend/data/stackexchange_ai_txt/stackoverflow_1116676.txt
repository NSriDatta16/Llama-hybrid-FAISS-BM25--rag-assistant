Remember also that you have access to all of Java ... OK so perhaps I should present some examples ... my clojure skills are not good so these examples may need a bit of tweaking. The System.console() way: (let [console (. System console) pwd (.readPassword console "tell me your password: ")] (println "your password is " pwd)) The BufferedReader way: (print "give me a line: ") (let [reader (java.io.BufferedReader. *in*) ln (.readLine reader)] (println "your line is " ln)) My point is that one can leverage knowledge of Java, and Java itself, in Clojure. It's one of its principal, advertised strengths. Wonder what would my score have been if the question were about user input from a GUI! By the way, you could use JOptionPane to put up a little GUI to get user input ...
