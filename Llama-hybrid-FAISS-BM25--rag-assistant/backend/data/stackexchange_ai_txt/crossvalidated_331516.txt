If interest lies in the year effect, then that's what you want to look at. From your model (which maybe should be a Poisson model), you can obtain the average scat count at year 1, year 2, and year 3 on a given quadrat, together with a measure of uncertainty (standard error). The relevant keyword for you is LSMeans (Least Squares Means). R has a library for this: lsmeans . By comparing the LSMeans, you will have an idea of the year-to-year changes (i.e. the year effect). If really relevant, tests of significance are readily available (both for the overall effect and for the 2-by-2 comparisons). In contrast, if you are interested in the quadrat effect, then you should look at the quadrat-to-quadrat variability (which your model assumes to be the same for each year). Significance testing (again, if really relevant) on variance components is open for debate; see e.g. here . PS: No details are given about your design, but according to your title this is a repeated measures situation, which your model ignores.
