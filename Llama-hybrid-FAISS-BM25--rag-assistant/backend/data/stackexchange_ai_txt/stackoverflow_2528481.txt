SVG, animate a line from x1,y1 to x2,y2?

The animate property is very loosely documented. And unfortunately for me, the way the W3 documents SVG is VERY difficult understand and cross reference. I'VE GOTTEN IT TO WORK (... a step forward at least)... should've known to convert seconds to milliseconds (slaps, forehead) I've updated the code to reflect my next stepping stone (ran into another problem). When I have two lines animating, the other disappears when the next one starts, how do I make it so every line stays once it has been animated? ... I assume it has something to do with the 'fill' property, but 'fill=freeze' transforms the line to vertical. UPDATE: I recently got it to work, here's the solution Add a fill attribute to your animate element with the value of freeze . Like so Here are some effects I achieved: SVGAnimate Compatible Browsers Only!!! [Opera, Safari, Chrome ], sorry no firefox or IE ... fair warning, it taxes CPU a bit.
