Adding to David's answer, in fastai is where I found the concept of finding the best learning rate for that data, using a particular architecture. But that thing exists only on fastai/pytorch. Recently someone made a keras implementation . which in turn are based on these papers: A disciplined approach to neural network hyper-parameters: Part 1 -- learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Residual Networks Using Large Learning Rates Hope this helps.
