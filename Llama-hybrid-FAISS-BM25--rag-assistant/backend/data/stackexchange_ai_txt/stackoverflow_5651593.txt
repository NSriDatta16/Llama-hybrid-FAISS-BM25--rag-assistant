alternatively, could you use decimals, or a string? content order -------------------- A 'a' B 'b' C 'c' Then to insert D between a and b, give it the value 'aa' An algorithm for generating the strings is best shown for a binary string: if you want to insert something between "1011" and "1100", do the following: Avalue = 1+0*(1/2)+1*(1/4)+1*(1/8) Bvalue = 1+1*(1/2)+0*(1/4)+0*(1/8) average, new value = 1+0*(1/2)+1*(1/4)+1*(1/8)+1*(1/16) new string = "10111" content order -------------------- A '1011' new! '10111' B '1100' C '1101' since you always average 2 values, the average will always have a finite binary development, and a finite string. It effectively defines a binary tree. As you know binary trees don't always turn out well balanced, in other words, some strings will be much longer than others after enough insertions. To keep them short, you could use any even number base - it has to be even because then the development of any average of two values is finite. But whatever you do, strings will probably become long, and you'll have to do some housekeeping at some point, cleaning up the values so that the string space is used efficiently. What this algorithm gives you is the certainty that between cleanups, the system will keep ticking along.
