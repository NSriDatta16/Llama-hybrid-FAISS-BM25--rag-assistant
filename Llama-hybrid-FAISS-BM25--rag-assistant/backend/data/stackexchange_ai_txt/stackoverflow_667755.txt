Thanks to both sipwiz and MrEvil. We developed a PHP script that will parse the URL that the user enters and paste www to the top of it. (e.g. if the customer enters kiragiannis.com , then it will redirect to www.kiragiannis.com ). So our customer point their root (e.g. customer1.com to A record where our web redirector is) and then www CNAME to the real A record managed by us. Below the code in case you are interested for future us.
