Why the error on a training set is decreasing, while the error on the validation set is increasing?

When training XGboost model I observe the following outputs: [10] train-rmspe:0.360292 eval-rmspe:0.843193 [11] train-rmspe:0.358901 eval-rmspe:0.848542 [12] train-rmspe:0.355327 eval-rmspe:0.878116 [13] train-rmspe:0.349120 eval-rmspe:0.880048 [14] train-rmspe:0.343729 eval-rmspe:0.886429 [15] train-rmspe:0.337795 eval-rmspe:0.887312 [16] train-rmspe:0.331385 eval-rmspe:0.892312 [17] train-rmspe:0.329000 eval-rmspe:0.892327 [18] train-rmspe:0.325391 eval-rmspe:0.892305 [19] train-rmspe:0.323480 eval-rmspe:0.894754 [20] train-rmspe:0.321171 eval-rmspe:0.892071 [21] train-rmspe:0.320194 eval-rmspe:0.893531 [22] train-rmspe:0.318526 eval-rmspe:0.892274 [23] train-rmspe:0.315825 eval-rmspe:0.903235 [24] train-rmspe:0.315040 eval-rmspe:0.901118 [25] train-rmspe:0.313372 eval-rmspe:0.905540 [26] train-rmspe:0.312313 eval-rmspe:0.905291 [27] train-rmspe:0.311462 eval-rmspe:0.908073 I don't understand why the error on a training set is decreasing, while the error on the validation set is increasing. What is the meaning of this? It happens with all the data sub-sets...
