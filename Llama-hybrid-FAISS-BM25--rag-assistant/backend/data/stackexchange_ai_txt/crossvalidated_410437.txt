For ordinary response variables Y, use a method that takes advantage of the ordinality, to increase power by reducing the number of parameters in the model. Ordinary $\chi^2$ tests for contingency (frequency) tables involve a lot of parameters because they consider Y as polytomous (multinomial; categorical). To handle the repeated-within-subject nature of the data, you can incorporate random subject effects. So combining a proportional odds ordinal logistic model with random effects is advised, e.g., R package ordinal . Even better (fewer approximations) would be a Bayesian mixed effects ordinal model.
