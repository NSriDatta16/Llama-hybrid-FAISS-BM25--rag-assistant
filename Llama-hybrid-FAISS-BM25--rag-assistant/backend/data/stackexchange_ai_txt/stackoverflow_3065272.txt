Change i18n resources path for .Net Windows application

We are migrating a .Net windows application to Windows 7. This application can be used in multiple languages, but only English is installed by default. There is a menu item that allows users to download additional languages. This application is using the standard .Net satellite resources folder organization: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sb6a8618%28v=VS.80%29.aspx . The problem in Windows 7 is that the users are not administrators and don't have write access to the "program files" folder where the application is installed. This means that when the users try to download a new language resources file they get an error. Is there a way to direct .Net to look for resources files in another folder, for example one inside the user's home directory? I know you can add the resources to .Net Global assembly cache, but you also need administrator rights for that. Edit : I'm aware of the configuration parameter ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/823z9h8w.aspx ), but it can be used only to specify a subdirectory of the application's base path. Is there a way to force it to a folder outside of the application's home? Edit : I think I could probably use the AppDomain.AssemblyResolve event to look for the appropiate resources, but it won't be called for resource assemblies prior to .Net 4 and I can't have the users update to that version yet. Thanks, Guillermo
