How to deal with train test split where a factor variable has only 1 observation for some levels

(Suggestions for tags welcome, could only think of r tag and predictive-models tag) Here is a variable from my data: > table(processed_train$cat89) A B C D E F G H I 183744 4312 220 33 5 0 1 1 2 I split my data into test and train, created a model and tried to do some prediction on test: set.seed(123) sample_train Before predicting, here is what a variable looks like: > table(working_test$cat89) A B C D E F G H I 73536 1697 78 12 3 0 1 0 1 > table(processed_train$cat89) A B C D E F G H I 183744 4312 220 33 5 0 1 1 2 Now look what happens: > prediction_mlr_sink From Googling around it seems the conventional wisdom is to just drop variable cat89. But that strikes me as crude. Is there a more elegant solution? What should I do here in order to get my predictions on test data and avoid this error?
