@jpl has provided a good explanation of the ideas here. If what you want is just a reference, I would use a solid, basic textbook. Some well regarded books that cover the idea of cross-validation and why it's important might be: Harrell, F. (2010). Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis . Springer. Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2011). The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction . Springer. and/or James, G., Witten, T., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2013). An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R . Springer.
