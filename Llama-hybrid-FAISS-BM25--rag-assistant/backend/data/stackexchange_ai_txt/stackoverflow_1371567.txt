XHTML5 standard is not written yet, so want you want is not achievable. Additionally, HTML5 and XHTML 1.0 are different unrelated standards of HTML. The mime-type tells the user-agent how to process the current resource. That is different than the doctype declaration, which tells the user-agent what the definition of the current resource is. The mime-type for SGML based HTML is text/html. SGML forms of HTML include: HTML 4, HTML 5, XHTML 1.0, and all earlier versions of HTML. XML forms of HTML must be processed with the application/xml+html mime-type which is only for XHTML 1.1 and XHTML 5. The biggest differences between the SGML form and the XML form is sloppiness. The SGML form is essentially a text document and is typically regarded as tag soup where validation is often irrelevant and browsers try to do the best they can. In the XML form any error at any point in the code will cause the document to fail at the user-agent and throw an error to the screen, much like any other programming language. In this case the XML form of HTML is treated like an application where code is evaluated for processing opposed to merely a flat text document of characters. The advantage of using the SGML form is that complete incompetence and ignorance of the technologies is perfectly tolerable. If the browser processes the code then the code is good enough no matter how invalid. The disadvantage to that is that the experience is limited to what the browser can visually process to the end user, which means assisting technologies are at a severe disadvantage. The advantage of the XML form, especially if it is defined using schema instead of doctype, is that the document acts like an application where it is inherently self-aware of its own structure and what its capabilities are. The is always valid or it fails, which means the code is always syntactically uniform, which makes integration of assisting technologies simple and practical. The disadvantage to the XML form is that incompetent and lazy authors cannot publish documents that work correctly. Personally, I do not see that as a disadvantage since its a minimal expectation in absolutely every other regard to any other form of computing.
