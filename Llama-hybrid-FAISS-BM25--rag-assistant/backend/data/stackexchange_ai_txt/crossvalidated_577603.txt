A neural network with a single sigmoid neuron is also a linear classifier when the output is thresholded for classification. But, more than one layer produces a non-linear one because the decision rule can't be written in the following form: $$\sum w_i x_i+b>\tau$$ where $\tau$ is threshold, $w_i$ are learnable weights and $x_i$ are features. This is why logistic regression is referred as a linear classifier.
