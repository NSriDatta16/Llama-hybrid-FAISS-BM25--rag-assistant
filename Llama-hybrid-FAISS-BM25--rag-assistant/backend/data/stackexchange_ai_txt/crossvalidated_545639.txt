Forecasting a historically seasonal no-trend time series after COVID

Time-series : Frequency = Monthly. Seasonality = Yearly. Trend = No-Trend. Aggregated at country level. Time-line : 2011 through 2021(most recent) Forecasting metric = MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) I am facing increase in MAPE with my ensemble(Auto-ARIMA + ETS + Prophet) model. The issue is due to recent COVID-19 shocks. The Ensemble model has an MAPE of around 5% when back-test until Jan-2020. i.e use data till Dec-2019 and forecast for Jan-2020. It basically is (m+1) forecasting approach, i.e use data till month m and forecast for next month i.e m+1 . Back in mid-2020 the sales dropped drastically, which caused the increase in MAPE, and now recently the sales are higher than usual and the MAPE is high again. I am looking for ideas to handle the COVID shock on my time-series. Things I have tried : Remove the COVID period(start of 2020 to mid-2021) completely, and back fill the values using the ensemble model. Selectively remove the points which has high error during my back-testing, and only fill those gaps using the model. Use COVID cases as a regressor, but this does not add much value. The MAPE is as high as 20%, because the conditions have changed drastically. We are in the new environment in terms of sales and demand, and it feels like a cold start issue. What are some of the common techniques to address such use-cases.
