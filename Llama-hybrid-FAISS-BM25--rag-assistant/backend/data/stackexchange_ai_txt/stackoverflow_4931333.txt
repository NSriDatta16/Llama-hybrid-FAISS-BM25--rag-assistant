How to obtain the id of a record resulting from a HTTP POST?

I've implemented an iPhone App that uses a RESTful HTTP POST to register itself with a web server via Rails. Some time later, the App needs to update its own record on the server, and so needs to know the id of its own record for the RESTful HTTP PUT path. However, the App was never told the id of its own record on the web server resulting from the POST. So, it then needs to search for it on the server using the device's UDID (stored in the record), return the corresponding id, and then construct a RESTful URL based on that... this all seems rather cumbersome. Is there a more elegant design-pattern for this? (it would be convenient if the original POST returned some data that allowed me to obtain the record id, but it doesn't seem to). Thanks.
