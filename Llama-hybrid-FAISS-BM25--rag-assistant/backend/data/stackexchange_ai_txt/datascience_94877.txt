Is there wights of voice or audio for VGG or Inception?

I want to use VGG16 (or VGG19 ) for voice clustering task. I read some articles which suggest to use VGG (16 or 19) in order to build the embedding vector for the clustering algorithm. The process is to convert the wav file into mfcc or plot (Amp vs Time) and use this as input to VGG model. I tried it out with VGG19 (and weights='imagenet' ). I got bad results, and I assumed it because I'm using VGG with wrong weights (weights of images ( imagenet )) So: Are there any audio/voice per-trained weights for VGG ? If not, are there other per-trained audio /voice models ?
