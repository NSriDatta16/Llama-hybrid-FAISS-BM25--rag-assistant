Flex Drag and Drop

I have an image that I show inside a canvas which I can zoom in on. The problem is that when zoomed in, I try to drag the image, I can see the outline of the image in the foreground, (i.e.) outside the canvas boundary. Is there anyway to tell the dragHandler to crop the "grabbed" image outside the canvas boundary?
