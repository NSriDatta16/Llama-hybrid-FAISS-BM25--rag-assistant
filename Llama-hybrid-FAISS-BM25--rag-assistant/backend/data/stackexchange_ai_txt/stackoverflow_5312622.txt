Silverlight JetPack Theme Toolkit errors

After creating a new Silverlight application from the JetPack theme template that was installed, I try to follow the instructions provided in the App.xaml file about how to enable themeing of silverlight toolkit controls, To extend this theme to include the toolkit controls: 1. Install the Silverlight Toolkit for Silverlight 4 2. Add a Toolkit control to your project from the toolbox. This will add references to toolkit assemblies. 3. Change the "Build Action" for ToolkitStyles.xaml to "Page" 4. Uncomment the resource dictionary include above. If you do not intend to use toolkit controls, delete this comment and the ToolkitStyles.xaml file.--> I follow the instructions correctly but the project now does not compile, here are the 39 or so errors it throws out. I'm new to Silverlight (coming from MVC/jQuery) and it might be something I'm doing. Error 40 An error occurred while finding the resource dictionary "Assets/ToolkitStyles.xaml".
