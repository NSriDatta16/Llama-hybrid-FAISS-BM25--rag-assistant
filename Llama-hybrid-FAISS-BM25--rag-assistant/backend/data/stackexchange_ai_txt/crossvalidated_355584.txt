You can't best practice your way out of a problem you didn't best practice your way into. Get rid of the multiplicative output node. Use a normal 1-node output layer with linear activation and do include a bias. This is the default recommendation for regression, for good reason. Roughly speaking, for intuition purposes only, this is the same as doing a normal linear regression as the final step in your process. Linear regression always gives the best linear unbiased estimate. In particular, the mean of your predictions is pretty much guaranteed to match the mean of your training set. All of the learning happens in the hidden layers. By the time we get to the output layer, we don't need to do any more work - there are already plenty of features on the second-to-last layer that have very high mutual information with the output. All we need to do in the output layer is a little book-keeping - averaging together features and centering and scaling them so match the response variable $y$. And the usual 1-node linear response using bias output layer is perfect for that.
