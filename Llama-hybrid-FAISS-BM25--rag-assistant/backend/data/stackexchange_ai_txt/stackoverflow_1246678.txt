What is the state of Open Source Java?

What is the current state of Java's transition to an open source license (which Wikipedia lists as the GNU General Public License / Java Community Process )? Java being inclusive of many things, including: The JVM The JRE The JDK The Core Java Libraries JavaME JavaEE I've heard/read various things, but never seen it laid out in a straight, definitive, manner. However if you know about only a subsection of Java, don't hesitate to add an answer. Just to clarify, this question is about the current state of the process, not what Sun may or may not do in the future.
