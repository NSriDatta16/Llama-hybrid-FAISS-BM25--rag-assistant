static final's and multiple classloaders

I have a definition like this public static final Object foo = Xyz.generateFoo(); And my application is using multiple custom class loaders. How can I ensure that all classes see the same instance of foo ? Preferrably without resorting to external storage (ie System.Properties or file). Thanks.
