SOLR not searching on certain fields

Just installed Solr, edited the schema.xml , and am now trying to index it and search on it with some test data. In the XML file I'm sending to Solr, one of my fields look like this: some text in a paragrah tag ]]> There's HTML there, so I've wrapped it in CDATA. In my Solr schema.xml , the definition for that field looks like this: When I ran the POSTing tool, everything went ok, but when I search for content which I know is inside the PageContent field, I get no results. However, when I set the node to PageContent , it works. But if I set it to any other field, it doesn't search in PageContent . Am I doing something wrong? what's the issue? To clarify on the error: I've uploaded a "doc" with the following data: 928 some name html content ]]> In my schema I've defined the fields as such: And: PageID PageName Now, when I use the Solr admin tool and search for " some name " I get a result. But, if I search for " html content ", " html ", " content " or " 928 ", I get no results Why?
