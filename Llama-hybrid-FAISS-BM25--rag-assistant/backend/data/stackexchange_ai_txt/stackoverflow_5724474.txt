Interesting question. You'll notice from my earlier question on sorting that Magento uses SQL ORDER BY statements for sorting by default. That will make it pretty hard to achieve what you need (IMHO) using the addAttributeToSort() approach. You could use a similar approach to the answer that I posted to that question which basically converts the collection to an array of objects, then applies a custom sort function. You need to create your own custom module and update your layout xml to point at the new block e.g. Hope this helps, JD
