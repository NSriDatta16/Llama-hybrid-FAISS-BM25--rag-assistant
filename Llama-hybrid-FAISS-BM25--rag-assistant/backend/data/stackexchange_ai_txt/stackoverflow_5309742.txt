WP7 MultiScaleImage getting images from Isolated Storage

I want to create a similar control to that of the Bing Maps control (from which I can see it uses the MultiScaleImage) but I have all of my images stored in a compressed format in local isolated storage. I know of the MultiScaleTileSource class, but from what I have seen that just returns to the MSI a collection of URI's not the images themselves... Anyone had any any luck with this type of thing?
