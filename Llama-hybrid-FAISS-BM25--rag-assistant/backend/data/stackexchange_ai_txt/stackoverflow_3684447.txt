ActiveX is COM so the technology for embedding it in a page has not change for 10-12 years ago. It is just plain HTML, with Object tag. This is pre-.NET and .NET has not made any enhancements last time I checked. You can run C# and host it in IE and use ActiveX like that but you do not want to do it. Have a look here: http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_object.asp I must say, however, that with all the limitations on running ActiveX in IE - because it was a security hole - it will not be a pleasant user experience for its users.
