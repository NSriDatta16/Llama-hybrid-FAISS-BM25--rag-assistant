Is it appropriate to use regression to predict a difference score?

Participants in a study all respond to stimuli under two conditions, and some difference in response time is expected between Condition 1 and Condition 2. I have three continuous outcome variables: - A participant's average response time in Condition 1 - A participant's average response time in Condition 2 - The difference between C1 and C2, i.e. C1 minus C2 I also have 7 variables that are believed to predict these outcome variables. In particular, they're strongly believed to predict the difference score. Is it appropriate to use multiple regression to predict a difference score of this sort, i.e. to do three regression analyses, one for each outcome variable? What differences in interpretation will be required as a result of the fact that I'm predicting a difference score? Are there any other things that I will need to handle differently in this context, for example in relation to regression assumptions and diagnostics?
