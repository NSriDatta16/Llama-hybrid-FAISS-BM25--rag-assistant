It doesn't make sense -- what a browser does when it submits a form by definition is to make a request to a web server. If all that's going on is that you don't want to be running Apache, you could hook something simple up using the CGIHTTPServer class that's provided as part of the Python Standard library. If you don't want a server process at all, and you're using a suitably modern browser, you may want to look at using HTML5 local storage, but that's not a Python solution.
