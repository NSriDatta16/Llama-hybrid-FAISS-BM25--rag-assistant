They are talking about batch normalization, which they have described for the training procedure but not for inference. This is a process of normalizing the hidden units using sample means etc. In this section they explain what to do for the inference stage, when you are just making predictions ( ie after training has completed). However, in stopped validation you interleave prediction on validation set with training to estimate your validation error. So during this process you don't have a population average (the averages are still changing as you train), so then you use a running average to calculate the batch norm parameters to calculate performance on validation set. It is in this sense that Using moving averages instead, we track the accuracy of the model as it trains. nothing to do with literally using the running means as a metric for neural network performance.
