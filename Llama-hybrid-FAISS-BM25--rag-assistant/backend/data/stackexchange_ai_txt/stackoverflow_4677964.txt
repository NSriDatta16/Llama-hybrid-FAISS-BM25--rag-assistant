C# Charting zoom problem with DataTime for X axis

using the MS Charting for .NET, I am trying to zoom into the chart which I have created. This works fine on the Y axis (type = float) and on the X axis if type = int, but when I have DateTime values on the X axis, scrolling does not behave as it should on this axis. Vertically, everything still behaves properly, but while I can zoom into the X axis, I cannot drag the sliding bar to move where I am zoomed into. However, I can click either side and it will jump. Does anyone know how to fix this and make it behave like it does with float values? Thanks!
