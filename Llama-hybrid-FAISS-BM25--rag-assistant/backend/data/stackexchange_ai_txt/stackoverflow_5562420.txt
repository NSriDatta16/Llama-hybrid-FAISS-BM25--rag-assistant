WPF RichTextBox TextChangedEvent - Finding Nearest Paragraph Start

Using WPF in .Net 4, I have created a small WPF RichTextBox inside a window. I have successfully been able to catch the TextChangedEvent event for the RichTextBox, and I can traverse through the changes array provided by the TextChangedEventArgs. I'm using the code found here: Best way to implement a Parsing/Editable Richtextbox in WPF Well, say I type the letter 'a' into the RichTextBox at runtime, and have a breakpoint during the TextChangedEvent in order to inspect the contents of the RichTextBox using the debugger. I want to then perform the following: string sa = range.Start.Paragraph.ContentStart.GetTextInRun(LogicalDirection.Forward); But the problem is that 'sa' is always an empty string no matter what I put into the RichTextBox at runtime. Shouldn't 'sa' be a string starting at the beginning of the paragraph relative to a given change? Or should I use something else besides range.Start.Paragraph.ContentStart ?
