AS3 Flex dynamically loading images does not allow images' id

I need to load dynamically a few images (4-6) so that by clicking on particular image user would invoke particular action. Embedding images solves the problem but at the expense of file size. If I load them dynamically, they lose their ID. and so forth this works. But instantiated in CDATA it does not work: import components.ExercisesSCroller; private var custScroller:ExercisesScroller; private function init():void { custScroller = new ExercisesScroller(); this.addElement(custScroller); custScroller.ex1 = "@Embed(source='assets/Exerc_1.png')"; } I thought it should be quite a trivial task, but so far I can't solve it.
