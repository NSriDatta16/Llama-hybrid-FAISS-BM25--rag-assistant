How to draw state diagram for first order Markov chain for 10000bases from 2 chromosomes?

I'm learning HMM now and very confused about the order of the Markov chain. Can anybody help me by answering the following question as an example: Thank you very much! Take 100,000 bases from chromosomes 1 and 2 respectively, what is the transition matrices for first order Markov chain, second order Markov chain, and third order Markov chain. How to draw state diagram for first order Markov chain?
