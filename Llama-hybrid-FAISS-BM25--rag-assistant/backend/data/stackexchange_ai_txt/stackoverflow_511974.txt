In the example you've presented, Electronics and Apparel are technically two separate trees if they have no common parent. If you add "My New Category" it's also a new tree. If you're trying to traverse between Electronics, Apparel and My New Category you need a value above all three, say "All" that is your root node. See Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database for a example with both a enumerated tree and examples or actual storage in the database.
