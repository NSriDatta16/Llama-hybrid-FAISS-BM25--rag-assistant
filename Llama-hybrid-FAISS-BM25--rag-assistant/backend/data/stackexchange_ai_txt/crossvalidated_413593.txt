To answer the two questions above directly: You have other choices to choose non-conjugate priors other than conjugate priors. The problem is that if you choose non-conjugate priors, you cannot make exact Bayesian inference (simply put, you cannot derive a close-form posterior). Rather, you need to make approximate inference or use sampling methods such as Gibbs sampling, Rejection sampling, MCMC, etc. to derive you posterior. The problem with sampling methods is that intuitively, it's like drawing a picture of elephant in darkness by repetitively touching it----you may be biased and incomplete. The reason people choose non-conjugate prior is that for certain likelihood, conjugate prior option is pretty limited, or to say, most are non-conjugate. Yes, you definitely can. If α and β are independent, which is the idealistic condition, you can derive their joint distribution by p(α)p(β). If they are not independent, you may need to figure out the conditional probability and do integral to derive joint distribution.
