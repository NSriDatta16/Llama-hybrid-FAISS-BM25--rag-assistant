What is the meaning of "trait" in biostatistics?

My question is related to the question " When and why do I have to use "trait" for multinomial multilevel models with MCMCglmm in R? " But in contrast to this question, I don't want to know, how trait has to be used in MCMCglmm , but what it means in (bio)statistics. The author of MCMCglmm , Jarrod Hadfield , is biologist. So what do biologists or biostatisticians commonly mean by this word? (One example to make clear what I'm looking for: If I would be asking for the meaning of "cluster" in statistical papers about educational research, I would be looking for an explanation like "A cluster is a group, to which multiple observations belong to. For example, many students build a class and this class is then a cluster of students. Data with clusters are often analyzed by multilevel models.")
