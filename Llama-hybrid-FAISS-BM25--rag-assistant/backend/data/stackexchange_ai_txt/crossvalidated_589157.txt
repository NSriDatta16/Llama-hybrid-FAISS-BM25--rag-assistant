Determining association (or not) of binary variable with continuous independent variable

(Fair warning: I am not a statistician.) Let's say I run a bunch of trials. My (possibly) dependent variable is binary; my independent variable is continuous. For the sake of example, say each trial is {pass/fail, temperature}. Is there a relatively straightforward way to determine if pass rate is not associated with temperature? As is far too often the case with statistical questions, this seems trivial at first (just use a logistic regression!), but very quickly becomes complex. (Imagine the case that temperature is uniformly distributed over a range, and failures occur within a window centered on the mean temperature...)
