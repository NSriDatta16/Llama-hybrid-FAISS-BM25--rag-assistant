I needed to use Areas. See: http://elegantcode.com/2010/03/13/asp-net-mvc-2-areas/ I created a new Area called Admin, renamed my AdminController.cs to MenuController.cs and placed all of the required controllers and views inside of the Admin area folder. Inside the Admin area folder there is a file called AdminAreaRegistration.cs which contains public class AdminAreaRegistration : AreaRegistration { public override string AreaName { get { return "Admin"; } } public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context) { context.MapRoute( "Admin_default", "Admin/{controller}/{action}/{id}", new { controller= "Menu", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional } ); } } I had to add in the controller = "Menu" so that when you navigate to /Admin it will take you to /Admin/Menu/Index by default. Now any of my controllers in the area folder are accessible like /Admin/News/Edit/5 and so forth. Thanks for your attempts, I should have been more clear that I am an absolute MVC noob and didn't know about Areas to begin with.
