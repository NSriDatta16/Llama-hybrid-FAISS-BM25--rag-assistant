Decision tree / random forest is one option, if you decide to run a logit regression as well then given the rather large number of independent variables you can try implementing a shrinkage method, like LASSO, which performs both variable selection and estimation, extremely valuable when the parameter space is large. In fact you could include all of the interactions between your 28 variables (you'll then have several hundred independent variables) such that LASSO will also be able to pick up on nonlinear relationships. R packages gamlr or glmnet have this capability and make it easy to implement. If you're interested, try to look at some tutorials online or read some papers to get acquainted (I think this stuff is a little bit more involved than what you find in the typical undergrad curriculum).
