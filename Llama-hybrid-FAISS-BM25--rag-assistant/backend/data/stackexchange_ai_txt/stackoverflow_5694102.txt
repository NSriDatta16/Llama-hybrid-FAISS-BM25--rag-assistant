A concrete example would be helpful, as this question is very unclear. I assume that the issue is that you are attempting to access ligature features that are not part of the default for the font (i.e. it must be turned on as an opentype feature). CSS does not provide a way to specify opentype features to activate. Sorry. If it is a logo, or similar, you could simply create the text as an image, either in something like png, or as an SVG. For a short paragraph, SVG again might be suitable. If not, then maybe there is a font that supports the appropriate ligature by default.
