Machine learning algorithms that provide probability estimate

Question I read the post that describes the difference between classification vs. prediction. The main takeaway is that sometimes we prefer algorithms that output probabilistic estimate rather than deterministic 1/0 decision. This makes us determine a decision threshold that is best suitable for downstream task. However, almost all machine learning courses I have taken do not address this point well. This makes me confuse Why machine learning community does not seem to care about this. Is there a list that categorizes algorithms that naturally output probability estimate. To my knowledge, Logistic regression, boosting, and decision trees do this while SVM does not. But I am expecting a more complete list.
