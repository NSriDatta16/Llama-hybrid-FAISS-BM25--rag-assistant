Expanding on Robert's answer, you can, if necessary, avoid downloading a standard print driver by just picking a "standard" printer that comes with the operating system and printing to file. Plenty of the drivers are justing using a standard version of postscript. It is generally pretty easy to convert postscript files to pdf files for viewing if needed. Printing them is generally easy, too. This solution is slightly more work than just using a specialized driver which outputs an image.
