How could this header solve your problem if user will reply with his own mail agent? In another words, reply will be sent without X-myID header. The common way for tracking messages is adding Conversation ID to subject or to the text and telling users not to delete original mail text or modifying headers. About beeing marked as SPAM because of headers - I don't really think so.
