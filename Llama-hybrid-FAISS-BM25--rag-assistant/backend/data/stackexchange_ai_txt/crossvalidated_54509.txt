If I were approaching this I would: Try to use a random forest of gradient boosted trees to predict the patients (or patient characteristics of interest) based only on the amino acids. These tools handle categorical inputs. This would allow reduction of the region of interest from being 600-dimension (or whatever) to on the order of 5-30 dimensional. In the much smaller dimensionality data-set you would likely find more textbook approaches to be more successful.
