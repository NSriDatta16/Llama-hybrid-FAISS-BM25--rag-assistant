last_modified would work well, I suggest your logical export keep its own data about what was last backed up and you do not go the way of an is_dirty flag. Let your design for your data be about your data and let your logical export be the one to track what was last backed up. And, before all that, have you looked thoroughly for a backup system that has already been written? ( why re-invent the wheel? ) Also, further consideration, any flag column usually doesn't index so well so querying on the column can be a real drag. Unless you use a bitmap index, which has its own caveats and things to be wary of. I always design all my tables to have an entry_date field (with triggers to support) and an mod_date field (again with triggers).
