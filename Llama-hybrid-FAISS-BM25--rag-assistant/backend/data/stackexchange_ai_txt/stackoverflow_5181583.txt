You can't replace the currently running application from within Silverlight code. However you could create a single application to act as a shell. You could store assemblies or entire Xaps in isolated storage. Using the AssemblyPart class allows you to load an assembly from this storage, create an instance of an entry type and execute an entry point method. The big caveat would be that this "stored application" would have to be coded specifically to work within your shell. You would need to provide your ways in particular to allow for "application" level state to be accessed and a means of loading content assets such as images.
