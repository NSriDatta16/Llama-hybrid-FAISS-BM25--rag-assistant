SQLite has a VACUUM command, which will compact deleted entries and reduce fragmentation & file size. The amount of deletions vs. insertions really dictate how frequently this should be done. It's generally quick and not always necessary. The best thing to do is setup some scripts to simulate your expected activity in production. Take snapshots of the file size & graph in your favorite spreadsheet. If after 10 years of simulated activity, there isn't a problem, then your usage patterns don't need VACUUM.
