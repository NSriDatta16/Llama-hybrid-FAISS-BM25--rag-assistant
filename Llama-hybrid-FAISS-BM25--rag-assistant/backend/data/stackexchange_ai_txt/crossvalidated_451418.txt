Modeling with seasonally adjusted series and BoxCox

I have time series with daily data. This time series have frequency 7. Before I start with modeling first I made seasonal adjusted series with STL decomposition (from forecast package). So next step should be modeling with models from forecast package like auto.arima,snaive,ets,tbats etc So my question is does I can use BoxCox transformation during modeling or not, with this seasonally adjusted series ?
