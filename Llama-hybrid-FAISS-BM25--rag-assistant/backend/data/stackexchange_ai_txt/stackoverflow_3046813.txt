How can I click a button behind a transparent UIView?

Let's say we have a view controller with one sub view. the subview takes up the center of the screen with 100 px margins on all sides. We then add a bunch of little stuff to click on inside that subview. We are only using the subview to take advantage of the new frame ( x=0, y=0 inside the subview is actually 100,100 in the parent view). Then, imagine that we have something behind the subview, like a menu. I want the user to be able to select any of the "little stuff" in the subview, but if there is nothing there, I want touches to pass through it (since the background is clear anyway) to the buttons behind it. How can I do this? It looks like touchesBegan goes through, but buttons don't work.
