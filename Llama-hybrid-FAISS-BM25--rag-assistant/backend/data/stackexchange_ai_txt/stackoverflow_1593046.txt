How to convert Unicode NCR form to its original form in PHP?

To avoid "monster characters", I choose Unicode NCR form to store non-English characters in database (MySQL). Yet, the PDF plugin I use (FPDF) do not accept Unicode NCR form as a correct format; it displays the data directly like: &#36889;&#20491;&#19968;&#20491;&#20363;&#23376; but I want it to display like: 這個一個例子 Is there any method to convert Unicode NCR form to its original form? p.s. the meaning of the sentence is "this is an example" in Traditional Chinese. p.s. i know NCR form wastes storage space, but it is the safest method to store non-English characters. Correct me if I am wrong. thanks.
