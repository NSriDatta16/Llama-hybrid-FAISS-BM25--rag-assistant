Percentage change vs log change in a repeated measures or time series analysis

I'm trying to measure growth over 8 weeks between two groups. In essence it's an 8 (week) x 2 (group) analysis. What is the best practice, percent change in my dependent variable across weeks (e.g. Percent growth between time 1 and time 2, percent growth between time 2 and time 3, and so on) ... or log difference in my dependent variable across weeks (e.g. take the natural log of my dependent variables, then log difference in my dependent variables between time 1 and time 2, then time 2 and time 3, and so on)? It seems like the numbers are approximately equal, but I'd like to hear other opinions too on best practices.
