Yes, it's called an Object-Relational-Mapping layer or ORM for short. In particular I'd recommend looking at Linq To SQL as this is a nice an easy introduction. You pretty much add a new "Linq to SQL Classes" object from Add->New Item->Data (call it DB.dbml), go to View->Server Explorer (specify your SQL server settings), drag your SQL tables onto a designer window, build, and then can access your database like objects in code: DBDataContext db = new DBDataContext(); var cars = db.Cars.Where(c => c.Name == "Ford Falcon");
