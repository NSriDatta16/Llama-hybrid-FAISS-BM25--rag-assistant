Use a network sniffer or a proxy to compare requests and responses, you have differences for sure. Post the requests and responses here if you still can't find. If faking the user agent on curl side does not work, try to do the opposite by installing a firefox extension which fakes the user agent, and set it to the one used by curl. If it works, it may be some passive browser fingerprinting (such as p0f by lcamtuf) relying on network timing, and you may have hard time to workaround it. Would be extremely surprising though!
