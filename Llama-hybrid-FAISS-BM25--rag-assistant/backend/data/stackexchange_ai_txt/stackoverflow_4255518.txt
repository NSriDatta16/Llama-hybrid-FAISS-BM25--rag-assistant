I would like to add the following with your differences, malloc" does is allocate memory and return a pointer to it. For whatever reason, the designers of the C language implemented it as a standard library function. On the Other hand "new" is to instantiate an object, by allocating memory and calling the appropriate constructors. Seems reasonable to me that this function is far more tied to the language than something that simply allocates storage. new calls constructors, while malloc() does not. In fact primitive data types (char, int, float.. etc) can also be initialized with new.
