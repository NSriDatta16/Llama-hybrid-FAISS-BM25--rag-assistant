View rotation in touchesMoved

I rotate a view by 45 degree on every dragging. Here is my code. Problem here is that the view is rotated only once. After that there is no rotation. What will be the reason? Any help - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:context]; [UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseInOut]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0]; dialView.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(45* M_PI/180); [UIView commitAnimations]; }
