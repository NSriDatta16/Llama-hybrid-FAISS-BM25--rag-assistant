This is a matter of taste, and everyone will have a different opinion... For what its worth, I prefer Fleder's only because if you have multiple accounts, its a visual indicator of which account you're logged in with. EDIT: @Romain Muller - I don't think you ever explicitly support multiple accounts, it just happens implicitly. Sometimes for legitimate reasons (personal account & professional account), and other times for illegitimate reasons (by pass storage limits). Either way, you want to give your users the benefit of the doubt, and assume that if they have multiple accounts, then they see who they are logged in as.
