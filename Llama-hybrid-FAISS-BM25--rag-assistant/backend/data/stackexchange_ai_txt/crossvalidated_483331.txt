Log-concave probability distribution functions defined on the Euclidean space have nice properties such as unimodality and strong unimodality , which turns out to be equivalent to log-concavity by a theorem due to Ibragimov. Log-concavity is preserved by product, by convolution, by marginalization. The normal, uniform, exponential univariate distributions are log-concave. Multivariate normal distributions are log-concave.
