A (or divider), which must be closed by , is a block-level element in HTML which is often used for website layout or for content which doesn't fit semantically into another element. The only semantic meaning of a divider is the logical grouping of the content within it. Because of this, it can be freely used for non-standard presentational purposes or behaviour. It is strongly encouraged that it should only be used as a last resort, when there is no other suitable element. From the HTML5 specification: The div element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements. They are frequently used to produce floating content in layouts, in preference to the semantically inappropriate element. Very often used along with the attributes "class" and "id" for divisions such as 'Post Header' or 'Table of Contents' respectively. References: W3C HTML4.01 Specification W3C HTML5 Specification
