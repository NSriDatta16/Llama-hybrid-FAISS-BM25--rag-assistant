It seems like you want something a bit more losse than a typical Relational db. Sounds like a good candidate for something like Lucene or MongoDB . Lucene is an index engine which allows any type of document to be stored and indexed. MongoDB is in the middle between RDBMS and free-form document storage. JSON in some form or other (MongoDB is a good example) should fit nicely.
