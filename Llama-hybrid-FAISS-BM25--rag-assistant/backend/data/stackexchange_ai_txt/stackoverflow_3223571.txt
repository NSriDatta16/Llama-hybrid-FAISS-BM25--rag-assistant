Alternative in using Excel in reporting

Even with the advanced technologies and available database tools (even free alternatives) are available today, it seems that huge number of users are still very comfortable in using Excel IN EVERYTHING! That's why, as a database developer working as one of these users, I am forced to let them use Excel simply because they are very comfortable using it. Especially for the older people who seemed to never gonna let Excel go and embrace a new tool. Currently, to make their experience as smooth as possible and at the same time, automated, I'm using a lot of database queries inside Excel be it view,SQL or stored procedures. Mostly on ad-hoc (but then became permanent) reports. My question is are there any hopes to improve this situation? I'm sure a lot of organizations are using this same method. Is it possible to completely replace this arrangement with something more logical and efficient both in data collection and reliability? I'm thinking about using Sharepoint. Am I on the right track?
