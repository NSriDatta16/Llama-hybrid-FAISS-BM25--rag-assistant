Here is an estimator which can consistently estimate $\theta$ and for which the condition $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i ^2 =\infty$ is relevant. We have $$E(X_i) = \frac 12 + \theta a_i \implies \frac{2E(X_i)-1}{2a_i} = \theta$$ Set $$Z_i = \frac{2X_i-1}{2a_i} \implies E(Z_i) = \theta$$ and $$\text{Var}(Z_i) = \text{Var}(X_i/a_i) = \frac {1}{4a_i^2} -\theta^2$$ Consider the sample mean $\bar Z_n$. Its expected value is always $\theta$, and its variance is $$\text{Var}(\bar Z_n) = \frac {1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{4a_i^2} -\frac{\theta^2}{n}$$ Ignoring weird situations , we want this variance to go to zero in order to make certain that $\bar Z_n$ will consistently estimate $\theta$. So we want $$\frac {1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{a_i^2} \to 0 \implies \frac {n^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{a_i^2}} \to \infty$$ Now from the Harmonic-Arithmetic mean inequality , we have that $$\frac {n}{\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{a_i^2}} Since we want the left side of the inequality to go to infinity, it follows that $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i ^2 =\infty$ is a necessary condition for this to happen, i.e. a necessary condition for $\bar Z_n$ to consistently estimate $\theta$. (Follows the original exploratory post). We have that $$\{a_i\} \to 0 \implies \frac 1 n \sum a_i \to 0 \tag{1}$$ and $$\{a_i\} \to 0 \implies \{a_i^2\} \to 0\implies \frac 1 n \sum a_i^2 \to 0 \tag{2}$$ Now, the OP does not state it but I will assume that the rv's are independent, since the focus is elsewhere. Also, I note that the Bernoulli distribution belongs to the Exponential family and so the sum of observations is a sufficient statistic, it has all the information that the sample can give us. More over, Chebychev's Law of Large Numbers applies (mean and variance of each $X_i$ is finite), namely, the sample average of the $X$s converges in probability to the limit of the average of their means, and we have $$\text{plim}\bar X = \lim\frac 1n \sum E(X_i) = \frac 12 + \theta \lim\frac1n \sum a_i = \frac 12 \tag{2}$$ So as sample size tends to infinity, information on $\theta$ is eliminated if we use the sufficient statistic. The same we would obtain if we looked at the variance. The variance of $X_i$ is $$\text{Var}(X_i) = \left (\frac 12 + \theta a_i\right) \left(1-\frac 12 - \theta a_i\right) = \left (\frac 12 + \theta a_i\right) \left(\frac 12 - \theta a_i\right) = (1/4) - \theta^2 a_i^2$$ and calculating any sample mean will again tend to eliminate the information on $\theta$ as the sample size increases, due to $(2)$. So the challenge here appears to be that we have to abandon the sufficient statistic.
