Can I keep several features with multicollinearity in the model?

I am creating a sports prediction model with around 300 features. There is a high degree of multicollinearity which breaks an assumption for logistic regression. The issue is that several of these features contain the most information toward prediction. One such predictor is the current number of wins a team has, which can be indirectly predicted by the other predictors. Can I keep this feature, and several other important features with high multicollinearity?
