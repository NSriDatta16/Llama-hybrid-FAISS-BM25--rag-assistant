Ultimately, it's apples and oranges. Logistic regression is a way to model a nominal variable as a probabilistic outcome of one or more other variables. Fitting a logistic-regression model might be followed up with testing whether the model coefficients are significantly different from 0, computing confidence intervals for the coefficients, or examining how well the model can predict new observations. The χ² test of independence is a specific significance test that tests the null hypothesis that two nominal variables are independent. Whether you should use logistic regression or a χ² test depends on the question you want to answer. For example, a χ² test could check whether it is unreasonable to believe that a person's registered political party is independent of their race, whereas logistic regression could compute the probability that a person with a given race, age, and gender belongs to each political party.
