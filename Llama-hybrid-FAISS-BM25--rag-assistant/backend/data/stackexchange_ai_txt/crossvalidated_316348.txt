Its not clear why you'd want to train two separate models on two samples coming from the same population. If your goal is to check for consistency of results from both models, you might want to carefully choose an appropriate sampling method so that m and n are not too heterogeneous. If they are heterogenous, in other words the underlying data distribution is different; that would result in different parameter estimates and combining the models won't be such a good idea. Also the above method would be tricky to implement when you have longitudinal data or time series data.
