Storing templates using dictionary in c#

I have to store some templates based on the statecode.I cannot store them in database. So i thought of creating a dictionary with statecode as key and list as value. I have chosen a list because i need a template line by line.So each string in list is a line. Is there any better way of dealing with this kind of situation. Please comment. private static readonly Dictionary > NotaryForStates = new Dictionary >() { {"AR",new List {"Per Steve Hollowell, ESQ from the Legal Division of the AR, SOS.
