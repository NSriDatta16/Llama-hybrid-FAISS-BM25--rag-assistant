Is descriptiondetail a really large column? Sounds like it could be a lot of text compared to the other fields based on its name, so maybe it just takes a lot more time to read from disk, but if you could post the schema detail for the purchaseorders.product table or maybe the average length of that column that would help. Otherswise I would try running the query a few times and see you consistently get the same time results. Could just be load on the database server the time you got the slower result.
