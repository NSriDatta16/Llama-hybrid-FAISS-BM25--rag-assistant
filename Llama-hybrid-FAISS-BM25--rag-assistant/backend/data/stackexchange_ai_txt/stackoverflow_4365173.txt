How to pass a name-value pair as an argument in Perl

I think this is very basic perl question but I am not getting it through. I am using LWP::UserAgent package to build a post request in perl script. The code is as follows: my $urlStr = "http://localhost/testproj/AServlet"; my $postDataStr = "{name => \'ankur434\'}"; my $response = $ua->post($urlStr, $postDataStr); The above code doesn't work & gives following error - However when I directly pass postDataStr's value to post method, it works perfectly well, like shown below: my $response = $ua->post($urlStr, {name => 'ankur434'}); I tried few options like escaping { with backward slash (\{) but nothing worked... Can anyone suggest something? Thanks!
