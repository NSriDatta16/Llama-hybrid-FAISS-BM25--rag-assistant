Not sure what you are talking about with "from" and "to" tags... What you need to do is write a simple custom module (the best way), or just override the controller by putting it in the /app/code/local/ directory. [Edit] - I wrote a post that covers overriding the different Magento elements, controllers included: http://prattski.com/2010/06/24/magento-overriding-core-files-blocks-models-resources-controllers/ I hope that helps.
