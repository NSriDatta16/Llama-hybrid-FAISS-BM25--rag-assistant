Choose the filename of an uploaded file with Django

I'm uploading images (represented by a FileField) and I need to rename those files when they are uploaded. I want them to be formated like that: "%d-%d-%s.%s" % (width, height, md5hash, original_extension) I've read the documentation but I don't know if I need to write my own FileSystemStorage class or my own FileField class or ... ? Everything is so linked I don't know where to start.
