Pick the right directory structure from the start - it's a bitch to change later. I tend to think that the "best" is organized by project, with a trunk/tags/branch under each project Every person does not need every project checked out. Only check out what you need Figure out some way to share tools among developers. Little things like a SQL diff program that grabs procs off servers and diffs them is invaluable. Try not to let any one project be too large. Trying to update or commit across a folder with 1GB is annoyingly long to compute Figure out some upgrade strategy for the subversion server Backup your repository of course - with full revision history Trac is useful for linking people directly to changelongs and diffs Make it fun. Run keyword searches over the repo on the weekend and graph how often people say curse words in code. Run a code swarm
