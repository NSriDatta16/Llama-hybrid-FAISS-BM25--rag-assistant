How can we possibly know all possible test when applying the Bonferroni correction?

I never quite understood the rationale behind the Bonferroni correction. I understand that we want to reduce the FDR, but it seems odd to penalise a test based on the existence of another test, given that we do not even know if we have complete information about all possible test. As an example, say we perform some test on time series data (let's say, the Mann Kendall test). Let's say we have temperature data about New York from 1900 to 2020. If we perform the test for the full dataset, from 1990 to 2000, that gives us one test. We find this is significant. We could now perform another test, but with a subset, using data from 1950 to 2020. We also find this is significant, but we now apply a Bonferroni correction. We now perform another test, from 1990 to 2020, and now the original test (1900-2020) is no longer significant from the correction. We could continue like this until we have no significant results, even though we haven't changed the raw data.
