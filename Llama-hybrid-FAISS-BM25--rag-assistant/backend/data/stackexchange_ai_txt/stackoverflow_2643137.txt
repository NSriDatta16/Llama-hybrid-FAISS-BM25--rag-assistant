There might be more elegant solutions out there (look for Natural language formatting), but personally I couldn't find any. I would suggest calculating the distance from now to the date you're formatting, and using thresholds. Pseudo solution: diff = now - date if (diff The comparison will work for both past and future dates, as long as you use compare with the abs value of diff . Display timeunit ago or timeunit from now by checking if diff is positive or negative. For the morning, afternoon, evening etc. you only need to check for the time of day in the date, and regarding the formatting type you hit, either display the time as numbers (far away), or natural language (recent or near date).
