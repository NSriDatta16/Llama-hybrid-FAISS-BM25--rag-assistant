How many divergent transitions are too many?

I am running a Bayesian linear mixed effects analysis. Four chains for 3000 iterations. I end up with four divergent transitions. Is this too many or can I proceed? How do I know if it's too many? I've read about diagnostics using plots, but to be honest it didn't help much.
