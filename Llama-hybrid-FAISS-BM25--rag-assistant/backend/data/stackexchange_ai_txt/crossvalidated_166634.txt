I would recommend that you get two books: General reference I can definitely recommend Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop. It is a bit older (2006) but you will obtain the foundation to dive in state of the art research papers. The already mentioned Elements of Statistical Learning is also a good starting point. Especially as you can download it for free. Python / Programming It would be good to know whether you have previous programming experience in a scripting language (Python, R, Matlab). It is quite hard to find a book that provides both an adequate technical level and good programming examples. If you don't have prior knowledge in "statistical programming" I would recommend a book such as Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney. My experience has shown that data analysis beginner have more problems with the data itself (formatting, merging) than with algorithms as there are normally toolboxes with already implemented algorithms.
