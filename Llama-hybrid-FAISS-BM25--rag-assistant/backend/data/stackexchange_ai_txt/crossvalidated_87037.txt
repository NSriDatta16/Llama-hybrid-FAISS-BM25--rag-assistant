Which variables explain which PCA components, and vice versa?

Using this data: head(USArrests) nrow(USArrests) I can do a PCA as thus: plot(USArrests) otherPCA I can get the new components in otherPCA$scores and the proportion of variance explained by components with summary(otherPCA) But what if I want to know which variables are mostly explained by which principal components? And vice versa: is e.g. PC1 or PC2 mostly explained by murder ? How can I do this? Can I say for instance that PC1 is 80% explained by murder or assault ? I think the loadings help me here, but they show the directionality not the variance explained as i understand it, e.g. otherPCA$loadings Loadings: Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 Murder 0.995 Assault -0.995 UrbanPop -0.977 -0.201 Rape -0.201 0.974
