I wouldn't think any pattern of erosion or deposition on Earth would fit because skewing factors including gravity and Coriolis are always involved (rivers meander more as they age, for example, and valley floors are sort of the average of rivers). Maybe the cross section of a stalagmite, assuming the drip remained in one fairly exact central location? I would think the drips would deposit the most precipitate right where they are moving slowest, which would be at the point of impact.
