Well, I'm not sure, but you could wonder if the target score can predict the actual score. I think that a positive correlation between target and actual scores is a reasonable assumption, so you could try $O_i=\alpha + \beta E_i + \varepsilon$. A toy example in R: > set.seed(123) > e range(e) [1] 40.67 115.74 > o range(o) [1] 21.29 111.17 > fit summary(fit) [...] Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -22.73 8.51 -2.67 0.016 * e 1.04 0.10 10.38 5e-09 *** In this example, you get: $$O_i = -\underset{(8.51)}{22.73}+\underset{(0.10)}{1.04}\;E_i+\varepsilon$$ (standard errors under the estimates.) This would mean that: actual scores are lesser than target scores by 22.7 on average; high actual scores are slightly more likely when the target score is high. If a regression doesn't look absurd to you, and if you get a reasonable explication (i.e., a reasonable $R^2$), you could add some predictors, e.g. gender.
