If one is using XGBoost in the default mode (booster:gbtree) it shouldn't matter as the splits won't get affected by the scaling of feature columns. But if the booster model is gblinear, there is a possibility that the largely different variance of a particular feature column/attribute might screw up the small regression done at the nodes.
