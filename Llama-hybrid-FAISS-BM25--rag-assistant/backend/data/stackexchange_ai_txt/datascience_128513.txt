How can I apply a technique from "ZHOU, Pei, et al. Self-Discover: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures. 2024" to my toy project?

I want to practice a technique from " ZHOU, Pei, et al. Self-Discover: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.03620, 2024. " The article call it "SELF-DISCOVER framework". It is about large language model structured reasoning. I've read the article several times, but maybe because I'm still studying this field, I don't know how to practice the technique myself. For me, It seems that there isn't enough information to implement this framework in the article. Specifically, I can't find how to implement "Stage 1" where LLMs self-compose reasoning structures with atomic reasoning modules and human-written JSON. The first stage consists of three actions, and what I can't fully understand is the first action: SELECT, where relevant reasoning modules for task-solving are chosen from the set of reasoning module descriptions. The article says, given raw set of reasoning module descriptions and a few task examples without labels, SELF-DISCOVER framework selects a subset of reasoning modules that are useful for solving the tasks by using a model and a meta-prompt. How to "use a model and a meta-prompt"? May I get advices?
