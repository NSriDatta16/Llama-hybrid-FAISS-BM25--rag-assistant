Exchange order between Global pooling layer and fully connected layer

I'm trying to create a new CNN model. First I pass the images through a ResNet50 network. I now have 2 different ways to proceed. Way 1: Insert a FCL with 512 neurons followed by a global average pooling layer. Way 2: Do a global average pooling layer first, and only after do the FCL with 512. Are way 1 and 2 equivalent? If not, which one is more correct?
