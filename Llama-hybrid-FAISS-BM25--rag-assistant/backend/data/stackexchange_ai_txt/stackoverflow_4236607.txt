My vote is for XNA. I actually began my game using SDL.NET + C# (which covers the memory management that you described, while staying true to SDL) awhile back to learn C#. So if you do indeed like the perks of .Net you could check into that. However, once I discovered XNA and messed around with a few small test games I decided that porting my work over to XNA would be worth it (as I didn't care for cross platform anyhow). I do understand what you mean when you say the 'one file approach'. Although as others mentioned, this isn't the actual end result, just the way it is presented to be like 'Hey look how easy everything is, update and draw now you got a little guy walkin around shooting fireballs out of his eyes!' Things in XNA feel much more structured than SDL, more hand holding if you will. XNA is easy to pick up and to get done what needs to get done, letting your good coding practices fall into play along the way.
