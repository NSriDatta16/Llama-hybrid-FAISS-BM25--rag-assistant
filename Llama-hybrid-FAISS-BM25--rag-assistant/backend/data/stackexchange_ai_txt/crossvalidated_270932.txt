Sampling instead of delta method

Let's say I estimating some parameter vector $\theta$ with some estimator $\hat \theta$. I have that asymptotically, $\hat \theta \text{ }\dot \sim \text{ } N(\theta, \Sigma)$ Now let's say I want to compute a confidence interval for $f(\theta)$, where $f$ is some differentiable function. Given a consistent estimator of $\Sigma$ defined as $\hat \Sigma$, I can create an asymptotic confidence interval using the delta method, i.e. $\hat {f(\theta)} \text{ } \dot \sim \text{ } N\left(f(\theta),\text{ } f'(\theta)^T \Sigma \text{ } f'(\theta) \right)$ For a variety of reasons, this may be suboptimal in my case. Mostly the issue that $f$ is very non-linear about $\theta$, relative to area covered by $N(\theta, \Sigma)$. In my head, a much better solution to this is to actually sample from $N(\hat \theta, \hat \Sigma)$ and then plug directly into $f$. We can then form confidence intervals in exact same manner we normally form credible intervals from MCMC samples. Is this a well known practice? Is there reference or a name for this procedure? I realize it's not possible that I'm the first person to think of this, but I don't know where to start looking about references for this.
