Scoring products across all stores

I am trying to score each product based off a couple of features. I was thinking I can use the sales rate(7 days prior) as the target column and predict the sales rate using some ensemble technique and attest the score based off the sales rate value. I feel there are many other ways to do it, but some guidance here will really be helpful. I am trying to look for a good place to start. Also, maybe if its just scoring, are there other statistical techniques I can use instead of machine learning? End Goal: Try to attest a score to each product, for example: if target has a total of 10000 products, each of these products should have a score based off the input features.
