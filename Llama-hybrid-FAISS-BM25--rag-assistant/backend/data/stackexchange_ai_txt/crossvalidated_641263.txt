There is no fix for this situation. Not only has the experiment used a minimum information (binary) response variable, but it does not have the needed sample size (96) just to estimate the intercept in a logistic regression model. To add to the problem the distribution of Y is not balanced. The sample size needed here is more like 96 + 15 times the number of candidate predictors. The effective sample size is 3np(1-p) where p is the proportion of positive responses. More in https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/multivar and https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/lrm . The referee is exactly correct.
