Hah. As shown in the code, I was using $jQuery.load() and pulling the exact href of the link as the URL to request. All the URLs had fragments/anchors on the end, that is: .... html#id-of-div . In this case, the script itself was working fine, but the #id-of-div didn't exist on the page yet. That's why I could see content returned, but the dialog just ended up blank. :-)
