Looking at your representation I am finding very striking resemblance to Atom Syndication Format, which does this using atom:entry and atom:link. To be honest I am at an awe with Atom Syndication Format (ASF). The RFC for ASF https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4287 The pagination of entries within ASF - rfc5005 If the RFCs are used your feed would look like - Example Feed 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z Darrel Miller urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6 Item 987 987 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z Some text. ... Item 345 345 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z Some text. I suggest using this as would give power to the client to leverage standard clients to consume your representation. I personally prefer pagination in accordance with what mogsie mentioned above with ASF. Once pagination is in place I would suggest the standard HTTP stuff to improve performance: Set HTTP Cache related headers in the response so that clients can use them to cache responses Use a Cache server (Squid, Varnish) in front of the Application Server to reduce generating feed everytime. Support compression, i.e., support both plain and compressed content depending on client capabilities.
