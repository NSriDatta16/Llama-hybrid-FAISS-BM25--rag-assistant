The major applications of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is sequence modelling. Applications like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-Speech Tagging etc.(since, i work in NLP, all the examples are from NLP) Some of the resources which I found helpful for a beginner are: Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks By Alex Graves's Thesis Bengio's Deep Learning Draft Chapter Also, the RNN tutorial link containing Python Code, http://www.nehalemlabs.net/prototype/blog/2013/10/10/implementing-a-recurrent-neural-network-in-python/ Specifically the part on Backpropagation Through Time was well explained in the thesis.
