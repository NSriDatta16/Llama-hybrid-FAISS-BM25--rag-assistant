It adds on the assumption that the advantage / Q-function is quadratic -- even though this might not hold true in all cases, it does have the advantage of making learning much easier especially in high dimensional spaces. (To be clear, it's not a mathematical claim that $A$ is quadratic, but rather the authors model $A$ using a neural network whose outputs are constrained to this quadratic form). The authors elaborate on the implications of restricting the advantage function to be quadratic in section 8.3. We can thus intuitively interpret NAF as doing variational inference to fit a Gaussian to a distribution, and it has mode-seeking behavior. Empirically such behavior en- ables NAF to learn smoother and more precise controllers, as most effectively illustrated by three-joint reacher and peg insertion experiments, and substantial improvements in terms of convergence speeds in many other representative domains explored in the main paper.
