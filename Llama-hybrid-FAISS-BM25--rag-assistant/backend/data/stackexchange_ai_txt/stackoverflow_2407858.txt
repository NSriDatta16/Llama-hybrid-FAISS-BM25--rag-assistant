Not knowing about LinqPad, here's a stab in the dark: You could try this: (no promises) I'm assuming you are referencing it in your project. Add the linkqpad.exe to your project. Set the build action to none, set copy-to-output-directory to false. If you have a reference to it, delete your reference to it, set your reference to point at the file you just included in your project. This way, it will reference the local copy rather than the one in the GAC. If you don't have a reference to it, set the build action to "content" and set copy-to-output-directory to false. Then where you're calling it, look for it locally. This is how you would generally deploy a 3rd party dll locally rather than installing it in the GAC (works for DirectX, but not for Infragistics). I don't know if it will work for an exe... RobinDotNet
