You probably mean bootstrap aggregation (a.k.a. bagging) combined with time series techniques such as ARIMA or exponential smoothing. There is a paper * and another one ** about ets + bagging and how it works very well on M3 competition data. See this section of the "Forecasting Principles and Practice" textbook for a brief overview with R code and an example application. *Bergmeir, Hyndman and Benitez "Bagging Exponential Smoothing Methods using STL Decomposition and Box-Cox Transformation" (2016) **Petropoulos, Hyndman and Bergmeir "Exploring the sources of uncertainty: why does bagging for time series forecasting work?" (2018)
