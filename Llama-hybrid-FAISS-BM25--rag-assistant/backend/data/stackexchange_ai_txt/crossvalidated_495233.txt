Examples of functions in generalized linear models

Let $X \in {R}^{n\times p}, Y \in R^{n}$ and $\beta \in R^p$ , I am trying to find examples of generalized linear models where the posterior $g_{\beta|y} \propto \exp(-f(y;X,\beta) - \lambda\|\beta\|_2^2)$ such that $mI \prec \nabla^2f \prec LI$ , and $m,L > 0$ . $\beta$ is unknown parameters and prior on $\beta \sim N(0,\frac{1}{\lambda}I)$ for $\lambda > 0$ . I know linear model is an example which satisfies above constraints, but I am not able to find other models. I think poison regression does not follow above constraints. Would logistic regression fit above criteria?
