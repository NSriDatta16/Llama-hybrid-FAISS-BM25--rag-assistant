Since you are interested in the stock market a more elegant way to incorporate the pandemic covariates would be to include a set of dummy variables (be aware of the dummy variable trap) and, depending on other independent variables you are considering, interaction terms of the pandemic dummy variables and other covariates. If you are dealing with daily data you may also consider to employ Chow test to determine whether there is a structural change between the two different periods. I suggest you to have a look at Chapter 13 of Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach by Jeffrey Wooldridge.
