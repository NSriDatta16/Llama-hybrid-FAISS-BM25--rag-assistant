Hover not click and have a lightBox appear with an image in it

I have been slaving over this for hours now. I need a lightbox to popup when I hover (not click) over a word in a paragraph. I have been trying different jquery plugins but none of them work unless I make the word a link and click it. I have something like this I am a yellow dog, drinking a spotted cow. When I hover my mouse over the word "dog" a lightbox comes up and displays a picture of a dog in it until I leave the word. When I hover over "cow" a lightbox comes up with an image of a cow in it until I my mouse isnt on the word "cow" anymore.
