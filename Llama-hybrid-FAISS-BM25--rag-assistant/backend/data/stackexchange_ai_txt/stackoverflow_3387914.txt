Can eclipse convert/refactor a method to a class?

This seems like it should be fairly straight-forward, but I can't see anything obvious. What I basically want to do it to point at a method and refactor->extract class. This would take the method in question to a new class with that method as top level public API. The refactoring would also drag any required methods and variables along with it to the new class, deleting them from the old class if nothing else in the old class is using it. This is a repetitive task I often encounter when refactoring legacy code. Anyway, I'm currently using Eclipse 3.0.2, but would still be interested in the answer if its available in a more recent version of eclipse. Thanks!
