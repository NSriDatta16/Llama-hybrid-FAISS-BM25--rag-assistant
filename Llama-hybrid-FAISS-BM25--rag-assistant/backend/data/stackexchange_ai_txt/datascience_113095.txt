Sure, you can average the word2vec vectors of all words in the sentence and train a linear classifier with labeled data. Before doing that, you may remove stopwords that do not add meaning. This approach, of course, disregards word order, so your results may not be good depending on the kind of text you are classifying. If you google "word2vec text classifications" you will find many helpful resources.
