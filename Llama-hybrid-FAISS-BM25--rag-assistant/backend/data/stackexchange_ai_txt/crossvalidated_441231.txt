The second formula derives directly from the first: $$ p(a,b,c) = p(a) p(c|a) p(b|c) $$ Indeed $$ p(a,b) =\sum\limits_c p(a,b,c) $$ $=\sum\limits_c p(a) p(c|a) p(b|c) $ (according to the 1st statement) $$= p(a) \sum\limits_c p(c|a) p(b|c) $$ Beside you know that (Bayes'rule): $$ p(a,b) = p(a) p(b|a)$$ Which leads to $$ p(a,b) = p(a) \sum\limits_c p(c|a) p(b|c) = p(a) p(b|a)$$ EDIT: it can be useful to provide here the link toward the material: pattern recognition and machine learning Looking at the corresponding page provides some useful insights on the context and it can be relevant to note that the given formula is not true in the general case but corresponds here to a specific probability graph configuration. A more general formula being for instance: $$ p(a,b,c) = p(a) p(b|a) p(c|a,b)$$
