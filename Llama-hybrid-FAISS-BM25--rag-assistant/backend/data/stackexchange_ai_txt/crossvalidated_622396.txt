Small sample sizes and transfer learning

I have a very small dataset (n = 18) of patients with certain key data as well as imaging. I have performed a clustering analysis (via PCA and hierarchical clustering) to cluster these patients based on their key data, and then have created a random forest model using their imaging to predict this key cluster with good accuracy using 5-fold, 10-fold, and LOOCV. I then have used this RF model on another dataset's imaging from a different institution (n = 70) to predict this key cluster for these new patients, and then have compared certain outcomes between these groups based on the predicted cluster. I have significant results, but I am concerned at the small sample size my RF is based on. What is the standard in the literature? Note that for my original cohort, the kind of data collected is quite unique and difficult to get.
