Can some Survival Models "Dominate" other Survival Models?

I recently heard an interesting interpretation of Survival Models : A "standard" Survival Analysis problem (e.g. where at the end of the study, observations can either be "Censored" or experience the "Event") can correspond to a Markov Chain with 3 States (Healthy = First State, Event = Second State, Censored = Third State) in which all observations begin in the "First State" and by the end of the study (if they have not transitioned already) must transition to either the "Second State" or the "Third State". In the traditional sense, the "Second State" and the "Third State" are usually considered to be as "Absorbing States" - this means that when an individual is "censored" or experiences the "event" - they can not transition back to being "healthy". With this interpretation in mind, I was trying to learn more about the following two types of Survival Models: Competing Risk Models Multi-State Models In Competing Risk Models, individuals can now transition to "n" number of states (instead of only 2 states) - for example, the "event of interest" might be "diagnosis of asthma" , but a "competing" event might be " diagnosis of gout". As in the traditional case, these "n" states (along with the "censoring state") are still considered to be "absorbing" states. In Multi-State Models, individuals can now transition to "n" number of states, but some of these "n" states do not necessarily need to be "absorbing states". For instance, suppose there are 3 states (Healthy, Sick, Dead) - logically speaking, Dead" can be considered as an "absorbing state", but in individuals might now be allowed to freely transition between the "Healthy" and "Sick" states multiple times throughout the study. This leads me to my question: At a first glance, it would appear as though everything that can be accomplished using the Competing Risk Model can also be accomplished using the Multi-State Model ... but not everything that can be accomplished using the Multi-State Model can also be accomplished using the Competing Risk Model. Does this mean that the Multi-State Model "dominates" the Competing Risk Model and can be considered as a "superior" model? My guess is that this is probably not the case, and the Competing Risk Model might still have advantageous properties when compared to the Multi-State Model (e.g. less computationally expensive to estimate model parameters, "better" statistical properties of estimates (e.g. stronger consistency, asymptotic normality), might require less data to implement, etc.) - but I am not sure about this. Thanks!
