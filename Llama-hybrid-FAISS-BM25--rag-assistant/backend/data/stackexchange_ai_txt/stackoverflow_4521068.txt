Leave the folders as they are and put your medium density images in drawable-mdpi and hign density images in drawable-hdpi folder. I would leave the small density screens and let android scale them. But if you are worried about small density then put those in the drawable-ldpi directory too. There are only a very few devices that support small screens. Now for supporting multiple screens you need to make some changes in your manifest. Here is the explanation of what developers need to do to support multiple screens. A note of caution if you are supporting 1.5 devices. In this case put all the images in your drawable-mdpi into drawable folder. That is because 1.5 devices do not support multiple screens and they recognize images in drawable folder.
