Random Forest: Variable Importance plot depicing negative increase (decrease) in MSE

I'm using a RF analysis to evaluate 75ish predictor variables pertaining to my response variable of percent functional area across some wetland sites. I selected the default ntree value of 500, and my mtry value is roughly p/3 (25), although my model performs slightly better with an mtry value of 15. My sample size is small (n = 556). When I print my variable importance plot (shown here), several variables are depicted as having a negative increase in MSE (aka a decrease in MSE) when they are permuted. This implies that when the values for this variable are randomly shuffled, it somehow makes the model more accurate. However, when I remove these variables, the % of variance explained by my model decreases slightly and the mean of squared residuals increases, implying that removing these variables makes my model less accurate. I've tried changing my mtry and ntree (including using TuneRF to find the best mtry and plotting OOB error against ntree to find the best ntree value), but my VIMP plot still ends up depicting variables that decrease MSE. It's worth noting that nearly all of these problematic variables pertain to monthly sums or the number of days of precipitation. I've tried removing them 1 at a time in case there are any monthly precip variables that are useful to the model, which is tedious because every time I remove one "bad" variable, another takes its place. If I just remove all of them, the VIMP plot looks better and there's only 1 variable that is "acting weird" by having a decrease in MSE (shown here), but my % variance explained drops from 77 to 70% and my mean of squared residuals increases from ~78 to 108. Is this because my sample size is so small? Should I just exclude all of these variables, or leave them in since removing them decreases my % var explained and increases the mean of squared residuals?
