A few things here: lmSBF is for linear regression. twoClassSim simulates classification data and you would't want to use a linear regression model for that. If you want to fit a linear SVM model with method = "svmLinear" you'll need to use caretSBF or write your own fit function. You should give this page a good read since a lot of the information that you want is there. For SVM classification models, the default ranking of the predictors uses an ANOVA model (see the link above). That means that smaller scores are better. You can use a score function that is TRUE for the 10 smallest scores. The code below probably does what you want. I didn't tune the model over the cost value but you could if needed. require(caret) ## For speed, I added 300 informative predictors set.seed(1) simdata Max
