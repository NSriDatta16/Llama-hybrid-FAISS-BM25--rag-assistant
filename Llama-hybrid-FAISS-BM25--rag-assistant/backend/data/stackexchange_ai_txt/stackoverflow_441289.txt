How do you use namespaces?

Namespace are pretty cool: with them, you can organize your libraries and you can avoid name conflicts. Well, this is the intention, I think. I think that a lot of people do not use it like it should be used... Every day, I see 95 char long namespaces scattering the code and hiding the really important information. Here is an example: BigCorp.FrontOffice.MyApp.MySubDomain.Controllers.MyControllerXYZ xyzController = new BigCorp.FrontOffice.MyApp.MySubDomain.Controllers.MyControllerXYZ( BigCorp.FrontOffice.MyApp.MySubDomain.Const.MyValue1, BigCorp.FrontOffice.MyApp.MySubDomain.Const.MyValue2 ); Did you got the intention here? No, of course. It was: MyControllerXYZ xyzController = new MyControllerXYZ( MyValue1, MyValue2 ); Pretty simple without namespaces but unintelligible with... Well, how do you use namespaces? What are your best practices about them? Should we use namespaces or inner classes? How many namespaces your main project is using? (Currently, mine is using 210 interfaces(!) and much much more namespaces -- unmaintenable!) In advance, thanks for your answers, Sylvain.
