jQuery - overwriting events?

My page contains some drag-able div elements ( not jQuery UI dragable ). Now we want to add a new feature: the user should be able to select more than one div at a time and drag these div elements without triggering the previous bound events. Now here is my problem: Is it possible to disable the mousedown , mousemove and mouseup event of each div as long as they are part of a selection? So basically I want to replace the old event by a new one and afterwards restoring the original events. Thanks for your time Update: I wrote a tiny script to test stopImmediatePropagation jsBin demo With the following code: $("p").click(function(event){ alert ( ' I am the old event ' ); }); $("a").click( function() { $("p").click(function(event){ event.stopImmediatePropagation(); alert ( ' I am the new event ' ); }); return false; }); It does not work as event.stopImmediatePropagation(); is called after the first event. So the out put is: I am the old event I am the new event
