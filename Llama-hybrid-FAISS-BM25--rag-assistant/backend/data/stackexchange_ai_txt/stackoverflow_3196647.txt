jQuery infinite function execution

We want to know if it is possible to have a function using jQuery to inspect a number of elements and, depending on the types assigned to them by one click, perform other functions. Basically, a function that would run forever, while the user does not refresh the page. The idea is not to depend on events clicks to perform a function, but the classes assigned to a specific element. For example: $("td.gantt").each(function() { if($(this).hasClass("oper")) { //execute a serie of functions } if($(this).hasClass("preop")) { //execute a serie of functions } }); The above is executed once, and we need to run all the time.
