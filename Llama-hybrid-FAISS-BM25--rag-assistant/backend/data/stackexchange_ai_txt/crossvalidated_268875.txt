How does replacing a categorical variable with associated numerical attributes change model flexibility?

Our data consists of 100 observations (people) of 5 variables. One of the variables is the political party each observation has voted for (parties A, B, C etc.) As an alternative to party names/assigned letters can be a numerical value based on how that party scored on a 100 point political scale. For example, a vote for party A is equivalent to a score of 56 on an authoritarian - libertarian spectrum. This score variable could then be possibly used as a dependent variable in further analysis. I'm wondering if this is a valid approach and whether this change would give me more possibilities compared to categorical variable approach. For example, I can make assumptions regarding individuals political spectrum preferences this way.
