Your third example is the same as your last example - the typedef there is useless - GCC even gives a warning about that case: warning: useless storage class specifier in empty declaration Your first and second example are also partly equivalent, in that they both give the enum type a name EmployeeName . The first example also lets you use enum Ename interchangeably with EmployeeName ; in the second example, EmployeeName is the only option. The second example has to be written as you have - you can decompose the first example as follows: enum Ename { Bob, Mary, John }; typedef enum Ename EmployeeName; Maybe that helps clear things up?
