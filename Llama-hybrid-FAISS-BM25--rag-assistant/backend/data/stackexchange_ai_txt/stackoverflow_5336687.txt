Even and odd table rows with Razor

I'm using the Razor view engine with MVC 3 and I'm trying to make even and odd rows have different classes in a table. So far I've got this @{ var odd = true; } @foreach(var userLot in Model) { if (!odd) { else } @userLot.Id @userLot.Description @userLot.Carat @userLot.AverageBid @userLot.Rank @userLot.CurrentBid @{ odd = !odd; } } This is giving me endless trouble with the stupid view engine unable to figure out what is markup and what is code. I've tried wrapping the tr opening tags in a text directive, but then the stupid view engine moans about the closing tr tags. If I then wrap the closing tr tag in a text directive the stupid view engine moans that the text directive has no opening tag. Just to be clear, this gives an error that the text tag has no matching opening tag. Lovely. How do I write this so that Razor doesn't give an error? Please don't recommend a JavaScript solution, I'm trying to get around the Razor issues here.
