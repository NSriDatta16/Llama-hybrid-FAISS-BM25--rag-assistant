Removing ListBoxItems from a bounded ListBox in WPF?

I have a ListBox that has items that can be dragged and dropped onto a StackPanel. When these items are dropped, I need them to be removed from the ListBox, which is bound to a list. The item that is beign dropped, and should be removed as an example would be a Person. public class Person() { private int Age {get;set;} private string Name {get;set;} public Person(){...} /*Getter and Setter Methods to follow*/ } Note This class is completely arbitrary, and just used as an example. This class will be bound to a ListBox using the following code. The call to get the list of Person objects, is also not implementation specific. List personList = PersonDAO.getAll(); listBox.ItemsSource = personList; listBox.DisplayMemberPath = "Name"; Everything works fine in my application so far, except for removing items from the list. When an item is dropped, it needs to be removed from the list. How is the proper way to remove the dragged item from the ListBox without removing it from the source?
