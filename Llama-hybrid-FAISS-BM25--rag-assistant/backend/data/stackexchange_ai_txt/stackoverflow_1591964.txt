Well I rolled my own solution and hosted it on GoogleCode: draggableitemorderedpanel- A .NET Winforms Component... Kinda like jQuery UI Draggables (not really, maybe someday) here's a screenshot: (source: googlecode.com ) and another just resized: (source: googlecode.com ) Hope this helps someone else out. Also it's super basic and pretty sucks right now but gets the job done. Anyone that wants project access can have it.
