Of course you have to first check the licensing policy for JUNG. That might already limit out some options. IIRC, the licence is Apcahe 2.0. As you mentioned, drawing you must re-implement. For that there a few options: GWTCanvas , GWT Graphics and g2d , and probably others that I forgot. Also, to take full benefit of the GWT approach must not rely on too many external projects, which makes a bit harder. Based on all these, I would go for using only some of the classes and porting them to GWT one by one. Maybe starting from the graph layout algorithms.
