I don't think you should divide by the length of the road. If there's a stretch of road one mile long which two cars enter/leave every minute, why would you want to say that was twice as busy as a stretch two miles long which two cars enter/leave every minute? The two stretches could have the same number of cars on them per mile, travelling at the same speeds. The AADF itself seems to be the best measure of busyness available from the data, but congestion would be quite a jump from that - is there any info. on average speeds, speed limits, or number of lanes?
