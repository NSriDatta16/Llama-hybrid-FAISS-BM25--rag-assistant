Under the assumption that you don't have readings for every day or that the data is "sparse" using monthly sums might be appropriate. In either case (daily or monthly) post one of your series showing starting date and country of origin and a brief description and I will try and help further. Note that weekly sums are not usually useful as activity in week x of year 1 is not usually duplicated in year x+1 except for very systematic processes AND of course how to deal with the leap year conundrum AND the impact of when exactly the holidays and or significant events have occurred in the past and will occur in the future. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: 120 monthly values for AREA1 were analyzed the first 100 were without any treatment ..the last 20 months reflected two treatments (BOTH) . Here is the data in graph form and partially in list form To test the hypothesis that the treatment had an effect one needs to be concerned about possible anomalies clouding/obfuscating that test. A number of possible anomalies were identified and the model is here. with the treatment variable (called BOTH) not-significant. The Actual/Fit graph is here with the Actual/Cleansed here If there was seasonal activity be it seasonal deterministic effects or seasonal arima effects these would have to be identified and included in the model in order to assess the effect of the de jure intervention point. Software exists to handle this sometimes onerous task and would be mandatory for a large-scale problem as you have described. If there was some untreated but important seasonal structure it would be in evidence in the acf of the model residuals. Often the de facto date of the intervention is different from the de jure date due to delays in the response to the treatment or a gradual response to the treatment. his is handled via INTERVENTION DETECTION and is discussed here and nearly everywhere http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html except in introductory/basic courses in time series analysis,.
