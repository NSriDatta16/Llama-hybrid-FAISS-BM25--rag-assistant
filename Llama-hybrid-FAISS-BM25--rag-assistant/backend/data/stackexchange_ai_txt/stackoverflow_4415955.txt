WHERE Something IN (CASE WHEN statement)?

Possible Duplicate: WHERE Something IN (CASE WHEN statement) ??!! i want ro write a "select-where" cluase with cinditonal condition. i used "case-when" in "where ID IN" clause But I have the following error: Msg 512, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 Subquery returned more than 1 value. This is not permitted when the subquery follows =, !=, , >= or when the subquery is used as an expression. here is my simplified code: SELECT UnitsAllocation.UnitID, OrganizationUnits.Title AS UnitTitle, 'Title' AS ExpenseTitle1, SUM(UnitsAllocationDetails1.ExpenseAmount1) AS ExpenseAmount1 FROM [bdg_UnitsAllocation] UnitsAllocation LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT UnitsAllocationDetails.UnitsAllocationID, SUM(UnitsAllocationDetails.Amount) / 1 AS ExpenseAmount1 FROM [bdg_UnitsAllocationDetails] UnitsAllocationDetails WHERE UnitsAllocationDetails.ExpenseID IN (CASE 1 WHEN 1 THEN (SELECT Id FROM bdg_Expenses WHERE ParentId = 1) ELSE (SELECT Id FROM bdg_Expenses WHERE Id = 1) END) GROUP BY UnitsAllocationDetails.UnitsAllocationID) UnitsAllocationDetails1 ON UnitsAllocationDetails1.UnitsAllocationID = UnitsAllocation.ID LEFT OUTER JOIN [bdg_OrganizationUnits] OrganizationUnits ON UnitsAllocation.UnitID = OrganizationUnits.ID GROUP BY UnitsAllocation.UnitID, OrganizationUnits.Title Please Look At " WHERE UnitsAllocationDetails.ExpenseID IN ... " How can I fix that?
