What error codes can occur with CopyFileEx?

I'm writing some C++ code that needs to call the CopyFileEx function. The documentation for CopyFileEx, like most other WIN32 functions, says: If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError. Which is all well and good - however does anyone know where I can find a list of the error codes that a specific API function may return via GetLastError? In this case I want to handle different error conditions in different ways but without a list of the error codes for this function I'm going to be reduced to generating the error conditions I want to handle just to see what error code is prodcued or going through the system error codes from numbers 0 to 15999 trying to guess which ones might apply! Edit: Here is a little more context to help explain the issue and why I want to know if there is a definitive list of error codes that can be returned by a function anywhere. The code will be used as part of a Windows service so while there are users they won't always be there to respond to errors. I need to be able to distinguish between errors that don't need reporting every time, if a file is locked I'm just to re-try it again later. If I don't have permissions to read a particular file I can log the problem and carry on, if the destination directory is unreadable or is full then I want the service to stop and to trigger a reporting process that will atrract the attention of a user. Without a comprehensive list of the ways that CopyFileEx can fail I'm finding it hard to do this.
