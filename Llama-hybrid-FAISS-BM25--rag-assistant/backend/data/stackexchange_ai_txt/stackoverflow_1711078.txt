HTML5 element on Android

According to: http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.0-highlights.html Android 2.0 should support the HTML5 video element. I haven't been able to get this to work using a Motorola Droid, and haven't been able to successfully view a video on any of the HTML5 video example pages out there. Since there currently isn't support for QuickTime or Flash, this is the only other thing I can think of for embedding mp4 video in a web page. Has anyone had any luck with this?
