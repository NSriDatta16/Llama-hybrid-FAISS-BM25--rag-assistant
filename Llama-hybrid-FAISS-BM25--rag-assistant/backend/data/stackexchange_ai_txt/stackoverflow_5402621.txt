As far as I understand, your GridControl is bound to a datasource containing two tables. Since a filter is applied to a GridView and each GridView can only be bound to a single table, this filter condition cannot be applied to a GridView. So, there are two solutions for you. First, which I consider to be the best, is to apply this filter to the grid's underlying DataSource. Second is the solution based on GridView's filtration. In this case, you should apply a separate filter on both master and detail GridView objects. I.e. the master gridView should have the following filter condition: gridView1.ActiveFilterCriteria = new BinaryOperator("Size", 100); To apply a filter condition to the detail GridView, handle the master GridView's MasterRowExpanded event to obtain the detail GridView object and apply a filter condition: private void gridView1_MasterRowExpanded(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.CustomMasterRowEventArgs e) { GridView detailGridView = (sender as GridView).GetDetailView(e.RowHandle, e.RelationIndex); detailGridView.ActiveFilterCriteria = new BinaryOperator("Human", "man"); } NOTE : the first solution is the best one.
