Is the number of MySQL procs (average) at 0.39 is a lot?

Can someone tell me whether the number of MySQL procs (average) at 0.39 is a lot??? I've gotten it down from 1.18 - 1.24 range. Our shared hosting provider says their limit is .4. Our site is not real big, though does make use of 5 DBs and has several pages that connect to the various DBs. To me it doesn't seem like a lot, but I have no frame of reference. Site traffic has pretty much been the same for the last 9 months. Weâ€™re averaging 108/visits per day and 5,234 page views a month. Most DB tables are small, the two largest are around 6,200 records and the other is around 350,000 records. The large one I was planning on archiving some old un-necessary data from several years ago and re-indexing to help performance, though not sure if this is an issue.
