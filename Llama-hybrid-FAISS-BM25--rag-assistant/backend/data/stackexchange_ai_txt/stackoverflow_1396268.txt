I'm not sure what exactly you're trying to do, but maybe you're looking for something like this: userinfo = { "tim": "1 infinite loop", "sally": "123 fake st", "john": "123 fake st", "albert": "345 real road", "janet": None } conditions = { "cats": ["tim"], "three": ["sally", "tim"], "three cats": ["john"], "four cats": ["albert"], "dogs": ["tim"], "cats hat": ["janet"] } for c in conditions: if all_words_are_in_the_sentence(c): for p in conditions[c]: print p, "because of", c print "additional info:", userinfo[p]
