You must have the listing view of the documentation window hidden. Normally above the documentation pane there is a list of the matches for your query (similar to the pane at the top of the editor part - where you can do Command-Shift-E to toggle that, but it doesn't work for some reason in the Docs window). Anyway, drag the top part of your pane down to see the listing. Hope that was clear enough.
