Yes. When comparing a variable or column of type MAX the internal code uses stream semantics. The variables types of length less than 8000 use direct comparison semantics. A simple example: create table A (k int, x varchar(8000)); create clustered index cdxA on A(k); go insert into A (k, x) select number, name from master..spt_values; go declare @s datetime = getutcdate(), @i int = 0; set nocount on; while(@i Running this repeatedly yields measured loop times of 2786, 2746, 2746, 2900, 2623, 2736, so an avg of around 2.7s. The very same code, but replaced the two occurences of varchar(8000) with varchar(max) yields measured times of 4916, 5203, 5280, 5040, 5543, 5130, an average time of 5.2s significantly higher than the non-max type. Conclusion is that in very tight loops the varchar(max) is slower in comparing and assigning when compared with the non-max types. Like all optimizations, it should be only considered and applied after careful measurement reveals that it is a bottleneck. Note that the difference is visible even on a data of actual length 3 chars , and is not derived from differences in storage.
