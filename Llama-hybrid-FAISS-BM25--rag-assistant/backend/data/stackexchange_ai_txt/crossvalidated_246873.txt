ols vs logistic regression, does the interpretation of interaction differs?

My question concerns the interpretation of interaction in ols vs logistic regression. Let us imagine that I have two independent variables, $y_{1}$ is the probability of watching TV at least once a day and $y_{2}$ the time in minutes of TV watching I have two explanatory (categorical) variables : Female (0-1) and Year(1980-2015). I am interested in the change overtime of Female $\times$ Year. I would fit my logistic regression with $y_{1} = \alpha + \beta1_{Female} + \beta2_{2015} + \beta3_{Female × 2015}$ and my ols with $y_{2} = \alpha + \beta1_{Female} + \beta2_{2015} + \beta3_{Female × 2015}$ In the logistic regression the reference is clear : Men in 1980 . So, I have to interpret the interaction term as the comparison of Women in 2015 to Men in 1980 . However, someone told me that in ols, the reference was not the same as in logistic. I was wondering what exactly is the reference in the ols? (if any). (I guess not men in 1980 , but what then ?).
