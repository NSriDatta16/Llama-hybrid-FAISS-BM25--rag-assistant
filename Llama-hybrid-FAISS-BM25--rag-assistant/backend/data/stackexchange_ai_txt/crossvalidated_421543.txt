Classification Model - How to Preprocess Text

I have a Dataframe that contains 2 columns: 'Skills' column - each cell contains a list of strings describing different technical and soft skills of a person, e.g: [Python,SQL,Java,Team Management,Teamwork,Communication skills] 'Status' column (target column to predict) - categorical column with 2 categories: Passed / Failed. I would like to create a machine learning model to predict the 'Status' of a person using the list of skills as input. (Each person can have a different number of skills). I am new to the world of text classification, and I would like to know how to prepare the data for modeling. How should I handle the 'Skills' column and which libraries should I use? Thanks.
