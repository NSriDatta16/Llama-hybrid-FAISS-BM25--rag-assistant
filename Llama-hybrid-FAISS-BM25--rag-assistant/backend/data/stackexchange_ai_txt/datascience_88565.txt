Machine learning classification with time-domain signals how to ignore signal arrival time?

I am training a Tensorflow classifier model with signal data (converting signals to the spectrograms). I want the model to be insensitive to the arrival time of the signal within the fixed window. Moreover the model should classify both of these signals as the same. Ideas Train the model using the same signal at different arrival times Preprocess the signal before providing it to the model I want to avoid 1. because it will mean I have to generate a huge amount of signal data which will slow down training. Are there any commonly applied preprocessing steps for this problem?
