Bootstrapping Time Series Data

I have daily time series for returns on currency exchange rate. I want to estimate the frequency of crossing certain level for cumulative return, that is, how often cumulative return over several days exceeds some level. I have checked for autocorrelation and found that coefficients are insignificant. Can I use simple bootstrap in this case or do I need to use block bootstrap or sort of? I know that correlation is not a measure of dependece and it simply shows linear dependence. Also, should I choose a number of drawings from sample for bootstrap equal to a size of sample or it can be less?
