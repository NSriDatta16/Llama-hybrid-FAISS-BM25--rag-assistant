optimal classification algorithm

I would like to know, from the below classification algorithm which one is optimal(in terms of memory and processing power) and which classification algorithm used widely? k-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm Naive Bayesian(NB) Algorithm Concept Vector-based(CB) Algorithm Singular Value Decomposition-based Algorithm Hierarchical Algorithm Combination Algorithm SVM I am looking for an optimal algorithm to classify network traffic. Thank you! -sathish
