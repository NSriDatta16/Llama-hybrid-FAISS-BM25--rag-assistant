Some simple questions you can ask a developer that you are considering to develop some custom modules for you. Q1: Where does the code for your custom module reside in the structure? A1: There are a couple of places that it can and will reside, you want to keep it totally independent of magento core. For the code it should reside in app/code/local or app/code/community, the template/view code should reside in app/design/frontend/default/yourcustomnamespace/modulename or app/design/frontend/custominterfacename/yourcustomnamespace/modulename(this is something anyone who has extended magento should and will know) Q2: you can ask them about observers and their relation to magento and purpose A2: anyone who has extended magento functionality should certainly have experience with observers and know that they are part of a model and should reside in the model directory as well as be able to provide you with some of the examples of how to observe an event. Also that they need to be defined in the modules XML ie: singleton Namespace_Module_Model_Observer increment and model methods accept an event argument. ie: public function doSomeStuff (Varien_Event_Observer $observer) { execute some stuff in here } I think if someone can explain these types of things to you then you can probably assume they know magento and can create your custom modules for you. Granted my response here is a little convoluted and wordy but I think you get the idea.
