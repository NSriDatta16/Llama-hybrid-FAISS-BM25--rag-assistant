Your problem has nothing to do with mixed models. Your Age is centered to have mean zero. If you only have a linear term + Age in your model, then to get a prediction for each Year you can simply supply Age=0 , which is what you are doing in your new.dat dataframe. And it works fine. But if you have a quadratic term as well, then the combined contribution of Age+Age^2 will not on average be zero, and so your predicted curve will not match to the data. Instead, you need to supply some value $a$ such that $$\beta_1 a + \beta_2 a^2 = \Big \langle \beta_1 \text{Age} + \beta_2 \text{Age}^2 \Big \rangle = \Big \langle \beta_2 \text{Age}^2 \Big \rangle = \beta_2 \cdot 1 = \beta_2,$$ where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the model coefficients for the linear and quadratic Age terms respectively (and I used the fact that Age is standardized, i.e. has zero mean and unit variance). This is a quadratic equation that yields a value of $a$ to put into the dataframe that is passed to predict() . As you wrote in the comments, this does the trick. This approach can be extended in an obvious way to handle higher-order polynomials, but the equation(s) will get more complicated. I am not sure what strategy the effects package uses to handle it.
