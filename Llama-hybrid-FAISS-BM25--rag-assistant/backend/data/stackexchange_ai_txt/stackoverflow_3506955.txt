Organizing or Color Coding Project & Folders in Visual Studio 2010

I am looking for an extension to Visual Studio 2010 which would allow for better organization of the solution, projects, folders and files. I would really like to be able to color code specific project and folders. For example, my team is working on and ASP.Net webforms site and integrating ASP.Net MVC. I would love to be able to color code the MVC folders as that is where I do the majority of my work, or otherwise call them out and/or hide/grey-out other folders. Another nice-to-have would be a set of bookmark icons or favorite files / folders. For example, in MVC land I often find myself working on a set of files at one time: a view, one or more partial views, a controller, model files, services, utility classes, and scripts. I might have 10 files associated with a particular "page" and it would be nice to be able to group this together into some sort of multi-tab favorite. Are there any extension out there that do this, and if so what are your experiences with them?
