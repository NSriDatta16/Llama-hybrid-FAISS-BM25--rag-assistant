Firstly, you'd have to get all the IDs from dragExternal . Do this by using string.split(',') . Then you can use the jQuery.each method to go through each of the items. var dragExternal = 'div1a,div1b,div2a,div2b'; $.each(dragExternal.split(','), function(i,item){ $("#" + item).hide(); }); Example: http://jsfiddle.net/jonathon/UMCrC/ Although you don't even need $.each (it's nice to know the usage though) - since they're all just strings: var dragExternal = 'div1a,div1b,div2a,div2b', items = dragExternal.split(',') for(var i=0;i You use the id selector to get each div by prefixing the div name with # .
