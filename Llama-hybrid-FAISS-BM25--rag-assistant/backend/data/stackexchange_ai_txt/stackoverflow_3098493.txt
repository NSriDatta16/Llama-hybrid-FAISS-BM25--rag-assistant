My other answer still applies when making games using physics engines. But I have also realised that you say: i have the ball restitution set at 1.0 Do you also have the paddle restitution set to 1.0? I haven't checked Box2D, but in Farseer (what I have on hand and which is related to Box2D) the restituion force used in a collision response calculated as an average (from Arbiter.cs): _restitution = (GeometryA.RestitutionCoefficient + GeometryB.RestitutionCoefficient) * .5f; If Box2D works the same way, which it probably does doesn't (thanks Mark from comments) , your paddles will also need restitution set to 1.0 to get the effect you want. (Also: this demonstrates how it helps to have the source code to your physics engine on-hand.)
