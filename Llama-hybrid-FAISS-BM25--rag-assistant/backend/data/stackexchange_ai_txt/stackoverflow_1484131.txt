If you have shell access on the box, you can simply try one of: 1) "wget http://www.google.com " (should create a file named index.html containing the source of the google main page) 2) "telnet google.com 80", which should produce some output indicating you're connected to google.com. Try typing "GET /" followed by return. You should see the google home page code fly by. If you don't have shell access, do what derobert suggested, use php's built-in curl functions and try to make a connection.
