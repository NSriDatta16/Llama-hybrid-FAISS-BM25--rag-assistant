why is jquery ui autocomplete folder cannot be accessed

Just wondering what could the problem be why I can't access jquery ui autocomplete folder in the prod side. I've been using this widget in the dev side and it works perfectly. However, when I deployed it, I get errors saying, jquery.ui.core.js, jquery.ui.widget.js, jquery.ui.position.js, jquery.ui.all.css, and jquery.ui.autocomplete.js cannot be found: "404 Object Not Found". This is how I reference these files: Using Firebug, these are the Response and Request headers respectively: HTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0 Date: Thu, 14 Apr 2011 08:22:27 GMT Connection: close Content-Length: 4040 Content-Type: text/html GET /folder1/folder2/jquery-ui-1.8.10.custom/development-bundle/ui/jquery.ui.core.js HTTP/1.1 Host: (hostname) User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Referer: (referrer) Cookie: (cookies) I'm using Coldfusion MX 6.1. Are there permission or hosting issues involved? I don't have any idea here. Please help. Thanks.
