It will work in some cases. However, you should be aware that the HTTP referer header is not guaranteed . User agents (browsers, search spoders etc) cannot be relied on to send anything, correct or not. In addition, if a user browses directly to the page, no referer header will be present. Some internet security software products even strip out the HTTP referer for "security" reasons. If you wish to use this solution, be sure to have a fallback in place such as not showing the back link, or linking to a default start page or something (it would depend on the situation this is to be used in). An alternative solution might be to use javascript to navigate to "history.back". This will use the browser's back/history function to return to the previous page the user was on.
