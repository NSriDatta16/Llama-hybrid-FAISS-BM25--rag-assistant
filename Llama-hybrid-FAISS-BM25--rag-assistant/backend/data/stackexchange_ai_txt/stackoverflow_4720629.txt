Assuming you have a jquery selector that can find all of the elements you wish to make draggable, when you wish to make some newly added elements draggable, you could use the same selector in a new expression that just selects those that do not have ui-draggable class. $(".selector:not(.ui-draggable)").draggable(draggableOptions);
