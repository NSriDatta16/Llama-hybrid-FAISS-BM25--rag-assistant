Method to substitute foreign for English characters in Java?

In PHP I would use this: $text = "Je prends une thé chaud, s'il vous plaît"; $search = array('é','î','è'); // etc. $replace = array('e','i','e'); // etc. $text = str_replace($search, $replace, $text); But the Java String method "replace" doesn't seem to accept arrays as input. Is there a way to do this (without having to resort to a for loop to go through the array)? Please say if there's a more elegant way than the method I'm attempting.
