select a.dept, a.name, (SELECT count(*) FROM students WHERE dept = a.dept) from students a group by dept, name order by dept, name This is a somewhat questionable query, since you get duplicate copies of the department counts. It would be cleaner to fetch the student list and the department counts as separate results. Of course, there may be pragmatic reasons to go the other way, so this isn't an absolute rule.
