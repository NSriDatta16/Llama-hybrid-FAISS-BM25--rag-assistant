I assume you'd like to see code like: SomeField=28; someField++; somefield++; SOMEFIELD++; compiled as if SomeField in any casing variation is the same variable. Personally, I think it's a bad idea. It encourages laziness and/or carelessness. Why bother properly casing the thing when it doesn't matter anyway? Well, while we're at it, maybe the compiler should allow misspellings, like SoemField++ ?
