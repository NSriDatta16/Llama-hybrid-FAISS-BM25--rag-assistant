What's the idiomatic way of parsing text by using ifstream?

I'm trying to parse a text file to find a pattern then grab a substring. This code fragment works fine, however can I improve this? Can I minimize copying here? I.e. I get a line and store it in the buf then construct a string, can this copying be eliminated? In short what's the idiomatic way of achieving this? std::ifstream f("/file/on/disk"); while (!f.eof()) { char buf[256]; f.getline(buf, sizeof(buf)); std::string str(buf); if (str.find(pattern) != std::string::npos) { // further processing, then break out of the while loop and return. } }
