It would be helpful if you described your dataset more. Gene expression datasets seem to often have very high dimensionality and Lasso regularized logistic regression is a popular method to approach this problem. This paper takes it a little further and might help you out: http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-198 Random forest can generally certainly provide a meaningful importance ranking, but it also depends on what your dataset looks like. mRMR sounds like it is specifically designed for identifying gene characteristics, so definitely give it a try. There's also Principle Component Analysis which is also used for gene expression data. Lots of options, but your questions is not detailed enough to go any further, and providing code as a solution at this point isn't realistic. The documentation for Python scikit-learn has many good explanations and examples.
