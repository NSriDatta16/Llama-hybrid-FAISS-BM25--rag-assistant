One application of PCA that I have used a few times is the construction of social indicators. We use the projection of each observation (usually households) over a component axis (usually the first), and use it as an indicator for public policy. This is possible because the surveys that we use are designed to capture that information. You can look online for "quality of life questionnaires". Another thing to take into account is that PCA may not be the best method in many applications, but is used for "backward compatibility". If you change the method, you will be unable to compare with past measurements. And the result will not be useful for building public policy. see: http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.statistics.20221203.03.html
