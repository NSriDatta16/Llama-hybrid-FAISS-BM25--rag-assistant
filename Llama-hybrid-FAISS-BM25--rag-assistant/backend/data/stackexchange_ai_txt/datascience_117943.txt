If you don't have training data, "classification" may not be the best name. But it could be if you consider this task as like in zero-shot learning. There are some pretrained models in huggingface for that. You may have to fine tune them with training data to get some actual reliability. An alternative idea would be to use pre-trained embeddings to calculate vectors for your input and for the tags that you expect to identify. Then you could compute the similarity between the input vector and the tag vectors, and use the similarities to suggest possibly relevant tags.
