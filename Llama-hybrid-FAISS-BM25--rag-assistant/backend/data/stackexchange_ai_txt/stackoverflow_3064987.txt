AHEAD is a methodology for doing feature-oriented programming, and there is a java composer. There is also a Eclipse IDE for doing fop applications. You can even choose AHEAD composer (java) or featurec++ for c++. All these are implemented as source-to-source compilers http://wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/iti_db/research/featureide/ the meaning of this approach is that you implement features as layers, each layer is exactly one feature. So in this layer you keep code that refines some of the code in lower layers (layers/features are ordered) and you also encode how the feature interacts with other features. In a layer there might be refinements to multiple classes (exactly what you would do if you had to add a certain feature to your existing program), but with FOP you don't really lose the previous version. The idea is that if you disable a certain feature from a given build, that means that the code that interacts with that feature is not injected but the rest of the features remain unaltered. Think of it as an additional dimension of polymorphism and how you organize functionality
