not working in firefox and chrome

break line tag is not working in firefox, neither in chrome. When i see the source of my page i get: Zugang zu Testaccount: peter petrelli sein Standardpwd. peter.heroes.com However when i do view selected source, i get: Zugang zu Testaccount: peter petrelli sein Standardpwd. peter.heroes.com It seems firefox is filtering break line tags out. It works in IE7 fine.
