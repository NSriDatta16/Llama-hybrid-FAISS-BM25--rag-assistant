Yep, possible. Your "backwards" null hypothesis is the one-sample version of a test for equivalence. Take a look at the hypothesis $H_0: \: \theta_1 \neq \theta_2$ and how it is often handled with the two one-sided t test (TOST). Pay close attention to how p-values and type I errors are calculated.
