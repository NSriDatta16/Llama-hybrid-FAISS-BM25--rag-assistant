Enabling/Disabling controls according to license type

I have a .NET 2.0, application with several types of Controls (Check boxes, Buttons, etc), that I need to Enable or Disable them according the kind of License that the user bought. I wonder if there is a way to support this as an Aspect, like using Injection or a Proxy that can intercept the call to Enable or other Properties of the Control, and the desired logic can be added there. If it matters, I use Infragistics controls. Any other thoughts about this issue? Other approachs/patterns? Thanks
