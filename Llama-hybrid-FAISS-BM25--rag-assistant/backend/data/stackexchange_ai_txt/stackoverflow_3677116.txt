It's probably simpler in awk, but how can I say this in Python?

I have: Rutsch is for rutterman ramping his roe which is a phrase from Finnegans Wake. The epic riddle book is full of leitmotives like this, such as 'take off that white hat,' and 'tip,' all which get mutated into similar sounding words depending on where you are in the book itself. All I want is a way to find obvious occurrences of this particular leitmotif, IE [word1] is for [word2] [word-part1]ing his [word3]
