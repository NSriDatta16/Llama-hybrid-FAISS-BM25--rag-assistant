FTP **TO** Rails app hosted on Heroku?

Pardon the whacky question, but is there anyway to have my Rails app receive a FTP transmission? I have daily FTP upload that I have no control over, which uploads several hundred HTML pages to our existing server each day. I want to move this site to a Rails-only deployment on Heroku, but I can't touch this FTP upload (which still needs to happen). Since Heroku doesn't offer public storage space or FTP, I can't upload the files directly to Heroku (and I don't really want to). What I would love is to point the FTP upload to my Rails app, and have my Rails app receive and parse the HTML files to pull out the information I need, store it in the database, and do whatever else I need to do with it. (Kinda like a RESTful action, but via FTP instead of any of the standard REST verbs). Is this at all possible or am I barking mad for thinking it? If it is possible, how would I go about doing this?
