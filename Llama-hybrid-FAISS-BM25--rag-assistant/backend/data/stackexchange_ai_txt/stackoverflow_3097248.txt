What software is sending User-Agent "Test Certificate Info"?

Google is surprisingly mute on this issue. In my company's web software error logs, we're seeing multiple individuals with an Apache access log entry that has this in it: ... HTTP/1.1" 500 - "-" "Test Certificate Info" I have no clue what piece of software this comes from or why it's sending us requests with malformed URLs... but it'd be nice to find out... and perhaps to correct it if it's open source software. :) (This might be a ServerFault question, but I'm a developer so I figured I'd ask here first.)
