Magento - How to set minimum amount of products per order for a category?

Is it possible to set the minimum number of products required for a category per order in Magento. A client sells wildlife paintings, one of the shop categories is 'cards', it isn't very cost effective to ship less than 6 of these at a time. How would I force a minimum of 6 products from the cards category? Thanks, Dan
