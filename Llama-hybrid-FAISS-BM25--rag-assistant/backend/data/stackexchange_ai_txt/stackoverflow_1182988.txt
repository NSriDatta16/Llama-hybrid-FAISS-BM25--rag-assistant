Mozilla canvas adding floating text

In my canvas element,i want to add a draggable text over an image.User should able to move it within the canvas area.I could add text by using some API functions, but i have no idea of movable text.Do i need to use DIV tag to contain text ?,But the problem is, finally i need to save the canvas as an image file, so ordinary DIV tag over canvas will not be saved. I would really like to hear your comments.
