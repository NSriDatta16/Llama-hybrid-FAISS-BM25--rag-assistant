If there is only one categorical variable as predictor in the regression model, is the predicted outcome always same as the average of the level?

I have read somewhere that it is acceptable to have only one categorical variable as a predictor in the regression model. From my understanding, does it mean that the predicted outcome using this regression model will be always the same as the average of that level? If so, does it mean that the R squared value and p value of this model are not informative?
