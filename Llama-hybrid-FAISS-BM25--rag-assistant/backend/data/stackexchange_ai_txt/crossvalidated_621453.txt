How can be decoder of VAE represent probability distribution p(x|z) eventhough we directly get image as output

How can be decoder of VAE represent probability distribution p(x|z) eventhough we directly get image as output. Also if my current understanding is right than we get same image for same value of z sampled by at bottleneck of VAE than how is decoder probabilistic.
