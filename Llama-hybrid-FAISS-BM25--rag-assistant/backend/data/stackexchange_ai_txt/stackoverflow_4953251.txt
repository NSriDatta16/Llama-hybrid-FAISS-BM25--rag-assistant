The problem I found when I was doing something similar (horizontal dragable timeline) was that every item was wrapped in a ContentPresenter before it was placed on the canvas which prevented the thumb from working. Its OK if you want a readonly display, but if you want to drag it becomes a problem. The solution was to override the GetContainerForItemOverride() method. I have included my control template, styles and the XAML for the Timeline itself. This link really helped me. How to change the default item container for ItemsControl? public class Timeline : ItemsControl { protected override System.Windows.DependencyObject GetContainerForItemOverride() { return new ContentControl(); } protected override void PrepareContainerForItemOverride(System.Windows.DependencyObject element, object item) { var control = element as Control; if (control != null) { var myUri = new Uri("/ResourceDictionary.xaml", UriKind.Relative); var dictionary = Application.LoadComponent(myUri) as ResourceDictionary; if (dictionary != null) { control.Template = (ControlTemplate)dictionary["TimelineElementTemplate"]; } control.DataContext = item; } base.PrepareContainerForItemOverride(element, item); } }
