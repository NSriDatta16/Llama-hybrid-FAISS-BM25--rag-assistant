Neural Network simulator in FPGA?

To learn FPGA programming, I plan to code up a simple Neural Network in FPGA (since it's massively parallel; it's one of the few things where an FPGA implementation might have a chance of being faster than a CPU implementation). Though I'm familiar with C programming (10+ years). I'm not so sure with FPGA development stuff. Can you provide a guided list of what I should do / learn / buy? Thanks!
