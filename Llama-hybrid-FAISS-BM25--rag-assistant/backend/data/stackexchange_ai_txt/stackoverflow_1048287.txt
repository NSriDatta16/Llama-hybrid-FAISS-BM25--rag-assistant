Is basicHttpBinding really required when exposing a WCF service as a Web Service for .NET 2.0 Target Client?

I have a WCF service and am hosting it in a Windows Service. I tried to add a reference for the service from a Windows Form client built on .NET 2.0. I could get the Web Reference by pointing to the httpGetUrl="http://localhost:8002/HBAccess/help/mex" but when I check the Reference.cs---It only contains a namespace with nothing in it. Now I add the basicHttpBinding and repeat the same steps: And now I can see the classes for the web service. My senior colleague insist that setting the httpGetEnabled to true would be sufficient to export the WCF service via http and make a proper web reference. Could anyone point me to what I am missing here? --> // Resulting Reference.cs (Empty proxy stub with only namespace) #pragma warning disable 1591 namespace Form.ServiceClient { } #pragma warning restore 1591
