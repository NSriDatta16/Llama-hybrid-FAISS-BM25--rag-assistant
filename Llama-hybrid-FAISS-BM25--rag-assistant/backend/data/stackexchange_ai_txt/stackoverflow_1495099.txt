SplObjectStorage $s = new SplObjectStorage(); $s->attach($some_object); $s->attach($some_other_object); Note that you can also use arrays, the keys are unique and reassigning a new value to existing key overwrites the new one. But with arrays you have come up with your own ID-s, with SplObjectStorage you don't. Array example $a = array(); $a['key1'] = $some_object; $a['key1'] = $some_other_object; In the above example only 'key1' is kept.
