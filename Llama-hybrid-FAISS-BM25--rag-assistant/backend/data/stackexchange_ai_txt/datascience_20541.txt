What is deconvolution operation used in Fully Convolutional Neural Networks?

When I was reading this this paper, Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation , I found that they use an up-sampling layer to classify each pixel in to a class. I have two questions: How do you understand the mathematics behind the de-convolution operation? Why do we use an upsampling layer? Is it for extract more global context?
