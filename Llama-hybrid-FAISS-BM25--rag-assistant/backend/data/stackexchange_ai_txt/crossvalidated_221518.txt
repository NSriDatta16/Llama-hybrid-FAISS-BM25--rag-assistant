Covariance Matrix for Time Series

I'm trying to investigate how events affect the stock market through econo-physics and I came across a paper that uses the co-variance matrix. What I don't understand is how such a matrix can be formed with one time series. The paper says: We study here the behaviour of the first three eigenvalues (λ1, λ2, λ3) and their ratio [(λ1/λ2), (λ1/λ3), (λ2/λ3)] of the co-variance matrices of the original return series and of those rebuilt from wavelet components for emerging and mature markets. How can I replicate this if I'm looking at a series like the DJIA? cov(ts) simply returns a single value. EDIT: The link to the paper provided in the question is not working anymore. It seems the author was referring to the paper Sharkasi, Adel and Crane, Martin and Ruskin, Heather J. and Matos, Jose A. (2006) The reaction of stock markets to crashes: a comparison study between emerging and mature markets using wavelet transforms. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 368 (2). pp. 511-521. ISSN 0378-4371 . I found another working link here
