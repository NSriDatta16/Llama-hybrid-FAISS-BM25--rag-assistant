Including/Organzing HTML in large javascript project

I've a got a fairly large web app, with several mini applets on each page. These applets are almost always identical jquery apps. I am looking for advice on how I should organize/include smaller parts of these jquery apps within my larger project. For example, each app has several independent tabs. If possible, I would like to store each of the tabs as a seperate .html file because this makes development easier. My requirements are: 1) All of the html 'tabs' are loaded on the clients end when the page loads. I would like to avoid any delays by dynamically requesting the tab html. 2) If possible, I would like to minimize the raw data sent. For example, it would be preferable to send each tab 1 time, instead of sending each tab 10 times if there are ten applets on that page. Questions: 1) What are my options for 'including' the HTML files / javascript code 2) Any tips for keeping my development simple in this situation? Surely there has to be a better way than just editing one massive html file when working with large pages.
