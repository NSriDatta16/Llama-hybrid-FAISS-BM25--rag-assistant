I've been facing a similar problem -- I've got a dataset in which I knew from the start that I wanted to include all variables (I was interested in the coefficients more than the prediction), but I didn't know a priori what interactions should be specified. My approach was to write out a set of candidate models, perform multiple imputations, estimate the multiple models, and simply save and average the AIC's from each model. The model specification with the lowest average-of-AIC's was selected. I thought about adding a correction wherein I penalize between-imputation variance in AIC. On reflection however, this seemed pointless. The approach seemed straightforward enough to me, but I invented it myself, and I'm no celebrated statistician. Before using it, you may wish to wait until people either correct me (which would be welcome!) or upvote this answer.
