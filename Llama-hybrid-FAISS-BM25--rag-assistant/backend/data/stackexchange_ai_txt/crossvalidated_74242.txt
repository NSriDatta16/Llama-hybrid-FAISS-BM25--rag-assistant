Converting 2nd order Markov chain to the 1st order equivalent

Given a 2nd order Markov chain where each state takes values in the set $\mathcal{X}=\{A,C,G,T\}$, such that all transition probabilities $p(x_t|x_{t-1},x_{t-2})$ are larger than zero, How to convert it to the equivalent 1st order one with all the transition probabilities defined?
