Multiple Items Same Shipping Consignment in Magento

Say I have products 1, 2 and 3. They can all be sent in the same consignment, but with a maximum of 5 per consignment. How do I set it up so that the checkout recognizes this and only applies the shipping once to all of them (max 5)? For example: One consignment can have 5 items but only from a specific manufacturer. So the shipping cost for 1 item is the same as the cost for 5 items. But 6 items will need to be sent in two consignments so the price is doubled. 1-5 items, Â£10.00 6-11 items, 20.00 ..
