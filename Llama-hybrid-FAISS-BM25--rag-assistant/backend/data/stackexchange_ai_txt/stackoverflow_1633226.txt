Video is a series of frames, played at a frame rate. That said, there are some rules about the order of what frames can be decoded. Essentially, you have reference frames (called I-Frames) and you have modification frames (class P-Frames and B-Frames)... It is generally true that a properly configured decoder will be able to join a stream on any I-Frame (that is, start decoding), but not on P and B frames... So, when the user drags the slider, you're going to need to find the closest I frame and decode that... This may of course be hidden under the hood of Flash for you, but that is what it will be doing...
