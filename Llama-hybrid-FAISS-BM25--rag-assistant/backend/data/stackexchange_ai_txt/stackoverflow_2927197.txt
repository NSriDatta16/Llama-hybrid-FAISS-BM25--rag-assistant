Magento Installation stuck at configuration

I am not sure what is going wrong when I am trying to install magento to my local ubuntu machine. I did all the steps mentionsed in the magento wiki . Everything goes well until I reach the point where I am here which is the magento config page. When I try and continue after entering the necessary details like host, database name and user name and submit it comes back to the same page. I checked for everything like db in my phomyadmin panel and it still gets stuck there. What is the possible reason for that. Thanks
