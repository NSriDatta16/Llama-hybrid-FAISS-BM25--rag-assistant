Since the Increase is performed on an IsolatedStorage File , only your application (or others hosted in your domain) can use the new quota: Since isolated stores are scoped to particular assemblies, most other managed code will not be able to access your code's data (highly trusted managed code and administration tools can access stores from other assemblies). Unmanaged code can access any isolated stores. Also, it seems that once you increase, you cannot go back (programmatically): An application shares its quota with all other applications that are hosted on the same domain (Web site). The initial quota is 1 MB to be shared by all of the domain's applications. The new quota size must not be less than the current quota. Only quota increases are allowed. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.isolatedstorage.isolatedstoragefile.increasequotato%28v=VS.95%29.aspx
