To get it to work properly, there is a LOT of stuff to do. -insertNewObject:... is by far the easiest way, weird or not. The documentation says: A managed object differs from other objects in three main waysâ€”a managed object ... Exists in an environment defined by its managed object context ... there is therefore a lot of work to do to create a new managed object and properly integrate it into the Core Data infrastructure ... you are discouraged from overriding initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: That said, you can still do it (read further down the page to which I linked) but your goal appears to be "easier" or "less weird". I'd say the method you feel is weird is actually the simplest, most normal way.
