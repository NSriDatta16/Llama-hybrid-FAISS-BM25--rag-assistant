Analyze performance Poisson regression model on a time series(count forecasting)

I have tried to build a model to forecast the count of a particular variable.The model that was used for the purpose was poisson .Unfortunately ,i don't have enough stat knowledge to analyze the model performance .If somebody can provide some insights as of how the model is performing,as well as some tweaks to improve the model performance will be greatly helpful. I am also willing to try out other models if it performs better. I am using python with the statmodels package to build the model. Attaching a graph which shows the fitted and the actual values( Green shows the actual values and Blue shows the fitted values) Also,providing the summary() output of the model Generalized Linear Model Regression Results ============================================================================== Dep. Variable: Work_Item_Type No. Observations: 581 Model: GLM Df Residuals: 574 Model Family: Poisson Df Model: 6 Link Function: log Scale: 1.0 Method: IRLS Log-Likelihood: -16752.

Day of week Week of Month Week Time Delta (Starts from 0 increment by one until end) Month of Year Also,i haven't done any kind of transformation on the variables.
