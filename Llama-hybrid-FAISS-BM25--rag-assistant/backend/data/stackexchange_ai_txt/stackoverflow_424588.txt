How do you structure css files for a web project?

In my project I have put all my css classes in the style sheets. The structure I am following was Have a global.css file, which will have all the global styles. And then for each .aspx page one style sheet which will be particular for that file. Although I am talking about the asp.net this should not make any difference to any other web development environment, I guess. Is this way of structuring the css files OK ? How do others arrange their css files, and why ? Thanks. Related Question What's the best way to organize CSS Rules
