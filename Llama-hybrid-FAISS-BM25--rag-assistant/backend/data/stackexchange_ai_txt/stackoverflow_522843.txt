Footnotes are filled in the available space just like any other paragraph: you just write \footnote{ a whole lot of text that goes on and on and on and... ... and may consists of multiple sentences. But after a while ... it finally comes to a stop. } That is not your problem. Looking at the error message (which I don't recognize from personal experience), I'd say your problem is character set or font related. Is you editor using unicode?
