Ridge was originally designed for correlated variables, and that's where it's best. Consider examinations to determine a degree. ( Which supposedly is measuring ability) Which do you think is more reliable: taking the average of all the exams or picking a single exam most correlated with ability (if there is one)? Averaging over the different exams removes (independent noise - you didn't sleep well one day etc) Ridge will take the average of these correlated inputs (IE the separate exams), whilst lasso will just select one.
