First of all, think of the following question. In practice, how will you execute your model to predict new observations ? Predict $A$ and use the resulting prediction $\hat{A}$ it to predict $B$ (or the other way round) ? Predict $A$ and $B$ simultaneously ? In the first case, keep in mind that $\hat{A}$ is predicted using your other features. Let them be $(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$. Actually, $\hat{A} = f(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$, so using it to predict $B$ is definitely possible. It is in fact doing some feature engineering, albeit using a machine learning technique, and you can use it both for $A$ and $B$. But keep in mind though, that you will be using $\hat{A}$, not $A$, to predict $B$. Hence, it becomes more advisable to predict $\hat{A}$ in your training dataset rather than $A$ and use it during training. In the second case, you will simply not be able to use $A$ or $B$. You should definitively consider using multi target regression. I suggest you have a look on this post .
