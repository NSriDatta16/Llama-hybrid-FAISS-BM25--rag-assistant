Problems trying to use Visual Studio 2010 and AJAX extensions

Why can I not add ScriptManager control or UpdatePanel to a page in Visual Studio 2010? The drag( or double click) just fails - it seems like there is an incompatibility somewhere? UPDATE: This is 'default' install of 2010 Ultimate on Windows7, create a web application, cannot drag ScriptManager or UpdatePanel to the designer. Typing the declarations works. The cursor changes to the [+] icon when you drag it to the right place but nothing appears to happens on 'drop', briefly the documents name has * appended, this quickly changes back to normal, either is saves or does an undo. I'm assuming something is going wrong so it undos...but what is going wrong?
