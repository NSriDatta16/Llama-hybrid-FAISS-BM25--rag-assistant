Do you know when does the new pattern start? You could reset the hidden state of the RNN each time this happens during training. A more detailed explanation in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04148.pdf In that paper, they try to predict the next item in a user's session. They use a GRU to create a user-level representation (which in your case could be the pattern representation) and another GRU to predict the next item based on the current session information. To do that, they reset the hidden state of the second GRU every time the session changes and reset the hidden state of the first GRU every time the user changes, and I think you could reset the hidden state every time the pattern changes. It is difficult to explain it all right here, I recommend you to read the paper I mentioned before. EDIT: To know where are the pattern change points you could train another network, maybe using as labels points where your GRU's accuracy decreases substantially, and then use this network's predictions to reset the hidden state on these points at training time as I mentioned before.
