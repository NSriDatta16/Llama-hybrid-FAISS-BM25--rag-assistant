I have configured it as follows: class_weights = {0: weight_1_for_0 , 1: weight_1_for_1,2: weight_2_for_0 , 3: weight_2_for_1} This is for a neural network with two output neurons and it seems to be functioning correctly, but I am not entirely certain that the weights are being applied correctly in TensorFlow 2.11. Here is a portion of the code: weighted_history = weighted_model.fit( train_features, train_labels, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, epochs=EPOCHS, callbacks=[early_stopping], validation_data=(val_features, val_labels), # The class weights go here class_weight=class_weights)```
