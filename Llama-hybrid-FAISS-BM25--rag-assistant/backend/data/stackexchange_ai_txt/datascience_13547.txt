My point of view as a general purpose programmer with a tiny bit of R experience: R is excellent for data science, but it's geared towards people manually interpreting data. If you want to use the results for something automated, you have to interface with something else, and that something else will be hard to do in a problem specific language like R. Can you do a web site in R? :) On the other hand, python does have ready made libraries for data sciency stuff and is a general purpose programming language that doesn't get in the way of your doing anything else with it. As for Java, it's good for large programming projects with hundreds of thousands to millions of lines of code. If the data science part needs to interface with that, it may make sense to do everything in Java then. Random whine: Why do I have to sign in to each StackExchange site separately?
