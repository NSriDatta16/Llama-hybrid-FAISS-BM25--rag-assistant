I have changed my mind since my comment. The only two places where there is ambiguity in my mind is if E is tied with F, G, and H, and if B is tied with A. I say no. I am going to talk in absolutes and say that we know something in the next paragraph. That avoids the awkwardness of always saying that we have evidence through some significant p-value. We know that F, G, and H are contenders for the top spot. We don't know if E is in that group. However, we know that D is not as as good as F, G, and H. Since we cannot find a significant difference between D and E, E should not be regarded as a contender for the top spot. Similarly, we know that A is a contender for the worst performance. We don't know about B. However, we know that C outperformed A. Since we do not have a difference between B and C, B should not be regarded as a contender for the bottom spot. Consequently, A is the lone group that can be said to have performed the worst, while further testing is needed to tell which is the best of F, G, and H, though these three are the top performers. Edit: Read the comments.
