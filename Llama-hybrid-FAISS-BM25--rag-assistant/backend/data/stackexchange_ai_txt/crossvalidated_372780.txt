It won't be solved in the usual way. Every time it gives -1 as a reward whether you are progressing or not. On the reward end, I did a small change that is if the position (observation[0]) of the car is greater than -0.2, I took the reward as 1. I took as 1 because -0.2 position is top of the hill which means our random actions giving somewhat fruitful results. This approach solved my problem. I solved this problem kind of traditional deep learning model implementation if you need more details then check my article once.
