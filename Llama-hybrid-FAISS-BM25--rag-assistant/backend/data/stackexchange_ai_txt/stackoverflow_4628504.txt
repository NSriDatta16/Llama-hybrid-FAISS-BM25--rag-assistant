Something along these lines might achieve what you want; it uses absolute positioning for the various pieces (a, c, e) but within a non-absolutely positioned div which you can repeat. The 'b' section is created using the '.main' div since it'll expand with the content of '.rightColumn'. I assumed as there was no content in there you'd be filling it with a colour or image, so put any image etc. for the 'b' piece in the styling for the '.main' div. HTML Your content here... CSS .main { /* Any 'b' piece styling goes in here. */ display: block; float: left; width: 640px; margin: 0; padding: 0 0 100px 0; /* Change 100px to whatever the height of your bottom caps are. */ position: relative; /* We can use relative positioning here. */ } .rightColumn { display: block; float: right; width: 540px; /* Change to whatever width piece '640px - width of a' is. */ margin: 0; padding: 0; } .leftColumnTopCap { position: absolute; /* The absolute position here relates to the 'main' div. */ top: 0; left: 0; width: 100px; /* Change to whatever width piece 'a' is. */ height: 100px; /* Change to whatever height piece 'a' is. */ } .leftColumnBottomCap { position: absolute; /* The absolute position here relates to the 'main' div. */ bottom: 0; left: 0; width: 100px; /* Change to whatever width piece 'c' is. */ height: 100px; /* Change to whatever height piece 'c' is. */ } .rightColumnBottomCap { position: absolute; /* The absolute position here relates to the 'main' div. */ bottom: 0; right: 0; width: 540px; /* Change to whatever width piece '640px - width of a' is. */ height: 540px; /* Change to whatever height piece '640px - width of a' is. */ } Hope that helps.
