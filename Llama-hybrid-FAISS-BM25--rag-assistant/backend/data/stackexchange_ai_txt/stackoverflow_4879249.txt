Disadvantages to creating/removing many hard links?

I need to create hundreds to thousands of temporary hard or symbolic links that will be deleted shortly after creation. For my purposes both types of links will work (i.e. the target is not a directory and it always exists on the same file system) As I understand it, symbolic links create a small file that contains the path to the original file. Whereas a hardlink creates a reference to the data in the same inode. So maybe if I am going to be creating/deleting thousands of these links is it better to be creating and deleting thousands of tiny files (symlinks) or thousands of these references (hardlinks)? It seems like one taxes the hard drive (maybe fragmentation) while the other might tax the file system itself? Where are inode references stored. Do I risk corrupting the file system by making so many hard links? What about speed? Thanks for your expertise! This a work around to be able to use ffmpeg to encode a movie out of an arbitrary subset of images from a directory. Since ffmpeg requires that the files be named properly (e.g. frame%04d.jpg) I realized I can just create hard/sym links to the subset of files and just name the links appropriately. This avoids renaming the original files and having to actually copy the data. It works great but it requires creating and deleting many thousands of links, repeatedly. Sort of addresses this problem too I believe: convert image sequence using ffmpeg
