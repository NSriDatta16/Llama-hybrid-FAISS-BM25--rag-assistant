Looking for MemberShip.GetAllUsers(startDate,endDate) functionality

I'm creating a user approval interface leveraging the .Net Membership class. I have a page that does a Membership.GetAllUsers(), and I spit the results to a datagrid. I filter them by MembershipUser.IsApproved. My Issue is due to slowness I'm hitting while I GetAllUsers(). Since I don't need to pull down all of the users, but rather, say, all of the users with a CreateDate falling within a certain range, I'm wondering if there's a way to grab a subset based on date-range? Wanted to Update for those in a similar situation: UPDATE: So, I ended up actually not using the answer below.. Although, it does address the specific question properly. Anyhow, my real problem was, grabbing a subset of Users (i.e. those requiring "approval" - Since my Admin holds control of this (not the users)). My solution was to assign newly signedup users to an "awaitingapproval" role, then I was able to grab Roles.UsersInRole("awaitingapproval"), display those to the Admin with the ability to "approve" a user. Each approved user is then dropped from "awaitingapproval" and assigned to a new role.
