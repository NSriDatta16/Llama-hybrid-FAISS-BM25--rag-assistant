Can I present My Loginwidow before MAC Login Window

I am trying to put my own customised login window before the standard MAC OS X Login window. Acutally , I need to have a stacking / chaining of window, so that original MAC Login window presented after my customised login window. I have already tried prelogin agent, but that do not fullfill my requirement , because i want my window to be launched before MAC login window not parallet to MAC Login window. Thanks for help in advance. Meet B.
