What is the loss function for C - Support Vector Classification?

In article LIBSVM: A Library for Support Vector Machines it is written that C-SVC uses the loss function $$ \frac{1}{2}w^Tw+C\sum\limits_{i=1}^l\xi_i$$ I know what is $w^Tw$ . But what is $\xi_i$ ? I know that it is somehow connected with misclassifications, but how it is calculated exactly? P.S. I don't use any non-linear kernels.
