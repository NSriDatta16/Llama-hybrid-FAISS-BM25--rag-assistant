Probably only hardcore GPU geeks like me have heard about it. Tidepowerd -- dead link has made GPGPU possible for CIL-based languages (such as F#, C#, VB.NET, whatever). On the other hand you can do the same for sole F# language with a Quotation-to-GPU runtime/API (looking forward to see someone implement that). This is something Agent Smith has bloged about or that is also mentioned in F# expert 1.0 book (Language Oriented Programming chapter) AFAIK. Agent Smith (ok, sorry for that) is speaking about NVIDIA Cg. But you can do same using HLSL DirectCompute shaders or OpenCL C99.. PTX (low level NVIDIA IL), CAL-IL (low level AMD/ATI IL)...
