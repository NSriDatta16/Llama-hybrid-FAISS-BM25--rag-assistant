Variation explained in ordinal logistic regression models

I have made these three ordinal logistic regression models: model1 To figure out if the models are a good fit to the data, I calculated the proportion of variation explained like this: model_null Questions: Why doesn't summary give null deviance? Have I calculated the proportion of variation explained correctly? Am I right in saying model1 and model3 explain little variation in carb , but model2 explains 25% of the variation in carb ?
