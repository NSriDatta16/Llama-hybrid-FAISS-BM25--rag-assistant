Different Array notations The notation String args[] is just a convenience for C programmers, but it's identical to this notation: String[] args Here's what the Sun Java Tutorial says: You can also place the square brackets after the array's name: float anArrayOfFloats[]; // this form is discouraged However, convention discourages this form; the brackets identify the array type and should appear with the type designation. Reference: Java Tutorial > Arrays VarArgs BTW, a lesser known fact is that main methods also support varargs, so this is also okay: public static void main(String ... args) { } The reason is that a varargs method is internally identical to a method that supports a single array parameter of the specified type.E.g. this won't compile: public static void main(final String... parameters){} public static void main(final String[] parameters){} // compiler error: Duplicate method main(String[]) Reference: Java Tutorial > Arbitrary Number of Arguments
