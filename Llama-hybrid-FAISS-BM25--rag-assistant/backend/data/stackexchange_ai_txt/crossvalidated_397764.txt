In some cases, the Gaussian assumption can be justified by the central limit theorem. For instance, if the data consist of averages of heights of students in each school, we can treat each average follows a Gaussian distribution. In general, the Gaussian assumption can be too restrictive so people tend to use the sub-Gaussian assumption which includes all distributions with fast-decaying tails including Gaussians, all bounded distributions and so on. In this case, you cannot use the maximum likelihood estimation since we do not specify any density function. But still we can prove many commonly used estimators such as sample mean, median, quantiles behave in some optimal manner.
