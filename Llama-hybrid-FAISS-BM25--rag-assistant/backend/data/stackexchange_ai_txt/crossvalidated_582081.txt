How can I find the posterior distribution for gammadistributed data and prior?

I'm working on a project where I believe Bayesian statistics should be useful. However, my knowledge about bayesian statistics are very scarce. Suppose I got data following a Gammadistribution with a known shape-parameters of $\alpha = 11.26$ and the estimated parameters for the prior are, $a=1.08$ and $b=13.7$ (a being shape and b being rate). For the prior I got a gammadistribution: $$ f(\theta) = \frac{b^{a}}{Γ(a)} \theta^{a-1} exp(-b\theta) $$ And the likelihood: $$ L(x|\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{Γ(\alpha)}\theta^{\alpha}exp(-\theta x_i) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha n}}{Γ(\alpha)}\theta^{\alpha n}exp(-\theta \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i) $$ Thus the posterior is: $$ f(\theta|x) ∝ \theta^{a-1} exp(-b\theta) * \theta^{\alpha}exp(-\theta \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i) = \theta^{a+\alpha n - 1}exp(-\theta(b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i) $$ This will then be a $Ga(a+\alpha n, b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)$ am I right? However, when I plug in the values for $(a+\alpha n, b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)$ , I get a distribution that is not possible/true. The posterior distribution will be $Ga(1250.94, 17.39)$ ,the plotted distribution moves very far away from both the data and prior, the distribution should be closer to the data rather than be further away? Is the posterior parameters not the distribution or have I missunderstod something? Or is it possible that it's not at all a probability density function I'm plotting?
