Bootstrapping for imbalanced and small sample sized data

I have a logistic regression model (relogit to be precise) with small sample sizes in the target group (~5%). So far I'm cautiously optimistic with my model and I would like to thoroughly test it. I'm using R and I've so far looked at cross-validation with the caret package. The train-function from caret compares the target values with the output of the model as categorical (i.e. rounded to 0 or 1) value. Since the respons variable of the model is always total number of cases in the target group given a population of test-cases. So far I have manually created train and testset. On the testset, I have simply summed up the predicted probabilities, which gave me the desired total number. I did some more research and found out that people call this a bootstrapping approach. So I've tried the following with the boot-Package: require(data.table) set.seed(546) # for reproducibility options(scipen=999) generate some data that looks like mine (including a column with the forecasted values from my model): BootData This function would give me this result performed on the entire data: bootfun(BootData) mycols summe N 1: realval 51 1000 2: forecast 50.47873 1000 Is it possible to wrap this into a bootstrap? Here is what I've tried: require(boot) bootStrap Error in t.star[r, ]
