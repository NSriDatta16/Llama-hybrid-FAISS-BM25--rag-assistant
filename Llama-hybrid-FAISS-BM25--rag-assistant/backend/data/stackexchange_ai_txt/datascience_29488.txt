Whats an explanation of PCA that is intuitive for someone in senior leadership who doesn't have a technical background?

I've been pulled onto my first Data Science project at work. Classic problem of predicting sales based on web traffic data, etc. While I don't know about the specific techniques I will be using in my model, I think that PCA will probably be tried at some point, and if I use it successfully as a preprocessing step before I chug the data into some estimator, I'm thinking about how I might go about defending/explaining my work. My question is, what is an intuitive explanation for PCA that doesn't rely heavily on the linear algebra that makes up the process? Perhaps an analogy that draws a parallel to something that any layman can readily understand?
