i'm not sure how to go about replacing newline characters with " ". Is there an easy wat to do that? You can do that with Java regex: String raw = "..."; Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\n"); String html = " " + p.matcher(raw).replaceAll(" ") + " " ; I have taken the liberty of adding your HTML wrapper in for you. edit: For the fun of it, I've taken Oscar's point and took a stab: Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\\[([^\\]]*)\\]"); raw = p.matcher(raw).replaceAll(" $1 ");
