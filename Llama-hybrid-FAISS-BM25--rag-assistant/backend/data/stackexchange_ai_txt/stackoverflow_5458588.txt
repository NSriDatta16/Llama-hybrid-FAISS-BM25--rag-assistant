Create Recurring Payment profile failed

Hi All I am implementing recurring payments with paypal. My paypal script is already running now embedding recurring payments in it. I have searched a lot and not find any useful material. I found from Recurring some material. I implemnted the code of createrecurringpayments.php from here and changed the variables accorinding to mine. I redirect browser to this file from DoExpressCheckoutPayment.php when transaction is completed. But at createrecurringpayment.php I always get the following error. CreateRecurringPaymentsProfile failed: Array ( [TIMESTAMP] => 2011%2d03%2d28T11%3a44%3a30Z [CORRELATIONID] => 81d0c488123c4 [ACK] => Failure [VERSION] => 54%2e0 [BUILD] => 1776465 [L_ERRORCODE0] => 10002 [L_SHORTMESSAGE0] => Security%20error [L_LONGMESSAGE0] => Security%20header%20is%20not%20valid [L_SEVERITYCODE0] => Error ) .
