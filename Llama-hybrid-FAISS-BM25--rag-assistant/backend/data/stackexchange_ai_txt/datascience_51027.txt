How to train ML algorithm with multiple values in target data?

I am new to data science and machine learning and looking for some help. I am trying to train a machine with following data set: Here, L3 is the target variable. As it can be seen that the target variable contains a set of possible values, I am wondering how I can train the machine with such a data. In my test data, I might want to predict any of the one or more values given one value. Example test case : 20 c aa 'aa' is given value and I want to predict other values based on the values 20, c and 'aa'. Is it possible to do what I am trying to achieve? Thank you.
