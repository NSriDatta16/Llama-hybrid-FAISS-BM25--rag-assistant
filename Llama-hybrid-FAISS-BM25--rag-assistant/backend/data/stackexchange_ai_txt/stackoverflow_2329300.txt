Hibernate does have a JPA implementation but it can also be used standalone. It is possible to use Hibernate as the persistence provider in JavaEE. The JBoss application server for example uses Hibernate for its persistence. So if you are using Hibernate to provide the persistence in the app server, it may make sense. If you are using an app server that does not use Hibernate for the persistence, then it sounds like you might not need it. Hibernate does have some extensions and things that are not available in JPA. Many other persistence providers also have these extensions (like Toplink or Eclipselink). Check with your app server provide to see if they have the extensions you might need or something similar to what you might have used in Hibernate.
