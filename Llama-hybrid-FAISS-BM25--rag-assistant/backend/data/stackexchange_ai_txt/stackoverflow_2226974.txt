I want to create a table like an Excel sheet. The table has rows' headers and columns' headers. How to make the rows header move when the vertical scrollbar is dragged and statistic when the horizontal scrollbar is dragged and vice versa for the Columns header like in Excel sheet. Does anyone have any ideas how to do it? Thank you very much for your help
