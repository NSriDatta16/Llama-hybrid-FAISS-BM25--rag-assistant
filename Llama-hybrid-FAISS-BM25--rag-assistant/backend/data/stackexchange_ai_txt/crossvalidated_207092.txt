You can organize the data as a 2 by 6 contingency table. Descriptively you can present this table (absolute counts) and the proportion of "1" (relative counts) per group. Different proportions highlight treatment differences. If it makes sense to test the null hypothesis of equal group proportions, you can e.g. use a classic chi-squared test of association (which is similar to the likelihood ratio test of the logistic regression). Maybe you rather want to compare each of the five test groups against the control. Then you can go for five tests. Another strategy is to test each treatment against each other (again e.g. with chi-squared test). Anyway you will need a prespecified strategy to correct for multiple testing (or not), like Bonferroni-Holm. It really depends on the research question. Some example R code # input: prepare data and check contingency table set.seed(39) n In this data set, the proportions of "1" do not differ much across groups (always between 47% and 52%). No true group differences are detected at the 5% level.
