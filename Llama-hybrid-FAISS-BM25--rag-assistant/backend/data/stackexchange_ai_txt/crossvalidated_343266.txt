I don't think the answer differs for an applied econometrician versus any other practitioner using an ARMA model. Nor is there a genuine distinction between "theoretical advantages" and advantages "from the applied [insert-profession-here] point of view". The bottom line is that if a particular form of a model yields some "theoretical advantage" by allowing some use of relevant theory, then that theoretical advantage can be deployed by any applied practitioner using the model. (This is merely a broader recognition of the illusory dichotomy between theory and practice .) Advantage of the MA($\infty$) form: The main value of inverting to obtain an MA($\infty$) representation is that it gives the observable time-series variable as a sum of unobserved terms, without polluting the equation with auto-regressive terms. This is convenient because it allows you to obtain moments of the observable time-series variables, and possibly even its distribution (e.g., in the case of normal error terms). If you have your time-series in this form then you have: $$Y_t = \mu + \sum_{i=0}^\infty \theta_i \varepsilon_{t-i}.$$ With a standard white-noise error process $\{ \varepsilon_t \} ... \sim \text{IID N}(0, \sigma^2)$ the MA form immediately gives you the covariances between the observable values, which are: $$\mathbb{Cov}(Y_t, Y_{t+k}) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \theta_i \theta_{i+k}.$$ This also gives you correlation values between the observable values, which means that you have your auto-correlation function (ACF). The MA form makes the correlation structure of your time-series clear in a way that the initial ARMA form does not. By inverting the auro-regressive aspects of the ARMA model, the MA form allows you to see the combined effect of the auto-regressive part and the moving average part in determining the auto-correlation function for the series. The practical value of this for any applied practitioner is that it allows them to match the observed sample auto-correlation with an appropriate theoretical model of the ARMA form (which usually also involves inspection of partial auto-correlation plots and some formal estimation techniques). The theoretical advantage yields a practical advantage to the practitioner.
