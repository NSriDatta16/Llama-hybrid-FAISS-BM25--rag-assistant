Examples of misapplication of Bayes theorem

This Math Overflow community question asked for "examples of bad arguments which involve the application of mathematical theorems in non-mathematical contexts" and produced a fascinating list of pathologically applied mathematics. I am wondering about similar examples of pathological uses of Bayesian inference. Has anyone encountered academic articles, eccentric blog posts that use Bayesian methods in crankish ways.
