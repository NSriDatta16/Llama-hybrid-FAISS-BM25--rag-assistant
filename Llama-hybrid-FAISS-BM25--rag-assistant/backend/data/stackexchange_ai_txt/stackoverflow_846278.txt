#1 That's because of the default baseline alignment of inline images - the extra space you're seeing is reserved for descenders (letters that go below the baseline: g, p, q, y, etc.) in the text surrounding your images. (The fact that you have no text is irrelevant - space for them is still reserved.) You can get rid of it like this: img { /* Or a suitable class, etc. */ vertical-align: bottom; } #2 Newlines are whitespace, and get displayed as spaces. If you had HTML like this: This is a sentence in a paragraph. you'd expect the browser to put a space between "sentence" and "in", wouldn't you? elements are inline blocks, just like words in a paragraph.
