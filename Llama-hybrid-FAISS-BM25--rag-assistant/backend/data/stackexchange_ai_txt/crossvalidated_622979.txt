Multiple linear models and multiple comparison correction

I have run a PCA from which I have extracted 4 components. Each component will be used in a multilevel model as the outcome variable. The four model will have the exact same predictor variables, 4 predictors of interest and age and gender to adjust for. ID is a random factor. My question is how do I have to correct for multiple comparisons, is each model a comparison or would each variable within each model be a comparison (so 24 comparison in total)? I want to extract from each model the significant predictors for each PCA component but first i want to correct the p values I am just unsure of how any comparisons I have. The other possibility is 32 comparison I think.
