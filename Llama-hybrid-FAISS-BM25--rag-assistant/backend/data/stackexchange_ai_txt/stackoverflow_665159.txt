Our staff (about 40) used VSS to manage courseware development for the Air Force. We transitioned to SharePoint 2007 and Office 2007 last year and experienced a few problems, but none insurmountable. Mis-configured browsers and poor network performance had the most negative impact on user experience. Since everyone already had experience with the whole check-in/check-out process, it was mainly bringing people up to speed on how the process worked in SharePoint. Regardless of experience level, there's one simple pre-requisite: Training, training, training! That's the key to happy customers. Establish reasonable expectations and realistic schedules for implementation. Let them know what's coming and why, then train them properly on how to use the product. For our 300+ Air Force users (external customers), we started to see rapid growth in usage at the 6 month point. The key is to identify and involve early-adopters as technology advocates at all levels of the organization. Let them do the selling of benefits to their peers. Adoption will be slow at first, but pickup rapidly as word gets around. Get the system stable and let your customers become comfortable before your begin piling on the features. If your system or application is percieved to be unreliable or overly complex (training!) during the early phase of deployment, you may never achieve a critical mass of satisfied users.
