Actually, the spec encourages you to redundantly-transmit RTP Event packets, because of possible packet loss, and they suggest sending each 3 times at least. Check the start and end times in each duplicated event. If you need to extend the event (key still held down, longer than you want to encode in one event, etc), then you can extend it without ending it. This is also why the End packets are sent 3 times. (See section 3.6 of RFC 2833 ).
