Best way to implement request throttling in ASP.NET MVC?

We're experimenting with various ways to throttle user actions in a given time period : Limit question/answer posts Limit edits Limit feed retrievals For the time being, we're using the Cache to simply insert a record of user activity - if that record exists if/when the user does the same activity, we throttle. Using the Cache automatically gives us stale data cleaning and sliding activity windows of users, but how it will scale could be a problem. What are some other ways of ensuring that requests/user actions can be effectively throttled (emphasis on stability)?
