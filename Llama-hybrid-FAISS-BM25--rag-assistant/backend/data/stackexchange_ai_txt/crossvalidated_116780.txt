Stepwise backward regression may be commonly used, but that doesn't avoid the problems noted by @Alexis. If you can't trust the p -values, you won't be able to judge the statistical reliability of any variable's relation to outcome. And always be cautious about using results of multiple regression to conclude that a covariate is "independently" associated with outcome. Higher-quality clinical journals are now more frequently requiring better statistical analyses, often having a separate review by a statistician, a trend that is to be encouraged. The R package rms was designed for dealing with these types of regressions in statistically reliable ways. Frank Harrell, the author of the package, has a book "Regression Modeling Strategies" and resources available on-line to guide you through its use. It is true that the stepAIC function in the MASS package allows for simple stepwise selection, but please don't perpetuate the problems that come from publishing results of such un-validated, over-fit models in the clinical literature. Learning how to do it right from the beginning is preferable, even if you don't get your first (unreliable) "result" so quickly. (I am speaking here from less-than-pleasant personal experience.) Although you are not a statistician, if you are getting involved in clinical research you have to learn enough about statistics to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, and so that you can consult intelligently with professional statisticians as needed. As you are still in training, it's very appropriate to ask a statistician at your institution for guidance. Starting that learning now will have a high payoff later in your career.
