Interpreting zero-inflated Poisson regression

I fitted a zero-inflated Poisson regression with "group" (4 groups in total) as indepentdent variable and nchoice (frequency that a person choose a certain answer) as dependent variable. I got this output: Call: zeroinfl(formula = nchoice ~ group | group, data = data) Pearson residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.4080 -0.3979 -0.3717 -0.3198 3.3936 Count model coefficients (poisson with log link): Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.65243 0.18209 3.583 0.00034 *** group2 0.03735 0.28597 0.131 0.89609 group3 -0.18642 0.28758 -0.648 0.51684 group4 -0.38739 0.30063 -1.289 0.19754 Zero-inflation model coefficients (binomial with logit link): Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.2833 0.2689 4.772 1.83e-06 *** group2 0.5373 0.4125 1.303 0.193 group3 0.1184 0.4025 0.294 0.769 group4 -0.1389 0.4138 -0.336 0.737 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 Number of iterations in BFGS optimization: 14 Log-likelihood: -276.9 on 8 Df My questions are: Should I understand the count model (1st part of the model) as a Poisson regression when all cases with nchoice = 0 are excluded? -> The exp(Intercept) should show me the average value of nchoice in group 1 when all the cases with nchoice = 0 are "deleted". But it is not the case. the zero-inflation model (2nd part of the model) as a logistic regression when all cases with nchoice > 0 are recoded into 1 (nchoice as binary variable) -> The exp(Intercept) should show me the odds of having nchoice = 0 in group 1. But it is also not the case. I would be very thankful if you could show me how I can interpret the output.
