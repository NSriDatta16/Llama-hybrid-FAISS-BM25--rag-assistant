There is no official managed .NET wrapper for the virtual disk APIs. So you currently have three options: Run the dos command and scrape the console response, which you don't want to do as it is not a stable API. Use Microsoft.Storage.Vds.dll that was added in Server 2008. You can use .NET reflector to examine the API. However, this is also unofficial, in that it is undocumented and thus could change without warning in service packs, etc. Use the official C API . This is what I would recommend until an official managed wrapper class is released and documented. As noted above, the full API documentation has everything you need. I would recommend writing a simplified C wrapper dll around this API that does what you need and no more. Then, PInvoke your wrapper library.
