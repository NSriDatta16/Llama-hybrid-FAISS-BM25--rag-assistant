I think you're misinformed. http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/filesystem/File.html?filter_flex=4.1&filter_flashplayer=10.1&filter_air=2 The File class includes static properties that let you reference commonly used directory locations. These static properties include: * File.applicationStorageDirectoryâ€”a storage directory unique to each installed AIR application According to this, the applicationStorageDirectory is unique to each app; not unique to each user. Is your experience different?
