Given that std::string is itself a typedef, I think you are fine. I do it myself. Even Scott Meyers recommends typedef for ease of reading code in cases like yours. EDIT: Effective C++, Second Edition, Page 120, Item 28, fourth paragraph. "...provide typedefs that remove the need..." More Effective C++, 7th printing, Page 237, Item 31 First paragraph. More Effective C++, 7th printing, Page 238, Item 31 First paragraph after code sample. In essence, no worries. :-)
