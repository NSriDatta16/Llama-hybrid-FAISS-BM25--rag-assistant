What is an elegant way to solve this max and min problem in Ruby or Python?

The following can be done by step by step, somewhat clumsy way, but I wonder if there are elegant method to do it. There is a page: http://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Wii , where there are 2 tables... there is Mario - 6 2 2 3 - - Luigi 2 6 - - - - - Diddy Kong - - 3 - 3 - 5 [...] The name "Mario", etc are the Mario Kart Wii character names. The numbers are for bonus points for: Speed Weight Acceleration Handling Drift Off-Road Mini-Turbo and then there is table 2 Standard Bike S 39 21 51 51 54 43 48 Bullet Bike 53 24 32 35 67 29 67 Bubble Bike / Jet Bubble 48 27 40 40 45 35 37 [...] These are also the characteristics for the Bike or Kart. I wonder what's the most elegant solution for finding all the maximum combinations of Speed, Weight, Acceleration, etc, and also for the minimum, either by directly using the HTML on that page or copy and pasting the numbers into a text file. Actually, in that character table, Mario to Bower Jr are all medium characters, Baby Mario to Dry Bones are small characters, and the rest are all big characters, except the small, medium, or large Mii are just as what the name says. Small characters can only ride small bike or small kart, and so forth for medium and large. Update: it would be nice to also filter out only Kart type or Bike when printing the results, as some people only play with bikes, and only for the "in" or "out" drift type for the bikes, as some people only play using "in" drift type. Also nice is to print out result that have the same max or min value (different characters on different kart or bike that add up to the same value). Hugh's answer of printing out top values and bottom values is nice too as some of values are quite close, such as 73 or 72.
