The putative contradiction is based on the different lag-representation for PACF- and ACF- plots in R: ACF starts at lag 0 and PACF starts at lag 1. In principal, PACF and ACF at lag 1 should be equal. The theoretical ACF for a stationary time series $Y_t$ is just the autocorrelation, so $ACF(1)= Corr(Y_t,Y_{t-1})$. The PACF of lag j is the autocorrelation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-j}$ with the linear dependence of $Y_{t-1}$ and $Y_{t-j+1}$ removed. Since for PACF(1) there is no intermediary dependence, its value reduces to the simple autocorrelation: $PACF(1)=Corr(Y_t,Y_{t-1})$.
