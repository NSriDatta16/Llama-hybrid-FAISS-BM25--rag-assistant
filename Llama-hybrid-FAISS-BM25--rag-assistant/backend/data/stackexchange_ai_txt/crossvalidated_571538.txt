Is it okay to use PCA then with LSTM

I am currently trying to see if there is any validity to this procedure: Using PCA on data in tabular data Then transforming the new "PCA data" into a multivariate time series Using an LSTM to make classification predictions I have been trying to look for papers using this method, but I only found a few that used this method (they weren't bad, just not the most convincing). So if anyone has some experience using a similar method or knows some good papers that they can recommend to me that would be much appreciated. Thanks in Advanced,
