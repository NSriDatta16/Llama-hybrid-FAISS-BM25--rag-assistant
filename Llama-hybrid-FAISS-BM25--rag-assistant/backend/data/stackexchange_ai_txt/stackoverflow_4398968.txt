In general when confronted with issues like this: take the output of your page (Save as HTML), and edit that to pare down your problem to a simple reproducible test case. Find a piece of CSS, HTML, or JS that looks unrelated to the problem and delete it. If the problem still exists, repeat step 1. If the problem went away, put that code back in and delete something else. If necessary, repeat until there exists no byte of code that can't be removed without ruining your test case. In the process you will often find the problem yourself. You'll delete something seemingly-unrelated, find that it fixes (or changes) the problem, and as you wonder why that made a difference you'll suddenly be hit by a flash of insight. If you don't figure out the problem, you still win because you end up with a test case that is very few lines and encourages experts to quickly analyze and fix your problem. Oh, and: always validate your HTML and validate your CSS first and as you go. :)
