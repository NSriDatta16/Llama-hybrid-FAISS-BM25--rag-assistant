Understanding the 10:1 events per variable rule

I read online that 1:10 rule is based on the frequency of lower occurring class. I have a dataset with 4712 records. There are 1558 records labeled yes, and 3554 records labeled no. In my case, the frequency of the less commonly occurring class is 1558. According to the 1:10 rule, am I right to understand that it is calculated like 1558/10 = 155.8 further equals 150 predictors? So In my logistic regression, I can use 150 variables/input features to the model without the risk of overfitting. Am I right? Do we also have to look at the frequency of the other (high occurring) class to determine the no of predictors that I can use? If yes, can you share me as to what has to be done to determine the predictor count? (I am aware that we could also use 1:20 or 1:50 rule. But my question is mainly:) Are there any other considerations for determining the number of predictors in a logistic regression model? How do people calculate the minimum sample size required for analysis based on this? Is events per variable about that? (For example, I can't have 20 records and 60 predictors. It may not make sense.) Similarly, can you people help me understand how to determine the number of predictors and sample size required for logistic regression? Is it called a 'data hungry model'?
