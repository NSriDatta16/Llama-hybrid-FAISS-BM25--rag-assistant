After having a conversation with a friend, we both figured out how to overcome this problem but the solution is not very elegant: Add columns to your DataTable Close Visual Studio re-open Visual Studio right click the DataTable to update click Set Datasource Location add your DataSet connection again and update your DataTable against the one present in the new connection Note: if you try to update again, you must close visual studio again and repeat everything. Hope this can help someone with the same problem.
