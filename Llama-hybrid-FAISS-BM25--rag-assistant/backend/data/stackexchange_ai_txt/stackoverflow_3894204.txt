SimpleCov.coverage_dir ‘coverage’ This will allow you to set the directory where the coverage information will go. So one way to configure it will be to put if RUBY_VERSION > "1.9" require 'simplecov' SimpleCov.start 'rails' SimpleCov.coverage_dir 'coverage/rspec' end inside of your test_helper , and if RUBY_VERSION > "1.9" require 'simplecov' SimpleCov.start 'rails' SimpleCov.coverage_dir 'coverage/cucumber' end inside of features/support/env.rb That should separate them. You probably also want to make sure to run the tests separately so that it doesn't merge them.
