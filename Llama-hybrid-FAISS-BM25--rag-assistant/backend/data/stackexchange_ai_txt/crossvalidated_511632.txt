Can a P-value be calculated with these 4 statistics?

This is all you know. There are two farming plots, they are adjacent to each other, with the same soil type and irrigation methods. Yields for the two plots are available for 15 years. Plot 1 has an average yield of 158.6. (crop/acre) Plot 2 has an average yield of 159.2. The maximum difference between a Plot 1 reading and a Plot 2 reading was 4.8%. A new fertilizer was used for Plot 2 this year. The 16th pair of readings is plot 1 = 158.1 ; plot 2 = 178.4 The null hypothesis is that the means are equal. The alternate hypothesis is that they are not equal. (The significant level used would be the standard 0.05.) Is there enough information here to reject the null hypothesis? I am assuming the plant sizes on a given farming plot will be normally distributed, as there are consistent plot characteristics, and consistent irrigation and sunlight.
