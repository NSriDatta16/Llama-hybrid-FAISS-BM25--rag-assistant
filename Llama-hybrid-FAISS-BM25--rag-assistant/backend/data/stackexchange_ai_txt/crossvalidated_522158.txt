How to explain a relationship between Accuracy and F1 Score / F-Measure?

I am building a CNN model for pitch estimation using a song recording. For the evaluation metrics, I am using Accuracy and F1 Score . Sample of overall test result are given below using mean measurement. Some notes: Val-Acc is the validation accuracy. I am using this to see how well the model analyze new data that is not given during training. Delta acc is the difference value between accuracy and val-acc . Right now, I am wondering how can I explain the relationship between Accuracy and F1 Score . My supervisor said to me that accuracy is measured to get how accurate the model performs, and F1 is how well the model performs. Is the relationship really like that? May I get some insight on how to explain the relationship between them?
