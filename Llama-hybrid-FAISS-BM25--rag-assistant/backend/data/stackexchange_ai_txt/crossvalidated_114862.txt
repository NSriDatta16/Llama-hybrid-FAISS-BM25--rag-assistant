I understand that you've already checked an answer, but I suggest an alternative approach all the same. Why not use random survival forests to predict the conditional cumulative hazard of attrition? This method has the benefit of having few assumptions about the underlying hazard function, and does not rely on the proportional hazards assumption. In addition, The method is implemented in randomForestSRC (formerly within randomSurvivalForests ). The limitation of this method is that you would need both tenure of the workers as well as an indicator for whether there was attrition even for each worker. I would prefer this method over logistic regression because time is not really discrete in this process; it is at least approximately continuous. Another benefit of random survival forests is that it automatically considers complex interactions among your model features.
