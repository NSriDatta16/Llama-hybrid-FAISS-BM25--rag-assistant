Your question might have been entitled in the reverse "is there a useful model for my data or is it without significant predictable structure other than the mean " The distribution of the observed series IS OF NO CONCERN . The distribution of the residuals from a useful model IS OF CONCERN as that is where all the assumptions reside (are placed !). Your original data is far from white noise with an Actual/Fit and Forecast graph here showing strong/systematic impact for a few periods of the year and a very significant seasonal auto-regressive structure and a significant level shift down at period 43(44) (FOLLOW THE BLUE LINE IN THE FORECAST REGION ) . The forecasts are a working image of the model ... The model is here and in more detail here The residuals from the model have the following ACF suggesting "whiteness" i.e. no anomalies , no auto-correlation in the residuals. Finally the Actuals/cleansed plot is informative as to the latent identified deterministic structure Finally your statement about the acf of the original series suggesting "whiteness" is due to the downwards bias introduced by not treating the pulses and the level shift. See Detecting outliers in a time-series for more on this. Additionally models need to detect anomalies since if untreated they inflate the variance of the errors causing incorrect acceptance of the hypothesis of randomness. Prof. J.K.Ord has referred to this as "the Alice in wonderland effect". The problem is that you can't catch an outlier without a model (at least a mild one) for your data. Else how would you know that a point violated that model? In fact, the process of growing understanding and finding and examining outliers must be iterative. This isn't a new thought. Bacon, writing in Novum Organum about 400 years ago said: "Errors of Nature, Sports and Monsters correct the understanding in regard to ordinary things, and reveal general forms. For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations; and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways."
