Assessing potential multicollinearity for various model types meant for causal inference

I was wondering if, in the case where I use the same set of predictors for different kind of models (e.g. ANOVA, Poisson GLM, logistic regression...), VIF values for each predictor would be similar across models or if they would vary depending on response variables and model types (e.g. logistic vs. Poisson GLM)? EDIT: the helpful comments below confirmed my idea that, since correlations among predictors are independent of response variables, VIF values should be similar across model types. However, if I understand explanations from EdM correctly (in the comments as well as here and here ), the actual effects of predictors multicollinearity on coefficients will vary between models fitted with ordinary least squares and those using Maximum Likelihood . Consequently, the use of generalized VIF (GVIF; see also here ) or Condition Indexes for each model is recommended. Still, I am unsure about the two following things: Does that mean that VIF/GVIF values would be indifferent to model misspecification/overfitting? I'd figure that it is perhaps not a good idea to compute correlations with an inappropriate sample size. To illustrate my questioning with a ridiculous example, would it be okay to compute GVIF for 30 predictors in a model with only 50 observations? Does that make any sense to preventively drop redundant predictors before actually assessing the effects of this multicollinearity on coefficient estimates?
