Symfony won't override mailer factories setting for "dev" environment

I'm a bit of a Symfony noob, but I'm stuck on something I'm sure should work. I am using the "dev" environment on localhost, and am trying to test an action where an email is sent out to the user. I have the delivery_strategy set to none for "dev" but Symfony still tries to use the settings for "all". Here is my factories.yml: prod: logger: class: sfNoLogger param: level: err loggers: ~ test: storage: class: sfSessionTestStorage param: session_path: %SF_TEST_CACHE_DIR%/sessions response: class: sfWebResponse param: send_http_headers: false mailer: param: delivery_strategy: none dev: mailer: param: delivery_strategy: none all: routing: class: sfPatternRouting param: generate_shortest_url: true extra_parameters_as_query_string: true view_cache_manager: class: sfViewCacheManager param: cache_key_use_vary_headers: true cache_key_use_host_name: true mailer: class: sfMailer param: logging: %SF_LOGGING_ENABLED% charset: %SF_CHARSET% delivery_strategy: realtime transport: class: Swift_SmtpTransport param: host: localhost port: 25 encryption: ~ username: ~ password: ~ The error I get: Connection could not be established with host localhost [A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond. 10060] I've checked that there's only on factories.yml file (for the application "frontend" level). Thanks! Mark.
