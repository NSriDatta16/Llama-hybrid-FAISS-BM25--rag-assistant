Your approach of iteratively flattening the list should probably work fine, although it's not the most efficient or (subjectively) elegant way to do it. If there are more than one such list, the correct output would depend on the specification -- should you return all of them, or just the first one, or throw an error? If I were you, I'd look in to coming up with a recursive function to solve the problem. Each level of recursion would basically process the elements of a given level of the nested lists. Think of what each recursive call should do -- it's very simple if once it clicks!
