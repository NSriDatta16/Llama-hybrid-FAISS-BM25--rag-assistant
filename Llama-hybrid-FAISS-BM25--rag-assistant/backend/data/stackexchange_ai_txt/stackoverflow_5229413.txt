What I understand of gh_pages as presented in pages.github.com , is that it is for: creating a separate branch: your repo has now two roots (one for master and all the dev branches, one for gh_pages for GitHub published content). The root for gh_pages branch has a special treatment when managed by GitHub. "publish content to the web": and that can be any content you want. So if you don't need a full space for documentations, you can just go with a readme.md file or an index.html page ("user page"). help.github.com itself is organized as documents within a gh_pages branches .
