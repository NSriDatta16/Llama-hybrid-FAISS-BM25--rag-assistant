Short answer: Yes. Structure and semantics are good. For example. Many screen readers have a "forms mode" in which they ignore anything that isn't related to a form. () Cat () Dog () Rabbit That is pretty meaningless What is your favourite animal? () Cat () Dog () Rabbit Now the fieldset legend gives it context. A paragraph wouldn't work — it isn't presented to the user in forms mode. A label wouldn't work — it describes a field, not a set of them. You would use a label for each of cat, dog and rabbit.
