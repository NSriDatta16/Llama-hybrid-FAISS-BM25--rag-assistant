The problem is in how jQuery instantiates html passed to it, possibly lacking a good cross-browser string-to-dom parsing technique (such as createContextualFragment on Mozilla). To be concrete, there are two regexes in the jQuery's clean function which will have to be fixed: 857: var match = /^ $/.exec(elems[0]); 874: elem = elem.replace(/( ]*?)\/>/g, function(all, front, tag){ Both of these will fail to process tags with colon in the name. The fix: 857: var match = /^ $/.exec(elems[0]); 874: elem = elem.replace(/( ]*?)\/>/g, function(all, front, tag){
