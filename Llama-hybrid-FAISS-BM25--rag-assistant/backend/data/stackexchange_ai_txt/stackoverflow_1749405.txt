What are you doing with data between dump() and load() ? It's quite common error to store pickled data in file opened in text mode (on Windows) or in database storage in the way that doesn't work properly for binary data (VARCHAR, TEXT columns in some databases, some key-value storages). Try to compare pickled data that you pass to storage and immediately retrieved from it.
