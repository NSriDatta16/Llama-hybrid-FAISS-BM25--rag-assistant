Kragen makes a good point. Anything that is less than 50% of your code is "the wrong choice in the majority of situations". However, even though nowhere near 50% of your classes should be generic abstract base classes, it also isn't less of a good thing than any other language feature. For example, BindingList could be considered an abstract generic base class. It's a generic container, and sorting requires you to derive from it and override ApplySortCore . KeyedCollection doesn't just act like an abstract generic base class, it is one. To use it you MUST derive from it and implement GetKeyForItem .
