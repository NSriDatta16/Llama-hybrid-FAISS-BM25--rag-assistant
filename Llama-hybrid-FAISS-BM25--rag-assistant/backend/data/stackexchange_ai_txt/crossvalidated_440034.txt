The key thing to remember is that throws are IID. Realization could be included when it is considered in the design of your model. One of the example is if your model is a markov model, in fact many models that use bayesian framework includes realization on updating the probability. This is a great example to what I mentioned earlier. The reason that it does not apply for your case because realization is not included by design of your model.
