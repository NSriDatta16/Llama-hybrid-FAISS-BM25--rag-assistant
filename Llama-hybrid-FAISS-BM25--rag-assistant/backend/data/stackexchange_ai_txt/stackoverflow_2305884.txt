I have seen some code posted and could not refrain to add my own... because I really think it could be done more simply :) I suppose that item is of a numeric type. #include // std::max #include // std::numeric_limits ListItemType findLargest(const ListNode* p) { if (p == 0) return std::numeric_limits ::min(); else return std::max(p->item, findLargest(p->next)); } As you can see, much simpler, and I took the liberty to add a const since we're certainly not going to have to modify the list itself!
