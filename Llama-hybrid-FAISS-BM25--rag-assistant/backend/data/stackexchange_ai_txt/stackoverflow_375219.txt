You'd almost certainly be better off reducing the filesize of the images in articles, than combine them. I'd agree that there might be accessibility issues with the method you suggest. Also, I suppose it depends on what you mean by "dynamic" - if you're thinking of combining those images and generating CSS for each page load, you might well find that that results in slower page load times for users with average connection speeds. As to your second point, GD could certainly handle that. A better use of GD for reducing page load times might be reducing the image quality of your article images to reduce filesizes, at article creation time, not at page load.
