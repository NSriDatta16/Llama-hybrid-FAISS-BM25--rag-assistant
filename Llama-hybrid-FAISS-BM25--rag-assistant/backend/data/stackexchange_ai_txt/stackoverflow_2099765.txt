Putting a ContentControl *inside* a WPF DataTemplate?

I have a custom Expander control called SpecialExpander . It is basically just a standard Expander with a fancy header and a couple properties ( HeaderText and IsMarkedRead ). I began by creating a simple class: public class SpecialExpander : Expander { public string HeaderText { get; set; } public bool IsMarkedRead { get; set; } } Then I created a style that sets a couple properties on the expander (e.g., margins, padding, etc.) and, importantly, it also defines a custom DataTemplate for the HeaderTemplate property. The template is basically a grid with two rows. As shown in the illustrations below... for the top row, I'd like a fixed layout (it's always TextBlock TextBlock CheckBox ) for the bottom row, however, I want to be able to provide custom XAML for each expander. I tried putting in the DataTemplate , but I couldn't figure out how to hook it up properly. alt text http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/1194/contentcontrolwithintem.jpg Question How can I build a DataTemplate for my SpecialExpander so that the header has some fixed content (top row) and a place-holder for custom content (bottom row)? For the second illustration, I would want to be able to do something like this: " IsMarkedRead="True"> Main Content Goes Here
