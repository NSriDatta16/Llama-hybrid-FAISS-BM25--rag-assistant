How can I access the points of the polygon stored in Postgres using Libpqxx?

I want to retrieve the points of a polygon that are stored in the postgres db. The contents of the db are: polygonid |vertices -----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------- 2 |((1,0),(1.5,-1),(2,-1),(2,1),(1,1),(0,0),(0,2),(3,2),(3,-2),(1,-2)) 4 | ((3,3),(4,4),(5,5)) The vertices column is of type Polygon. I'm using libpqxx library for C++. Suppose I want to retrieve and access the points in the vertices column, I would execute these statements in C++: result R = W.exec ("select * from polygon_tbl"); for (result::const_iterator r = R.begin(); r != R.end(); ++r) { int x = 0; cout Sorry I'm very new to libpqxx. I've pretty much understood how the libpqxx works but I'm stuck with the Polygon types. We actually just need a simple storage for our polygons in Postgres but I'm not sure how to access them using libpqxx.
