What do I need to install a Visual Studio 2010 (sln)-compatible Build Agent in TeamCity?

I seem to be unable to install a build agent on our TeamCity 5.1.2 build server that is compatible with a VS2010 (sln) build configuration. Under "Build Runners", the following runners are listed: Ant: Runner for Ant build.xml files Duplicates finder (.NET): C# and VB duplicate code finder Command Line: Simple command execution And under "Compatible configurations", the project I've configured to build with the Visual Studio 2010 (sln) build runner is listed under "Incompatible configurations". To install the build agent, I'm simply running the .msi installation package, but it seems the default settings are not good enough. The build server machine has Visual Web Developer Express 2010 as well as .NET versions 2.0-4.0 installed, but no full version of VS. Do I need anything more? (I have no experience whatsoever of building with msbuild scripts, so if I can I want to avoid having to do that.)
