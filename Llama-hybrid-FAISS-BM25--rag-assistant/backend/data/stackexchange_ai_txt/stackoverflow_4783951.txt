How to organize multiple xna game components?

I am programming in XNA and need help on organizing my classes and code: I have a button class and a button manager. I also have a scene class and a scene manager. The button manager handles the different buttons that would be drawn on different screens since almost all screens would have a button. The scene manager does the same thing except instead of handling buttons it handles background scene objects that just need to be drawn. Both managers depend on the current game state to determine which buttons or scene objects to draw. How should I organize my code so that both managers know what the current game state is? (Both managers are instantiated inside of the main game class and both managers are game components)
