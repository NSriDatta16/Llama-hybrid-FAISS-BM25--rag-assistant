Can I use twice "@subpackage" for phpDocumentor?

For example I have a project called "myproj" and a subpackage called "utils" and in this subpackage there's again a subpackage called "debug". Can I do something like that: ? /** * @package myproj * @subpackage utils * @subpackage debug * / Thanks in advance! Solution There is also the tag @category: The @category tag is used to organize groups of packages together. So you can use the tags in the following order: @category, @package, @subpackage And if that isn't enough for you, can could use also underscores in the names.
