Since Magento is just blinding converting from the table, deleting entries from the table will prevent Magento from trying to convert them. Override the helper class and delete the entries you don't want to see and you should be pretty well on your way. As far as displaying them correctly in the admin panel, is this a separate problem you have if you save those non-Latin characters? More specific information would be helpful.
