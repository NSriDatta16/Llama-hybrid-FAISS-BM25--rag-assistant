How to speed up training of a Neural Network?

I'm writing a thesis where I developed a script that generates NN and precalculates weights and biases to reduce a required number of epochs when I train a network. In my work, using examples I managed to prove the efficiency of precalculated weights and biases, but wondering, is there any other ways to reduce a required number of epochs to train a network? I just want to enrich my thesis, if you can share a reference I would really appreciate it I am using feedforward and recurrent NN, applying backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent optimization
