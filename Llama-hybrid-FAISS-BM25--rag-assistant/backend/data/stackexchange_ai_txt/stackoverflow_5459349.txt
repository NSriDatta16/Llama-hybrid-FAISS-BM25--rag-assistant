i did some minor modifications, now its working with one single input-field for all sliders. Heres what i did: In the function "sliderUpdateInput" i added the line "document.getElementById("whatever").setAttribute("data-controlled-by", this.id);". then to the input field added the id="whatever". Now only thing to take care is, that in the sliders attribute "data-controlled-by" the value is the same as the id of the slider, so you can apply to it in the function "sliderUpdateInput" with this.id. So the value of the input-attribute will be changed to the corresponding slider, each time you click or drag the slider. If you want to display all the inputs for each slider anyway, you wont need this, but in my script there was no room for all that inputs, so i thought it was better, to only use one input anyway, to have it a bit more dynamic. Thanks for your solution, i especially like how the value of the input corresponds with the slider in realtime.
