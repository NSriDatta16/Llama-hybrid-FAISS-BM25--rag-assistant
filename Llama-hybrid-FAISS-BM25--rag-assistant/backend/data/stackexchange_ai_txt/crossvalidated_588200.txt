Centering (more generally, standardizing) predictors can make the regression coefficient harder to interpret. This seems to happen in your example because nouns and verbs have different mean SER. I didn't know what SER is (and I still don't), so I was looking at (Winter 2017) to figure it out. In a great example of reproducibility, the data and the code for that analysis are available on GitHub . This means I was able to reproduce your regression. #> (Intercept) SER_c POSVerb SER_c:POSVerb #> 0.6642 0.1182 0.7237 0.5084 But first I wanted to look at the distribution of SER for nouns and verbs. You can see from the histogram that verbs tend to have lower SER than nouns. We can also compute the average SER by part of speech (POS). #> # A tibble: 2 × 3 #> POS n `mean(SER)` #> #> 1 Noun 1106 3.42 #> 2 Verb 373 2.96 So, while SER = 0 might be arbitrary, so may be the average SER of verbs and nouns (in this dataset). The (unweighted) sample mean SER is a 3:1 combination of the mean noun SER (3.42) and the mean verb SER (2.96): (1106 * 3.42 + 373 * 2.96) / (1106 + 373) = 3.3 This average is hard to interpret. It follows that the concepts of "NOUNS w/ AVERAGE SER" and "VERBS w/ AVERAGE SER" are also hard to interpret. Instead I would report the model as two regression lines, one for nouns and one for verbs. Here is the model overlaid on top of the data. Appendix Since POS is categorical, the model Iconicity ~ SER * POS is equivalent to a separate regression line for each category. (The errors about the regression lines have the same variance.) The interaction term is a specific parametrization which indicates that the regression slope is different for nouns and verbs. $$ \begin{aligned} Y &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{SER} + \beta_2\operatorname{Is}\left\{\text{Verb}\right\} + \beta_3\text{SER} \times \operatorname{Is}\left\{\text{Verb}\right\} \\ &= \operatorname{Is}\left\{\text{Noun}\right\} \color{red}{\Big[\beta_0 + \beta_1\text{SER}\Big]} + \operatorname{Is}\left\{\text{Verb}\right\} \color{blue}{\Big[(\beta_0+\beta_2) + (\beta_1+\beta_3)\text{SER}\Big]} \\ &= \operatorname{Is}\left\{\text{Noun}\right\} \color{red}{\Big[\beta_0 + \beta_1\text{SER}\Big]} + \operatorname{Is}\left\{\text{Verb}\right\} \color{blue}{\Big[(\tilde{\beta}_2 + \tilde{\beta}_3\text{SER}\Big]} \\ \end{aligned} $$ B.
