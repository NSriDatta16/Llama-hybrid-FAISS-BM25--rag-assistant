RESX files upgrade problems Watch out for internationalized RESX files. When you reopen a ,net 1.1 form in .net 2.0 the RESX file gets upgraded to a new version. In .net 1.1 the foreign language .resx file only contained the changes. In .net 2.0 ALL of the fields in the default .resx file now get moved into the foreign language resx file. (.fr.resx for example). If you have already internationalized the form all of the foreign language resx files will have to be looked at. Internationalisation Tools Some tools that you may have used/written yourself to do internationalization en mass may not work anymore as they may have used numbered resources. (Multi Lang & Infragistics) Infragistics Winforms controls modify the InitializeForm() in .net 1.1 and access resources using a resource numbering system. When migrated to .net 2.0 the numbering of the Infragistics resources will fail as the resx file is regenerated. You will need to upgrade your Infragistics libraries.
