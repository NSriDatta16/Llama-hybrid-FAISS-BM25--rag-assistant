Does a table with 20 columns benefit more from indexing a certain field (one that's used in search-ish queries) than a table that has just 4 columns? No, number of columns in a table has no bearing on benefits from having an index. An index is solely on the values in the column(s) specified; it's the frequency of the values that will impact how much benefit your queries will see. For example, a column containing a boolean value is a poor choice for indexing, because it's a 50/50 chance the value will be one or the other value. At a 50/50 split over all the rows, the index doesn't narrow the search for a particular row. What is the harm in adding index to fields that I don't search with much, but might later in the future? Indexes only speed up data retrieval when they can be used, but they negatively impact the speed of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements. Indexes also require maintenance to keep their value.
