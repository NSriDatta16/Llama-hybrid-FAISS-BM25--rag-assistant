android alert with sound, vibration

I need to add an alerting system to my application. When some data is read i need to alert the user of the data. I need a dialog to pop up letting the user know the time it occurred and tell them some other stuff. The user needs to click ok and that is it. Just to bring their attention to something. I need it to make noise and vibrate. I was looking into notifications and alertdialogs. AlertDialog seems to be what i want, however, i do not see anything about sounds and vibrations in the documentation for alertdialog. Is there noise and vibration for alertdialog? Or is there another way for me to do this with sounds and vibration? I need the window to stay active until the user presses ok. Thanks!
