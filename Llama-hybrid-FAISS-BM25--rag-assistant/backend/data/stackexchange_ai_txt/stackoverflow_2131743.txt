Detect target treenode when dragging items to the TreePanel instance

I have GridPanel and TreePanel instances. Elements from GridPanel could be dragged into the treepanel. But I can't detect which tree node receives these dragged items. I initialize tree panel DD with the following code (method of class derived from Ext.tree.TreePanel): initDD: function() { var treePanelDropTargetEl = this.getEl(); var treePanelDropTarget = new Ext.dd.DropTarget(treePanelDropTargetEl, { ddGroup: 'ddgroup-1', notifyDrop: function(ddSource, e, data) { // do something with data, here I need to know target tree node return true; } }); } So how can I find out which tree node received dragged items in the "notifyDrop" handler. I can take e.getTarget() and calculate the node but I don't like that method.
