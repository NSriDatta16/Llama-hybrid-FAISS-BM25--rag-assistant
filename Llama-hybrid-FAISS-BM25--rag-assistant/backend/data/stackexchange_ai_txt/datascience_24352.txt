Working with Data which is not Normal/Gaussian

What happens if my data/feature is not normal? Can I still use machine learning algorithms to utilize such data for predictions? I noticed in many data sciences courses, there is always a strong assumption of using a normal/Gaussian data. I have always wonder why this is so, and most people would say that due to central limit theorem, the data is always assumed to be normal. However, what if the data that I am dealing with is not normally distributed? Should I perform log/ exponential transformation on the data for the sake of getting normal distributed data? Why is Gaussian data always best suited?
