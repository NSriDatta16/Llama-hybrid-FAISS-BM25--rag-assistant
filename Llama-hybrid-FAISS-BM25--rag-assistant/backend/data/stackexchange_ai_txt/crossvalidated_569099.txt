What statistical test to use

I want to carry out a study but I don’t know which statistical method to use for analysing the results. I have two buildings (say, houses A and B) and I keep daily records of some quantitative variable Y on both houses. I want to apply a treatment or intervention in house B and see if it has a meaningful effect over Y, using records of house A as control. Before applying the treatment, I already know that house A tends to have a lower Y than house B, and I think I should somehow adjust or control by this difference, but I don’t know how to correctly do it. Besides that, because of the time of the year, I expect the values of Y to increase on both houses. I’ll illustrate the situation with some figures. Before the intervention, I have $n_1$ records of variable Y on house A with an average of 35; and another $n_1$ observations on house B with an average of 54. After the intervention, I have $n_2$ observations on house A with an average of 48 and another $n_2$ observations on house B with an average of 72. Y mean Before intervention After intervention House A 35 48 House B 54 72 My questions are: What statistical technique should I use to determine if the intervention has a significant effect over the outcome variable Y? Since I already know that before the intervention there’s a significant difference in the average of Y in both houses, should I somehow adjust or control for it? If so, how? For what I’ve been reading, I think this is a quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent control group, since there is no random assignation. I’ve also been reading about difference in differences but I have concerns about it since my data is somehow temporal (I have daily records, and variable Y is definitely affected by the time of the year). Thank you for your answers! Edit 1: Before the intervention, I have measured $n_1$ =13 days on both houses, so I have a total of 26 observations $Y_{A_1},..., Y_{A_{13}}, Y_{B_1},...,Y_{B_{13}} $ . After the intervention I have recorded $n_1$ =10 daily observations on each house: $Y_{A_{14}},..., Y_{A_{23}}, Y_{B_{14}},...,Y_{B_{23}} $ .
