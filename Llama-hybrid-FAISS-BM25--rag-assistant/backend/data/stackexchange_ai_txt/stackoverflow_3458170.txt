What is the easiest (correct) way in ASP.NET MVC 2 to make a button-click display text?

I need to make a quick demo showing how to do interactivity on an ASP.NET MVC page . I opened an ASP.NET MVC project in Visual Studio 2010, put the view in design mode, dragged in a button, double-clicked on it and looked at the view again. I was expecting to see some ingenious JQuery code generated but instead an and a block was created, which seems to be a mixing of classic ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC metaphors . I don't think that is the recommended way to build interactivity in MVC, right? So what is the easiest, most standard-MVC approach for me to (1) create a button, (2) when the button is clicked, change some text in my view? is it really best practice in MVC to use the runat-server block? are there some easy wizards which generate JQuery interactivity so that I can do this in a best-practice MVC way? or do I need to implement the JQuery myself as I would on a plain HTML page without ASP.NET MVC? View: protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { } Home Page
