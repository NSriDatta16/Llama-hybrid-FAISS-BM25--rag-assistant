Consuming PHP webservice(SOAP, WSDL) from ASP.NET C# app - problems with array

I have a web service, defined(WSDL) and implemented in PHP. This one is relatively simple, important bits defined as the following: Note that data parameter is an array, in fact it is an associative array. PHP client works beautifully with this, calling service and getting proper response. Now, when I try to consume this service with ASP.NET... what do I use as an associative array? Hashtable?.. Proxy class created by Visual Studio says that second parameter is actually a string(or should be string) and not any type of collection... Quite puzzling... Addendum: I tried grabbing SOAP request that PHP generates, here is a part of it that carries 'data' parameter: ... company_data name Test company name slogan Test company slogan ... So what data type that ns2:Map is? Is there something that ASP.NET supports that maps onto it cleanly?
