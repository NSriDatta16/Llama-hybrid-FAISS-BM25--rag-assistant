Cross fitting with same params but differents models

What is the best fitting way with 2 variables to explain ($Z_1$ and $Z_2$) depending on the same variables ($X$ and $Y$) and parameters $\theta$ but with differents models ($f$ and $g$)? For instance: $Z_1 = f(X,Y,\theta) $ and $Z_2 = g(X,Y,\theta)$. I have an estimation of $\hat{X}$, $\hat{Y}$ and $\hat{\theta}$, and two mechanistic models $f(.)$ and $g(.)$. I would like two regressions in the same time. I used a GLM, GLMM and nls() function in R which work to estimate $\hat{\theta}$ for $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ one at a time. Are Bayesian model the only way? Where may I look for?
