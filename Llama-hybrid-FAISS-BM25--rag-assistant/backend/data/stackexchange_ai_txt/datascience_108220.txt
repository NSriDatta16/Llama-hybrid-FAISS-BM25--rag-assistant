Does it make sense to add a new calculated column for dates/duration?

I'm using a Random Forest Classifier on some data, and I have two date field, StartDate and EndDate . Does it make sense to create a derived/calculated column Duration , that would be the difference between the end and the start dates in days (or weeks)? Would this give extra power to the classifier, or is this already covered, as the decision trees within the model would create corresponding "buckets" for this based on the dates?
