The business analyst flavour of data science is something you are nicely suited for. As far as I have seen business analysts and business intelligence engineers in the industry, most of their work is centered around deriving insights from Excel sheets and writing SQL queries to dig out the appropriate data. They do write scripts, but that is generally for just the visualization purpose, and not for higher lever analytics like Machine Learning. I can also see a nice future for you in the financial analytics/quant domain. It is also a domain where the learning curve is a bit steep, but totally worth it. Here is my answer on Quora about getting into the field of quant. However, if you want to get up to speed with data science, then you have to slowly build up strong linear algebra skills, along with a very keen and valuable domain knowledge in whatever domain you'd be working with. The latter is often underrated, but from my (short but valuable) experience in the industry; I vouch for that fact. Bonus resources: Quora data science topic wiki Metacademy learning paths OCW math courses If you're okay with starting with a full blast ground up learning marathon for data science, then this is the path I'd recommend: Single Variable Calculus Multi Variable Calculus Differential Equations Linear Algebra Probability theory and combinatorics Basics Statistics Algorithms All the above courses are available in the OCW catalogue. If not, then you can find them in other MOOC aggregators too.
