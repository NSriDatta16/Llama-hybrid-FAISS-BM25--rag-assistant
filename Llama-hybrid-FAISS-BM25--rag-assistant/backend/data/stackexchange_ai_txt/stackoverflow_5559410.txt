If I understood what you are wanting... Once thing you could do is make it so that your button go to a javascript function instead of just to the file. Then, after you have done whatever you want to do in your javascript function, you can send the file to the user. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/robertphyatt/8cJmE/3/
