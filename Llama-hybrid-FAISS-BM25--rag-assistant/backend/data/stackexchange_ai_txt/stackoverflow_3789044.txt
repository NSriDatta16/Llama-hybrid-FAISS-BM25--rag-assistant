passing xml nodes/documents/fragments as parameters to xslt

I tried to pass a w3c.dom.Document , Element and NodeList as parameters to a xslt transform. I want to be able to process it within the xslt: I pass the parameter as: Document params = createLinksParams(links); transformer.setParameter("links", params); I get this exception: 'Invalid conversion from 'com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.DocumentImpl' to 'node-set'.' I tried also exslt:node-set() , xalan:nodeset() etc, but it doesn't work. It seems that internally xalan excepts his own implementation of the Node. How can I do something similar without incurring in this problem? I cannot use document($param) because I construct the doc on the fly.
