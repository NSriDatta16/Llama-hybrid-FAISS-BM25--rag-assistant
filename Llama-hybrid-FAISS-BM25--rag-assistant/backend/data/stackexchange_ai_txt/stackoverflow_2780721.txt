Add multiple columns in select query

Scenario is like: SomeTable { A int, B int, C int } I need to select and add with formula: A + 25%B + 50%C. If in decimal, round upto next full digit and display an asterisk and a spcae preciding the sum. Each column needs to be rounded off before adding. Suppose data is 10 16 12 14 15 19 Select should return: 20, 28 *. I am thinking of using case statements but its getting very dirty with that. Any ideas?
