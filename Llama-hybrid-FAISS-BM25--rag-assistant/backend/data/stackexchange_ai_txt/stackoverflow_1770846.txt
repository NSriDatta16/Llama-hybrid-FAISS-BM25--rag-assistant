Make table rows sortable with YUI

Currently I have a table similar to below: Example Title Title2 data1 data2 I am using script.aculo.us currently with the code: Sortable.create('tblbdy', {tag: 'tr', ghosting: false, constraint: 'vertical', onUpdate: sortparts}); This basically makes a very simple you effect that you click on the row, drag it up/down, it inserts it into the new sport and calls the function "sortparts", it works great; However on my curent project I am phasing out script.aculo.us to cut down on the javascript footprint and to switch to YUI for all the visual stuff (and this is the last bit). How would I achieve a similar result with YUI? I have tried to just new YAHOO.util.DD(row) on each row but nothing happens at all... edit I have found this: http://normankosmal.com/wordpress/?p=25 which works however if you have any textboxes in your table you can no longer edit them.
