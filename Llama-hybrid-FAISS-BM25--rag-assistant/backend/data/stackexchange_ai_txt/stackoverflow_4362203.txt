We've talked about attacks using the RLO (U+202E RIGHT TO LEFT OVERRIDE) character in the past, which shifts the 'visual' display of a string from the position it's placed inside that string.

In fact we're starting to hear of real world attacks using these techniques to bypass spam and other filters. Firefox closed a bug in their file download dialog box.
