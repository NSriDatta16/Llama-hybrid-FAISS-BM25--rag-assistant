Choosing the right linkage method for hierarchical clustering

I am performing hierarchical clustering on data I've gathered and processed from the reddit data dump on Google BigQuery. My process is the following: Get the latest 1000 posts in /r/politics Gather all the comments Process the data and compute an n x m data matrix (n:users/samples, m:posts/features) Calculate the distance matrix for hierarchical clustering Choose a linkage method and perform the hierarchical clustering Plot the data as a dendrogram My question is, how do I determine what the best linkage method is? I'm currently using Ward but how do I know if I should be using single , complete , average , etc? I'm very new to this stuff but I can't find a clear answer online as I'm not sure there is one. So what might be a good idea for my application? Note the data is relatively sparse in the sense that the n x m matrix has a lot of zeroes (most people don't comment on more than a few posts).
