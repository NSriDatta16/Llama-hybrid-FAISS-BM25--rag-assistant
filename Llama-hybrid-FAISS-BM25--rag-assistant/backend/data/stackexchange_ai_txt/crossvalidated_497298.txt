Yes. Because you have a fairly small amount of features already (15), it makes sense if you weren't able to reduce the dimensionality much further without reducing the explanation for variance. PCA is often done on datasets with hundreds or thousands of features to reduce the dataset. Although, to note, if you did have highly-redundant features, it is also totally possible that you could have reduced your dataset down to fewer features. Yes, you are right that there is not much redundancy in your dataset and you shouldn't reduce the features.
