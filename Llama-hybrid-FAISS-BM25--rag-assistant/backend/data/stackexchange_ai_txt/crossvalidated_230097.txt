Think like a bayesian, check like a frequentist: What does that mean?

I am looking at some lecture slides on a data science course which can be found here: https://github.com/cs109/2015/blob/master/Lectures/01-Introduction.pdf I, unfortunately, cannot see the video for this lecture and at one point on the slide, the presenter has the following text: Some Key Principles Think like a Bayesian, check like a Frequentist (reconciliation) Does anyone know what that actually means? I have a feeling there is a good insight about these two schools of thought to be gathered from this.
