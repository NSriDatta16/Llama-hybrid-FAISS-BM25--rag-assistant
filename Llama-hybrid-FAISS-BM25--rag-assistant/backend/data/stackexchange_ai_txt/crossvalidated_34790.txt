It depends on what are the 7 questions asking. If it's a validated questionnaire that you borrowed somewhere, and it specifically explores "knowledge," then I'll agree to take a sum or average and then report it by group. If the questions are put together by you and they are quite different in the knowledge domain (for instance, a mixture of questions asking about prevention, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and maintenance), then I would suggest starting with looking at the rate of being correct at each question individually by group. Perhaps you may find some insights (like both groups know equally well about prevention and detection, but the cancer patient group knows much more about diagnosis) along the way. This interesting information could be masked away quickly if the scores were summed in a rush.
