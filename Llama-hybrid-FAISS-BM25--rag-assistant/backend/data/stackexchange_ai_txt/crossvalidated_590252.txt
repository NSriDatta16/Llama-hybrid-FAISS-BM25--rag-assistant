Interpret the relationship between weights before the output layer and the weights in the first layer

I took a lot time doing research in neural network recently. Last time I asked questions about interpret neural network result from a similar picture and it really activated my interest. For now, my new question is can we build an equation between W21 and W11,W12,Wx21,Wx22 from the plot? From my perspective, W21 W22 are the weight for the two neuros in the first hidden layer, and it should have a relationship between something like W11 and W21 . Then we can directly know the 'weights' of X1 and X2 corresponds to Y. It sounds like the back-propagation, starts with W21 and ends at the node W11 .
