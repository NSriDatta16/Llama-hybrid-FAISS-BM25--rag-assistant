I am also trying to figure out how to build an achievements rules engine. I checked around rules engines and what are the basics of it. There is a good summary of that in wikipedia Basically, you either have foward chaining when you, for example, check availability for something; otherwise, you use Event Condition Action rules. Its the latest that caught my attention. So you could predefine a set of triggered events. In the engine you can define what are the checked conditions who are based on available metrics, and specify the association achievement. This way seems more flexible, but you have to define the events, possible condition checks and metrics. For example, you would have various events like TicketCreated triggered in the code. In the rule engine you could have something like Event: TicketCreated Condition: UserTicketCount >= 1000 Achivement: "Created 1000 tickets" or for "reset settings to default" Event: SettingsChanged Condition: Settings = DEFAULT Achievement: "Reset to Default" I haven't tried it yet, but I'm going to pretty soon. It's mostly theoric for now.
