Typical Customer Order Value

I am analysing some sales data and looking at the customer orders for 550 customers and want to answer the question "What is the typical customer order value", however, the orders are skewed as follows; Order Value - No of Orders £0 to £100 - 400 £101 to £200 - 78 £201 to £300 - 35 £301 to £400 - 25 £400 and over - 12 The average is £27.5 with almost 50% of the orders under £28 and 72% under £100, the mode is 7. What method can I use to answer the question of what is the typical customer order?
