You can get world population statistics online - estimates are available here: Wikipedia World Population This will help you to rough-up some statistics, but you need to remember... Population is not equal to "has an internet connection" 0.5% does not really equate to "internet users" - it's more like 0.5% of people who are the kind of people that would install a random toolbar that offers them very little - so you need to bear in mind it's a certain "type" of person and that the statistics will be skewed (which is why www.alexa.com isn't ranked as EVERYONE with the Alexa toolbar is going to visit that website at some point The smaller your website, the less accurate the statistics are. If you aren't in the top 100,000 websites in the world, the statistics become largely an anomaly as they "estimate up" the statistics from the toolbar users into an "average if everyone had a toolbar". Hope this helps.
