iPhone Objective-C OAuth: A more elegant way to check if a request token is still valid?

I want to do this when the app loads, so I can either ask the user to log in (if not authenticated) or else continue. The only way I can think of is to call a random request (a GET that requires authentication) and check whether or not I get a valid response, but this seems inelegant. I am using the Foursquare API . Are there better ways to do this?
