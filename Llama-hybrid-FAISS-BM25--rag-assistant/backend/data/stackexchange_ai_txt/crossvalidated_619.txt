I have a depressing and not-very-specific anecdote to share here. I spent some time as a co-worker of a statistical MT researcher. If you want to see a really big, complex, model, look no further. He was putting me through NLP bootcamp for his own amusement. I am, in general, the sort of programmer who lives and dies by the unit test and the debugger. As a young person at Symbolics, I was struck by the aphorism, 'programming is debugging an empty editor buffer.' (Sort of like training a perceptron model.) So, I asked him, 'how do you test and debug this stuff.' He answer was, "You get it right the first time. You think it through (in his case, often on paper) very carefully, and you code it very carefully. Because when you get it wrong, the chances of isolating the problem are very slim."
