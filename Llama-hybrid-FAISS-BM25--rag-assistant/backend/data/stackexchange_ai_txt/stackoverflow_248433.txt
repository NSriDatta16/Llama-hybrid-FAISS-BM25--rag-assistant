Hooking into Windows with C# to Produce Windows 7 New Feature

I just saw a really useful UI feature of the forthcoming Windows 7 ( visit http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2008/10/windows_7_walkthrough_boot_video_and_impressions-2.html and scroll down to the video entitled Super Scientific Video of New Window Resizing Feature) In a nutshell you can drag a window by the title bar to the top of the screen to maximise it, drag it back down to restore and drag it to the left edge or the right edge of the screen to have it snap into position butted up against the edge you dragged it to, and resized to occupy half the screen. Now I know there are a bunch of keyboard-based apps that do "similar" things but I've not seen a mouse-based program that does JUST the above, simple, useful and nothing more. If you know of one (or are smart enough to write one) please post the URL :) Anyway, if I wanted to try and write a small app to do this I have a question: If I wanted to try and write a small app to do this, could I write it as a .NET app? I guess hooking into Windows' window drag/drop handling is pretty low-level and maybe not something that could be done in C#.NET? any smartypants here who can knock a small app like this out in their lunchbreak? ;) I'm sure anything mimicing Windows 7 features would prove very popular, at least pre Windows 7's launch. Edit: The AeroSnap guys ( http://www.aerosnap.de/index_eng.htm ) have done a nice job of implementing this feature and judging by the number of downloads, it was a popular feature!
