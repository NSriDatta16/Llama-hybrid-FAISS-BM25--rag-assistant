How does adding a "lives" mechanic change average picks?

I'm tuning a slot machine app and need to make sure the mini-game is appropriately balanced. The mini-game is a grid of 30 treasure chests, 6 of which are traps. The user continues to open chests (and earn prizes) until they hit a trap. What I'd like to do is add a "lives" mechanic where hitting a trap depletes a life instead of ending the game outright. When user is out of lives, the mini-game ends. Here's the equation I'm using to determine the return %: $(return \ \text{%}) = (\text{%} \ chance \ of \ triggering) * (avg \ reward) * (avg \ num \ of \ picks)$ Here's the table I'm using to derive average number of picks: Pick # Probability Expected 1 20% 0.20 2 16.55% 0.33 3 13.60% 0.41 4 11.08% 0.44 5 8.95% 0.45 6 7.16% 0.43 7 5.67% 0.40 8 4.44% 0.35 9 3.43% 0.31 10 2.61% 0.26 11 1.96% 0.22 12 1.44% 0.17 13 1.04% 0.14 14 0.74% 0.10 15 0.51% 0.08 16 0.34% 0.05 17 0.22% 0.04 18 0.13% 0.02 19 0.08% 0.01 20 0.04% 0.01 21 0.02% 0.00 22 0.01% 0.00 23 0.00% 0.00 24 0.00% 0.00 25 0.00% 0.00 Total 100.00% 4.43 Here's the equation I'm using to determine probability: $(probability) = \frac{PERMUT(24, \ Pick \ \text{#} - 1) \ * \ (num \ of \ traps)}{PERMUT(30, \ Pick \ \text{#})}$ How does adding a "lives" mechanic change these equations?
