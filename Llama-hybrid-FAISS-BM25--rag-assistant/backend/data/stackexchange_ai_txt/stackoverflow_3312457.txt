You will need a pointer that will hold the value returned by malloc(), so that you can free it later. If what you plan on using storage_p for is going to change it value, then you are going to need two pointers. However, I generally keep the pure initial pointer, and create new ones, ad hoc, as I need one. int *storage = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int[GROW_BY])); // : int* ptr = storage; while (*ptr) { // : ++ptr; }
