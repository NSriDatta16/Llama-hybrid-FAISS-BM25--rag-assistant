What watch is really designed for is validation of property values. For example you could validate that something is an integer: obj.watch('count', function(id, oldval, newval) { var val = parseInt(newval, 10); if(isNaN(val)) return oldval; return val; }); You could use it to validate string length: obj.watch('name', function(id, oldval, newval) { return newval.substr(0, 20); }); However, these are only available in the latest versions of the SpiderMonkey javascript engine. Great if you are using Jaxer or embedding the SpiderMonkey engine, but not really available in your browser yet (unless you are using FF3).
