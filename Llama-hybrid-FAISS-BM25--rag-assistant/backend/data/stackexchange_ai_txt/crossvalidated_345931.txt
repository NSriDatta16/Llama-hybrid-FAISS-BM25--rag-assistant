Our new review discusses these questions in detail: Dormann, C. F., Calabrese, J. M., Guillera‐Arroita, G. , Matechou, E. , Bahn, V. , Bartoń, K. , Beale, C.

A., Wood, S. N., Wüest, R. O. and Hartig, F. (2018), Model averaging in ecology: a review of Bayesian, information‐theoretic and tactical approaches for predictive inference. Ecol Monogr. Accepted Author Manuscript. doi:10.1002/ecm.1309 One of the main conclusions is that bias/variance -> error of the average is influenced by the bias variance / covariance of the contributing models, as well as the error (uncertainty) of the estimated weights for these models. Depending on how things play out, MA will have higher or lower error than alternatives (picking one / the best / the full / a regularized model). A further issue is that calculating uncertainties / CIs for averaged predictions is challenging, which can be an argument against MA if you care about that.
