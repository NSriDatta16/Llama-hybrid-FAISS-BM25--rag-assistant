Using BeautifulSoup to parse lines separated by tags?

I have a page that looks like this: Company A 123 Main St. Suite 101 Someplace, NY 1234 Company B 456 Main St. Someplace, NY 1234 Sometimes there are two rather than three "br" tags separating the entries. How would I use BeautifulSoup to parse through this document and extract the fields? I'm stumped because the bits of text that I need are not contained in paragraph (or similar) tags that I can simply iterate through.
