Voting is actually a very difficult problem. There are so many models of voting, and they all produce different results. For example, choosing your one favorite candidate versus ranking candidates produces a different result. Choosing your LEAST favorite candidate produces a different result. Organizing choices into good/bad produces different results. Balancing then becomes something that can be done by asking the community. It's very difficult to balance games of that magnitude, simply because even your most exhaustive tests wont cover all of the cases. Having a properly established forum where users can give their opinions as well as having testers who watch out for balancing issues is probably the best way to go. Oh, and if you want an abstract about the voting problem I mentioned, it's here: http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~lane/computational-politics.html
