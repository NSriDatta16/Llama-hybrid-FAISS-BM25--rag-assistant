Frequency limit when applying Holt-Winters model to daily dataset

I am trying to use the Holt-Winters model to forecast the daily pollution rates of some cities. I have almost 4 years of daily data available and would like to make a prediction for the next 180 days. For simplicity, I'll make a quick time series with rnorm() to elaborate my problem. myts (from what I've read on the internet, this is how you make a daily time series with ts().) Training dataset: traints I tried to fit a Holt-Winters additive model by: fit1 but it gave an error: Error in ets(x, "AAA", alpha = alpha, beta = beta, gamma = gamma, phi = phi, : Frequency too high When searching around it seems that ets() has a frequency limit of 24. I've read that Holt-Winters can be used for daily data so how would I work around this frequency limit to make a model(other than switching to ARIMA models)?
