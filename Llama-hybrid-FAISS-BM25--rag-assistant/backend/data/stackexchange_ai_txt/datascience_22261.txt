From a stats perspective, it sounds like you have a Poisson process , where the events are user submissions. So you might represent your dependent variable as the number of events in a unit of time (say, number of submissions per week), and set up a Poisson regression or negative binomial regression. For the independent variable, you might try the number of comments received in the previous unit of time, i.e., you might see how well the number of months received this week predicts the number of submission next week. Note that there are likely to be trends over time (i.e., a new user doesn't make many submission at first, but gradually becomes a regular user) and autocorrelation , especially if your time scale is too small. For example, in your example data, most days have 0 submissions, so autocorrelation will high if your units are days or smaller. So consider using time series methods or selecting a time scale large enough to get low autocorrelation.
