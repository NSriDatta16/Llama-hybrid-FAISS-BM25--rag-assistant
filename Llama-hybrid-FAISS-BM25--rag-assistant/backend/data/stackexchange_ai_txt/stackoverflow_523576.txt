Actually, AI research is having a renaissance and has been for the past 5-8 years or so. Back when neural networks were all the rage in the 70s and 80s, they were showing such promise in solving simple tasks that people's hopes were sky-high for the whole field of AI. Then, when it turned out to be very difficult to move on from the very simple tasks to real-world problems like language acquisition, a lot of people became disillusioned. Until recently, that is. I am not the best person to ask -- being no AI expert -- but I believe some of the most promising areas are: Semantic search and data mining (including text classification) Statistical machine translation 'Real intelligence' HTMs (read Jeff Hawkins ' On Intelligence ) Relevance / Recommendation engines (essentially a hybrid of data mining and network analysis) Visual object recognition
