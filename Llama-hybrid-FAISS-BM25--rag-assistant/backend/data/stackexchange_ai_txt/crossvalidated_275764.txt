I agree with Dilip. You will need to present your project and questions clearly before other readers will respond. As for the responses you'll receive here, they will provide guidance only and will not do the work for you. As for a coding language, I highly recommend using Matlab in this case. It's a high-level language and as such you can work more directly with machine learning concepts and methods, which I think is the point of the project. There will definitely be a learning curve involved, but I think Matlab will be far more welcoming and less tedious than the other options you've mentioned.
