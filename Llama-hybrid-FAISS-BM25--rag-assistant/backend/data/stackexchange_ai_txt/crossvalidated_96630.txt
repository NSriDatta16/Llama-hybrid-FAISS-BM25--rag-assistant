Yes, you could. But there are easier ways to distinguish men from women. Assume that you find a significant difference of 4 inches between men and women, with respective average heights of 5'9" and 5'5". Then a sensible decision rule would be to assume maleness to anyone 5'7" or over. This is basically the approach taken by discriminant analysis. But the big question is: how often do I make a mistake by this method? The answer to that depends on the variances of the height distributions, which in your example, allow for a considerable overlap between the two populations and a big probability of false classification. Recall that your hypothesized "significant difference" assumes that you took a sample of male and female heights. Given a real difference and a sufficiently large sample size, you will get a significant result. Basically, significance depends on the distribution of the sample averages; classification success depends on the distribution of the individual. So you can have a statistically significant result, but a totally crappy classifier.
