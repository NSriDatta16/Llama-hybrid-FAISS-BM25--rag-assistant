You are looking for a multinomial logistic regression model. These models are very easy to code in any programming language: both fitting the model and producing Wald, Likelihood, and Score tests for the inclusion of a set of covariates (or a general linear hypothesis). For the amateur, you can use the ${\tt multinom}$ function in the ${\tt nnet}$ package since you are using ${\tt R}$ .
