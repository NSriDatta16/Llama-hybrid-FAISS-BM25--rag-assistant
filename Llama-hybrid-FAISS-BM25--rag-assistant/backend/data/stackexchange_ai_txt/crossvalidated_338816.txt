95% confidence interval for log odds

I'm looking at data from the O-Ring Challenger disaster and wasn't sure how to get a 95% confidence interval for a particular estimated log odds. In this case, I'm considering a logistic regression model where a success was an O-Ring failure. If I wanted the estimated log odds of a particular O-ring failing at a takeoff temperature of 60 degrees, I know that it would be $x'\beta=$ $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 60 \end{bmatrix} $ $\begin{bmatrix} 5.085 \\ -0.1156 \end{bmatrix}$ = -1.851 However, if I want a 95% confidence interval for these odds, should I be looking at the 95% confidence limits for intercept and temp in the table and choosing the values to maximise and minimise those odds or should I be considering something along the lines of -1.851 $\pm$ 1.96 $\sqrt{Var(intercept)+3600Var(temp)}$?
