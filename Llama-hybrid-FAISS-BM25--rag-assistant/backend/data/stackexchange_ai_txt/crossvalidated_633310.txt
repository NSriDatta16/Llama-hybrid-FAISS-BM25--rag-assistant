Interpretation of logistic regression slope

I am running a logistic mixed model with a binary outcome (correct/incorrect). I have two fixed effect predictors: Condition (0, ‘low’ vs 1, ‘high) Sumspq (a continuous questionnaire score) There is a random intercept for participants. Participants complete trials in each condition and each have a single sumspq score. The model: Correct ~ sumspq*Condition+ (1|participant) My question: How do I interpret the regression slopes for the main effects? E.g., is the main effect of sumspq the effect of this variable on the log-odds when Condition is ‘low’ (0)? I have grand mean centered both Condition and sumspq as recommended in the literature. However, I have read that this only changes the intercept.
