iPhone Autorotate: Replace rotation animation with fade-in/fade-out?

Someone else asked a similar question previously, but I am interested in knowing whether the autorotate feature of the iPhone SDK will allow us to replace the rotation animation with another transition, such as a fade-in/fade-out. For a modal view, we can set the modalTransitionStyle but there is no such property for autorotate. If I can't leverage the built-in functionality, how else can I implement this functionality?
