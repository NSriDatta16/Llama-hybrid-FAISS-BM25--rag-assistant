The most important part of that paragraph is: If you are trying to return values on the stack below the return address (...) In other words, don't return pointers to data that is only valid within the scope of that function. This was probably something you had to worry about before C standardized how a function returned a struct by value. Now, it's part of the C99 standard (6.8.6.4) and you shouldn't worry about it. And return by value is fully supported in C++ for a while now. Otherwise, many STL implementation details would simply not work properly.
