Classifying data in R

I'm using R and I want to use some type of machine learning technique (SVM, perhaps) to classify data. I have data that looks like this, for example [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 3 4 5 6 0 [2,] 2 6 7 3 1 [3,] 7 1 4 6 1 [4,] 3 4 5 9 0 Where columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 are variables with some provided data, and column 5 is the classification. So, data entry 1 has values 3, 4, 5, and 6 for the four variables, and is classified as a 0. Classifications can be either 0 or 1. I want to be able to build an SVM so that given a new set of variables, it will classify it as "0" or "1" What is the best way to do this?
