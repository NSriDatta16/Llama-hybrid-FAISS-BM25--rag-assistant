Relative Variable Importance with Model Averaging

I am doing occupancy analysis for mammals using data derived from camera traps. I've fit the model using Rmark, dredged for the p covariates by fixing psi covariates, then performed model averaging to determine which p covariates I should keep. the results for the full averaged model gives me this relative variable importance: Relative variable importance: Psi(Phase) p(WeekDay) p(Trail) Psi(Zone) p(DetectionDist) Psi(Phase:Zone) Importance: 0.53 0.47 0.38 0.34 0.28 0.01 N containing models: 24 20 19 24 20 8 Is there a rule of thumb about what the importance should be for those covariates which I should discard? To me, it looks like all the p covariates should be retained but the Psi covariate of (Phase:Zone) should be discarded, although I dont know if I can make this assumption since this was dredged fixing the psi covariates. Thoughts?
