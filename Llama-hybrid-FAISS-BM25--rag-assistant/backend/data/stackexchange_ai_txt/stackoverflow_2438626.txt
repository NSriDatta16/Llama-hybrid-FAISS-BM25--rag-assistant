After a bit of tinkering I realised that nothing can be dragged within stack panel to the right not being coverd by other elements .. unless you drag the very right item.. What I did to resolve it: Created a visual cue (half transparent shape of a generic item to represnt it during the drag operation) Made the cue invisible (width=0) and keep it always as the very last element of the stack panel children Subscribed the stack panel to mouse left button up, down, move Emulated drag/drop with code Once the drag initated I turn the cue to visible and set its translate transform to the current mouse coordinates Adjust translate transform on every mouse move event On drop I hide the cue again and rearrange items in a way I want. To stress again - whatever way you do - you have to manipulate with the last element in StackPanel.Children collection ....
