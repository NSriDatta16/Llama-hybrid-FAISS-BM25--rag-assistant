the "org-preview-latex-fragment" command in emacs org-mode

5here is a command named org-preview-latex-fragment in org-mode . its default binding key is C-c C-x C-l . In the org manual, it says this command could preview a latex fragment inline. but after using it, nothing is produced but blank frames (I can't upload images, sorry). What happened? I'm using emacs23.1 on Ubuntu10.10, the org-mode version is 6.21b, and I've installed dvipng version 1.13-1. I tried trace the code, but got lost. How can I fix this?
