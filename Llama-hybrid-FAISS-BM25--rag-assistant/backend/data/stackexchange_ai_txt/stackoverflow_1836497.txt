VB6 convert to VB.net Variant question

I have been tasked to convert out VB6 program to VB.NET. In my research online everyone seems to say I need to go through my code and get rid of any Variants I have. I have had pretty good luck so far, but I am having an issue in replacing this one. Private Sub lvThumbView_OLEDragDrop(Data As MSComctlLib.DataObject) Dim File As Variant For Each File In Data.Files Select Case UCase(right(File, 3)) Case "JPG", "BMP" ..... End Select Next File End Sub I am still pretty new to VB (either 6 or .net) and I am having a hard time finding an alternative for this. Will the convert tool in VB.net handle this just fine? Or do I need to change this? If I do, is there a better alternative for this? Forgive my noobness. Thank you in advance.
