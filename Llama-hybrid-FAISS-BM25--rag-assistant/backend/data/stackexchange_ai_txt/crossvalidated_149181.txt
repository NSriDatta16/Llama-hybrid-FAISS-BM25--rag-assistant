Does this ARMA-inspired time process have a name?

I have to estimate a price time series for my thesis. We found that the price is reasonably well described by a process on this form, which looks like an ARMA(p, q) process but has an extra term: $$x_t = \mu + \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^q \beta_i \varepsilon_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t + \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^r \gamma_i y_{t-i}}_\text{this is new}$$ The $y_t$'s are exogenous input. Does this kind of process have a name, and if so, could anyone provide pointers to relevant literature about it? Also, statistics and time series analysis is really not my forte, so if anyone could provide input on (1) what properties this series has and (2) whether this model is a sensible at all, that would be great. Thanks in advance.
