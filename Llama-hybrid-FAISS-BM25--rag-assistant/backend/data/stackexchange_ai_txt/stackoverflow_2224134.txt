An Array is indeed a natural fit. I think it is acceptable to throw OverflowException, when you run out of place in your memory. The teacher will see attention to detail. A multiplication roughly doubles digit numbers, addition increases it by at most 1. It is easy to create a sufficiently big Array to store the result of your operation. Carry is at most a one-digit long number in multiplication (9*9 = 1, carry 8). A single int will do.
