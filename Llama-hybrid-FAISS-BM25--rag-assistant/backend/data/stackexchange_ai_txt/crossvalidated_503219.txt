How to choose the within factor in Fixed effect model

I am doing a fixed effect model to research on supportâ€™s effect on reducing number of injured employees. I have a dataset on company level from 2012-2020: year average age total salary total number of employees Segment Industry Risk Index support total number of Injured employees company A ID 2012 45 5 Million 55 S IT 1 0 1 company B ID 2012 48 40M 500 B Service 3 0 20 There are approx. 30k companies, and 10 industries. Should I do the within industry fixed effect model, or within company fixed effect model? And what is the difference in interpretation of results between these two?
