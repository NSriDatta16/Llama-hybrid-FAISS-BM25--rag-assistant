Since structure member padding and alignment are always implementation defined, you should never make any assumptions about the sizof a struct (even between different versions of the same compiler on the same platform, or the same compiler with different optimisation settings). If you need specific alignment and packing, you must use compiler specific directives to achieve this. This may be by command-line compilation option, #pragma directive or in GCC and some other compilers __attribute__ specifications. Or perhaps more robustly (but more work) use data serialisation.
