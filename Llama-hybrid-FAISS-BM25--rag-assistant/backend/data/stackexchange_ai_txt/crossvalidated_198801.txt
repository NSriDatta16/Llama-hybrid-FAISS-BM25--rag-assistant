Improving Logistic Regression model's summary output

Logistic Regression using R's glm package is giving me the following summary (snap of the few first variables). My Data Set: Dimensions: 1252 rows and 224 columns (after using model.matrix). The Data has been standardized. Response variable is binary. Trying to predict if an employee will leave the company, based on employee attributes My Understanding: The model does not give a good fit because: Residual Deviance > Null Deviance. p.value = 1 - pchisq(3676.5, 817) turns out to be 0. The first warning about 0 or 1 fitted probability message suggests that due to some predictor(s) the model might be giving perfect predictions Second warning on ‘rank deficiency’ suggests that there might be predictors that are linearly dependent on one another. My Questions: How can I improve the model? I would like to see Residual Deviance Why do I have such extreme coefficient values? Many answers to other posts state that ‘AIC’ is used to compare different The summary parameters (coefficients , std error and p-values) for many dummy factors obtained via model.matrix, like GSS_SEXM, is shown as 'NA'. Why is it so? logistic models. What is meant by ‘different’ here? Models trained on different data sets that bear different coefficients, like say different set of attributes?
