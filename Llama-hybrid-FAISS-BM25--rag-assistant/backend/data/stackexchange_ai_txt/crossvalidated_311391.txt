ETS model for time series forecasting in Java

I am trying to develop a time series forecasting model in Java. Is there any reliable guide explaining the ETS model algorithm in detail? I am not able to find any existing reliable java API for ETS model. P.S. : my knowledge in statistics is very limited. Pardon me if this is a very naive question.
