Solr JavaScript transformers and special characters (æ, ø, and å)

I am running Solr 1.4 with the Jetty web server. I have a transformer, written in JavaScript in my data-config.xml file, that looks as follows: Basically, what I am trying to do is to replace 'RØD' and 'RED' with 'Rød', and 'SORT' and 'BLACK' with 'Sort' before I add itemColor to the Solr index. ('SORT' is black and 'RØD' is red in Danish). But for some reason the else-if part is never true, although itemColor has the value 'RØD'. There are no problems updating itemColor when the value is 'SORT' or 'BLACK'. I suspect it has something to do with special characters (Æ, Ø, and Å). I have tried with colors that contains those characters and it fails every time. What is the solution?
