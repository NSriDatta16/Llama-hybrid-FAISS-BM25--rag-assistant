How to interpret RMSE to evaluate a regression model

I am trying to evaluate a regression model (random forests); my understanding is that R^2 (coefficient of determination) is not a good measure of fitness since my dataset is non-linear. It looks like RMSE is the usual choice, but how do I know what is a 'good' value? Furthermore, it seems that RMSE is sensitive to the scale of the data?? I don't have a baseline model to compare to unfortunately. edit: perhaps I use learning curves to determine if it is underfit or overfit ?
