The most commonly used way to visualize $t$-test-like comparison is to use boxplots . Below I provide example using dataset describing "relationship between marijuana smoking and a deficit in performance on a task measuring short term memory" from this site . > nonsmokers smokers > t.test(nonsmokers, smokers) Welch Two Sample t-test data: nonsmokers and smokers t = 2.2573, df = 16.376, p-value = 0.03798 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.1628205 5.0371795 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 20.1 17.5 Actually, boxplots are commonly used for "informal" hypothesis testing, for example as described by Yoav Benjamini in 1988 paper Opening the Box of a Boxplot : The regular boxplot is supplemented by an approximate confidence interval for the median of the batch, shown as a pair of wedges taken out of the sides of the box. These confidence intervals are constructed in such a way that when two notches of different boxplots do not overlap their medians are significantly different. (...) Since the formula for the confidence interval is a constant times the interquartile range divided by the square root of the batch size, the latter can be perceived from the length of the wedges relative to the length of the box. See also: T-test using only summary data in a box plot This plot does not show quantities directly involved in $t$-test, as @NickCox noticed. If you want direct comparison of means with confidence intervals you can use bar plot with marked confidence intervals. Using means and confidence intervals also enables you to conduct hypothesis test (see here or here ). As you can see from other posts and comments under this thread, both boxplots and dynamite plots are somewhat controversial choice, so let me give you one more alternative that was not mentioned yet. First, recall that $t$-test and regression are related . You can plot $t$-test-like comparison as two points with errorbars (confidence intervals) that are connected with line. Slope of the line is proportional to regression slope if you used linear regression rather than $t$-test in this situation. Major advantage of such plot is that it enables you to easily judge the magnitude of difference of means by looking at the slope of the line. It's disadvantage may be that it may suggest that there is some "continuity" between the means (i.e. that you had paired samples). Boxplots seem to be more commonly used since they provide more information about the distribution of variables visualized (comparing to mean with confidence interval only). They also complement rather than duplicate the information from $t$-test and such usage of plot is encouraged by most style guides, e.g. by Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association : The first consideration is the information value of the figure in the text of the paper in which it is to appear. If the figure does not add substantively to the understanding of the paper or duplicates other elements of the paper, it should not be included.
