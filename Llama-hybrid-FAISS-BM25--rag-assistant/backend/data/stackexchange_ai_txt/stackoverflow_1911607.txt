I assume you want to keep your interface basically the same -- left, right, and top sections always stay in the same position, and the center section can scroll down if necessary. If that's true, I'd try the following layout: Design the page to put the left, right and top sections in their own divs, and the center section in a scrolling div by using "overflow: auto". Break the left, right and top divs into their own PHP files and include them in every page. So each page would include those files, and then define the unique content in the scrollable div. Admittedly it's not the most elegant solution (I prefer using a library such as Apache Tiles in Java ). But it has worked well for me in the past. A key to making this maintainable is to make each include file start with the tag for that section, and end with the tag for that section. Writing include files that start and end on different levels, or leaving divs open that must be closed in another file, is a cause of major headaches.
