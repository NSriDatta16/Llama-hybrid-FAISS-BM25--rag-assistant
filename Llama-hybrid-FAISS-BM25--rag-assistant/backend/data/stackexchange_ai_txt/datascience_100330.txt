Unknown words is an integral part of bringing NLP models to production. I recommend considering these methods: remove unknowns - the most trivial way to handle unknown words - just delete them. this is not optimal because of trivial reasons so let's continue. unknown tag - add new word to your vocabulary that represent unknown words, you can call it [UNK]. It is recommended to replace some rare words during training with [UNK] for robustness. characters - work in character level instead of word level. BPE - an algorithm that enables you to split words to subcomponents in a smart way, and leaves no unknown words. You get the best of both world - word level, characters level and now also subword level. Each one of these methods has pros and cons and I recommend reading more about them.
