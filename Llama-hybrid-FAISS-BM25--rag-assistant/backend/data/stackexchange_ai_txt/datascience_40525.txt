If you just have a normal correlation table (Which I am not sure about) you can do it like this: For every row you can add a correlation of the organ in a row to other organs. So you will have Week Baby Age Organ Date IssueFound Problem Type Organ1 Organ2 Organ3 ... 2 Baby2 A0 Organ2 06/24/16 1 F 0.5 0 0.3 ... If you do not have a row for a new baby you should then format the data this way together with other parameters. The Corr_Organ1 an aggregation of all correlations that lead to Organ1 failure. Baby X-Type_cells Organ1 Organ1_time Organ2 Organ2_time Corr_Organ1 Corr_Organ2 ... Baby1 1024 Yes 06/24/16 No nan 0.2 0 ... Then you make iterations: First forecast everything with zero correlations. Then when you calculate the first forecast and Organ 1 failed you update all other correlations. Starting data: Baby X-Type_cells Organ1 Organ1_time Organ2 Organ2_time Corr_Organ1 Corr_Organ2 ... Baby1 1024 nan nan nan nan 0 0 ... After first iteration: Baby X-Type_cells Organ1 Organ1_time Organ2 Organ2_time Corr_Organ1 Corr_Organ2 ... Baby1 1024 yes xxx no nan 0 0.8 ... Then you predict again based on correlations and get the following result: Baby X-Type_cells Organ1 Organ1_time Organ2 Organ2_time Corr_Organ1 Corr_Organ2 ... Baby1 1024 yes xxx yes nan 0.2 0.8 ... You repeat those iterations until you do not change anything. The aggregation of correlations could be just a sum or something more complicated.
