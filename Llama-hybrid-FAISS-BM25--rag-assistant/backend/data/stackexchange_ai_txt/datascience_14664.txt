Neural network with flexible number of inputs?

Is it possible to create a neural network which provides a consistent output given that the input can be in different length vectors? I am currently in a situation where I have sampled a lot of audio files, which are of different length, and have to train a neural network provides me the desired output given a certain input. I am trying to create a regression network that can generate MFCC feature, given samples of an audio file, which are of different length, which makes different numbered input.
