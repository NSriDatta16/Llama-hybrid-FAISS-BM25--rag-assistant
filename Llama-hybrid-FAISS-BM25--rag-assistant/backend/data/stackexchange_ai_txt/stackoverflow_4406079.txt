I suspect that you set the value on the browser site, not on the background site. Both pages have a different window object and therefore a different localStorage so what happens is that you background page tries to read a value that wasn't set. Example: > localStorage['foo'] undefined > JSON.parse(undefined) SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL To fix it, you need to set the localStorage data in the background page.
