You may experiment with two representations of the problem. 1- Group ECG channels of one class together and label class A as 1 and class B as 2. So, the target variable is composed of two classes only. Now, you may apply some feature ranking methods which are independent of the classification process. For example, you have mRmR and JMI. 2- Every channel is a separate class and for each channel, there are two groups i.e. normal and abnormal singals. This can be viewed as a hierarchical solution. So, you start by classifying the signal into one of the 3 channels. After that, you progress by classifying the signal into A or B. You need to pay attention that for different representations, the target variable differs and that may lead to different subsets of the selected features.
