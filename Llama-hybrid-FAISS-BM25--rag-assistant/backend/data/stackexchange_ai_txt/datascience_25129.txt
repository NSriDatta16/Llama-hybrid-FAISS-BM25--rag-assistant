Welcome to the site! As you have mentioned that you are an Instructor of Statistics I think you can directly start with different methodologies/techniques available. As @Emre has suggested it would be better if you can work on different project available on Kaggle , Analytics Vidya . You would be exposed to most of the necessary things in Data Science field. Following R-Bloggers , will expose you to the latest packages. Ofcourse following Data Science Exchange. You can doing small projects on different datasets on UCI . For experimenting using different techniques. These are just couple of things which would help you to be updated. Follow them for atlest next 2-3 months then you can access yourself.
