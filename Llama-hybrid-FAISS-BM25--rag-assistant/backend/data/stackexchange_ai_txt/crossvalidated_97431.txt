This is a test of homoscedasticity. And because this is a time-series, the appropriate choice is the Breuschâ€“Pagan test, not the F-test. This test only answers ONLY the question of equality of precision between the two devices. Level of precision is another way of thinking of variance. [Edit: Changed the test to the correct one, considering the time-dependence]
