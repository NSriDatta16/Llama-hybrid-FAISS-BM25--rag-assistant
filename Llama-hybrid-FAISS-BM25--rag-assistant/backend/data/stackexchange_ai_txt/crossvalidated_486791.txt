Assumptions do matter for regression whether it is used for inference (as is most common in statistics) or prediction (as is most common in machine learning). However, the sets of assumptions are not the same; successful prediction requires less restrictive assumptions than sensible inference does. The post "T-consistency vs. P-consistency" illustrates one of the assumptions that is needed for predictive success. If the so-called predictive consistency fails, prediction with regression will fail. Why is so little attention paid to assumptions in machine learning context? I am not sure. Perhaps the assumptions for successful prediction are quite often satisfied (at least approximately), so they are less important. Also, it might be a historical reason, but we might also see some more discussion of assumptions in future texts (who knows).
