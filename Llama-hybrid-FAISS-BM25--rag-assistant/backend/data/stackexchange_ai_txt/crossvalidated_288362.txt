Regression with Logistic / Count Data

I have data from an experiment that I'm trying to figure out what to do with, I'm hoping someone can provide some guidance. Each experimental subject is from one of two groups, 'A' or 'B'. Each subject runs through a series of trials, labelled "t_1" to "t_30". For each trial, the subject is given information and chooses either "true" or "false". My hypothesis is that subjects from group 'B' are more likely to choose "true" than subjects from group 'A' are, and I need to find a way test this hypothesis. It should be noted that there are inherent differences between trials (t_1 to t_30) that make everyone more or less likely to pick "true" for one trial compared to another, so I would like to account for the trial number as some sort of random effect. I tried a mixed logistic regression for this, something like: choose_true ~ group + (group | trial) But the model had a pseudo-R^2 of something around 0.002 which is clearly an awful model. I could look at this a different way, as "count" data (i.e. each subject picks "true" on X number of trials), not sure what to do with that though. Someone suggested a Poisson regression, but I believe that assumes that the variance and mean are equal, which is not the case with this data. Any ideas on an appropriate analysis?
