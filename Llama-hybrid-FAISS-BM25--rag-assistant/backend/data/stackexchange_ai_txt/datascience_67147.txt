Standard data augmentation techniques add noise to the data. For example in images - 1) Adding gaussian noise. 2) Taking the negative of the samples. 3) Transitioning the image vertically/horizontally might help augment the data but may not represent the real data distribution you are trying to fit your model to. A generative model tries to capture/fit the real data distribution rather than the samples which are picked from it. So that the discriminator gets fooled by it. Hence it is said to be generative ADVERSARIAL. That is the thing about GANs, getting a 50/50 prob of being real on each of the generated samples and real samples tells that the discriminator cannot distinguish between them and hence the generated data distribution has completely replicated the real data distribution(ideally). That indeed is a necessary (if not exhaustive) condition required for a generator to augment data. Hence a completely trained generative model(although very tough to train via GANs) is better to augment your data.
