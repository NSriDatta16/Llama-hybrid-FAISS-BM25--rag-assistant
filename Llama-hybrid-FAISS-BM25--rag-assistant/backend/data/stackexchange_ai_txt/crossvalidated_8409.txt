I would always remember, that MCMC is just a numerical integration tool (and a rather inefficient one at that). It is not some magic/mystical thing. It is very useful because it is reasonably easy to apply. It does not require much thinking compared to some other numerical integration techniques. For instance, you do not have to do any derivatives. You only have to generate "random numbers". However, like any numerical integration method, it is not a universal catch all tool. There are conditions when it is useful, and conditions when it isn't. It may be wiser to set up another technique. Depending on how big $h$ is, and how fast your computer is, and how much time you are prepared to wait for results. A uniform grid may do the job (although this requires small $h$ or a long amount of waiting). The "job" is to evaluate the integral - the equation does not care what meaning you or I attach to the result (and hence it does not care whether we obtained the result randomly or not). Additionally, if your estimates of $\omega$ are quite accurate, the $f(\omega)$ will be sharply peaked and closely resemble a delta function, so the integral is effectively substituting $\omega\rightarrow\omega_{max}$. Another numerical integration technique is using a taylor series under the integral. $f(\omega)\approx f(\omega_{max})+(\omega-\omega_{max})f'(\omega_{max})+\frac{1}{2}(\omega-\omega_{max})^{2}f''(\omega_{max})+\dots$ This is a useful strategy when the moments of $\omega$ are easily obtained. Edwin Jaynes has a nice quote on this: whenever there is a randomised way of doing something, there is a non-randomised way which yields better results, but requires more thinking One "more thinking" way is to use "stratified MCMC" to do the integral. So rather than "randomly" pick a spot on the whole parameter space: divide it up into "strata". These "strata" should be picked so that you get a good range of the high part of the integral. Then randomly sample within each strata. But this will require you to write your own code I would imagine (i.e. more thinking).
