This is used so often during sales presentations. For instance, KLoC (Kilo Lines of Code) or LoC is used to demonstrate the kind of competence the vendor organization has with large/complex systems. This is especially true when the vendor is attempting to showcase their ability to MAINTAIN complex legacy systems. As part of negotiation, sometimes the customer organization provides a representative chunk of code to execute a Proof of Concept with the vendor to test the vendor's capability.This representative code will have enough complexities for the vendor company to handle and its sales pitch about "maintaining systems with several million LoC" can come under the radar. So, yes, Lines of Code is used and abused during sales presentations and hence a useful metric in sales.
