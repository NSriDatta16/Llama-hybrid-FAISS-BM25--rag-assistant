To make a grid with a fixed size, it's best to use a two-dimensional array. If you world consists of objects of type Place , for instance, you would define this as Place[,] worldGrid = new Place[width, length]; . Place would be a type that might contain sheep or wolves or grass. enum Organism { Wolf, Sheep, Grass }; class Place { public List Inhabitants { get; set; } }
