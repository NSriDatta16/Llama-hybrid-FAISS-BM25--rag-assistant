You do not need to use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. If you are using uniform prior distributions then you are doing something very similar as maximum likelihood estimation on a restricted space for the parameters $a$ and $b$ . $$P(a,b;d) = P(d;a,b) \frac{P(a,b)}{P(d)} = \mathcal{L}(a,b;d) \times const $$ where $\frac{P(a,b)}{P(d)}$ is a constant (independent from $a$ and $b$ ) and it can be found by scaling the likelihood function such that it integrates to 1. The log likelihood function, for $n$ iid variables $d_i \sim GN(0,a,b)$ is: $$\log \mathcal{L}(a,b;d) = -n \log(2a) - n \log\left(\frac{\Gamma(1/b)}{b} \right) - \frac{1}{a^b} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( d_i \right)^b $$ For this function it should not be too difficult to plot it and find a maximum.
