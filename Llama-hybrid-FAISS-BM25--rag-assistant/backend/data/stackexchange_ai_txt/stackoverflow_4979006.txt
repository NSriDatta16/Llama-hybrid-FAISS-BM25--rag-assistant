You can set a delegate to an UIScrollView object. It could be any object, but usually the view controller object of your view. Set the delegate in, say, viewDidLoad in the view controller like the following. aScrOllView.delegate = self; Then, implement delegate methods in the view controller defined in UIScrollViewDelegate protocol. Specifically you will be interested in scrollViewDIdEndDragging:willDecelerate: and scrollViewDidEndDecelerating because they are called when the scrolling has done. In these method, you can do whatever you need for scrolling inputs.
