How do you centralize ELMAH logs

At my works we produce websites like they are going out of fashion (ie a lot of sites per year) I want to install ELMAH on all of these as company practice and then log everything centrally for viewing by our developers. The process has to be really easy as otherwise its use won't take off. I was thinking of setting up a central Google Reader account and hooking all the RSS feeds for the ELMAH installations into it. my concern is that Google says that they only check about once an hour, and this means that if you are using the "in memory" storage for ELMAH there is a chance that the errors will be missed when an app pool restarts. Email is pretty good, but if everyone starts recieving ELMAH error messages they'll start to ignore them - maybe i could setup an extra exchange mailbox JUST for this to keep things seperate? your thoughts will be greatly appreciated (ps this MAY be thought of as subjective - but i believe that someone probably has THE answer among a number of subjective answers, making it a valid question)
