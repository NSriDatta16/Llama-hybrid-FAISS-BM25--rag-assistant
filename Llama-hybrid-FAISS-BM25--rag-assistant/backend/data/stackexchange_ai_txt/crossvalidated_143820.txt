Significance of a cluster with respect to the whole dataset

I mainly am a machine learning guy and my knowledge of statistics is a bit limited. I have a (small) dataset of objects described by two categorical variables: $$ \begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline & \mathsf{'l'} & \mathsf{'u'} & \mathsf{'b'} & \mathsf{Tot} \\ \hline \mathsf{'2'} & 15 & 9 & 9 & 33 \\ \hline \mathsf{'3'} & 8 & 5 & 2 & 15 \\ \hline \mathsf{Tot} & 23 & 14 & 11 & 48 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ that obtaining a partition of 6 clusters. One of which is interesting from my point of view: $$ \begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline & \mathsf{'l'} & \mathsf{'u'} & \mathsf{'b'} & \mathsf{Tot} \\ \hline \mathsf{'2'} & 8 & 3 & 2 & 13 \\ \hline \mathsf{'3'} & 3 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\ \hline \mathsf{Tot} & 11 & 3 & 2 & 16 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ From a perspective of frequencies in the whole dataset the probability of obtaining an object of type ('l', '2') is $p_D=P(r=\mathsf{'2'} \wedge c=\mathsf{'l'} )=\frac{15}{48}=0.3125$, whereas for the cluster is $p_C=P(r=\mathsf{'2'} \wedge c=\mathsf{'l'} )=\frac{8}{16}=0.5$ which is an increase of $\frac{p_C}{p_D}=1.6$. Now, I have been asked about the significance of this "enrichment" given by the clustering with respect to the whole dataset. I was thinking about a randomization test in which I build the null distribution assigning randomly the cluster labels and calculating the the ratio $\frac{p_{C'}}{p_D}$ (where $C'$ is the randomized clustering) and testing the probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining a ratio of value at least of $1.6$. Do you think this is a valid procedure? Can you suggest something better?
