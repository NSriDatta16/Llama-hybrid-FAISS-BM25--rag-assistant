I think that the difference is that you are starting to " generate " stuff, the name gives it away. The key difference with GAN is that you have two different models which compete against each other, but at the very end you'll get a win-win situation from this. The innovative part is the competition. With GAN you have two models, where the output from one model is the input to the other. You'll have a zero-sum game , which is different from a "classical" optimization problem. It's believed that they will be helpful in the process of generating realistic input data (really close to the original). One main problem of Deep Learning is often the lack of input data, with GAN this may change. Interesting articles: Hype around Dueling neural networks Interesting Use
