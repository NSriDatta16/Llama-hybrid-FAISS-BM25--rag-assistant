What is "noise" in observed data?

I am reading pattern Recognition and machine learning by Bishop and in the chapter about probability, "noise in the observed data" is mentioned many times. I have read on the internet that noise refers to the inaccuracy while reading data but I am not sure whether it is correct. SO, what actually is noise in observed data? And what is additive noise and Gaussian noise ?
