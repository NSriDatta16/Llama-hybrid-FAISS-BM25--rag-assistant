State Machines and User Interface work -- any examples/experience?

I'm looking for ways to de-spaghttify my front-end widget code. It's been suggested that a Finite State Machine is the right way to think about what I'm doing. I know a State Machine paradigm can be applied to almost any problem. I'm wondering if there are some experienced UI programmers who actually make a habit of this. So, the question is -- do any of you UI programmers think in terms of State Machines in your work? If so, how? thanks, -Morgan
