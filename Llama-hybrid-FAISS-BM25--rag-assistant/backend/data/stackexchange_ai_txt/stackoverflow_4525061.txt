Converting to JQUERY from Prototype

I currently have a Rails website that has some Prototype scripting in it. My boss however wants me to to convert the page so that it uses the JQUERY library instead. I don't have too much experience in programming in Javascript so I am a bit confused. I basically downloaded a plugin called 'jrails' that helps move over the helpers that are need from Prototype's 'script.aculo.us' and translates them into something JQUERY can understand Here are two codes: Prototype: new Form.Element.Observer('new_member_search', 0.5, function(element, value){ new Ajax.Updater('ProjectMemberNew', '/of/user/search', { asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, parameters:'username=' + encodeURIComponent(value) }); }); Jquery: $('#new_member_search').delayedObserver(0.5, function(element, value){ $.ajax({ data:'username=' + value, success:function(request){ $('#ProjectMemberNew').html(request); }, type:'post', url:'/of/user/search' }); }); The prototype code works fine, but the Jquery doesn't seem to run for some reason. I haven't changed anything in the View by the way, just included 'jrails' in the page. Any idea why this isn't working? Thanks, EDIT 1: So I ran some tests in Firebug and I'm thinking maybe I should have posted the original rails code: "function(drag_element, drop_element, event){ if (confirm(\"#{escape_javascript(_('This will remove User from this Group, are you sure?'))}\")) {#{remote_function(:update => 'module_content', :url => {:controller => :projects, :action => :member_delete, :id => @project.id}, :with => "'u=' + encodeURIComponent(drag_element.id)" )};} }", :accept => 'RolesUsersSelection', :hoverclass => "#{drop_class}_active" %> When I run the webpage on firebug, the jquery version is giving me a couple errors: Prototype is not defined [Break On This Error] linear: Prototype.K, effect...2478493 (line 71) $.effects is undefined [Break On This Error] $.effects.drop = function(o) { jquery...4111587 (line 15) $("#RemoveThisMember").droppable is not a function [Break On This Error] }, hoverClass:'ProjectRoleDropDelete_active'}) member_edit (line 323) $("#role_15_user_4").draggable is not a function [Break On This Error] $("#role_15_user_4").draggable({revert:true}) Something tells me I cant just transfer over to the jquery library without making any changes to the rails code..
