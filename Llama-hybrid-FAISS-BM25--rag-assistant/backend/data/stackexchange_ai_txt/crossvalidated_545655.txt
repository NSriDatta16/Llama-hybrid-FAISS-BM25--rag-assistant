Understanding the Importance of "Sufficiency" within Statistics

I am trying to better understand what it means to be a "sufficient statistic". "In statistics, a statistic is sufficient with respect to a statistical model and its associated unknown parameter if "no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter" . " Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic Based on this definition, here is how I conceptualize it: In a unimodal distribution, the "mean" provides more information about the unimodal distribution - relative to the amount of information provided by the "mean" in a biomodal distribution. Thus in this case, the "mean" is more of a sufficient statistic in a unimodal distribution compared to a biomodal distribution. For example, in a distribution of basketball player heights that is unimodal - the "mean" would well describe the average height of a basketball player. But if you were to have a distribution of heights corresponding to penguins, ostriches and giraffes - and this distribution was not unimodal, it is more likely that the "mean" would not sufficiently characterize the height of the average measurement in this sample. Is this interpretation correct?
