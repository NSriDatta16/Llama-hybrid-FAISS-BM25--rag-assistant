Best way to insert hundreds of DOM elements into the page dynamically while keeping performance high

I have a web app where we would be inserting hundreds of elements into the DOM Essentially, I'm doing $('#some_element').html(' '); repeatedly. In some cases I might need to do $('#some_element').appendTo('more html'); From previous experience inserting html text using the append or setting the innerHTML of an element is slow. I've heard that you can increase performance by first putting the elements in a DOM fragment and then moving its location to inside the element you want. The performance of this is key. Do you guys have any tips or suggestions on maximizing the performance? Any hacks I can do to make this fast? Edit: as mentioned in a comment: The app involves a real-time stream of various data, so it needs to be able to constantly add new DOM elements to represent the new data. (This might also lead to another problem of having too many DOM elements, so would need to elements that are too old).
