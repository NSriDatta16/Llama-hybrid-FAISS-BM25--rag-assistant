I'm not sure if there's a way to hook a Windows event, but simply polling System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses() at regular intervals (say, 100ms) and looking for new/removed processes (comparing by process ID) should do the job. Also, Process.StartTime will give you the time at which the process began. Caveat: This method may be require a higher amount of processing compare an event-based method (none of which I am aware). Processes that start and end between each poll will not be observed, but this ought to be quite rare indeed for a reasonably high polling frequency (and perhaps you do not even care about these processes anyway). Saying this, these are minor detractions, and I would recommend you at least test this solution as it is fairly simple.
