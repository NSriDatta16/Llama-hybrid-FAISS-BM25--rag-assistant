Is it "allowed"? Sure. Your model will focus more on class B than on class A, however. You can try assigning class weights to deal with this, so that the model will try harder to avoid misclassifying an A example than a B example, perhaps making the total weights of the classes equal; standard SVM software supports this easily. The advice here is applicable to SVMs as well as linear regression (though in SVMs, more than the intercept can change).
