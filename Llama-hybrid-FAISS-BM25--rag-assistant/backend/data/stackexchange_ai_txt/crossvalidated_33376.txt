Reading this one now: Predictive Analytics: Microsoft Excel By Conrad Carlberg Published Jul 2, 2012 by Que. ISBN-10: 0-7897-4941-6 ISBN-13: 978-0-7897-4941-3 I'm not done reading it yet, but so far its a good introduction to the topic for a non-stat person. It starts pretty basic with both stat concepts and Excel functionality and is building from there. On the Stats front, its going into a pretty healthy discussion of of using moving averages and smoothing to help determine signal/noise in time series. On the Excel front, its explaining how to build models using the above concepts (rather than just plunking a typical Excel trendline on a chart), and using some of Excels add-on functionality (e.g. Solver and Data Analysis).
