How to encode a sentence using an attention mechanism?

Recently, I read about one of the state-of-the-art method called Attention models. This method use a Encoder-Decoder model. It can find a better encoding for each word in a sentence. But how can I encode a full sentence? For example, I have a sentence "I love reading". After embedding, this sentence will be converted to list of three vectors. (or matrix with dimension number of words times embedding dimension ). After several layers of attention mechanism, I will still have the same matrix. How can I convert this matrix to a single vector that contains an encoded representation of the full sentence?
