What do you think of Data Science certifications?

I've now seen two data science certification programs - the John Hopkins one available at Coursera and the Cloudera one . I'm sure there are others out there. The John Hopkins set of classes is focused on R as a toolset, but covers a range of topics: R Programming cleaning and obtaining data Data Analysis Reproducible Research Statistical Inference Regression Models Machine Learning Developing Data Products And what looks to be a Project based completion task similar to Cloudera's Data Science Challenge The Cloudera program looks thin on the surface, but looks to answer the two important questions - "Do you know the tools", "Can you apply the tools in the real world". Their program consists of: Introduction to Data Science Data Science Essentials Exam Data Science Challenge (a real world data science project scenario) I am not looking for a recommendation on a program or a quality comparison. I am curious about other certifications out there, the topics they cover, and how seriously DS certifications are viewed at this point by the community. EDIT: These are all great answers. I'm choosing the correct answer by votes.
