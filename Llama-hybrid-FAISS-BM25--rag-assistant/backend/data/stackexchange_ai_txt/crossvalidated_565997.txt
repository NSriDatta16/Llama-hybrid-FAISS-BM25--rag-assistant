You are trying to estimate the MSE. You have "n" points, all of which are an unbiased estimate of the MSE. Even if you keep resampling and averaging, you cannot get a more efficient estimator of your MSE than what you already have from the test set. This is analogous to drawing 10 samples and estimating the population mean from the sample average - you cannot make a more (unbiased) efficient estimator than that one.
