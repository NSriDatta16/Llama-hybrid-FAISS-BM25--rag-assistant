.net drawing to bitmap using FillRectangle fails when Magenta

var bmp = new Bitmap(16, 16); var gBmp = System.Drawing.Graphics.FromImage(bmp ); Color col = Color.FromArgb(pdmsCol.Red, pdmsCol.Green, pdmsCol.Blue); gBmp.FillRectangle(new SolidBrush(col), new Rectangle(0, 0, 16, 16)); mColourPopupContainer.Image = bmp; Using the above code draws a rectangle into my control for given color. This works fine unless the color is Magenta in which case it seems to be drawn transparently. I guess this is something to do with bitmaps treating Magenta as transparent. How to I turn off this behaviour? mColourPopupContainer is a UserControl (custom color picker).
