I don't think you mean what you're saying. I don't think you are trying to predict the "state" of each sequence. A sequence of length, say $N$, will have $N$ states. And these are hidden, so you will only have several different ways of getting probability distributions over them. Judging by one of the tags, I think you want to use HMMs to "classify" different time series. See this thread. I suspect you will have a possibility of a bad (or good) state at each time point for each sequence. And in addition to that, each sequence, in its entirety, can be thought of as "good" or "bad." I know I'm going out on a limb here, but maybe in trying to abstract away some details of your application you accidentally introduced an equivocation here. Also I think you don't mean to call your time serieses "obs." If you do it's unclear. Each element of those lists is a time series. Each element/letter of each of those series is an observation. Otherwise, you do mean what you say and the whole list is one time series. In that case, each observation (of each series) needs to be the same length/dimension. You don't have this, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're just using terminology I am unaccustomed to.
