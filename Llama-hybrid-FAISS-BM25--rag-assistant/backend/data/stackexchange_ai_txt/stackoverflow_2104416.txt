You could do this in straight Javascript or in probably even easier in jQuery or something similar. Here's what I'd do in jQuery: $('#previewdiv').hover( function() { window.open( 'pdf_viewer.asp?document=whatever.pdf','PDF Window','width=640,height=500,etc ...'); }); You could open the PDF itself but it would give you less control over that window so embedding is probably the way to go. I would also suggest that you let your user click on the document instead of hovering. If they accidentally mouse over that can create load on your server and be annoying to the user. Not only that but most pop-up blockers block pop-ups on hover so your users might not ever see it. In my example above just change "hover" to "click" to do it that way.
