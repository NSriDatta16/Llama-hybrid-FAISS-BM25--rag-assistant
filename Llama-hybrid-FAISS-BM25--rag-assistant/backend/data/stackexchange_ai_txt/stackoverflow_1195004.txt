Have you looked at javax.sql.rowset.WebRowSet ? From the Javadocs: The WebRowSetImpl provides the standard reference implementation, which may be extended if required. The standard WebRowSet XML Schema definition is available at the following URI: http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jdbc/webrowset.xsd It describes the standard XML document format required when describing a RowSet object in XML and must be used be all standard implementations of the WebRowSet interface to ensure interoperability. In addition, the WebRowSet schema uses specific SQL/XML Schema annotations, thus ensuring greater cross platform inter-operability. This is an effort currently under way at the ISO organization. The SQL/XML definition is available at the following URI: http://standards.iso.org/iso/9075/2002/12/sqlxml
