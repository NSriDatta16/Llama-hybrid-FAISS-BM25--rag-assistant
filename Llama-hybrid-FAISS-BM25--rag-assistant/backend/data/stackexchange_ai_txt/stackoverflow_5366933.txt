CCLabelBMFont fnt file not working properly

so I have this: CCLabelBMFont *timeLabel = [[CCLabelBMFont alloc] initWithString:@"abc" fntFile:@"clean_3.fnt"]; in a CCScene init method using this font: http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/clean_35 which is TTF using this program to convert the format: http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ and tried http://www.n4te.com/hiero/hiero.jnlp . I'm getting: "Invalid texture for sprite" error. I have tried deleting the app off simulator and device and tried it again, same thing. Any help would be appreciated. I do not want to use CCLabelTTF since I'll be updating this text every frame.
