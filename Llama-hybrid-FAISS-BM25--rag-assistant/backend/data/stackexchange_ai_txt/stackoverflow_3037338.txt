Temporary tables get put into a schema called "pg_temp_NNN", where "NNN" indicates which server backend you're connected to. This is implicitly added to your search path in the session that creates them. Note that you can't access one connection's temp tables via another connection... so depending on how exactly pgAdmin organises its connections, even being able to find the tables in the object explorer might not be useful.
