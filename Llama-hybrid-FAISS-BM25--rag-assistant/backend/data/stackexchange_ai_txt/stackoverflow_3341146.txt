C99 has the new _Pragma keyword that lets you place #pragma inside macros. Basically it expects a string as an argument that corresponds to the text that you would have give to the #pragma directive. If your compiler doesn't support this (gcc does) and you'd go for an external implementation of what you need (as said, m4 could be a choice) the best would probably be to stay as close as possible to that not-so-new _Pragma . Then once your compiler builder catches up with the standard you could just stop using your script.
