It's not so much about running a separate model for each variable, but more about identifying the important covariates that you'll use to build your model. If you have categorical independent variables, I believe you can use a contingency table instead. However, for other types of data, it's probably best to fit them into a logistic regression one at a time and analyse the fit each time. This resource online is quite helpful is you need a little refresher: Building and Applying Logistic Regression Models
