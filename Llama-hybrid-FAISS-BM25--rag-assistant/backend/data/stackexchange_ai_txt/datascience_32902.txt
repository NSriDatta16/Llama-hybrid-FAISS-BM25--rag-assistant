You can not use PCA, or at least it is not recommended, for mixed data. It is best to use Factor analysis of mixed data . You are lucky that Prince is a Python package that covers all data scenarios, borrowing from its explanation: All your variables are numeric: use principal component analysis (prince.PCA) You have a contingency table: use correspondence analysis (prince.CA) You have more than 2 variables and they are all categorical: use multiple correspondence analysis (prince.MCA) You have groups of categorical or numerical variables: use multiple factor analysis (prince.MFA) You have both categorical and numerical variables: use factor analysis of mixed data (prince.FAMD) Check also this question/answers in stats.stackexchange or discussion in researchgate .
