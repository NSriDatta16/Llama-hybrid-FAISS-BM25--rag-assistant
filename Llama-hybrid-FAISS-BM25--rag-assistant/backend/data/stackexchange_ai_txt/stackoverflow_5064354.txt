Not without a huge hack, no. If you want to read both property values independently, they will have to be two different properties. How about a pragmatic solution like this: vl-wlp1.hk.oracle.com vl-wcfs.hk.oracle.com dev ${dev.host} stage ${stage.host} src/site/apt/index.apt: Dev Site: ${dev.host} Stage Site: ${stage.host} (The huge hack mentioned above would mean programmatically iterating over the current project's profiles and parsing each profile's properties manually, you could do that in a custom maven plugin or in a Groovy Script using GMaven )
