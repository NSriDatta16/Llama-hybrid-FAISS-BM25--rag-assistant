You can test each machine learning algorithm using cross-validation . Basically you split up your training data into a train and test data set. Run your algorithms on the train data set and see how they do on the test data sets. The accuracies of the algorithms on the cross-validation training set are approximations of the accuracies of the algorithms on unseen data.
