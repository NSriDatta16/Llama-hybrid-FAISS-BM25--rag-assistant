Do not worry about autocorrelation in feature scaling. Feature scaling is a numerical, not a statistical issue. Statistically, estimating the standard deviation from an autocorrelated time series requires special adjustments. Numerically, you just want the numbers to be on roughly the same scale for stability of algorithms.
