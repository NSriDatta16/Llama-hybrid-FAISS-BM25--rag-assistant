Nah includes are fine, nothing to worry about there. You might want to think about tweaking your caching headers a bit at some point, but unless you're getting significant hits it should be no problem. Assuming this is all static data, you could even consider converting the whole site to static HTML (easiest way: write a script that grabs every page via the webserver and dumps it out in a matching dir structure) Most web applications are limited by the speed of their database (or whatever their external storage is, but 9/10 times that'll be a database), the application code is rarely cause for concern, and it doesn't sound like you're doing anything you need to worry about yet.
