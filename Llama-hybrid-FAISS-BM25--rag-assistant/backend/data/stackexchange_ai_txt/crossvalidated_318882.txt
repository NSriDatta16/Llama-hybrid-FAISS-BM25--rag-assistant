What does average of word2vec vector mean?

The paper that I am reading says, tweet is represented by the average of the word embedding vectors of the words that compose the tweet. Does this mean each word in the tweet (sentence) has to be represented as the average of its word vector (still having the same length), or does it mean the sentence itself has to be the average of all values computed above (average of word vectors of the word that the sentence contains)? I am confused.
