Using your notation, if you have a time series of length $n$ and you want to compute the mutual information between this time series and the time series delayed by $k$ positions, you should match $n-k$ values: $$t_1 , t_{k+1}\\ t_2 , t_{k+2}\\ \vdots \\ t_{n-k} , t_{n} $$ Mutual information between delayed time series is often computed to infer biological networks (See here and here ). So you will compute mutual information on $n-k$ data points rather than $n$. Be careful though when comparing mutual information estimated on a different number of data points: its estimates might be inflated if $n$ is small (See here ).
