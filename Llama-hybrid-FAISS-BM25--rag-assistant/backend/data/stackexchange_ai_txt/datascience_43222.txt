As mentioned, the easiest way is to apply the StandardScaler to only the subset of features that need to be scaled, and then concatenate the result with the remaining features. Alternatively, scikit-learn also offers (a still experimental, i.e. subject to change) ColumnTransformer API. It works similar to a pipeline : from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.preprocessing import StandarScaler column_trans = ColumnTransformer( [('scaler', StandardScaler(),2], remainder='passthrough') column_trans.fit_transform(X) The third entry of the tuple (here : 2 ) can be a single or a list of column indices (or column names when working with a pandas DataFrame).
