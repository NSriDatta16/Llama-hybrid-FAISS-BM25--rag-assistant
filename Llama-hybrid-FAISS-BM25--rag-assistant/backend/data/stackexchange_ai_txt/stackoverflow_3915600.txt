Weblogic 10 and Struts 2.x problem - Javassist

Please help with this issue, I'm going mad... I'm trying to make a client-server web application using Weblogic 10 as an application server and IIS as a webserver (corporate constraints), with EJB 3 and Struts 2. I am however having strage problems which I cannot solve. Using Struts 2.2 I get the following stack trace while starting the server: (OgnlRuntime.java:165) [...] However, the Javassist package is clearly visible in the web classpath (/WEB-INF/lib direcotry) among all the other Struts-related libraries, I can also browse its packages and classes. I also put it in the CLASSPATH library and in Weblogic initializaion parameters but nothing works. I don't know what to think. Is this a Struts 2/Weblogic integration bug? Even weirder is the fact that initially I managed to make Struts 2 work. Then for some reason (I don't really know what for) it stopped and I can't get rid of that error. Thanks for your help.
