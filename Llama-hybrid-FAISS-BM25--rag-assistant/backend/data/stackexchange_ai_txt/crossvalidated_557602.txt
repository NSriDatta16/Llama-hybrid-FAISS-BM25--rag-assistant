On this forum, there are a lot of related questions and answers about flat priors, like the ones above . They are not uniform priors because they are not distributions but $\sigma$ -finite measures (with infinite mass) and they are not the most uninformative or non-informative priors for many reasons detailed in these answers (and Bayesian textbooks). If the posterior attached to the likelihood $f(x|\theta)$ and a flat (constant) prior $\pi(\theta)=c$ is well-defined, ie can be normalised into a probability density for almost all realisations of the random variable $X$ behind the observed data, $$\int_\Theta f(x|\theta)~\text d\theta then using this extension of the standard Bayesian framework is acceptable. Note: the question is unrelated to MCMC (although one should not use MCMC with an improper posterior ). The proper entry keyword is improper priors which is a section or a chapter of all Bayesian textbooks . Improper priors are $\sigma$ -finite measures $\pi(\cdot)$ (with infinite mass) that can be used as prior measures provided $$\int_\Theta f(x|\theta) \pi(~\text d\theta) A flat prior (over an unbounded space) is a particular case of improper prior but not a very special one since a flat prior does not stay constant under most reparameterisations ( changes of variables ).
