Suggested order to view WWDC 2010 videos

I got WWDC 2010 videos. However, there are 68 of them and thats for iPhone only with each video having an average of 50 mins. I know you can watch them independently depending on your interest. However, is there a suggested order in which to view them if you wanna watch all of them? Say as a new developer, I wanna view them and get a general idea about all the frameworks discussed. Should I view, for e.g., in order of session number in the file name of the videos(Starts at 101 and ends at 425. Session 101 - What's New in Cocoa Touch). Does that indicate the levels (like in university where 101 is the most basic course and 400s are the advanced courses)? Just wanted thoughts from the community.
