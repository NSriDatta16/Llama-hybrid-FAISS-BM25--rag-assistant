Limiting distribution of an ergodic Markov chain with finitely many states. First thing to check is that this matrix $\mathbf{P}$ is a stochastic matrix with rows summing to $1,$ which is true. Because the transition matrix has all positive elements, it describes an (aperiodic) ergodic Markov chain with a single class of intercommunicating states. [To ensure ergodicity, it is enough for some power $\mathbf{P}^k$ of $\mathbf{P}$ to have all positive elements; here it happens that $k = 1.$ ] Thus, your chain has a stationary distribution $\sigma = (\sigma_1,\sigma_2),$ such that $\sigma\mathbf{P} = \sigma.$ Solving two equations in two unknowns shows that $\sigma_1 = .75, \sigma_2 = 0.25.$ In particular, $\sigma_1 = p_{12}/(p_{12}+p_{21}) = 0.6/0.8 = 0.75.$ [See the Note at the the end for an intuitive argument.] Also, vector $\sigma$ is the limiting distribution of the chain, so that the car is clean on $75\%$ of the mornings. Finding $\mathbf{P}^8$ suggests this limiting distribution, because both its rows are approximately $\sigma.$ [Matrix multiplication in R.] P = matrix(c(.8,.2, .6,.4), byrow=T, nrow=2); P P2 = P %*% P; P2 [,1] [,2] [1,] 0.8 0.2 [2,] 0.6 0.4 P2 = P %*% P; P2 [,1] [,2] [1,] 0.76 0.24 [2,] 0.72 0.28 P4 = P2 %*% P2; P4 [,1] [,2] [1,] 0.7504 0.2496 [2,] 0.7488 0.2512 P8 = P4 %*% P4; P8 [,1] [,2] [1,] 0.7500006 0.2499994 [2,] 0.7499981 0.2500019 For ergodic chains with more than two states, it may be convenient to use eigen vectors to find the stationary distribution $\sigma.$ We want a left eigen vector and R finds right eigen vectors, so we use the transpose t(P) of P . The eigen vector with the largest modulus [given first] is proportional to $\sigma.$ [We use as.numeric to suppress superfluous complex-number notation in case some unused eigen vectors are complex.] v = eigen(t(P))$vectors[,1] sg = as.numeric(v/sum(v)); sg [1] 0.75 0.25 Note: Here is an intuitive view of the probability (proportion of the time) the car is clean: Suppose the car starts out dirty. Then by a geometric distribution argument it will wait on average $1/0.6 = 10/6$ days until it is washed. Then it will wait on average $1/.2 = 5$ days before it gets a muddy rain bath. So a "cycle length" from dirty back to dirty with have $10/6 + 5$ days on average. Of this period of time it will have been clean $5$ out of $10/6+10/2 = 40/6$ days. So, on average, it is clean $\frac{1/p_{21}}{1/p_{11}+1/p_{21}} =\frac{p_{12}}{p_{21}+p_{12}}=\frac{5}{40/6} = \frac{3}{4}$ of the time. [This kind of argument often works well with 2-state chains, but not so well for chains with more states, because there are so many different possible cycles among states to consider.]
