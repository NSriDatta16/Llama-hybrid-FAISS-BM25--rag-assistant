Deep learning - effects of preprocessing

I am new to the field of deep learning, and I was wondering, whether there exist any theorems/laws, which govern how various preprocessing techniques effect the learning process. I saw in some models, that values are beforehand scaled, or min-max-ed, yet I still do not have a clear picture as to what exactly works or does not. Thank you very much.
