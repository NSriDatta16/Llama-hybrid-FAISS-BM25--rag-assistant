It's good that you are using class weights to handle the class imbalance in your dataset. Class weights can help the model to learn from underrepresented classes better. However, you should also consider using other techniques to handle the class imbalance, such as undersampling the majority classes or oversampling the minority classes. Using the precision-recall curve (PRC) as the evaluation metric is a good choice for imbalanced classification problems, because it can give you a more complete picture of the model's performance on different classes. However, you should also consider using other metrics, such as the F1 score or the weighted average of the precision and recall scores, to get a more comprehensive view of the model's performance. It's also worth noting that the low validation PRC score may be due to the small size of your dataset. With only 500 rows, it may be difficult for the model to generalize well to unseen data. One way to improve the model's performance would be to gather more data, if possible. Another thing you could try is using different model architectures or optimization techniques to see if you can improve the model's performance. You might also want to try different preprocessing techniques, such as removing stop words or using different word embeddings, to see if they have an impact on the model's performance.
