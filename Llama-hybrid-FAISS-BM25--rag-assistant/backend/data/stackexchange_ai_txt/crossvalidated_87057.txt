Based on Dr. Harrell's suggestion, I tried Logarithmic and Brier scoring rule. Since libsvm does not support probability estimation on nu-svm, I had to do it with binary class SVM. Some notes on the result image: The proportion classified correctly is different with the '-b 1' option in training and testing. Since the other scoring rules are calculated with the '-b 1' , it makes more sense to compare the last three sub-figures; The maximal and minimal of the logarithmic and brier are the same ($\gamma$ $\approx 50$), at which the accuracy in sub-figure 2 is $0$, and in sub-figure 2 is $100 \% $. The functions are continuous but not monotone, so my concern in OP still exists. The figures with only 2 features as it was in the OP:
