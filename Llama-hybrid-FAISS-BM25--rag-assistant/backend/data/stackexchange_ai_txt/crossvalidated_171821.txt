The main difference between linear regression and logistic regression is the type of the response variable. Linear regression assumes the response variable is continuous (e.g. SAT scores, anywhere from 0 to 2400). Logistic regression assumes it is binary (zero or one; success or failure). Because I assume the test scores are continuous rather than just pass/fail, my answer to "Is correct to use logistic regression in this problem?" is "no." You would probably lose information by forcing your continuous measurements into a binary outcome.
