Why we always get different accuracy for a different number of training our model?

As the question says for example if I train my neural network (with 2 layers) model the first time it gives me a score $A \in \mathbb{R}$ and when I train the same model again it gives a different score $B \in \mathbb{B}$ . This is very strange for me and still cannot understand the reason why!
