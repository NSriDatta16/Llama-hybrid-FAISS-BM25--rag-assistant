Cross Domain JavaScript, parent location setting in embedding iframe case

There is a solution called "Fragment Id Messaging" to solve cross domain communication by setting parent.location with extra texts followed by "#" from child iframe, it works. However, if the parent itself is embedded as an iframe in another page, parent.location setting seems denied by browsers... Is this true? If yes, is there a work-around? Thanks!
