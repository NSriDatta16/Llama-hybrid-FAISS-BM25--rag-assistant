Easy way to implement stop words on model fields

I am using Rails 3.0 and have several models which have a public, English, reference field such as a title on a chapter of a story. I am looking for an elegant way to implement certain stop words for actions on controllers, e.g. "new", "update", "destroy", etc. What is the best way to do this, via some kind of callback during the saving of the model?
