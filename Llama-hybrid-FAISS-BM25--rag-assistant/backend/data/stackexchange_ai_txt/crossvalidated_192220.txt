Decomposition of variation into cross-sectional and time series variation

I have a panel dataset covering 20 counties and I have 150 monthly datapoints for each country. Specifically, my data consists of stock returns from each individual country. I want to dig deeper into how the returns vary across countries and across time. From a referee I got the comment that I should decompose the variation of the return data into cross-sectional and time series variation. How could I do this decomposition? Thanks in advance!
