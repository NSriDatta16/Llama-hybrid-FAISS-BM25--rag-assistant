I store these kinds of things in the layers that make the most contextual sense. If an enum or struct blatantly belongs to a particular domain in your application, based on its context, then I would put it in the relevant layer. However, if it lands up being one that can potentially span across multiple domains, then by all means whack it in its own layer. Just be sure to organize them all in such a manner that makes contextual sense to your application.
