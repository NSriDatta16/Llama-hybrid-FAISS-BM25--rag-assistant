Forecasting daily data with zeros in Python

I'm currently testing some forecasts on daily sales quantities. However, out of ~2000 observations I have 16 zeros. How should I approach this? It's mainly Sundays and holidays that holds zero as value. I want to perform some transformations to the time series that doesn't allow for zeros, why I'm looking for solutions. Example of data: Sales_interior CalendarDate 2014-01-02 1066.000000 2014-01-03 1735.000000 2014-01-04 2538.000000 2014-01-05 952.000000 2014-01-06 1417.000000 2014-01-07 2205.000000 2014-01-08 1567.000000 2014-01-09 1464.000000 2014-01-10 1636.000000 2014-01-11 1979.000000 2014-01-12 0.000000 2014-01-13 1085.000000 EDIT: I'm currently planning on using a seasonal ARIMA.
