You can certainly take the web site offline and convert your MyIsam tables to InnoDb. (Do back up the db first, of course.) Your big quality risk on a production web site isn't changing a table's storage engine, though. It's starting to enforce database integrity constraints while the system is in production. You may find that you have a lot of data repair to do to allow the constraints to be enforced. You are probably wisest to build a shadow copy of this system (web site and DB) and work through all your changes carefully. Keep track of the commands and configuration changes you do on the shadow copy, so you can do them again on the live copy when you've proven that they work. But there is some chance they won't work. Shadow copies are easy in this age of virtual machines.
