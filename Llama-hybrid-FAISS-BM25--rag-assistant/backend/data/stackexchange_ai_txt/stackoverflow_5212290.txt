LAMP / CakePHP quirk - works locally, not on remote server. Debugging Tips?

DISCLAIMER - I am total PHP noob - looking for some help/tips on how to debug this problem... I have a PHP/CakePHP based app running on Linux/CentOS and MySQL. Its also running on my local dev machine (OSX Snow Leopard). One small part of the app however is behaving inconsistently between the two. I have copied the DB and the PHP code from the server to my local machine - so pretty sure they are in sink. Note the app was originally developed elsewhere and then deployed to the server. The different is that there is a master/detail type page - on both sites the master part works fine, but the detail part is only working for my local/OSX version. I have checked the DB and the detail records seem to be present as expected. The PHP version is slightly different.

I have tried changing master details via mysql command line and those changes are being shown. Tried turning on display_errors/display_startup_errors - but nothing is being shown. Wonder if there are any CakePHP debug tips... perhaps should look into that. My plan is to install the app on another server to see if that works and/or helps identify the difference/issue. The PHP code that seems to be the issue is this (its in one of the cakePHP controllers): $carInsuranceQuoteRequest = $this->CarInsuranceQuoteRequest->find('first', array( 'conditions' => array( 'CarInsuranceQuoteRequest.id' => $id, ) , 'contain' => array( 'Company' => array( 'Attachment' ), 'CarInsuranceVehicleType', 'CarInsuranceVehicleMake', 'CarInsuranceVehicleModel', 'CarInsuranceVehicleVersion', 'CarInsuranceCoverageType', 'CarInsuranceQuoteResponse' => array( 'CarInsuranceQuoteSite' ), ), )); The quote request object is being returned ok on both installs. But the quote response object is always empty on the linux box, even though they seem to be ok in the mysql db. The responses are being displayed fine under OSX. The PHP error on line 803 is ; url_rewriter.tags: (ini file field description not available) url_rewriter.tags = a=href,area=href,frame=src,input=src,form=,fieldset= Thanks in advance for any tips, Chris FWIW - my problem was due to the cakePHP models being wrong and so it wasnt able to navigate the relations. I had changed the mysql table. For some reason it got over the issue on my local machine.
