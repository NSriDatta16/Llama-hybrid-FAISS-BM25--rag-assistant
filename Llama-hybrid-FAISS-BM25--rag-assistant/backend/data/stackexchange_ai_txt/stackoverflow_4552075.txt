How to find reasons of why site goes online/offline

Seems today a website I manage has been going online and offline throughout the entire day. I have no idea what is causing the issue so I am seeking guidance on where to start. It is a WordPress based site. So here is what I do know: I use a program that pings the server every minute and when the server is not responding me it emails me, so I can know exactly when the site is online and offline. The site between 8pm to 12pm 12.28, and around the 1a hour early morning 12.29 (New York City timezone, and all times below are in same timezone). At the time of the ups/downs I see a lot of strain on the memory usage. Look at the load average when the site is going online/offline ( http://screencast.com/t/BRlfXkqrbJII ). Then I ran this command to restart http ( http://screencast.com/t/usVtYWZ2Qi ) and the memory usage then goes down to this ( http://screencast.com/t/VdTIy3bgZiQB ). An hour after I restarted http, the site then went offline/online so restarting the http didn't do much help. When the site is going offline/online, I ran the top command and get this ( http://screencast.com/t/zEwr7YQj3 ). Here is a top command when the site is at it's lowest ( http://screencast.com/t/eaMfha9lbT - so this would be dubbged "normal"). Here is a bandwidth report ( http://screencast.com/t/AS0h2CH1Gypq ). The traffic doesn't seem to be that much ( http://screencast.com/t/s7hrWNNic1K ), but looking at my times the site is going up/down this may be one of the reasons? I have the dvp Nitro package at Media Temple ( http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/nitro/ ). So at this point I would request some help in trying to figure out what the cause of this is, and how I can go about pinpointing this issue. ANY HELP is greatly appreciated.
