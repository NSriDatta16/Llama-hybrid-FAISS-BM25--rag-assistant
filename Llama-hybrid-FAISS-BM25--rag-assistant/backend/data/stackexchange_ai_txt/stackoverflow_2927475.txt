Select top and bottom rows

I'm using SQL Server 2005 and I'm trying to achieve something like this: I want to get the first x rows and the last x rows in the same select statement. SELECT TOP(5) BOTTOM(5) Of course BOTTOM does not exist, so I need another solution. I believe there is an easy and elegant solution that I'm not getting. Doing the select again with GROUP BY DESC is not an option.
