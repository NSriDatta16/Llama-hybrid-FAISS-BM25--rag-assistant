How to perform image classification in a dataset of images with heterogeneous sizes?

I have a dataset of images with very different sizes (ranging from 100X100 pixels to 5000X1000 pixels) and aspect ratios. I want to use neural networks for dealing with this problem. Is there any standard way to deal with datasets with this characteristics? I know that a common practice is to resize the image and performing a center crop. But this throw away too much information of each image. I'm looking for solutions that preserves as much as possible of the original information.
