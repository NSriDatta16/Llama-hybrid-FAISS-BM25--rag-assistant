Currently Windows Azure does not offer a fixed IP address, so any IP based filter would be subject to potential risk if the IP address should change (which it can without notice). I would recommend you explore either leveraging the service bus to create a peer-to-peer connection between the services, or possibly Azure Connect (an ipsec based VPN style connection).
