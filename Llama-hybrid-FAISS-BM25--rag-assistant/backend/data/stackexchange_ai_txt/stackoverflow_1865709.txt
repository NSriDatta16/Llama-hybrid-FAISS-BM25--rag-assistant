While I basically agree with VonC, and am grateful that he brought git submodules to my attention I would not recommend them to someone familiar with VCS but bridging over to DVCS. I now thoroughly enjoy using git and recommend it heartily but it has taken a lot of work to cross that bridge. As to alternative methods to address community software, I also heartily recommend ELPA for packages not supplied by Emacs. Updates have to be applied manually but at least ELPA provides a mechanism to let you know updates exist. And it also provides a good scaffold for adding community provided packages not hosted by ELPA. Lastly, you might want to elaborate on how you organize your packages based on platform. I try to keep all my platform (and per-machine) customization in embedded Emacs lisp such that I share a single set of source controlled support (*.el) files on all the major platforms I work with: Linux (Fedora and Ubuntu), Mac OS X and Windows (native and cygwin).
