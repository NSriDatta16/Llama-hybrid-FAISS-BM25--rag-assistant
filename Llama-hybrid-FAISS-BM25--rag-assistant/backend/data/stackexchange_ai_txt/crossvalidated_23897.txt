I wouldn't go too deep into the clustering of the time series based on a complex curve analysis, as you have probably a lot of noise in your data and you will probably get strange (meaningless) clusters. I think that an easier way will be to discover the major pattern of your data, which will most probably based on trends and seasonality (days of the week, weekends, holidays...). You can find it with plotting some statistics from each day (mean, morning trend, evening trend...) with time (day of the year, day of the week, day of the month...) on the x-axis. This will give you the baseline of your data, and therefore your basic clusters. For example in R, if you have your date in col 1, and your mean in col 2, you can easily plot your base line of weekdays pattern by: data[,3] The next step can be to identify your outliers and check if you can find a patterns there. If you prefer to work in a reverse order; running automatic analysis like the ones you suggested or more Time-Series tuned as LB_Keogh or kml , this is OK. But you need to return to the meaningful interpretation of the findings with the logic above.
