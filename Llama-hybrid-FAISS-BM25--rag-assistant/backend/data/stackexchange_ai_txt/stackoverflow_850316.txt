Depending on your Apache config (I'm assuming this is an OS X install from the .local URL) you might be able to change the set-up such that you run multiple Rails apps via http://localhost/MY_APP/ There's some good examples on setting up mod_rails for multiple directories here Pay attention to the example for deploying multiple apps under one VirtualHost. If you can get this configured, then you can just request a Google Maps API Key for http://localhost/ and reuse it as much as you need in development.
