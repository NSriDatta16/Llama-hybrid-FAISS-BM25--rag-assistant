How can I keep consistent line height with superscript elements?

If I have a element in a multi-line paragraph, the line with the superscript on it has a larger line spacing above it than the other lines, regardless of what line-height I put on the paragraph. It doesn't mean I have lots of paragraphs, each which is on a single line. I have a single paragraph with enough content in it to cause wrapping onto multiple lines. Somewhere (anywhere) in the text there may be a or . This affects the line height for that line by adding extra spacing above/below. If I set a larger line-height on the paragraph this makes no difference to the problem. The line-height is increased, but the extra spacing still remains. How can I make it consistent - i.e. all lines have the same spacing whether they contain a or not? Your solutions must be cross-browser (IE 6+, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome)
