Spring context files organization and best practices

We have started using Spring framework in my project. After becoming acquainted with the basic features (IoC) we have started using spring aop and spring security as well. The problem is that we now have more than 8 different context files and I feel we didn't give enough thought for the organization of those files and their roles. New files were introduced as the project evolved. We have different context files for: metadata, aop, authorization, services, web resources (it's a RESTful application). So when a developer wants to add a new bean it's not always clear in which file he should add it. We need methodology. The question: Is there a best practice for spring files organization? Should the context files encapsulate layers (DAL , Business Logic, Web) or use cases ? or Flows?
