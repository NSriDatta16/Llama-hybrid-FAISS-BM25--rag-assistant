Can ARIMA Models be used to models stock prices?

I'm learning about ARIMA models and other variants (SARIMAX, ARIMAX...etc) The problem is that whenever I try fitting the closing prices for a given stock (Google, Amazon or Netflix for example), the Auto ARIMA model predict that a SARIMAX(0,1,0) is the best fit which always give me a linear line for predictions, while the actual data is highly volatile and somehow seasonal. Even If I use an ARIMA model setting the p, d, q parameters by hand I get an even worse prediction (sometimes all prediction are close to zero while closing prices (actual values) are in the range of 1000). Here's the PACF and ACF for the first differences (closing_price(ti) - closing_price(t(i-1) ) Most coefficient looks non stationary, so I don't know if an ARIMA model is a good model to forecast stock prices (I had this issue with several stocks: Google, Apple, Netflix...etc) I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or is the model by nature not adapted for this kind of time series ?
