How get p-value from wilcox.test statistics in R?

I have an experiment in which I am calling wilcox.test in R for multiple times and gather statistic output. I compute the average of these statistics and then I want to convert it to p-value. What function should I call in R to get statistic of wilcox test as input and take a p-value as output? wilcox.statistics
