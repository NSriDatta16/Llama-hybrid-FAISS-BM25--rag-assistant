Bagging describes predicting based on the average result ob multiple models you created training on random subsets of data. For example in scikit you can configure your Bagging models with max_samples to tell him how many subsets to use. (see sklearn doc: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier.html ) If you're asking how high it "should" be, the answer is depending on your total volume of training data.
