Required attribute on property with instance

I something similar to the following class EntityNameId { public string Name { get; set; } public string Id { get; set; } } class OrganizationNameId : EntityNameId { } class PersonViewModel { public PersonViewModel() { Organization = new OrganizationNameId(); } OrganizationNameId Organization { get; } } How can I set the Required attribute in PersonViewModel for OrganizationNameId.Id so that client-side validation will work? I don't want to put it in OrganizationNameId or EntityNameId because its not always required, but it is required for PersonViewModel . I am using MVC 3. Edit : I do not want to add a custom property as described below by Bas. I have a custom partial view for EntityNameId that allows for it to be reusable.
