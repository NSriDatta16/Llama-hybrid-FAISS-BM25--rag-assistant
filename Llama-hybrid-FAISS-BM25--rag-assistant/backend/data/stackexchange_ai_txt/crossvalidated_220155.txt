I have taken the liberty of editing the figure to add labels a)-d) and re-uploading it within the question. Three definitions of nesting, in SEM are: "whenever one model has all the same free parameters as does a second model but also has other free parameters not shared by the other model. In other words, the two models are equivalent except for a subset of free parameters in one model that are fixed or constrained in the other (Maruyama, 1998, p. 235). ). Loehlin (1992) defines nested as being when "the model with the smaller number of free variables can be obtained from the model with the larger number of free variables by fixing one or more of the latter" (p. 67). Kline (2011) defines nested as "if one is a proper subset of the other. For example, if a free parameter is dropped from model A ... to form B ... model B is nested in model A" (p. 214). You are correct that model b) is nested in model c). The one-factor model is a restricted version of the two-factor model. To see this, consider what happens if we fix the correlation between the two factors in model c) to 1. In this case the 2 factors will be identical which is the same as replacing them both with a single factor. By similar reasoning, we can also see that d) is nested in c) if we fixed both paths from Fatique in model d) to 1.
