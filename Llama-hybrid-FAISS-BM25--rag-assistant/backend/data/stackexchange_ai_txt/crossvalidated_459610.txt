Welcome to stackexchange. However, is it possible to compute simple main effect for Bayesian ANOVA ? If yes, how can I do it ? This option is not available in JASP, thus can I do it with t-test, as it's possible in frequentist approach when interaction is significant ? Or, is it possible to do it with R ? Moreover, I computed bayesian post-hoc in JASP and BF were the same than Bayesian t-test... So I did not understand why... The simple main effects in your design capture the difference between A1 and A2 , or between B1 and B2 . These should already available in the ANOVA input of any program, including JASP. Finally, my last question is about power. I don't have many participants, so how to know if my bayesian analysis did not suffer from a lack of power when BF shows anecdotical evidence ? Power is a frequentist concept, and does not play a role in Bayesian statistics. However, you can answer your question quite easily in Bayesian statistics: if the BF indicates only anecdotal evidence in either direction (in favour of the null hypothesis, or in favour of the alternative), this means you don't have enough data to be sure that there is an effect, and you don't have enough data to be sure that there isn't an effect.
