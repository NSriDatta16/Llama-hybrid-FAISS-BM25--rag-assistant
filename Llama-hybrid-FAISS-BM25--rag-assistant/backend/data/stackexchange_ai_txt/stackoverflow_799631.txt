Java wait for JFrame to finish

I have a login frame that i have to wait for from another thread. Upon successful login frame disposes itself. And i want to pop up the main frame for the application. Right now i am watching a boolean value to determine when to fire up the main frame. What is the correct way of doing this? Watching a boolean value just does not feel elegant.
