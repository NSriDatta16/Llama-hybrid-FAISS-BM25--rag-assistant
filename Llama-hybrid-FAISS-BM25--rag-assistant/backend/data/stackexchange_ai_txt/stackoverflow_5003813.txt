Check GPU OpenGL Limits

I was wondering if there is an easy way to query (programatically) the GPU OpenGL Limits for the following features: - maximum 2D texture size - maximum 3D texture size - maximum number of vertex shader attributes - maximum number of varying floats - number of texture image units (in vertex shader, and in fragment shader) - maximum number of draw buffers I need to know these numbers in advance before writing my GPU Research Project.
