jquery draggable accept: classpath

I have problems with the following bit of javascript/jquery code: this.droppable = function(){ $('.imageWindow .body .item').draggable(); $('.groupWindow .body .item').droppable({ accept: $(".imageWindow .body .item"), over: function(event, ui) { alert("this is valid!"); }, drop: function(){ alert('dropped'); } }); } As you maybe know it is not possible to pass the following in the accept option: $(".imageWindow .body .item") But what is possible ? I want to pass a "class path" as an accept option ! It is probably a simple answer but i can't figure it out. Of course i could do: accept: ".item" But because "groupWindow .body .item" is a sortable it would also accept himself! Thanxs if you can help me!
