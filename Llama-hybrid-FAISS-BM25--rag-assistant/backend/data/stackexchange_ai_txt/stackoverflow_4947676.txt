Embedding Images into Email - What is the difference between ContentID and ContentLocation?

I am using aspNetEmail to send emails with embedded images and I am trying to choose between two options: ContentLocation: Embed images using the Content-Location header. ContentId: Embed images using the Content-ID header. I checked the aspNetEmail website for documentation but there wasn't very much information. I suspect these options are applicable to embedding images in all email applications? What is the difference between the two settings, and how will it affect my emails?
