How do I parse an xml fragment into nodes and append them to a node with a specified default namespace so that they are a part of that namespace?

I have the following input and want to generate the following output when using XmlTextWriter. According to the documentation for InnerXml ( MSDN ), the following code should work correctly. var outputdoc = new XmlDocument(); outputdoc.AppendChild(outputdoc.CreateXmlDeclaration("1.0", string.Empty, string.Empty)); outputdoc.AppendChild(outputdoc.CreateElement("root", "urn:default")); outputdoc.DocumentElement.InnerXml = " "; var writer = new XmlTextWriter(filename, Encoding.UTF8) { Formatting = Formatting.Indented, Indentation = 1 }; outputdoc.WriteTo(writer); writer.Close(); Instead, I get the following output: What do I need to do? EDIT: I didn't make the possible inputs clear enough. It was supposed to be an Xml fragment so it could be one element, more than one element with any number of children in either case. For example: or or 1 or 1
