XGBoost obtain n_estimators obtimal parameter with early stopping

If i use early stopping with an evaluation set for training, when i have to train the model for the final evaluation what is the best approach? Generally I'd train the model with the full dataset but in this case I can't use the early stopping feature since i have no validation. Is there a way to obtain the proper n_estimators value from the training with the evaluation set and then use it as a parameter? Or it's better to use even for the final result only the partial trained model with early stopping and evaluation set? Thank you
