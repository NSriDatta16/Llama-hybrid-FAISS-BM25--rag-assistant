http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/ has a great overview, I recommend you give it a read and check out the examples. However, it also ends with an excellent summary : Deferreds introduce a new, robust approach to writing asynchronous tasks. Instead of focusing on how to organize callback logic into a singular callback, you can assign several individual actions to callback queues knowing that these will be executed, in context, without worrying so much about synchronicity. Another good page on jQuery 1.5 explains: The ajax module has been rewritten entirely. It will now return a special jQuery based XHR object (rather than a plain XHR object). This object is a deferred object that I spoke about above. This means we can pass the ajax request around and let components or modules attach their own handlers when they need to. We can also bind multiple callbacks via the jQuery chaining pattern. (Emphasis mine.)
