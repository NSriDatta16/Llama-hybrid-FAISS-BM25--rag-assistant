dividing two sets of points

I have a series of points an a single real-valued axis. The points are either good or bad (encoded as 0 or 1). Generally zeros are bigger than ones. But they sometimes overlap. I need to a point which devised the two groups best. What techniques could I use? I thought about logistic regression, but do not know how do find the dividing number than.
