Hadoop, Spark and Cloud

It seems Hadoop, Spark, and different versions of Clouds offer facilities to store and analyze big data. There are some articles comparing Hadoop and Spark (for example, this article ). There are also articles which discuss services on AWS for working with Hadoop/spark, such as this article . My question is, if I am using cloud computing which provides storage and analytics services, will I still need hadoop/spark? Any references / readings which help in identifying different use cases and applications is highly appreciated!
