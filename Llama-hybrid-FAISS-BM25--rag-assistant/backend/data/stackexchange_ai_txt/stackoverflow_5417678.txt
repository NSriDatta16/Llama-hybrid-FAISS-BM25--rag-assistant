in your css code just add div#yourId { text-align:center; } if you want to align a specific item in your div you could do the following. let's say this is your html 21 text goes here then in your css code .align{text-align:center;} this way you just need to add the class align to the element you want and it will be centered (but this will only work with block elements, the paragraph tag is a block element but for example the span tag is not)
