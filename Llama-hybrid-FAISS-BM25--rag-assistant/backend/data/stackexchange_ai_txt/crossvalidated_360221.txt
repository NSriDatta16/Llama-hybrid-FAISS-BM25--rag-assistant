+1 to ERT's very helpful answer . That said, pretty much every hourly dataset I have come across exhibits multiple-seasonalities . That is, you have intra-daily seasonalities with cycles of length 24, but these cycles are different between weekdays and weekends, so you get a superposition of a seasonality of length 168. This applies to hourly time series of electricity load, call center workload, footfalls in retail stores, or traffic on CrossValidated . ARIMA does not handle multiple-seasonalities . So you might want to browse through previous questions in this tag, or look at the literature in its tag wiki . I especially recommend the bats and tbats models, which were specifically built to model complex multiple seasonalities, and which are available in the forecast package for R.
