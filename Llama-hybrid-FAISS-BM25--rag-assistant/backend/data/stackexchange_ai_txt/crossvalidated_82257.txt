As Nick points out, there is some confusion as to whether you mean standardisation (making each variable zero mean and unit variance vectors) or a transformation to make each variable more normally distributed. As you mentioned skewed data, I will address that point. The square root or log transformations may be applied to the counts to downweight the effects of extreme values, which may dominate the construction of the early axes if doing so would explain large amounts of variance. For count data though, PCA is rarely competitive in terms of variance explained. Correspondence Analysis will tend to ordinate such data as well if not better than PCA, though it is working on relative compositions (counts) not absolute-valued compositions; in PCA, the following samples with observations on 3 variables x would be assumed markedly different, but under CA, as these have the same relative composition, would be considered exactly equal. At this point you should be asking yourself what it is that you hope to achieve with the ordination/dimension reduction and let that lead to you an appropriate method.
