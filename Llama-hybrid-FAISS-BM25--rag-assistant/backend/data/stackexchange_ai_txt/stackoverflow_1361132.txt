QT4 Drag Window Without Title Bar

The application I'm working on has a custom UI that required me to remove the title bar from the main window. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to make it so I can move the application on the screen :) The code I have which is removing the title bar is the following: MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) : QMainWindow(parent, Qt::CustomizeWindowHint), ui(new Ui::MainWindowClass) { ui->setupUi(this); Any idea how I can move the window around using either another widget or the main form window itself? Thanks
