Is it safe to cache EJB Home lookup result ? Yes. What will happen if one my cluster node is no more working ? If your server is configured for clustering/WLM, then the request should silently failover to another server in the cluster. The routing information is encoded in the stub IOR. What will happen if I install a new version of the EJB without refreshing the service locator's cache ? Assuming you update the bean and not the component or home interfaces, then everything continues to work. EJBHome is effectively a stateless session bean, so the request can continue to be accessed from the same server if available or on a different server in the cluster if not. Note that the @EJB injection in EJB3 effectively encourages home caching. (Though, admittedly, it also allows SFSB caching even though this is clearly incorrect, so perhaps @EJB isn't the best support of my claim :-)).
