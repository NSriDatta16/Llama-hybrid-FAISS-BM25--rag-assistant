The distributions are supposed to look similar, because we are told they are "approximately normal" and both have the same standard deviation. The one with larger mean ($\mu_A$, the average of $X$) therefore has been shifted to the right, just like the blue density curve (representing a histogram) relative to the red one in this figure (whose mean is $\mu_B$, the average of $Y$). This should make it obvious that there is more area under the blue (right-hand) curve to the right of any given value $a$ compared to the area under the red (left-hand) curve. The difference in areas is that of the shaded region. Since areas represent proportions (the total area under either of these curves is $100\%$), the shaded area represents how much greater the proportion is in group $A$ compared to group $B$.
