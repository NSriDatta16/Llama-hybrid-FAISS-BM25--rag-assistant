For something like this you will need to parse the HTML in order to distinguish the parts that you do want to make the replacement in from the ones you don't. I suggest looking at the HTML agility pack - it can parse HTML fragments as well as malformed HTML. You can then query the resulting parse tree using XPath notation and do your replacement on the selected nodes.
