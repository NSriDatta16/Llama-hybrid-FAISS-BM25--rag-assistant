deploying osgi war bundle

I have deployed a standard war file as an osgi bundle into equinox using bnd to create a war bundle. Whilst it deploys ok and I can run the app, I cannot see any images or css files. I have deployed catalina-start as an osgi bundle and am using spring-web-extender as the bridge. The image/css files are located at the root of the war file root |_images |_css |_META-INF |_WEB-INF I have seen others deploy images and css files in fragment bundles, but I would have thought this should just work. Any help appreciated.
