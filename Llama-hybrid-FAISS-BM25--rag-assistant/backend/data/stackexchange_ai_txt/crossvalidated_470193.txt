representing quantile like quartile in form of normal distribution curve

I learned in statistics the first quartile, 2nd quartile, and 3rd quartile can be represented in the figure1 below I came across this part of the article Step 4 - Feature Engineering .In this portion of the article, they used quantile strain.append(np.quantile(X,0.01)) strain.append(np.quantile(X,0.05)) strain.append(np.quantile(X,0.95)) strain.append(np.quantile(X,0.99)) Can we represent these quantile0.01, quantile0.05, quantile0.95, quantile0.99 values in normal distribution curve like this Is it correct representation? What do these quantile0.01, quantile0.05, quantile0.95, quantile0.99 values define?
