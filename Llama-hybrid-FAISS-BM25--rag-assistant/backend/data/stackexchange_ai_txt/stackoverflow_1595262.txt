Go with Jquery. We've implemented an entire pageflakes-esque drag/droppable widget system on our customizable homepage Faxo Search . We couldn't be more pleased with jquery and jquery UI. We looked at other libraries and decided jquery had the largest potential. It's extremely expressive and the code is tight and efficient. We actually migrated from Prototype.
