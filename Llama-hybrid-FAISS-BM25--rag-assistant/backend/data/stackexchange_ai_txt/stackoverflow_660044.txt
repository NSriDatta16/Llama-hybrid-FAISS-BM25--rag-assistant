I suggest using IPv6. There is enough address space that you can create up to 2^40 "unique unicast" ranges, each with 16 bits of subnet and 64 bits of host ID. Protocols such as UDP, TCP, and SCTP already work on top of it It already has major operating system support. See http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4193.txt Densely filling the 40-bit unique-id is discouraged. Use the random generation method mentioned in the RFC.
