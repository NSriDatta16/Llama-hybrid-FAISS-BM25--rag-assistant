How can I get autotest to notice changes in subdirectories?

I have some submodules organized like this: |-- app | |-- models | | |-- foo | | | |-- foo-1.rb | | | |-- foo-2.rb | | | |-- foo-3.rb | | |-- foo.rb How can I get autotest to notice changes made to foo-*.rb, and then run the appropriate specs?
