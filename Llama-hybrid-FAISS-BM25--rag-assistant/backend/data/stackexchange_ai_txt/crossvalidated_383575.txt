Is Fisher's/Chi2 "better" than running a regression?

Say I have a variable treatment A/B (0,1) and effect yes/no (0,1). An easy way to calculate a P value from such a dataset would be to use Fisher's Exact test or a Chi2 test. However, we also have the option of simply running a logistic regression with 1 dependent variable and 1 independent variable. Would the former tests be "better" to answer the question, or would a regression be just as good?
