Is this the correct approach for fitting a lognormal distribution with known population mean to given data?

I have some incomplete data for loss ratios (=loss/revenue) for 5 years. Let's call it X. Suppose these are the given values for X: 2012 - 73%; 2013 - 67%; 2014 - 78%; 2015 - 81%; 2016 - 75%; I was also provided with a best estimate of the mean of the data of 83% (Note: This is not just the average of the above figures, it includes some other factors which I am not aware of). I want to fit a lognormal distribution to this data. These are the steps I followed, and I want to know if this is an appropriate estimation: Assume that E[X]=83% Estimate σ using MLE. i.e the standard deviation of ln(X_i's) Use the formula E[X] = exp(μ+σ^2/2), with E[X] = 83% and σ from step 2, to solve for an estimate of μ So, I get X ~ Lognormal(μ,σ) and E[X] = 83%. I want to know if this an appropriate method to fit a lognormal distribution to this data? I know technically I should be using μ = Average(ln(X_i's)) to estimate μ, but I want to assume that 83% is the best estimate of the mean, and then reflect the standard deviation from the given data.
