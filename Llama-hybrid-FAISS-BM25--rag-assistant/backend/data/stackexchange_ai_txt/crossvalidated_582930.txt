The dickey-fuller test shows that the data is stationary and looking at the acf and pacf I decided to use an ARIMA (0,1,0) to model the data.* This is a strange decision, as your ADF test result implies absence of a unit root while your ARIMA(0,1,0) model implies the opposite. The ACF and PACF actually imply ARMA(0,0,0), i.e. $x_t=c+\varepsilon_t$ where $c$ is the mean of the time series $\{x_t\}$ and $\{\varepsilon_t\}$ is an uncorrelated zero-mean sequence of errors.
