Yep. SharpPcap uses Packet.Net, http://packetnet.sf.net , as it's packet dissector. Most common packet types are being processed. If you find one that isn't just let me know or open a feature request on the Packet.Net sourceforge tracker. Sharppcap and Packet.net are also designed to be as fast as possible. You should be able to capture and process at network data rates in excess of 3MB/s without dropped packets. Chris Author of SharpPcap and Packet.Net
