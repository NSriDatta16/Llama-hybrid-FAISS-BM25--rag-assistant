Some advice from the font of all time series knowledge ( grin ! ) when you convert two column to one column ... you lose information thus dp not do this model y as a function of x .. predict x to obtain a prediction of y and then if you are so inclined compute the ratio of the predicted y to the predicted x to obtain a predicted ratio Encode the uncertainty in the prediction of x into the transfer function model between y and x while detect unusual activity be it pulses , level shifts, seasonal and/or local time trends . Include the possiblity of future pulses in the prediction limits around the expected value of y 5 detect possible changes in error variance that may have occured within time segments as is the case with your data verify constancy of model parameters over time suggesting data segmentation If you wish you can post your data and I will try to be of more help ..
