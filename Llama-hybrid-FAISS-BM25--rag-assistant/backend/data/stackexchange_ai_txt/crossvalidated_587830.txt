If you are doing this approach correctly, you should-- must --be using random effects estimators to get sensible answers. This means your estimates are corrected for regression to the mean. You will get very bad estimates without this approach. The problem with demeaning each firm and is that it's equivalent to doing the very thing you don't want to do (estimating a different intercept for each firm). You're estimating the growth rate for each firm by using the observed (mean) growth rate. This is going to cause severe problems, and is in fact inadmissible (statistically unjustifiable) if you're estimating more than 3 firms . For more details on random effects estimation (usually called hierarchical modeling from the Bayesian viewpoint), I suggest Richard McElreath's book, Statistical Rethinking .
