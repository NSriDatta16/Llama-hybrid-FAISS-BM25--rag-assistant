How to use R to determine if a value is statistically LARGER than an average?

So I have daily temperature data for each day of the year going back up to 100 years for different locations. With this, I have created a mean value for each day of the year and a 95th percentile again for each day of the year. I am comparing these values to the daily readings for a specific year (e.g.2016). However, I am only interested if the 2016 values are greater than the daily mean/95th percentile. Is there a way to determine if the values are significantly greater than the mean/95th percentile? In essence, there are 366 values for each column (one for each day of the year), and the mean/95th percentile and the 2016 data would be paired. A rough idea of what my data looks like: DAY OF YEAR: 1, 2, 3 MEAN: 12, 10, 11 2016 Temp: 17, 20.6, 13 Then: DAY OF YEAR: 1, 2, 3 95th Percentile: 16, 14, 13 2016 Temp: 17, 20.6, 13 Apologies if the formatting is confusing. So, all the 2016 values are larger than they 'should' be, but is this significant? Is there a way to determine if the values are significantly greater than the mean/95th percentile, not just statistically different?
