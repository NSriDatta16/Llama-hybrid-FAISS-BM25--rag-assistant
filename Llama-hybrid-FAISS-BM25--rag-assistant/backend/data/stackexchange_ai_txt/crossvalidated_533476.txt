Kruskal-Wallis is fine for ordinal Y. The only concern is whether it handles excessive ties accurately enough. You might instead use the proportional odds ordinal logistic model for all 3 outcomes. It reduces to the binary logistic model for (1) and handles arbitrarily many ties. It also leads to a more insightful Bayesian analysis.
