Embedding inline JS script instead of making an AJAX request. Why?

I noticed that some websites (for example: apple.com or disqus.com) don't send AJAX request to load, for example, live search results. Instead they attach new JS script, that holds all results in a variable. To be more specific. If you go to apple.com and type "test" into the searcher. It won't send an AJAX request to get the results, instead it will add to the HTML and execute new piece of JS script to bring in the search results. improvement Are they doing this only because you can't send AJAX request to a different domain, or is there any speed improvement possible?
