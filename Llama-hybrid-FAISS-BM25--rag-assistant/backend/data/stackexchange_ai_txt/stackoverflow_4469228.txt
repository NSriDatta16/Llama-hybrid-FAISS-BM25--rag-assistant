JSF 2 / primefaces/ jquery : autoselect, autotab and highlight feature for input elements?

Just want to ask around before implementing own's solution using javascript and css. I wonder if in core jsf tags / primefaces / jquery have the following features : auto-select : When receiving focus, an input text would auto-select all of the texts, so that it could be replaced instantly by user input without having the user to delete the whole unselected/unblocked string. autotab : Would like to tab to the next input based on the tabindex defined when the value inputted has reached the limit of defined maxlength in the input text. highlight : Would like to have a different border or background when an element is focused Thank you !
