If everything is working on the same PC then you can use any local storage starting from xml, .net config files to registry and even memory. If they are not on the same PC, you can use DB, so that if one client will store there ID others can select it, but all clients must have access to that DB. Other option is WCF. One of the clients can call the service method and get the ID. So options are vary from your exact situation and requirements.
