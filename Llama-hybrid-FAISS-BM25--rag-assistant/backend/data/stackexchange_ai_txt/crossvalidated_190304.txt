Why the constraint $\xi \geq 0$ can be dropped from l2-svm?

Why the constraint $\xi \geq 0$ can be dropped from l2-svm? I have found a solution in the following notes: https://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/ps2_solution.pdf . However, I do not quite understand it. Is there anyone who has a better solution?
