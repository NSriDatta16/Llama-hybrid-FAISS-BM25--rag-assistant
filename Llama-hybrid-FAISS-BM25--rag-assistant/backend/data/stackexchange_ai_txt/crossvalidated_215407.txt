No they don't "have" to be the same. The $\alpha$ you used in your power analysis before conducting the study, and the $\alpha$ you used in your test don't technically have to be the same. But, if you're only "relaxing" $\alpha$ in your test because you didn't get the result you wanted/expected -- and you're only changing this between your design and your analysis because you want to report a "statistically significant" result -- I would discourage this. That's not how hypothesis testing works. Instead, report your design; report your results (even if $p \ge 0.05$); and discuss the implications. Don't let your p-value be your only metric of success or failure in your research. Null findings can also have a great deal of scientific merit.
