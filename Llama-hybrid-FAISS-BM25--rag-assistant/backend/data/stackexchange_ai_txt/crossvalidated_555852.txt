The premise is incorrect. A series that has a unit root need not be a random walk series. Take any stationary series that is not white noise and then take its cumulatively sums for each time point. The new series will contain a unit root yet it will not be a random walk. Now to your questions: Yes, it is possible for other series to Granger-cause a unit-root series. Take a pair of cointegrated time series that each have a unit root, and you will find that at least one of them causes the other (or perhaps both cause each other). For a detailed exposition, see Giles "Cointegration & Granger Causality" . In such a case and given a sufficiently long time series (so that model coefficients can be estimated with good precision) a vector error correction model will do a better job forecasting your unit-root series (the one that is Granger-caused by the other) than an AR model would.
