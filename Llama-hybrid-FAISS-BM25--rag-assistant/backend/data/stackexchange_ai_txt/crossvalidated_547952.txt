Modeling a time series of ordered vectors

I have a series of ordered vectors, $\pmb{x}^o(1), \ldots, \pmb{x}^o(n)$ . Here, $\pmb{x}^o$ means the ordered vector of $\pmb{x}$ . For example, if $\pmb{x} = (2,5,1)^\top$ , then $\pmb{x}^o = (1,2,5)^\top$ . Is there any (possibly simple) model to fit this time series? For example, something similar to an "ordered" autoregressive model: $$\pmb{x}^o(t) = \pmb{A} \pmb{x}^o(t-1) + \pmb{\epsilon}(t).$$ However, I think this is incorrect in this form because the errors are not ordered (since they are random). Can we modify this model in some way? I am also fine with any other model. Note: If possible, it would be good if the model is simple. Because, as a next step, I need to estimate its parameters.
