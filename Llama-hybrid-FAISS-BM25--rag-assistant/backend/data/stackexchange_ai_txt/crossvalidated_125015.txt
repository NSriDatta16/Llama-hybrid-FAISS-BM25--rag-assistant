The simplest way to think about it is that your raw residuals ($e_j = y_j-\hat y_j$) are estimates of the corresponding disturbances ($\hat\varepsilon_j = e_j$). However, there are some extra complexities. For example, although we are assuming in the standard OLS model that the errors / disturbances are independent, the residuals cannot all be. In general, only $N-p-1$ residuals can be independent since you have used $p-1$ degrees of freedom in estimating the mean model and the residuals are constrained to sum to $0$. In addition, the standard deviation of the raw residuals is not actually constant. In general, the regression line is fitted such that it will be closer on average to those points with greater leverage. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals for those points is smaller than that of low leverage points. (For more on this, it may help to read may answers here: Interpreting plot.lm() , and/or here: How to perform residual analysis for binary/dichotomous independent predictors in linear regression? )
