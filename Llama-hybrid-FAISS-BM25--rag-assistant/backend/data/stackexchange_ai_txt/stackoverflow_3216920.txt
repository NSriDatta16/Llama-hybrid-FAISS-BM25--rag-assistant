Registering Users to a Login Database - Web Frontend?

I have a database which manages login information for an application, and find myself (for rather tragic reasons involving combo boxes - don't ask) needing to manage the registration of new users through a web frontend. Quite literally all it needs to do is have a single form composed of a few edit boxes and a handful of combo boxes. Keeping in mind that I'm completely inept and possessed of functionally no previous experience as a web programmer, how would one suggest going about making this form? (If there's a solution that keeps web simplicity but is functionally heavy on C++, or less ideally Java, I'm all ears.) As a bonus question, it would also be useful (but, I imagine, rather difficult) to have one of the combo boxes update with information pulled from a SELECT query to the database. Is this possible for a web design beginner like me?
