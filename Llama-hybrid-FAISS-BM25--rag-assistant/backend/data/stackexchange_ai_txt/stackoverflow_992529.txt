You can use the following code for a client side validation, as a complement to the server-side one. The client side validation is helpful in some simple cases ( like max text length ) because it reduces the server overhead, there is no redundant postback just for a simple check. EXample code: function clientValidate(sender, args) { if (args.Value.length > 200) { args.IsValid = false; } } Please, pay attention to the RequiredFieldValidator, this is to make sure that there is entered text in the textbox. For some reason, the CustomValidator does not catch when args.Value.length == 0;
