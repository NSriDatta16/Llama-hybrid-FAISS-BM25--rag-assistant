Well, you can serve xml requests as well (a sample web.xml fragment) some your servlet *.xml Then, you can write a HttpServlet that would make a XML Document (I would recommend using dom4j for that) and then you will serialize it to out (see HttpServletRequest.getWriter() ) using Transformer (TrAX) api. You can also serve such requests with jsp, but I wouldn't recommend that. Make a servlet.
