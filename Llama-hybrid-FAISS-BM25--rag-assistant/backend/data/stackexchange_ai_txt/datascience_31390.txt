I would recommend to use Graphexp. Gephi is highly dependent on the RAM of your computer which is obviously limited. Graphexp on the other hand display's only a limited number of Nodes, through which you can navigate to other nodes. I have visualized a graph with 700 Million vertices using Graphexp as a UI and Janusgraph with HBase as a back-end storage. https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp
