How many degrees of freedom in logistic regression?

I did an experiment where 1600 people either responded (1) or not (0) to 4 treatments (400 unique people per treatment): treatments How many degrees of freedom can I assume? R's glm function with family=binomial reports either 0 df or 1596 df, depending on how I specify the dependend variable (4x2 frequency matrix versus expanded data frame with 1600 rows): ## Frequency matrix: 0 df, no residuals summary(glm(response ~ color + size + shape, data = treatments, family = binomial())) ## Expanded data frame: 1596 df, with residuals tab I'm confused. Which way is correct or how would you fit the model, e.g. to predict other treatment combinations in unique(expand.grid(treatments)) ? The one with 1596 df and residuals or the one with 0 df and no residuals? Is the experiment valid at all? Thanks for your help. Edit: For non-R users: The output of the two summary calls (note the different residuals & df): Call: glm(formula = response ~ color + size + shape, family = binomial(), data = treatments) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 0 0 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.44235 0.18430 -13.252 and Call: glm(formula = resp ~ color + size + shape, family = binomial(), data = tab) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.4084 -0.3949 -0.3442 -0.3364 2.4085 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.44235 0.18430 -13.252
