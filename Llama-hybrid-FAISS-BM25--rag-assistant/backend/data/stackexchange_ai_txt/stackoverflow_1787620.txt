Wrapping text within a multiple list

I want to give the user the ability to select multiple elements (which happen to be about a paragraph each). The problem is that a standard select multiple in html is (as far as I can tell) a single line per choice. This is a problem as the layout gets very screwy if I let the line go long. Also, if I just truncate the line, the main gist of the text is lost. Is there a way to get around this with javascript? Is there an alternative that allows all of the text to be displayed and return the values back in a colon delimited list?
