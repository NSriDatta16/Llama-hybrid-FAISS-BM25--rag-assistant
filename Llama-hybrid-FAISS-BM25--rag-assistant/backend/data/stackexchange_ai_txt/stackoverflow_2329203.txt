Communication style : email and mailing lists : discuss everything concerning the project in public (?) when asking questions - do not bundle questions with your own opinions encourage people to propose more than one solution ask people to weigh pros and cons be brief and to the point avoid frivolous language that can be perceived negatively with people that do not know you well
