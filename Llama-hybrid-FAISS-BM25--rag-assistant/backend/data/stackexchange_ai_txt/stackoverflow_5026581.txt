How to display textarea's data in a table

I am using ASP.MVC 3. I have a view that has a textarea on it. I captures data in it, and when I want a new paragraph I wil press enter twice. After all my data is entered I save the text to the database. In my details view I would display the data in a like: Body: @Model.Body Now the text displays as 1 paragraph even though in my textarea (when I captured the data) it seemed liked paragraphs. How would I get the data to display as paragraphs in my table like what I captured it in my textarea. I'm assuming that I have to search for carriage returns and replace them with break tags?
