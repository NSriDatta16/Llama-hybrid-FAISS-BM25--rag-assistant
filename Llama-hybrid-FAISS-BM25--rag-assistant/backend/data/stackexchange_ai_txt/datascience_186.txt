Using SVM as a binary classifier, is the label for a data point chosen by consensus?

I'm learning Support Vector Machines , and I'm unable to understand how a class label is chosen for a data point in a binary classifier. Is it chosen by consensus with respect to the classification in each dimension of the separating hyperplane?
