Determining up/down market trends in timeseries data

I want to divide the time series data into two subsets (upside and downside markets) using some statistical methods. From the graph, it looks like early 2004 to mid 2008 : upside mid 2008 to early 2009 : downside early 2009 to early 2011: upside early 2011 to early 2012: downside early 2012 to mid 2015: upside mid 2015 to mid 2016: downside mid 2016 to late 2017 : upside. Is there any method to divide the dataset into two (upside and downside) in a logistic and systematic manner? Thank you.
