Often it is not clear at beginning of a project how difficult a task is and which elements will have biggest impact. One approach is to setup a machine learning system to systematically evaluate options and empirically explore the problem. First setup the simplest possible text classification pipeline where the raw text enters the pipeline and "change" / "not change" prediction comes out of the pipeline. Pick the most appropriate evaluation metrics for that binary classification task. Then take a model comparison approach where each element in the pipeline is experimentally tested to see if it improves the evaluation metrics. It is most common to experiment with different text encoding methods (e.g., one-hot encoding, count-based, or embeddings) and different algorithms (e.g., naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), tree-based models, or neural networks).
