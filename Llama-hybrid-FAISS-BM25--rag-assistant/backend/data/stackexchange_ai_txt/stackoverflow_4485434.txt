Cursor in application window not correct type

After messing around a little with making a GUI with the Windows API, I recently realized a problem with the cursor. When I compile and run my application, it shows a window like its supposed to. When I drag my cursor from the left side of my screen into my applications window, as it goes over the border it becomes the thing for resizing but it remains like that anywhere inside my window. Same goes for if I bring it into the window from the bottom. The problem does not exist when I do from the right side though. I questioned if it was just my program so I went to the MSDN website and even compiled and tried their program (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff381409%28v=VS.85%29.aspx). Same Problem! So then I started experimenting with the WM_SETCURSOR message and cursor functions but got nowhere. Does anyone have any explanation to this and what I could do to fix it? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
