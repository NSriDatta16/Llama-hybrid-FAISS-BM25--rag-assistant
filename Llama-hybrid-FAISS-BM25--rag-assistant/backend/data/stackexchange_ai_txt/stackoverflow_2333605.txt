Using EL 2.2 with Tomcat 6.0.24

With JSF 2 you should be able to do this: which would then call the action method, passing in the parameter (assume it's an Integer): @ManagedBean @SessionScoped public class MyBean { ... public String myAction(Integer myParameter) { // do something return null; } ... } This works on Glassfish v3 perfectly. However not on Tomcat, you get an ELException notifying of the parse error Caused by: javax.el.ELException: Error Parsing: ... Now, there's a documented way of making this work using EL 2.2 and Glassfish's implementation by replacing the el-api jar in the Tomcat lib directory, however I still get the same error occurring with no luck. Tomcat's really starting to frustrate me! JSF2 is meant to be easier! Maven POM fragments: sun http://download.java.net/maven/2/ jboss http://repository.jboss.com/maven2/ ... javax.el el-api 2.2 provided org.glassfish.web el-impl 2.2 provided More info. Here's part of the stack trace, seems it's still using an Apache EL implementation, and not the one I dumped into lib. I completely removed the existing el-api.jar that came with Tomcat, is there an el-impl.jar I'm meant to remove somewhere too that may be overriding something? Was expecting one of: "}" ... "." ... "[" ... ">" ... "gt" ... " =" ... "ge" ... "
