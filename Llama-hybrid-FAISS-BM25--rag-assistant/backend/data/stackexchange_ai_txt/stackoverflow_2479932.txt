A majority of my work uses Scala as a high-performance language. If one really pays careful attention to performance, Scala is almost always nearly as good as Java (if not equivalent). If one is careless about e.g. object creations, it can be many times worse--as it can in Java if you use a library that is careless about object creations. (In fact, my Scala code is often faster than my Java code because I find it so much easier to make my highly optimized code convenient to use and reuse--but the Java would be as fast or faster if only I had more time and patience.) If you want some data that demonstrates that Scala can be basically as fast as Java, check out the results on the Computer Languages Benchmark Game . (Another less useful but still interesting comparison for high-throughput multicore programming is Tim Bray's Wide Finder 2 . This is less useful because the algorithm is not defined in advance, so a large portion of the differences boil down to differences in algorithm.)
