If you have correlated variables then you may want to consider using something like the party package for growing your random forests. The original random forest method is biased towards correlated variables, so you may get an incorrect estimate of the importance of some variables. As for incorporating the cost of calculation into the variable importance, neither the original Fortran nor the R translation of it allow something like that to be done. My only suggestion would be to alter the code yourself to discount the permuted error rate (or the Gini impurity if you use that approach) that is used to determine the variable importance.
