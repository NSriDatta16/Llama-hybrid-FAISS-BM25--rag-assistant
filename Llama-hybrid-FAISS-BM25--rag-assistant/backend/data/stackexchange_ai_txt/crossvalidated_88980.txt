Why on average does each bootstrap sample contain roughly two thirds of observations?

I have run across the assertion that each bootstrap sample (or bagged tree) will contain on average approximately $2/3$ of the observations. I understand that the chance of not being selected in any of $n$ draws from $n$ samples with replacement is $(1- 1/n)^n$, which works out to approximately $1/3$ chance of not being selected. What is a mathematical explanation for why this formula always gives $\approx 1/3$ ?
