C# Resource Array

I have a bunch of pictures I'm using in a C# project, and I'm trying to initialize them all for later use. There are over 50 of them and they all have the same name format Properties.Resources._#, where # is the picture number. What I'm trying to do is something like: for(int i = 0; i How would I go about embedding the index into the name? Thanks, and happy holidays. EDIT: Just realized that if I had a way to embed the index in the name, I could just have a function that returns the specific picture based on the number given, so that would work too.
