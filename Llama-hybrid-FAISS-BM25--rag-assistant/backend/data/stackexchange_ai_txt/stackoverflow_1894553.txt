Extending Karplus-Strong with low pass filter

I have implemented a basic Karplus-Strong algorithm. Ringbuffer, filling with white noise, output a sample from the front and append the average of first two elements to the end and delete the first element. Repeat last to steps. For better results and control over them I tried to implement a extended version of the algorithm. Therefore instead of an averaging filter I need a frequency filter like a low pass filter. My averaging filter has two inputs and one output: avg(a,b) = (a+b)/2 The sample code on the wikipedia page gives as many outputs as inputs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter I have found other (mathematic) versions like: http://cnx.org/content/m15490/latest/ H(z) = (1+(1/z))/2 I guess z is a complex number. Both version have two inputs but also two outputs. How do I get one meaningful value out of this? Or do I have to rewrite bigger parts of the algorithm? If thats the case where can I find a good explanation of it?
