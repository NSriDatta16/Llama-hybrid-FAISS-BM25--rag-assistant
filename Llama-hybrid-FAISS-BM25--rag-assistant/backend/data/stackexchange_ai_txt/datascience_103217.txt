How do I use number of hours as index in timeseries forecasting?

I have a dataset that has number of hours (consecutive value) and total sales in that 1 hour in my dataset. See below for head of the dataset: t sales -------------- 23 172.3676 24 176.3456 25 166.9039 26 153.9990 27 167.9585 I want to forecast the sales for the next 10 hours. I also set column t as the index. However, when I try to get the seasonal decomposition, it shows an error: result = seasonal_decompose(train['sales'].dropna(), model='additive', freq =12) result.plot() plt.show() TypeError:seasonal_decompose() got an unexpected keyword argument 'freq' How do I handle the number of hours in a time series model? Do I need to convert it to a different format before using it as the index? Also, the sales column is continuous numeric value, do I need to round it off? Thanks in advance!
