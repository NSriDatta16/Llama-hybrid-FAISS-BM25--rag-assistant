The data structure you describe is compatible with a multilevel modeling approach. Your model would take the following form: modestyij = b0 + b1(vignette)ij + b2(religiosity)j + b3(vignette*relgiosity)ij + U0j + eij U0j ~ N (0, sigma^2u0); eij ~ N (0, sigma^2e0) Technically the interaction is a "cross-level" interaction, meaning that you are interacting a L1 occasion-specific variable by an L2 person-specific variable. In these cases, recent research by Heisig & Schaeffer suggests that you should allow the level 1 variable to vary across persons (often referred to as a random slope in the MLM literature). However, all subjects were exposed to the same two vignettes, so it doesn't make much sense to estimate a varying slope. As you note, your outcome is not "normally" distributed. This is not a requirement for a linear MLM, however you will have to look at the level 1 (and level 2) residuals for your MLM to see whether they follow a normal pattern (see notes on MLM diagnostics here ). If not, you may need to consider transforming your outcome scores somehow or using a generalized multilevel modeling approach. I would recommend using MLM, however if you wanted to go in a different direction you could use one of the relevant ANOVA-type models. In your case, you might consider the random (or mixed) effects two-way ANOVA with a covariate. But the MLM is just a more parsimonious version of this model, providing arguably more information. See Robert Long's answer to this prior CV question for further information on the two approaches.
