The short answer is No. It's possible even to have set-ups where the mode of a combined sample is neither of the modes of each sample. Suppose sample A has 30 values of 0 and 20 values of 1 and sample B has 20 values of 1 and 30 values of 2. Evidently 0 is the mode of sample A, 2 is the mode of sample B, but neither is the mode of the combined sample, a distinction that belongs to 1. We could rescue that example by an averaging rule, but no averaging rule works when an average produces a mode that isn't a possible value. Worse, an average often can't even be defined: Instead of 0, 1, 2 we might have categories "frog", "toad", "newt". In brief, the mode must be re-calculated from the original data. But backing up, what is the mode any way? Let's reconstruct a dialogue of simple (S) and complicating (C) comments, starting with the treatment in many introductory texts. S1. The mode is the most common value. S2. For categorical or count variables, the mode can be established by counting, or equivalently by inspecting a table or bar chart of frequencies. C3. But watch out: Ties can occur, and modes may not be well defined, especially but not only in small samples. C4. For (approximately) continuous variables, we need to think in terms of the position of the maximum of a density function. Counting may fail abysmally and it may even be true that each distinct value occurs only once, or that any ties are just quirks of measurement or sampling. S5. Histograms can help. Which bar is the highest? Looking at a histogram often makes it clear that (a) there is a strong mode or (b) there isn't. It may be helpful to think in terms of two or more modes -- with a looser definition of mode as a peak in density. C6. But watch out: The occurrence of peaks on a histogram can be an artefact of bin origin, bin width, or even boundary rules (are bins $(a, b]$ or $[a, b)$ ?). Even when a single bar is clearly highest, that still leaves the mode identified as an interval. Some older texts introduced procedures for using the frequencies associated with adjoining bars to get a point estimate. S7. Hang on: who said that we are limited to using histograms? We can work from other estimates of the density function, such as kernel estimates. C8. But watch out: The occurrence of peaks in density estimates can be an artefact of kernel shape (occasionally), kernel width (often), whether estimation is combined with transformation, or boundary rules when the support of the variable is bounded. S9. Sometimes if a brand-name distribution is a good fit, then the mode can be identified directly using estimates of other parameters. S10. A relatively simple half-sample mode algorithm often works quite well. Much more at How to find the mode of a probability density function? What is the big picture? Even statistically-minded researchers differ on how far modes are interesting or useful. When they are interesting or useful, it can be true that a rough indication of modes is good enough, and the other details can look like fussing.
