ATT is the average causal effect of treatment in those that received treatment. This is defined as the difference between two things: the expected outcome of those that were given the treatment, if they had received the treatment (which they actually did, so ignoring issues like missing data, we directly observe this) and the expected outcome of those that were given the treatment, if they had not received the treatment (we do not directly observe this). You paraphrased the second bullet slightly incorrectly, which I think is the source of the confusion. And, yes, the second thing is a hypothetical thing that we somehow need to figure out (e.g. via some appropriate modeling) and cannot normally observe directly. There's of course experimental designs that make this a lot easier, e.g. if treatment assignment is via randomization, then you know that the expectation in the second bullet has the same expectation as the observed outcomes of those randomly assigned to be untreated.
