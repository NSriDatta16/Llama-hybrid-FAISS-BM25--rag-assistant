One of the nice features of a continuous integration (CI) tool is that a build gets triggered every time something is checked into your source control repository. If that is not something you need then you are probably better of using the windows task scheduler or cron jobs. In addition CI tools also come with a (web) dashboard and advanced logging capabilities. Your question seems to me more "why would I use a CI tool" then "which CI tool should I use". If a batch script serves your needs, please use that. (Re)creating a build environment only becomes easier if you do not need a CI tool as an additional component. If you want source control triggered build, a dashboard, storage of old build results or other logging, use a CI tool and avoid developing all such functions in batch or shell scripts.
