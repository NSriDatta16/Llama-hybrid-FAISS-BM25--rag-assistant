There are multiple ways to input data, linear interpolation (as you suggest), splines, or any other complicated way you can dream of. However, regardless of the method you choose, you will be artificially reducing your uncertainty by using the data more than once. As usual with small sample sizes, this is a scenario where if you can quantify your uncertainty in the form of prior distributions, being Bayesian can really pay off. If you're interested, this book by Raquel Prado and Mike West is a good place to start.
