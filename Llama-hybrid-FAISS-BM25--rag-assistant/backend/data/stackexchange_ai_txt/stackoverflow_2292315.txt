A recursive algorithm uses the stack as storage area. In the iterative version, you use some vectors, which themselves rely on heap allocation. Stack-based allocation is known to be very fast, since it is only a matter of moving an end-of-stack pointer, whereas heap allocation may be substantially slower. That the iterative version is slower is not fully surprising. Generally speaking, if the problem at hand fits well within a stack-only recursive model, then, by all means, recurse.
