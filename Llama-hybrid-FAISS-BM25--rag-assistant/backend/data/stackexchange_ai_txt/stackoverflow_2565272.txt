Poor Transparency on Images

I am having problems getting transparency to work well on an ImageView. The images at ( http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/6233/whatn.png ) were screen captured from a Droid (hdpi). The top image I made in Photoshop and left the background white. The bottom image is the same image with the background transparent and the layout's color (white) shows through. Whenever I have transparent backgrounds in images it dithers shadows like this. Also, it only happens on hdpi devices, on my G1 (mdpi) it looks just fine. What is going on? How can I make the bottom image look as good as the top one?
