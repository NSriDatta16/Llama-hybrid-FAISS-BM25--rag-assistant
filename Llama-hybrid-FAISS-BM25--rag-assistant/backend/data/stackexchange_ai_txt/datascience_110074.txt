Do you mean using an ML model to make predictions, and then combining the original features + predictions as new features into another ML model? Conceptually that's a bit weird, unless you think the first ML model has some limitations (e.g. systematically biased) and you want to somehow correct for it using the second one. But in that case why not just use the second architecture. A much more common type of ensembling is simply training both models, and then do some sort of aggregation (e.g. average) on the predictions.
