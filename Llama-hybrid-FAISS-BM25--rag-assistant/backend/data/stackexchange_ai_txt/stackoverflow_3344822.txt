On your app startup use NSUserDefaults to check for the presence of a user setting with a name of your choosing (for example firstRunFinished or userAgrredToTerms). if that setting is present and has value of true (or YES), you proceed normally. if the setting is missing, or is present but has a value of false (or NO), push your terms and conditions view as a modal view at the top of your main controller view stack.
