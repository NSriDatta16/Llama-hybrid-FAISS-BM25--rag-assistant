Update: To be very precise; this is already known paradox in probability theory; which is called the confusion of the inverse . See the Marble problem discussed below . Where probability of a cubic marble to be pink; is asymmetrical to a pink marble to be cubic. $P(A|B) â‰  P(B|A)$ ..... (Not necessarily equals to, except the values may coincide) This is a very common fallacy in conditional probability . Using Bayesian theorem; $$P(\text{Pink}|\text{Cube})= \frac{P(\text{Cube}|\text{Pink})P(\text{Pink})}{P(\text{Cube})}$$ $$=\frac{75\% . 20\%}{50\%}=30\%$$ So using Bayesian theorem, the 2 representations of the data are consistent, just they are answer to two different questions. As user Scortchi - Reinstate Monica suggested, this can be described as a subset of affirming the consequent fallacy , a fallacy related to cause and effect . ............................ I would call it a generalization (that may lead to stereotype ) or misattribution (esp. culture bias ) I would interpret is this way. Suppose I have 2 kind of crop plants : Rice and Wheat Now I have a virus, which affect only 10% of the rice plant and 30% of the wheat plants. The statement "among wheat plants, most are are somewhat immune to the virus, only 30% of them are susceptible"- this is an answer to a different question. The statement "among wheat plants and rice plants, wheat plants are 3 more susceptible to the virus"- this is also true, and an answer to a separate question. Now, using one of the answer to nullify the other, is not correct, because they are answers to different question. Giving more mundane example. Suppose we have some marbles; which can be categorized according to colour (blue and pink); or by shape (round or cubic). $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} & \text{BLUE} & \text{PINK} \\ \hline \text{ROUND} & 90 & 10 \\ \hline \text{CUBIC} & 70 & 30 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ As an overall, if a marble is a cube, it is not very much likely to be pink. But if a marble is pink, it is very much likely to be a cube. Both information can be useful while making government policy etc. Suppose Group-1 is a non-vegetarian eater. Group-2 prefers vegetarian food only. Most members of both group prefer a lecture to be delivered in English, but some members from both group prefer a lecture be delivered in Hindi. $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} & \text{English} & \text{Hindi} \\ \hline \text{Non-veg} & 90 & 10 \\ \hline \text{Veg} & 70 & 30 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ From this given data, it would be aweful to generalize that vegetarian eaters are necessarily Hindi speakers; but it can be said if you arrange a comedy show only for the Hindi speakers from the people in the given sample, you may have to arrange more food coupons for vegetarian people.
