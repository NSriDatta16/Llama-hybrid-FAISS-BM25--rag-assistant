According to this thread : Prof. Mikhail Atallah et. al. here at Purdue did a lot of research on watermarking text . The approach uses TMRs ( Text Meaning Representation ) of phrases to encode bits by performing minor transformations positioning the TMR at a certain distance from a defined canonical form. (another method to watermark text is presented here ) It may be another way to hide text within text, along with the Steganograph method described in the other answers.
