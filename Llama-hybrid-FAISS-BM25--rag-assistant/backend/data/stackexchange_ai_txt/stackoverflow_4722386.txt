There are several ways to do this. First off all you may save your connectionString in an app.Config/web.config file. Your connection objects may access this string by using PROJECTNAME.Properties.Settings.Default.YOURCONNECTIONSTRINGNAME Your app.config file may look something like this As you can see this possibility still saves any user credentials hardcoded (although you may change them by manually editing the config.file (even after compiling). You may create such a config file by adding a new datasource to your project (e.g. sql server datasource). The wizard will then ask where to save your connectionString. Another possibility will be connectionStringBuilder. This class offers some properties: SqlConnectionStringBuilder conbuild = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder(); conbuild.InitialCatalog = "dbNordwind"; // database name conbuild.IntegratedSecurity = false; // true if you use winAuthent conbuild.UserID = "sa"; // e.g get this info by showing a authent form conbuild.Password = "123"; conbuild.DataSource = "servername"; SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(conbuild.ConnectionString); Using this method you may even access a file and read any required data. In this case you have to look into security measures for your file! Securing your file may be done by encrypting it (System.Security namespace) or saving data into any isolatedStorage (user specific - windows security will be used) or by using "aspnet_regiis -pef" to crypt any config-file.
