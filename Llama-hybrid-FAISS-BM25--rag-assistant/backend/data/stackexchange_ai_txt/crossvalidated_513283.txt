What concept comes before VAE and after GMM?

Suppose I am designing a course on generative models and I have just finished discussing GMM. My goal is to teach VAE. However, VAE's technicality is very high. Does there exist some model in between GMM and VAE that's useful to as a conceptual bridge? Sorry if this is a general question, but it is similar to how you wouldn't want the first lecture on supervised learning to be CNN, but rather build it up from linear regression or something.
