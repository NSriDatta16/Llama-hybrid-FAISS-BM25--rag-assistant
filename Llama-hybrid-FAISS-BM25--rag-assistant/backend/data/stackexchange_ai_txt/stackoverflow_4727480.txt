How do I make my Perl scripts act like normal programs on Windows?

I want my Perl scripts to behave just like any other executable (*.exe file). When I double-click on myscript.pl I want it to execute instead of opening in a text editor. I want to run myscript.pl instead of perl myscript.pl . I really want to run myscript instead of myscript.pl . I want to run program | myscript instead of program | perl myscript.pl . I want to be able to run my script via drag & drop. There are a number of changes you have to make on Windows to make all of these things work. Users typically stumble upon things that don't work one at a time; leaving them confused whether they've made an error, there's a bug in Perl, there's a bug in Windows, or the behavior they want just isn't possible. This question is intended to provide a single point of reference for making everything work up front; ideally before these problems even occur.
