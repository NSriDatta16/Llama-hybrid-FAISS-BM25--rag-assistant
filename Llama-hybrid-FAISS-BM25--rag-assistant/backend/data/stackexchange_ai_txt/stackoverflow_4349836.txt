How can I add an ICS meeting automatically to the Organizer's calendar?

Our java application generates ICalendar files using ical4j, and sends them out to users as part of an HTML e-mail notification. A couple of users (the Organizers of the meeting) report that the the "Accept", "Reject", etc. buttons for the meeting are grayed out, and unclickable. The meeting is not added to the Organizer's calendar. How can I force the meeting to be added for the Organizer? I configured the server temporarily to send the .ics file as an attachment (instead of inline), so that I could run it through a web-based ICalendar validator. The validator gave me a warning that the Version property was supposed to be the first property, but didn't find any other problems. The ICalendar works normally for every user except the organizer. I was able to reproduce the issue on my own Outlook account. I noticed that if I send the meeting notice through a gmail mail server, it works normally; but, when it comes from our internal Outlook server, it doesn't get added to the calendar. A message is shown underneath the grayed-out meeting controls: "As the meeting organizer, you do not need to respond to this meeting." Example ICalendar file generated by our system: BEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:2.0 PRODID:-//MyCompany//Product//EN CALSCALE:GREGORIAN METHOD:REQUEST BEGIN:VEVENT DTSTAMP:20101202T210423Z UID:77B17E9B-BE02-476E-816B-ED9558EE7D2A DTSTART:20101230T133000 DTEND:20101230T143000 SUMMARY:Review Meeting for A1 CI Review #123456 LOCATION:BLDG - 123 CREATED:20101202T210423Z LAST-MODIFIED:20101202T210423Z TZID:America/New_York ORGANIZER;CN="ORGANIZER, THE";SENT-BY="mailto:noemail@mycompany.com":mailto:myemail@mycompany.com ATTENDEE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;CN="ATTENDEE, SOME":mailto:noemail@mycompany.com END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR Edit: I tried adding the meeting organizer as an "Optional to" participant. No dice; same behavior. Edited the question again to reflect my progress on the issue.
