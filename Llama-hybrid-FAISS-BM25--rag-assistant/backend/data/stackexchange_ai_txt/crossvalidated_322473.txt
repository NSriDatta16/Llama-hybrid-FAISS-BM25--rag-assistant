Conditional probabilities - are they unique to Bayesianism?

I wonder whether conditional probabilities are unique to Bayesianism, or whether they are more of a general concept that is shared among several schools of thought among statistcs/probability people. I kind of assume it is, because I assume that no one can $p(A,B) = p(A|B)p(B)$ is kind of logical, so I think frequentists would at least theoretically agree, while cautioning against Bayesian inference more out of practical reasons, and not because of conditional probabilities.
