acceptdragdrop in flex

I am having one mxml in which I am doing dodrag of buttons into other canvas I want to have acceptdragdrop in other file so that the canvas accepts dragged buttons there is Panel.mxml in which I am writing this.addChild(button); button.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE,dragTaskImage) private function dragTaskImage(event:MouseEvent):void { ..... } Now I want to have other function in workflow.mxml in which I accept drag?
