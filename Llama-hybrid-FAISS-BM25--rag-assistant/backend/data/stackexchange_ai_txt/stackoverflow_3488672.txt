Javascript issue with http://mysite.com vs http://www.mysite.com

I've never experienced this problem before, and it just came to our attention because a client was trying to access our page and couldn't see much of the javascript. He was navigating to http://www.mysite.com , when we've always just gone to http://mysite.com . There appear to be no problems server-side, as in both url's are pointing to the same place. There are also no errors on the page when it loads. Has anyone had to deal with this before?
