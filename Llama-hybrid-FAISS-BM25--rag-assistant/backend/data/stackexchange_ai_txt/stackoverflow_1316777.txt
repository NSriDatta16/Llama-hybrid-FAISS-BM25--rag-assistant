Having attempted something like this before I can tell you it isn't particularly easy. What you'll need to do is provided on an OnMouseDown/OnMouseMove/OnMouseUp event to the form itself (or some control in the form) that updates the position of the control when the user clicks and drags. To my knowledge there is no built in control that will allow you to click and drag a window other than the title.
