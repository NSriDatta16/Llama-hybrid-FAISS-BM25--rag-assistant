Don't do it. The Xcode project files are notoriously fragile, and aren't always compatible between versions. When they make known-incompatible changes between versions, you'll get a warning opening the files on the new version. There's no such warning for 3.2 vs 3.1, but that doesn't guarantee that you won't have any problems. I should probably clarify that I don't mean that you should never upgrade, just that you and your partner should upgrade at the same time.
