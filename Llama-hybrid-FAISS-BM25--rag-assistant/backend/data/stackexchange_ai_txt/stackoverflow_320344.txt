I agree that avoiding polling is a good policy. However, In reference to Robert's post , I would say that the simplicity of polling can make it a better approach in instances where the issues mentioned here are not such a big problem, as the asynchronous approach is often considerably less readable and harder to maintain, not to mention the bugs that can creep in to its implementation.
