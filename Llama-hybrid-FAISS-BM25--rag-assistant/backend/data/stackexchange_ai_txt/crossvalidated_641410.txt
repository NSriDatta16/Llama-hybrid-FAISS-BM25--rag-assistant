Can a deep enough linear neural network (with activation functions) be able to learn anything?

Shouldn't a deep enough linear neural network (with activation functions) be able to learn anything, even recurrent and spatial patterns? I could just flattened timeseries data or image data and pass it as input to a fully connected feed forward network. Why wouldn't it be able to learn from that data. This would be inefficient but would this be possible? So Hypothetically I could replace an RNN or a CNN with a deep enough enough fully connected feed forward network?
