I will not answer to your question related to genetic, as I do not have the expertise for it. But here's some comment and answers on your design: My first concern is about the sea water compartment. Can you change the PH and randomized the PH treatment between those ? This may seems of low importance, but let's say that one of the compartment is closer to a source of light that disrupt larvae. You would then end up with a systematic bias. From what you describe, your experimental unit is the sea water compartment. Your cylinder are samples, and NOT independent replicates and should not be in your model. If you change larvae each day, your random term could rather be the day. Finally, if you want to test larvae family, you should not put it in the random term. I hope this will help, even though it isn't complete.
