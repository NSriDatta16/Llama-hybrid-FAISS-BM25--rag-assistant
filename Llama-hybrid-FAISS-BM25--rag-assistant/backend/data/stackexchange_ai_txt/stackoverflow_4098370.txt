Can I search inside multiple attributes with a single form field? (Magento AdvancedSearch)

I'm trying to modify Magento's AdvancedSearch but I haven't found a way to search for all the "text" fields using a single input. I can show inputs to allow searching for something inside Name or Description or ShortDescription, but is there a way to show the customer a "Text" input and make it search inside all the fields at once? If I use the full text search instead then I'd have no way to search for the text only for products within a certain price or belonging to a specific category, right? Thanks in advance!
