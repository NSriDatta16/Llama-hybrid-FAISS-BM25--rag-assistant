To calculate the odds ratio for the reverse group comparison, take the reciprocal of the odds ratio. To calculate the confidence limits for the reverse group comparison, take the reciprocals of the limits and swap them. Note: This is only valid for binary categorical predictors. That is, $\operatorname{OR}_{BA} = 1/\operatorname{OR}_{AB}$ and $L_{BA}=1/U_{AB}$ and $U_{BA}=1/L_{AB}$ . Here, $L$ and $U$ denote the lower and upper confidence limits for the odds ratio, respectively. The reason is that in a logistic regression model, the odds ratio is obtained by calculating $\operatorname{OR}=\exp(\beta)$ . If we switch the reference category, the coefficients sign is reversed, i.e. $\beta_{BA} = -\beta_{AB}$ . Hence, $\operatorname{OR}_{BA} = \exp(-\beta_{AB}) = 1/\exp(\beta_{AB})$ . Here is an illustration using R : set.seed(142857) # Sample size n $x2 x2, ref = "1") # Re-run the logistic regression mod2 You see that the odds ratio where $x_2=1$ is the reference category is the reciprocal of the odds ratio where $x_2=0$ is the reference category: $1.253 = 1/0.798$ . The lower confidence interval limit where $x_2 = 1$ is the reference category is the reciprocal of the upper limit where $x_2 = 0$ is the reference : $0.524 = 1/1.907$ etc.
