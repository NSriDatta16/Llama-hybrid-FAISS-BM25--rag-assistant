How do you foster the use of shared components in your organization?

If your company or project places an emphasis on (or at least appreciates) the development of code and components that can be reused and shared across projects, what are the "social engineering" things you've needed to do to facilitate the re-use the code? In my experience, code or components that are simply stated as being "reusable" won't be reused unless that code has someone to champion or evangelize it. Otherwise, people simply won't know about it. How do you make sure shared components or reusable code work in your organization?
