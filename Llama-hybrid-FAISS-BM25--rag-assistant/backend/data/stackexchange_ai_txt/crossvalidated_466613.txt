Presumably the person who asked this question is long gone, but for future reference I will mention a book here. Note: I have not read this book. Theoretical Statistics: Topics for a Core Course , by Robert W. Keener. Amazon: link. I quote the last three lines of the review by Amazon user Der Boandlkramer: This book is in a class by itself! Its natural companion (and prerequisite, to some extent) textbook on probability is the monumental "Foundations of Modern Probability," by Olav Kallenberg. For whatever it's worth, Keener's book is used at UCLA (STAT 200B).
