45 characters . You might expect an address to be 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 8 * 4 + 7 = 39 8 groups of 4 digits with 7 : between them. But if you have an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address , the last two groups can be written in base 10 separated by . , eg. [::ffff:192.168.100.228] . Written out fully: 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:192.168.100.228 (6 * 4 + 5) + 1 + (4 * 3 + 3) = 29 + 1 + 15 = 45 Note, this is an input/display convention - it's still a 128 bit address and for storage it would probably be best to standardise on the raw colon separated format, i.e. [0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:c0a8:64e4] for the address above.
