Object oriented way of doing things is something that no one can tell you in just a single shot. It's a whole new paradigm of thinking on how a problem can be solved in terms of few interacting objects. These objects are from the problem domain for which you are creating a solution. From the question, I can easily pick out atleast two problem domain objects - one would be "Customer" and the other "Order". May be your "Order" class is composed of various objects of "OrderItem" which is composed of a reference to one of the "Product", quatity and may be the price. If this is getting a bit hard to understand, I'm pretty sure that you would atleast have a database with tables that provides persistent storage of data. The tables that you have, (in many cases) can correspond to the actual classes that you need to design. You dont' have to design seperate classes that are actually going to work with the datagrid and other controls, that can stay be in the code behind. But all your business domain objects and the operations that can be performed on these objects must be encapsulated into classes.
