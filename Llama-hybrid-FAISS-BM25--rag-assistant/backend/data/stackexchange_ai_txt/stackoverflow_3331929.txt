Releasing a PHP CMS... how to?

I'm about to release a CMS written in PHP (using Zend Framework). It's very powerful and easy to manage once you understand it. I was wondering to release it some under commercial license (I want money) but I realized that there's a saturation of CMS's on market. So I think I'm going to release it under some open-source license. I know I have to choose the license but the question is: once the license is choosen what do I need to do to release it? To turn it official, so one cannot just "steal" it's code and say that created it. I read on a website that I just need to create a file called "license" and write the license there but what about the security? I know the code cannot be compiled or obfuscated so what do I do to "turn official" that I created it? Thank you for attention.
