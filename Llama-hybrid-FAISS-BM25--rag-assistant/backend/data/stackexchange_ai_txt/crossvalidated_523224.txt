Deterministic or stochastic universe in Bayesian statistics?

Dave Harris says the following in "Knightian uncertainty versus Black Swan event" : In Bayesian thinking, chance doesn't really exist. What does exist is a system that is too complicated and complex to know enough to make statements that you can be sure are 100% true. That seems to imply the universe / world (or at least the processes that are being modeled) is deterministic for a Bayesian. Is that a universally or at least widely accepted viewpoint? For a related question about the frequentist point of view, see "Deterministic or stochastic universe in frequentist statistics?" .
