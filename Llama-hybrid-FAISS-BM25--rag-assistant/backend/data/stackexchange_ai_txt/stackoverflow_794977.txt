C#/.NET - Custom Binary File Formats - Where to Start?

I need to be able to store some data in a custom binary file format. I've never designed my own file format before. It needs to be a friendly format for traveling between the C#, Java and Ruby/Perl/Python worlds. To start with the file will consist of records. A GUID field and a JSON/YAML/XML packet field. I'm not sure what to use as delimiters. A comma, tab or newline kind of thing seems too fragile. What does Excel do? or the pre-XML OpenOffice formats? Should you use ASCII chars 0 or 1. Not sure where to begin. Any articles or books on the topic? This file format may expand later to include a "header section". Note: To start with I'll be working in .NET, but I'd like the format to be easily portable. UPDATE: The processing of the "packets" can be slow, but navigation within the file format cannot. So I think XML is off the table.
