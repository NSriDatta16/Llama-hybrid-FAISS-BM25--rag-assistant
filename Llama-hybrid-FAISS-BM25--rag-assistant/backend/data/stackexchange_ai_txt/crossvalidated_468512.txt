How can I solve "horseshoe effect" on ordination analysis (Canonical Correspondence Analysis)?

I would like to ask for help in the analysis of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) that I did in the Vegan package in R, with my dataset of species and environmental parameters. The result appears in the image below. The expressed result shows the "horseshoe effect". I have already researched the subject in Numerical Ecology with R and other books and papers, and I found some explanations that talk about metric distance saturation (Morton et al, 2017 - Uncovering the Horseshoe Effect in Microbial Analyses ). What sort of ordination analysis should I do instead of CCA so that I don't have the horseshoe effect again, and how can I solve the metrics issue?
