'Continuous-state' Regime Switching Time Series Model?

I've been thinking of an idea, and I've had a difficult time finding any information on it so I'm not sure if there's a literature on it, or if I have an awesome original idea, or a stupid idea of no use. Model Essentially the basis would be a typical regime switching AR model of the form $$x_t = \beta_{0,s} + \beta_{1,s} x_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$ Where $t$ is time, and $s$ denotes a specific regime. I then modify it so $\beta_1, \beta_2$ would, rather than being associated with an element in a set of discrete regimes, be pulled from a distribution with parameters based upon the previous $\beta$ values. A simple version with normally distributed $\beta$ would be a model of the form $$x_t = \beta_{0,t} + \beta_{1,t} x_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$ $$\textrm{where } \beta_{i,t} = \alpha+\gamma_{i,0} \beta_{0,t-1} +\gamma_{i,1} \beta_{1,t-1}+v_{i,t},$$ with $\alpha,\gamma$ values as static coefficients, and distribution term $v \sim N(0, \sigma_{\beta}^2)$. Obviously there are a lot of modifications one could do, but I'm just trying to clearly demonstrate the sort of thing I have in mind.
