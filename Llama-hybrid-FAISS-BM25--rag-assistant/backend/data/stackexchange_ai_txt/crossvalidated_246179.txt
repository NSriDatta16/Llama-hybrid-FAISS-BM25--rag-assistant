Why is the marginal likelihood difficult/intractable to estimate?

I have a generally basic question to ask here that has been troubling to me for a while. Through most of my reading of bayesian statistics, it stated matter-of-factedly that the marginal likelihood is often intractable or difficult to estimate. Why? Reasons often stated include statements about high dimensional nature of the integral/summation to be estimated, or that the realm of possible models are infinite. I would please like this community to point me to something that digs into why, and explains this issue in simple language. Links to resources would also be appreciated. I have googled the terms in search of resources that explain this clearly, but most of them just state the issue without explanation. I also have the books pattern recognition in machine learning & the kevin murphy machine learning book. I am not satisfied with the explanations in these texts, so I am looking for something clear and simple.
