You may view your data as a time series where an ordinary measurement produce a value very close to the previous value and a re-calibration produce a value with a large difference to the predecessor. Here are simulated sample data based on normal distribution with three different means similar to your example. By calculating the difference to the previous value (a sort of derivation) you get the following data: My interpretation of your description is, that you tolerates re-calibration (i.e. points on greater distance from zero, red in the diagram), but they must interchange between positive and negative values (i.e. corresponding to shift from blue state to the yellow one and back). This means you can set up an alarm seeing a second one red point either on the negative or positive side .
