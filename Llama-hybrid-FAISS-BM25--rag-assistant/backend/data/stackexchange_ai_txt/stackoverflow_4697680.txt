In general, HTML5 tries to discourage authors from providing content that's hidden from sighted users, because (a) it often contains new information that would be of use to sighted users, (b) it's frequently poorly written because there's little feedback to the (normally) sighted author, and (c) it is not maintained as carefully and therefore can go stale quickly. So, instead of hiding the information in an attribute, consider placing it normally on the page as a caption in a tag adjacent to the svg or math section, or put the text in a tag and put that and the svg/math section in a element. If you really don't want sighted users to see the information, I believe that the standard technique is to absolutely position the caption with a large negative "left" value, at least until such time as screen readers catch up with HTML5.
