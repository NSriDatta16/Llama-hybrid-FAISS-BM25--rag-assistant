Dividing a square by the diagonals and making each resulting triangle a separate button

Suppose I have a square and divide it by the diagonals resulting in four identical triangles (apart from their rotation). Using CSS/HTML/Javascript, what is the best way to turn each triangle into a clickable area while not splitting apart the encompassing square? I have been looking into creating the triangles using image maps ( ), but it seems to me it only works as expected in Internet Explorer. As another possible solution, I have tried rectangular divs mimicking the triangles by placing gradually smaller rectangles towards the center of the encompassing square from all four "corners of the world". However, that is not an elegant solution, and really not what I'm aiming for, since I want "smooth", not jagged, triangles.
