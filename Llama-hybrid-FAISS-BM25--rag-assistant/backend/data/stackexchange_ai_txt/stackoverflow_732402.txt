There's no way to raise a mousemove and have it fill in the resulting target element properties, no. There is a way to get an element from arbitrary co-ordinates, but you won't like it much. It involves walking over each page element and calculating its dimensions (from offsetLeft/Top/Parent) and which elements overlay which other elements (from calculated styles ‘position’ and ‘z-index’)... essentially, re-implementing part of the browser's own layout engine in script. And if you have elements with ‘overflow’ scroll/auto you have even more calculation to do. If you have a limited case (eg. you can only drop the div somewhere amongst a set of other statically-positioned divs) it can be manageable, but the general case is quite hard and in no way fun. (Maybe someone somewhere has packaged such a feature up into a library or framework plugin, but I've not met one yet.) If you can find another way to make your drag'n'drop behave nicely that doesn't require you to do this, then do that!
