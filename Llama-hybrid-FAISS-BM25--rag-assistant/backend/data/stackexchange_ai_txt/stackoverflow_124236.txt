Unless they are the top level domain name (eg "foo.bb" rather than "bb.example.net"), then they are choosen by the organisation that owns that domain name, remember if you own a domain name, you own all subdomains. In that case, you can call it whatever you want. There's no specification and people call it many different things. There are many 2 level top level domains, one for each country. E.g. .fr for France. More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CcTLD
