Your app fires up and a certain bit of code in the app delegate gets fired. You can add code to this method. In addition, you have access to user defaults, use them to store simple data, such as a flag to indicate that the app has been run once. I'm not going to give you code, but there's enough in that first paragraph that you should be able to implement this yourself using logic, and the "getting started" introductory materials i'm also not going to link here, since you should have read those yourself by now. If you haven't, please head on over to http://developer.apple.com/ios/ and get started.
