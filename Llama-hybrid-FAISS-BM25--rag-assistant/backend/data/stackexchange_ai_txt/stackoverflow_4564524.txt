Turn what "feature" off? If the worker process is reset (and your using in-proc session) then the session is blown away on a reset. You might want to investigate moving your session storage to a state server or some other out of process scenario. Also, you might want to set the application pool to use several worker processes (aka: web garden) this way if one process is killed the others continue serving content. Next, as another option you might want to set up multiple web servers and load balance them. Finally, you might want to profile the app to see exactly how they are causing it to spin into nothingness. My guess is that there are a number of code issues you are simply covering up with this idea.
