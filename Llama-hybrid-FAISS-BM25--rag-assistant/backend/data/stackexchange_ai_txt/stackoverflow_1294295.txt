Coming to think of it, Properties are more than just syntactic sugar. They are the public face of your member data to you member code. Thus, giving you a clean layer for retrieval or input of a single aspect of you member data from you code. A DTO for example is nothing but a bunch of well written properties, cleaving data and behavior efficiently. Without a DTO would you imagine tightly coupling your DataGrid or Dropdown to complex business logic method? Put it simply, Methods are actually doing the work...Properties either instigate action or get the status. Though, you can use method code inside your properties ...it is not what they are meant for. Even, if you have to you are better of making a clean call to another method inside the property instead of actually writing you code in it. HTH!
