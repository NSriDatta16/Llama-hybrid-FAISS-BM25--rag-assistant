Lazy DBA Are you talking about bringing back all the values in your dimension table? If so, then why not add a non-clustered index with additional coverage such that you're only pulling values out of the index itself, rather than from the table? That way you're scanning a B-Tree with some attached "covered" values, as opposed to potentially performing a table scan? I can't vouch for relative performance, but it's worth testing for the scenario you're obviously working on. Cheers Ozziemedes http://ozziemedes.blogspot.com/
