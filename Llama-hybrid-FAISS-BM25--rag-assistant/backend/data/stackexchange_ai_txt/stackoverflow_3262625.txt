It's solved. No valid information was to be found in any logs. The silly answer was that, for some reason, port 80, that Tomcat uses, was blocked by a "System:4"-process. After some research it turned out to be the AD. Never would have suspected that since it happened all of a sudden. That is, it worked for a couple of weeks then just one day - nothing. You'll have to edit TeamCity\conf\server.xml TeamCity\buildAgent\conf\buildAgent.properties to use another port instead of the default port.
