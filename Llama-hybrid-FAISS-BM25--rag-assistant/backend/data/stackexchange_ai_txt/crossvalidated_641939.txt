Meaning of subscript $n$ in sample mean variable

I am reading Wasserman's All of Statistics. In Chapter 13: Linear and Logistic Regression, when deriving the least square estimates for simple linear regression, we have the data $(Y_1, X_1), \dots,(Y_n, X_n)$ . Wasserman denotes the sample mean of the covariates $X_i$ as $\bar{X}_n$ . The sample mean for the response variable $Y$ is also denoted this way. My question is what does the subscript $n$ mean here? Why is it not simply $\bar{X}$ ? Is it to convey the number of samples used, highlighting it is a sample mean as opposed to a population mean? But isn't the population mean usually denoted by $\mu$ ?
