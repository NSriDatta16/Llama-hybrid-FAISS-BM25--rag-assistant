You can construct larger tuples, but you'll need to define them yourself. Secondly, you don't have a Show instance, so you would also need to write an instance for that. In general, it is a bad idea to use large tuples, when you should be using a smarter data type, such as a vector. We discourage the use by limiting the size provided by default.
