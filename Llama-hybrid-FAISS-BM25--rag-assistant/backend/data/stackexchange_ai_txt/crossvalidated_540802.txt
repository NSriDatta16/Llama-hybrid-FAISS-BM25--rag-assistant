Fast feature selection on a huge dataset in R on a term document matrix

I have a 500K rows x 10K features dataset. It consists into : a term document matrix with words + bigram and TF-IDF weighting 6 one hot encoded multi-labels It is much more features that I want to train for the classification tasks. I will train several models but I need to reduce the the dimensionality first, while keeping the word per word explainability. I have several feature selection algorithms in mind that I could apply prior to any classification algorithm. Chi Square ANOVA Univariate LASSO Backward propagation Random forest based ... I'm not experienced with such hudge BoW dataset. I was wondering if some of you had this experience and could tell me what feature selection methods could run fast and get good results? Thanks
