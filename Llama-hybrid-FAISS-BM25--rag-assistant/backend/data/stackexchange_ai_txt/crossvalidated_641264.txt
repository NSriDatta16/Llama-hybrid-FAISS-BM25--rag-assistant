Counting problem in conditional probability exercise

I want to solve the following problem: A real estate agent has 8 master keys to open several new homes. Only one master key will open any of the houses. If 40% of these are usually left open, what is the probability that the real estate consultant will open any of the houses? So, we can define the events: A:The real estate consultant enters the house B:The house is open C:The house is closed D: The key is correct And note that $$P(A)=P(B) \cup P(C \cap D)$$ And for the independence $$P(A)=P(B) \cup P(C) \cap P(D)$$ Note that $P(A)=0.4$ and $P(C)=1-P(A)=0.6$ But my question is how to do the counting to find $P(D)$ , this is because it is not specified how many keys the consultant is trying, because for example if it were for three keys the count is easy $$\frac{\binom{1}{1} \binom{7}{2}}{\binom{8}{3}}$$ Any suggestions?, I'll apreciatte it
