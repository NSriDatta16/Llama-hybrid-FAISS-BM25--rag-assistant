Assuming you've built a drag and drop implementation without jQuery UI to have it snap to another element you need to now do the following: Determine the position and dimensions of the dragging object and other objects to which you want the element to be able to snap to While an object is being dragged you need to determine if the object being dragged is within your arbitrary threshold distance of an object it can snap to at that point you bump the dragged elements left/top to match the left/top/bottom/right position of the "snappable" element
