What you need to learn are RNNs and LSTMs. Here are some links I used to learn these: CS231n RNN+LSTM lecture Understanding LSTMs Also I would suggest you to use Keras , a Tensorflow API. In my experience, it makes working with RNNs and LSTMs way easier, if you're a beginner. I found these articles which seemed related to your problem: Time series classification project by naveen sai on github https://aboveintelligent.com/time-series-analysis-using-recurrent-neural-networks-lstm-33817fa4c47a https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/ Keywords to search: Time series classification tensorflow keras
