Capacity of a learning model relative to the training size

True or false: The more data examples we have, the more confidence we will have in using a high-capacity model without fear of overfitting. Here the “capacity” of a machine learning algorithm corresponds, informally, to the “size” or “richness” or “complexity” of the considered set of functions among which it searches for the best prediction function.
