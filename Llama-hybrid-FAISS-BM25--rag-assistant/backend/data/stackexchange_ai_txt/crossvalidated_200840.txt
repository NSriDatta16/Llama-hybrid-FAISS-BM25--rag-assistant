Binomial GLM vs. Bernoulli GLM

I have some data that- in its raw form - represents group binomial data.Y vector is the probability of an event. Using logistic regression I get one set of parameter coefficients. Turning the data into a longer form - Bernoulli format (i.e. Y vector is 1 or 0), I use logistic regression again and get a different set of parameter coefficients from before, why is this?
