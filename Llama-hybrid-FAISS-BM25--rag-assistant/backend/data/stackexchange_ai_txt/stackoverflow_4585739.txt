How should I join these 3 SQL queries in Oracle?

I have these 3 queries: SELECT title, year, MovieGenres(m.mid) genres, MovieDirectors(m.mid) directors, MovieWriters(m.mid) writers, synopsis, poster_url FROM movies m WHERE m.mid = 1; SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movie_ratings WHERE mid = 1; SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM movie_ratings WHERE mid = 1; And I need to join them into a single query. I was able to do it like this: SELECT title, year, MovieGenres(m.mid) genres, MovieDirectors(m.mid) directors, MovieWriters(m.mid) writers, synopsis, poster_url, AVG(rating) average, COUNT(rating) count FROM movies m INNER JOIN movie_ratings mr ON m.mid = mr.mid WHERE m.mid = 1 GROUP BY title, year, MovieGenres(m.mid), MovieDirectors(m.mid), MovieWriters(m.mid), synopsis, poster_url; But I don't really like that "huge" GROUP BY, is there a simpler way to do it?
