With three separate tests you get multiplicity problems, with a mixed model (with mice as a random effect) you get only one test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between days. (OK, one test per feature) That is probably why your colleague suggested this. EDIT Frank Harrell in a comment below criticizes the use of mixed models in this case, and prefers some Markov model. For an answer of his with more details, see What are the assumptions that need to be checked for multilevel logistic regression and for multilevel ordinal logistic regression
