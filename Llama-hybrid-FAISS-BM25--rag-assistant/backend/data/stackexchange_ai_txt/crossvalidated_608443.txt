In your solution, you have 7 regressors, which are Y, Z, X, Z, X, Y, which are all regressed onto X,Y,Z. In the final matrix, each regressor has a beta (= rows in the final array) onto each target (= column in the final array). This is clearly not what you want. I would propose looking into regression theory and figuring this out on your own instead of relying on ChatGPT. The answer you got is very wrong and the code quality is also pretty bad. From the way you posed your question it also appears as if you have some basic misconceptions about how linear regression works, so diving into the theory might be a good idea. If you are a visual learner, I can highly recommend the ritvikmath YouTube channel, which is the place I usually go to if I need to get an overview over a topic. However, there is a plethora of high quality material on OLS, so this is just one suggestion. Lastly, I would like to add one point: I have personally never heard of any scenario like the one you're describing and feel like it's a very uncommon use case to the extent where I would say it's not really valid. Could you maybe explain a bit about what you're trying to achieve?
