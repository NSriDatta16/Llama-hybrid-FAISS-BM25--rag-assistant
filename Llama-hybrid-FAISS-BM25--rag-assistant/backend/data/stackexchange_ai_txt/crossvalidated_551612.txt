What you are describing with probability distributions is called joint modeling and can be expressed using a regression model. This is the same machinery used to model repeated measures in, say, a clinical trial. The clinical trial panel data represents measuring the same endpoint on the same subjects longitudinally. In your case you are measuring different endpoints on the same giraffes cross-sectionally. In both cases, though, we have correlated measurements. Bradley Efron and others have written about the idea of division of labor. Rather than building an all-encompassing model it is more practical to build separate models to address different questions. If each giraffe measurement follows a different type of probability model it may become unwieldy to jointly model all three distributions, so we might use semi-parametric methods to jointly model just the means. If we wanted to condition the joint model on two of the endpoints to explain a third endpoint we could fit a separate standard issue regression model for this task. Since this is a univariate model with multiple regressors we could opt for a parametric model that describes the entire endpoint distribution rather than focusing exclusively on the mean. While there are certainly efficiency gains in terms of smaller standard errors by jointly modeling endpoints, it is by no means a requirement. Simply modeling each endpoint separately still allows you to make estimated probability/proportion statements about the population, form tolerance intervals that cover the true population proportions, and construct prediction intervals for predicting future samples. The coverage rates of such intervals would be on a per-endpoint basis, rather than a joint coverage rate. Keeping in mind that all of this has to eventually be disseminated to non-statisticians the idea of division of labor is not just a pragmatic matter for the analyst.
