Project Management software

i'm interested in project management software similar to MS Project. the project is a serious rebuild of my software. we have a bug management system already but i need to track project progress. i don't like web-based apps so much because the data is either hosted off-site or i need to set up my own server. i like MS Project but it doesn't seem to compare estimated time with actual time and use it to pro-rate the future work estimates. i'd like a gantt chart & calendar view. thank you for your help!
