I actually found a different, (in my opinion) more elegant, certainly simpler way to do this. My problem was that my file contained a pointer to my CSS file as href="./css/styles.css". The styles.css file is never, ever going to move. So, I just changed the href element to be an absolute URI ( http://www.mysite.com/css/styles.css ) instead of a relative URI. Problem solved! Thanks to everyone who posted for their help.
