"Random effects must be less than the number of observations" error in lmer package with categorical predictors

I know similar error messages were discussed before, but my question is different than those. I have a model in the following form: $$Y_{ij} = \alpha_jX_i+ \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij} $$ Here $\beta_j$ is a categorical variable (Group), $\alpha_j$ is a random slope for each group, $X_i$ is a categorical variable to identify each subject, and $Y_{ij}$ is subject $i$'s contribution to group $j$. When I write this model in lmer , I use the following model function: contrib ~ Subj + Grp + (Subj+0|Grp) I don't have observations for all Subj-Grp combinations. Some subjects only participate in some groups. When running this model, if my Subj is a continuous variable, then I don't get any error message. But if my Subj is a categorical variable to identify each subject, I get the following error message: Error: number of observations Is there a way to use a lmer model for such cases with imbalanced data? Any conceptual explanation about the differences of a model with a random slope for a categorical variable vs. continuous variable would be really helpful. Edit: as requested, this is the scenario I am trying to model. Subjects in the study are members of multiple groups. But not every subject is part of every group. So I think this is not a fully nested design (?). I measure the quality of the contribution of each subject to each group they contribute to ($Y_{ij}$ is such a measure). This measurement could be due to the properties of the subject and the group. That is why I am including categorical variables for the subject and the group. However the subject could have different quality of contribution in different groups. Hence I include a random slope $\alpha_j$. When I got the error message for subject as a categorical variable, I tried to replace it with a continuous value for the subject (average quality measurement across all groups the subject participate in). What I am interested in finding from the model is $\alpha_j$ (i.e., how much a subject vary in different groups).
