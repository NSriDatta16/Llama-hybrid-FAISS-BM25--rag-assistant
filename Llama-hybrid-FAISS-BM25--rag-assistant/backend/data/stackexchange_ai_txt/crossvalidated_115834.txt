Somewhat tangential to the question: it is important to note that the t-test - while popular - is ill suited for this particular application since its distributional assumption is violated. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is better to compare classifier performance. An excellent paper on the subject is Statistical Comparisons of Classiﬁers over Multiple Data Sets . A relevant snippet: On the other side, comparing multiple classiﬁers over multiple data sets—a situation which is even more common, especially when general performance and not the performance on certain speciﬁc problem is tested—is still theoretically unexplored and left to various ad hoc procedures that either lack statistical ground or use statistical methods in inappropriate ways [...] We observed that many otherwise excellent and innovative machine learning papers end by drawing conclusions from a matrix of, for instance, McNemar’s tests comparing all pairs of classiﬁers, as if the tests for multiple comparisons, such as ANOVA and Friedman test are yet to be invented.
