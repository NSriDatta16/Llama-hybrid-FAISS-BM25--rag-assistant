Getting my Java program to display images through drag and drop

I am trying to get my program to display an image after it is dragged over, but I dont really have a good idea of how to do this. Example: There is an image on your desktop, photo.jpg . You would take that, drag it over into a java JFrame, and the contents of that image (the photo iteself) would display. From there I would like to be able to play with the size ability of the photo, but first step first, I dont know how to approach getting it to display in the JFrame. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
