I just pasted your code and it works as intended. I can write forward slashes without problem. Have you checked if the glyph is embedded? (in case you're embedding fonts, that is). I'd write your code like this, though: myInputField.restrict = "A-z.\\-/"; Since you don't need to escape forward slashes.
