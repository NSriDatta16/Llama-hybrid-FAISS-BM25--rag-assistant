How to interpret Random Forest variable importance vs. distribution of min depth plots?

I am using Random Forest (regression) to analyze data on civil conflict. I have plotted two different things: variable importance and the distribution of the min depth (using the package randomForest randomForestExplainer in R). My question is: How come the variable with the highest variable importance is not the variable with the lowest mean min depth? And what does this mean that they are not equal? I included the two images. The dependent variable is conflict intensity. The data is structured in a country-year format, so for every country I have a data-point for every year. The independent variables include population, region, gdp etc. require(randomForest) require(randomForestExplainer) randomF
