I hate to say it ('cause you clearly indicated you don't want to hear it), but get into the IDE. Trying to get your head around smalltalk without using the IDE is like going to Paris and eating at McDonalds. Sure, you're in Paris, but you aren't really exposing yourself to what it's all about. The key thing about smalltalk is that it's all objects . All the way down (integers and characters are objects) and all the way up (classes, methods, the browsers, the IDE itself) are all objects . If you insist on fighting it you'll have about as much luck as someone wanting to learn how to write C by dragging and dropping things.
