Typically I see two options for you here. You can store an XML serialized object into the database, and simply use standard XML Serialization, here is an example that you can adapt for your needs. You can create a true table for this object, and do things the "Standard" way. With option 1, filtering/joining/searching on the information in the "data" column although still technically possible, is NOT something i would recommend and would be more for a static storage process in my opinion. Something like a user settings entity, or some other item that is VERY unlikely to be needed for a backend query. With option 2, yes, you have to do more work, but if you define the object well, it will be possible. Clarification With regards to my example in #1 above. You would write out to a memory stream, etc for the serialization rather than a file.
