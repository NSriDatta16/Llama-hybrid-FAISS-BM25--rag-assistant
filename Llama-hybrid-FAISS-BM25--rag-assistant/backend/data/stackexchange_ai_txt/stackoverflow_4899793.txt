What are you doing with the hash codes? If you're using them to work out whether two pieces of data are the same, an MD5 hash is pretty good, though only if you are working with data that is not being created by malicious entities. (Cryptographic purposes need better hash algorithms precisely in order to deal with the "malicious attacker" problem.) If you're using them for building a map (i.e., you're building a hash table) it's usually better to use a cheap hash and come up with a way to mitigate the costs of collision (e.g., by hanging a linked list off the hash table and resizing/rebuilding when the average weight gets too large).
