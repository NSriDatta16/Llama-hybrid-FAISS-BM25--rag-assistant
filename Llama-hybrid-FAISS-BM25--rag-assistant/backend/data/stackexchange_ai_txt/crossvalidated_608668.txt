ARIMA/SARIMA does not require any scaling. (Nor is it the case that "any dataset that goes as input to a Machine Learning model" needs to be scaled.) (S)ARIMA can't deal with any predictors at all, so your question about encoding of categorical predictors is moot. There is (S)ARIMAX, or regression with (S)ARIMA errors. These are different things. If you fit such a model, categorical predictors will usually be encoded one-hot, but honestly, it does not matter a lot. Your software should do this under the hood. (S)ARIMA expects data with a predefined seasonal frequency, i.e., number of periods per season. As such, there is no notion of "dates". You might have a vector of observations with a frequency of 7, and that might be daily data with weekly seasonality. Or you might have a frequency of 4, and your data might be quarterly with yearly seasonality - or it might be aggregates per six-hour-buckets with daily seasonality! It doesn't matter, and (S)ARIMA won't care. All it cares about is the frequency. ( Note that (S)ARIMA has major problems with "long" seasonality, e.g., daily data with yearly seasonality. Daily data with weekly seasonality is fine, monthly data with yearly seasonality too.)
