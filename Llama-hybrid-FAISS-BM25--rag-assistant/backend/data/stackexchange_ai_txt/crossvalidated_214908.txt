Is it possible to train neural network to draw picture in a certain style?

Is it possible to train neural network to draw picture in certain style? (So it takes an image and redraws it in a style it was trained for.) Is there any approved technology for such kind of a thing? I know about DeepArt algorithm. It is good to fill main image with certain pattern (for example, vangoghify image), but I am looking for something different - i.e., for example, making cartoon in a certain style from the input portrait.
