iPhone sockets - 3g vs. wifi

I have developed a trivial example application leveraging the example CFNetwork code listed here, http://dev.im.ethz.ch/wiki/Socket_communication_on_the_iPhone and combined it with the SpeakHere example on the apple developer site. Using this I have managed a very, very crude mechanism to stream audio to my server. It works surprisingly well over wifi, but hangs/bombs out over the 3g network. I had hoped that 3g/wifi would be transparent with respect to this issue but that doesn't seem to be the case. Is there any documentation regarding salient differences between these two?
