email inline images in base 64 through email with php code igniter

I am generating images dynamically at run time with php and have them displayed in base 64 through the browser. This same page/html document I need emailed but this method to show images does not work through email. I have found two code igniter libraries to try and help me with this task two of which do not work http://thecodeabode.blogspot.com/2010/11/codeigniter-and-php-howto-embedding.html http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Richmail/ The first one gives me Unable to send email using PHP mail(). Your server might not be configured to send mail using this method. From: "SystemDDX" Return-Path: Reply-To: "internal-33e@google.com" X-Sender: internal-33ek@google.com X-Mailer: CodeIgniter X-Priority: 3 (Normal) Message-ID: Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit The second one is extremely outdated The only method which I've managed to get working so far is using the code igniter $this->email->attach("C:\myfile.jpg") and then in my html reference using The problem is my image is in base64 as I'm generating it dynamically so if I can't figure out anything else, how can I revert base 64 to a specific file name while keeping it in memory. Please any tips and help would be greatly appreciated
