Pattern for WCF Kerberos Clients where Server uses User Account

We have a WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) client and service application. We're using Windows Authentication with Kerberos. The issue is that the service may be run under one of many accounts (maybe Network Service, maybe a specific user account -- depends on the IT group). This account is not not likely to change daily, but possibly on occassion (every few months maybe). Additionally, we deliver this client/service package to several groups, and each group may have its own account that they use to run the service on (this is to just let you know that we can't do a custom solution for a single team). Now the reason the above paragraph is an issue is apparently if the service is not running in the SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE account, i.e., a user account, then the client must specify the name of the user account in the identity of its endpoint. For more on this restriction see: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wcf/thread/feb6bc31-9a4b-4f8d-a887-ef6d2c7abe41 and http://www.vistax64.com/indigo/146204-using-localhost-v-s-environment-machinename.html Now this seemingly makes it tough to deal with the situation where the IT department changes the account that the service runs on. What is the pattern for handling this, if there is one? How have other people handled this? One solution I've thought of is that the admin sends out an email when the user account of the service has changed, which has a weblink to an application that updates the client or a config file, so the client refers to the new user account. But that seems hackish. Admittedly, this is a lot like the URI of the endpoint moving. Except, I think there's a lot more expectation on behalf of people that changing the URI is something the client should have to know about, but changing the account the service is running on is something that should be relatively transparent to the client. BTW, this is required to be hosted on IIS 7.0, if that matters.
