Question about consumer report and market shares

in my job we just got a consumer report about the automotive industry in which they outline the most significant brand attributes considered in the process of purchasing a new car. I transformed the presentation into a table like this: Brands Attribute.1 Attribute.2 Attribute.3 ... Brand.A 0.23 0.21 0.06 ... I also happen to have the market share by brand, which is an ordered data frame of brand names and market shares. What I want to know is which brand attributes can actually predict market share. I know should have time series data to make a robust analysis but I only have one period data and would like to know if I can make an approximation with this imperfect data. How can I measure the attribute's effect on the share's variance? What other alternatives with my current data do I have if I get a non-significant result? Thank you in advance.
