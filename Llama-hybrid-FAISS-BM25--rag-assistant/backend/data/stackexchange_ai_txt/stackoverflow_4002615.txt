AWS::S3::MissingAccessKey in Paperclip but I've defined both

I'm on Heroku, and this is a portfolio thing which I'm putting up on github for potential employers to look at, so obviously I don't want to stick my keys in a S3.yml file. I've exported S3_KEY and S3_SECRET to my environment both on Heroku and my machine and ruby can access them. But when I try and upload, it gives me the following error: AWS::S3::MissingAccessKey in Portfolio itemsController#update You did not provide both required access keys. Please provide the access_key_id and the secret_access_key. The trace is irrelevant except for my controller line #, which works fine until I try and upload a file. Here's what I have: class Asset { :thumb => "100x100#", :small => "300x300", :large => "600x600>" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => { :access_key_id => ENV["S3_KEY"], :secret_access_key => ENV["S3_SECRET"] }, :bucket => "bucketybucket", :path => "portfolio" end Anyone know what's going on here? How am I constructing this hash wrong? Oh, and I've followed this thread, no dice: Paperclip and Amazon S3 Issue
