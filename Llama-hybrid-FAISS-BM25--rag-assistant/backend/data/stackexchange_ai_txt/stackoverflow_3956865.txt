Why do you want to allow people to search for a page that they can't access if they click the link? Its technically possible to make it difficult (check in your authentication code if useragent contains 'googlebot', though there is nothing stopping people from faking this useragent if they want your content bad enough) but largely pointless. Also google's official line (IIRC, can't find this anywhere though) is that you may be penalized for deliberately trying to show googlebot different content to what human users see.
