Currently you're attaching the click handler to all elements in the DOM with * (very very bad, don't do this! ), including any children in those draggables. You are correctly stopping the event from bubbling up using .stopPropagation() , but it's likely a child of a .draggable you've clicked, not the draggable itself. What you want is actually listening on the .draggable element themselves, like this: $(".draggable").click(function (e) { var offset = $(this).offset(), theId = this.id; e.stopPropagation(); $("#result").text(this.tagName + " id=" + theId + " (" + offset.left + "," + offset.top +")"); $.post("http://localhost/index.php", { id: theId, x: offset.left, y: offset.top }); }); The other changes here are id can be accessed directly, via this.id , and passing an object to $.post() is safer for serialization, like I have above. Even the above isn't quite there though, you likely want to send the position when you stop dragging, by changing this: $(".draggable").click(function (e) { To this: $(".draggable").bind("dragstop", function (e) { ...or in newer versions of jQuery (1.4.2+): $(document.body).delegate(".draggable", "dragstop", function (e) {
