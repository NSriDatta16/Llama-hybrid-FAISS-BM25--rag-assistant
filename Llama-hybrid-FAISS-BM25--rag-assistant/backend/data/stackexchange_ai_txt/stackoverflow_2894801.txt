Google App Engine: Which is its RDBMS?

According to this: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html it seems that GAE only uses Datastore to store data, which is equivalent with Table service on Windows Azure Platform. Does anyone know that which RDBMS it uses? or such thing exists or not? EDIT: Windows Azure Platform, a cloud-computing platform by Microsoft, offers 2 options to store data: Windows Azure Storage service, which include Table service, which is similar with GAE Datastore. Both store data in entities, and their "tables" are schemeless SQL Azure, which is a RDBMS on the cloud, based on SQL Server. It supports most features of SQL Server, includes T-SQL That's why I think it's hard to believe that Google App Engine doesn't offer a RDBMS. I searched, but found no confirmation. That's why I asked here
