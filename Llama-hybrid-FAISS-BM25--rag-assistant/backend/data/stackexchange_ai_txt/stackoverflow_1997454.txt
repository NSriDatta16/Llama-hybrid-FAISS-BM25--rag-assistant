Is it possible to link two jquery.ui draggables together?

I have two jquery.ui draggables. I am constraining their movement to the y-axis. If one is dragged to a certain y-position, I want the other to automatically move to the same y-position and vice versa. Has anyone ever linked two of these together before?
