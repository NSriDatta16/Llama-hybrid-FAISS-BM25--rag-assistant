Are you sure Google Maps doesn't support draggable routes? There are plenty of times I've accidentally dragged a planned route when using the website, throwing everything off. Not sure about the API though. As accuracy goes I've noticed that for directions here in North Carolina, MapQuest is slightly more accurate. Google doesn't always map addresses to the right position. MapQuest and Google use different data providers in some places. Google uses a variety of data, and in some places the providers will be the same (NAVTEQ and Tele Atlas). Otherwise it is largely user preference: I rarely do see sites though that don't use Google Maps. Microsoft seems to force their projects to use Bing for some reason ;)
