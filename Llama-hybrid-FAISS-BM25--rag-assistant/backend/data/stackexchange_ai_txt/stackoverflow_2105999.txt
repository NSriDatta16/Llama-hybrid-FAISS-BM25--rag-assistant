Is Microsoft Office Infopath available to you and your users as an alternative to Excel? This is very specifically a "forms" application, with data validation and native XML data storage format so other apps can easily process them. You can use your own schema if you want. From your description, this sounds like what you want to accomplish. Unfortunately, Infopath 2007 forms are not cross-compatible with Infopath 2003, so a mixed-version office (like mine) can be a showstopper.
