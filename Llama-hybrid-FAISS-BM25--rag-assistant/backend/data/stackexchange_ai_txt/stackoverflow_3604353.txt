toString() not working

I am working with jQuery tabs and I've got some code that fires off when I change tabs. $('#container-1').tabs({ onClick: function(clickedTab, divElement, hiddenTab) { var selectedTab = clickedTab.toString(); // var pos = selectedTab.IndexOf("#") + 1; var results = selectedTab.substring(5); // selectedTab.IndexOf("#") + 1 alert(results); } }); I've commented out the offending code, but when I try to determine the position of the # character, I get an error: Object http://www.omnicom-innovations.com/play/tabsdemo1.html#fragment-2 has no method 'IndexOf' I was under the imporession that by using the toString() method, it would convert the object to a string. This is based off of my understanding of a similar post: jQuery and split not working together? If anyone can point out what's wrong, I'd greatly appreciate it.
