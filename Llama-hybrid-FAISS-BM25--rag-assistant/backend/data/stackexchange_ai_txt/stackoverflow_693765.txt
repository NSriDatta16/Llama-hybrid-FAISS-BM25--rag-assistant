Binary dependencies in Visual Studio projects

I've a native binary dependency for my c# solution which comes in Debug and Release variants, and I'm trying to figure out how to best organize this such that (1) It ends up in the build output, and is found when running unit tests (2) It lives under the checkout directory in source control (3) The correct variant (debug/release) is copied for each build configuration I'm looking at Solution Libs MyLibrary Debug/x86/foo.dll Release/x86/foo.dll MyProject src/com/acme/MyApplication.cs MyProject references MyLibrary and I'd like the build folders to look like: Solution/MyProject/bin/Debug/ x86/foo.dll I'm trying to do this without a custom msbuild file - everything would ideally build from the solution and project files. Anyone have ideas how to do this? (or suggestions how to reorganize the sources to achieve something similar?) I have a few libraries like this, so splitting them all into two (Library_Debug, Library_Release) isn't really an option. any help appreciated ;)
