I have worked with symfony in several projects (one of them is a custom e-commerce site built from scratch), and I'm very happy with this framework. If you plan to use Magento as a backend and symfony for the frontend, I'd suggest you to use Drupal Commerce http://drupal.org/project/ecommerce because Magento is a heavy piece of software. You can even forget about symfony and extend drupal to fulfill your needs. An alternative to Symfony could be Zend Framework http://framework.zend.com
