merging indexed array in Python

Suppose that I have two numpy arrays of the form x = [[1,2] [2,4] [3,6] [4,NaN] [5,10]] y = [[0,-5] [1,0] [2,5] [5,20] [6,25]] is there an efficient way to merge them such that I have xmy = [[0, NaN, -5 ] [1, 2, 0 ] [2, 4, 5 ] [3, 6, NaN] [4, NaN, NaN] [5, 10, 20 ] [6, NaN, 25 ] I can implement a simple function using search to find the index but this is not elegant and potentially inefficient for a lot of arrays and large dimensions. Any pointer is appreciated.
