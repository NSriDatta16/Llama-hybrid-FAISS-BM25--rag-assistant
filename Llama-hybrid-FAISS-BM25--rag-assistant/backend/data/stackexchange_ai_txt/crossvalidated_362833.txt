The CRAN Task Views page for Time Series Analysis lists the fracdiff package : Fractionally differenced ARIMA aka ARFIMA(p,d,q) models. The package is described as follows: Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of a fractionally differenced ARIMA(p,d,q) model (Haslett and Raftery, Appl.Statistics, 1989). The documentation says that the package can perform the following methods: Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) (1983) Reisen (1994) estimator Haslett and Raftery (1989) Regarding Sowell's method from 1992, a number of academic articles ( example ) report that they obtained the FORTRAN code from Fallaw Sowell. Probably, you could request the code and port it to R (if he or the licence approved of that)?! I couldn't find an existing package with the implementation.
