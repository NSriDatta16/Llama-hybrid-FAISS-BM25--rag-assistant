For database queries, you have a two small problems. Cache: data cache and statement cache. If you run the query once, the statement is parsed, prepared, bound and executed. Data is fetched from files into cache. When you execute the query a second time, the cache is used, and performance is often much, much better. Which is the "real" performance number? First one or second one? Some folks say "worst case" is the real number, and we have to optimize that. Others say "typical case" and run the query twice, ignoring the first one. Others says "average" and run in 30 times, averaging them all. Other say "typical average", run the 31 times and average the last 30. I suggest that the "last 30 of 31" is the most meaningful DB performance number. Don't sweat the things you can't control (parse, prepare, bind) times. Sweat the stuff you can control -- data structures, I/O loading, indexes, etc.
