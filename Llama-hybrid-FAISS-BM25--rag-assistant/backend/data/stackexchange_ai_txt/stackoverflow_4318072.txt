I find the use of single quotes advantageous when I'm embedding html into strings, mainly when dealing with templating. Here is an example: public string EmailTemplate = @" HEY {0}! BUY MORE STUFF " // later in code instanceOfStringBuilder.AppendFormat(EmailTemplate, firstNameVariable); I don't have any hierarchy in my mind for whether single or double quotes are "better." It is purely a matter of being consistent and having something that programmatically works.
