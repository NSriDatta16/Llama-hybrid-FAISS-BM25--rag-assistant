Time Series Decomposition : Box Cox for Additive Decomp

Coming from basically no time series back ground, this is likely a simple question, but what is the relationship between "being able to" use an additive decomposition of a series into seasonal, trend and remainder and a Box Cox transformation? From Professor Hyndman's blog : Because not all data could be decom­posed addi­tively, we first needed to apply an auto­mated Box-​​Cox trans­for­ma­tion. I was wondering: 1) What makes an additive decomposition attractive relative to a multiplicative one (which I understand is basically the other choice). 2) What is the requirement for an additive decomp and what does Box Cox do to make this possible? I think of Box Cox for ANOVA and reducing heteroskedasticity. Is there a tie in with decomposition of a series?
