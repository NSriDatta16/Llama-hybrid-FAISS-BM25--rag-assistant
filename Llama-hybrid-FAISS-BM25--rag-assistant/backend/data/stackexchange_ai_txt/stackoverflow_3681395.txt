The commonly used Hanzi/Kanji characters are in the "CJK Unified Ideographs" block between U+4E00 and U+9FFF, and take 3 bytes in UTF-8. (The Japanese Hiragana and Katakana characters also take 3 bytes.) However, there are also some very rarely-used characters in the "CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B" and "CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement" blocks, which take 4 bytes in UTF-8. Also be aware that Chinese text often contains ASCII characters like the digits 0-9.
