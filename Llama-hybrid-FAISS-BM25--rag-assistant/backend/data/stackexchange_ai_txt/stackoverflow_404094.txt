MouseMove event too slow for painting

I'm using C# WinForms to create a level builder for my XNA game. I have a tile grid that you can paint with a Pencil tool, like in MSPaint. The problem is that when you drag the mouse fast(ish) to paint a line tiles get skipped. I've tried using one approach i saw on Google saying to spawn a thread to do the painting, but that didn't seem to help. Any ideas?
