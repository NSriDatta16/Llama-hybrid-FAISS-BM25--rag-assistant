SVM Primal Optimization and Dual Optimization. Under what cases one better than another?

Primal $$argmin_{w} \frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + \frac{1}{N}\sum max(1-t^{(i)}(w^Tx+b),0)$$. The dual form $$max_{\alpha} \sum\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum t^{(i)} t^{(j)}\alpha_i\alpha_j K(x^{(i)},x^{(j)})$$ By optimizing dual form, we have $w = \sum\alpha_it^{(i)}x^{(i)}$ such that $\forall i, \alpha_i(1-(w^Tx^{(i)} + b)) = 0$. Where, there only a subset of vectors satisfies the constraint. Optimizing Dual form clearly has advatanges in term of efficiency since we only need to compute the subset of vectors. While, optimizing primal requires the computation of the whole data set. However, is there any cases that we prefer to optimizing prime instead of dual?
