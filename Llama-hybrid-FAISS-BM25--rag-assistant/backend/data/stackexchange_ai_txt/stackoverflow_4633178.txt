I had the same problem when I moved a development environment from iMac to Macbook Air. With provisioning profiles and certificate, I also exported "developer profile" from previous environment's XCode's organizer. Then I imported it in new machine. If this is not the case, did you download a keychain correctly and add it into "Keychain Access" so you can see "iPhone Developer: your name..." in "My Certificates" category of "Keychain Access"? Edit: Here's an Apple techincal Q&A about CodeSigning Error. (this was not helpful though in my case) http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa2008/qa1618.html
