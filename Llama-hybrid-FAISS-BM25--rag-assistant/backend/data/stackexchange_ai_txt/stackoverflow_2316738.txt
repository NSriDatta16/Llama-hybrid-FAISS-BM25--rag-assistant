I have been thinking about this for a LONG time and after trying putting validation in both controllers and models.... finally I have come to the conclusion that for many of my applications... validation belongs in the model and not in the controller. Why? Because the same model could in the future be used by various other controller calls or APIs... and then I would have to repeat the validation process over and over again. That would violate DRY and lead to many errors. Plus philosophically its the model which interacts with the database ( or other persistent storage ) and thus is sort of a 'last call for alcohol' place to do this anyway. So I do my get/post translation in the controller and then send raw data to the model for validation and processing. Of course I am often doing php/mysql web applications and if you are doing other things results may vary. I hope this helps someone.
