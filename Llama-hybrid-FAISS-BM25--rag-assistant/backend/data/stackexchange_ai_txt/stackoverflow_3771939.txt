How do I map all actions for a controller to the top-level in Rails?

Whenever I develop sites using Rails, I create a controller called "front" which has actions like "index," "how," and "about." So, the home page, "How It Works," and "About Us" pages can be accessed via /, /how/, and /about. My routes look like this: map.root :controller => "front", :action => "index" map.connect 'how', :controller => 'front', :action => 'how' map.connect 'about', :controller => 'front', :action => 'about' I have two questions: 1) Is this a good organization? 2) Is there a way to add one route to make all actions in the "front" controller accessible via /[action]?
