Calculating Bandwidth

Is there any way i can calculate bandwidth (packets sent and received) by an exe/application via net? have looked into IPGlobalProperties , and other classes. I want packets sent and received by a single application. I have checked http://netstatagent.com/ and need something similar. Is there anything in .Net which can help me? My app connects to web service to send and receive some image files.
