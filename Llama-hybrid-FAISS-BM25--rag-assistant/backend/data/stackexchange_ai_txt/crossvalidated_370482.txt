200 samples is likely too little for such a complicated model. Ideally your dataset should be at least 10x bigger. However, here are some things you can try: Simplify the model For example try using just (min,max) or (mean,std) summary across your MFCC frames: 2x13=26 features. Normalize the sounds Common for spectrogram data is to normalize each frame by subtracting the median or mean, and divide by RMS energy, standard deviation or max. Use (log) melspectrogram It can give better performance over MFCC with expressive classifiers like Neural Networks. Simple linear models often struggle with the co- Use a less data-hungry classifier Like Random Forests or kNN. Data augmentation Expand your data artificially using data augmentation. Common augmentations for audio data include time stretching, frequency response changes, adding white noise. Unsupervised feature learning Use unsupervised learning too learn more powerful features. A simple mechanism is spherical k-means on randomly selected spectrogram patches (3x3) to learn convolution kernels.
