You could track an IP+UserAgent on the server over a short duration, but you couldn't depend on tracking a cookie (as a user agent like cURL could just disregard saving it) unless a valid cookie matching a session was required to interact with your site. If the IPs or UserAgents spamming your site/app were constantly changing then there's no sense in even storing them on the server to simulate a cookie. You'd want to create a CAPTCHA to gate whatever is being spammed. We'd need more information to be any less general. ;)
