Tool / accelerator for improving adding css and script resources to MVC3 Razor pages

Is there any tool to make adding files to MVC3 razor pages faster? I find myself having to drag script files onto the page to generate: Which then i'll copy and paste Then cut/drag the rails.js fragment into the new script statement. Then at some point after this hopefully I remember I need to clean up a whole bunch of duplicated and/or broken script links. There has to be a better way than this that doesn't involve typing urls out manually.
