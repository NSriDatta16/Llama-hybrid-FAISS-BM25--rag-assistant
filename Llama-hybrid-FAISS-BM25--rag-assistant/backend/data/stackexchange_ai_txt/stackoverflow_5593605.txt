How to design data vault schema for efficient queries for BPMS system?

Current situation: We have a BPMS (business process management suite) in place. There is increasing demand on historical and operative reports. The data model in the BPMS is not designed for historical queries. So we are analysing the possible solutions. Solution in mind: The idea is to push data on events in flow to an external database. Typical events in BPM are: new process instance was created, status changed, a step in the process was performed or status of the process instance was changed. Data vault is besides the star schema one of the interesting alternatives. Let’s assume there are two Hubs: PI (processitem instances) and OU (organisational unit) and a Link table LINK_PI_OU. Each time the process item is assigned to an organisational unit a new line will be added to the link table. The LOAD_DATE in the link table contains the datetime when this record was added. The record in the link table with the latest LOAD_DATE shows the current assignment of the process instance. Question: Let’ assume the business wants to know to whom all open process instances are currently assigned grouped by organisational unit. How will a query look like for this report? Can it really be performant? Or am I on the complete wrong way?
