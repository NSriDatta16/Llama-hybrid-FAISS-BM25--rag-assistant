When using batch_normalization first thing we have to understand is that it works on two different ways when in Training and Testing . In Training we need to calculate mini batch mean in order to normalize the batch In the inference we just apply pre-calculated mini batch statistics So in the 2nd thing how to calculate this mini batch statics Here comes the moving average running_mean = momentum * running_mean + (1 - momentum) * sample_mean running_var = momentum * running_var + (1 - momentum) * sample_var
