To be consistent with your final model, only plot the effects for the variables that are actually in it. However I must caution you that this kind of stepwise variable selection procedure is very, very bad and it is extremely depressing that your supervisor seems to think it is OK. Is there no underlying theory to which you can appeal ? You seems to be interested in inference rather than prediction, so you you to pay very careful attention to which variables are potential confounders, mediators, instruments and competing exposures.
