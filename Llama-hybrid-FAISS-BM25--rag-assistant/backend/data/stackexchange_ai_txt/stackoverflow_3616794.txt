In my projects I often want to organize views and tests somehow, so I use structure like this: package |-- __init__.py |-- models.py # models are in one file |-- etc. # shared stuff |-- tests | |-- __init__.py | |-- tests_orders.py | |-- tests_clients.py | |-- | `-- etc. |-- views | |-- __init__.py | |-- orders.py | |-- clients.py | |-- | `-- etc. For bigger projects having view functions in one file is a pain (for me). This is what works for some projects I am working on - hopefully someone find this useful also.
