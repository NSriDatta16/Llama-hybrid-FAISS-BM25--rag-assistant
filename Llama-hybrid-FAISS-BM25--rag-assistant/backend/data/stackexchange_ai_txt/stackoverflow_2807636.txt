It might be more fun to have a dynamic that models a behavior resulting in a good reasonable solution, rather than finding an ideal solution to drive the behavior. Suppose you plan each trip individually. If you're a driver and you need to get from point A to point B, how would you get there? You might consider a few things: I know about typical traffic conditions at this hour and I'll try to find ways around roads that are usually busy. You might model this as an averaged traffic value at different times, as the motorists don't necessarily have perfect information about the current traffic, but may learn and identify trends over time. I don't like long, confusing routes with a lot of turns. When planning a trip, you might penalize those with many edges. If speed limits and traffic lights are included in your model, I'd want to avoid long stretches with low speed limits and/or a lot of traffic lights. I'd prefer freeways or highways for longer trips, even if they have more traffic. There may be other interesting dynamics that evolve from considering the problem behaviorally rather than as a pure optimization. In real life, traffic rarely converges on optimal solutions, so a big part of the challenge in transportation engineering is coming up with incentives, penalties and designs that encourage a better solution from the natural dynamics playing out in the drivers' decisions.
