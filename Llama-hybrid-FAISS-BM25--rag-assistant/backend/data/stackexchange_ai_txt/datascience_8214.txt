Unsurprisingly most programs in data science focus mostly on business or marketing applications. I too would like to see more programs focused on Biotechnology, Gaming or Energy for example but I think that in the future those kind of programs will become more and more available. However there are a few I know of that offer a somewhat different approach. Regarding health informatics there are many offers where you can find anything between Public health to Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics. Take a look at the full list. http://www.mastersindatascience.org/specialties/health-informatics/ On that list there are a few certification programs but there also are full fledged programs that lead to a M.Sc. If you are more interested in Marketing Analytics you can find the same list but for marketing related programs. http://www.mastersindatascience.org/specialties/marketing-analytics/ other options like Information Systems are also present, just browse that site and you might find something that interests you.
