Exception during hibernate saveupdate org.hibernate.TransientObjectException:

Hi i have hibernate mapping like this class name="com.example.Company" table="user"> Before save update my database is something like this company table COMPANY ORGANIZATION_ID ORGAIZATION 1 4 NULL organization table id name 4 xxxx now my problem is when I try to do saveorupdate org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: com.example.Organization. I used cascade=all but every time when i save update it creates new row in organization table hence i removed cascade =all when i was using casade =all it was working but it does something like this company table COMPANY ORGANIZATION_ID ORGAIZATION 1 4 5 organization table organizationid name 4 xxxx 5 nulll it creates null. How can i solve this problem.?
