sending SIGINT CTRL-C using ganymed SSH2?

I need to kill a process that I have started using ganymed SSH2. Specifically I would like to gracefully kill it using Ctrl + C . I have seen ideas of trying to send ASCII \x03 but when using the execCommand() it wont take escaped chars. How can I send Ctrl + C SIGINT through ganymed? If there is another Java SSH app I should be using let me know, I have looked into Jsch, sshj but just found ganymed ssh2 to the be easiest. The program i am trying to kill is tethereal (wireshark)
