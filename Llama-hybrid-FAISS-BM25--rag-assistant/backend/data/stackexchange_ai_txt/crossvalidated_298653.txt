Predict values from random forest model

I am trying to run a random forest model with the following code: rftest depn is the dependent variables and for.rf contains the set of dependent and independent variables. Next I am trying to predict the values using predict(rftest,for.rf) and then manually I calculated the mean of squared residuals which didn't match the RF output. However simply using predict(rftest) match the results. Can you help me to understand how predict(rftest,for.rf) behaves differently than predict(rftest) ?
