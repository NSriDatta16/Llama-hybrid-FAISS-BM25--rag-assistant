In one of my applications, I have getIdentity() return a user object, and it works pretty well for me. To use your factory method, do like this: $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance(); $user = R00_Model_User::getInstance(...); $auth->getStorage()->write($user); Then when you call getIdentity(), you will have your user object.
