Finding a Data pattern

I am new to this data science field. I have data of points in 3D space and each point "helps" a metric. I have the sets of points and corresponding metrics. Data might look like: [Pt_set1_1], [Pt_set1_2], [Pt_set1_3], ..., [Pt_set1_20], Metric1, Metric2, Metric3 [Pt_set2_1], [Pt_set2_2], [Pt_set2_3], ..., [Pt_set2_20], Metric1, Metric2, Metric3 I want to identify which points help which metrics. Is this problem solvable with the data science algorithms. Which algorithm would help me? Please let me know. Any help would be appreciated.
