Calculating future occurrences of Friday the 13th

I'd like to be able to start with a year, and calculate occurrences of Friday the 13th. A brute force solution is easy and obvious. I have something slightly better, but I have no doubt that someone else can come up with an elegant algorithm for this. Perhaps a little trickier, I'd be interested in giving the program a month, and have it find the next year in which that month has a Friday the 13th. Feel free to use pseudo code, but I expect people will vote more for working code samples in you favorite language.
