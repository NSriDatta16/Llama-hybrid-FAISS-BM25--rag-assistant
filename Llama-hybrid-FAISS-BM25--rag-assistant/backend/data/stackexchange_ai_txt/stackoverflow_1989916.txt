Why is IE letting a URL link break its container div?

Shows fine in FF, (continues the URL down to the next line, nice and clean). But IE lets it break passed the right border of the div. The NEWS section of this page: http://www.albuquerquecupcakecreations.com/index.php Any thoughts are appreciated! Thanks!
