Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: Local Features vs Global Features

In the paper Learn To Pay Attention an attention mechanism is developed which takes into account both local and global features. It is written that the local features are basically the feature maps extracted from the intermediate convolutional layers of the network, while the global features are the feature maps output from the whole CNN architecture. So the global features are typically given as input to fully-connected layers. But conceptually why is this true? I can't fully understand local features and global features extracted in a CNN
