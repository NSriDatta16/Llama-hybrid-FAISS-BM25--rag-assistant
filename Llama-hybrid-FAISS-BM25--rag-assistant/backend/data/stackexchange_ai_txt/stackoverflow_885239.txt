php: reversing mysql_real_escape_string's effects on binary

I built a webpage where users can submit a PDF which is then inserted into a MySQL database in a mediumblob for retrieval later. This all works fine, except when the PDF contains images or embedded fonts, in which case the images are corrupted and any text using the font disappears (Acrobat display a message about the missing font). I've determined the problem occurs from my passing the pdf data through the mysql_real_escape_string_function. I have switched to base64_encode/base64_decode on submission/retrieval which fixed the problem for all new files, but I have about 25 already submitted PDFs I need to be able to read. Is it possible to reversed the effects of mysql_real_escape_string? Or are these files damaged beyond repair?
