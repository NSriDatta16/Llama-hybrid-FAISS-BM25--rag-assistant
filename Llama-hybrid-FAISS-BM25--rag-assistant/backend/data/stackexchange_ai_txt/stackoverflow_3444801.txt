Setting Connection string in dbml files using Linq to SQL in Visual Studio 2008

I have an application that works with a database "TestDB". At the time I was developing the application I was using linq to sql and adding my data tables by dragging and dropping to the TestDB.dbml file and probably .net automatically sets the connection string to the local sql server on my machine. The application is supposed to launch on some windows based instruments. and the database will be local in those instruments. Now, how can I change the connection string to make sure that the local database inside the instrument will be targeted for my application? Also, I added username and password to my database so it will not be windows Authentication connection and my guess is that username and password should be part of the connection string.
