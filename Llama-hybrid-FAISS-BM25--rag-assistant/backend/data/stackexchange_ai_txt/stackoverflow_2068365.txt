Swap iphone resources in SVN working copies

We have a development environment with a lot of different settings for our sandbox instances, staging servers, and production environment. In our iphone code, we keep these settings organized in plists. Anyone have references to best practices for managing the swapping out of plists based on the current environment? Without having to manually change files, or worry about committing development environment changes to the repository? Ideally it would just be a build argument switch or something.
