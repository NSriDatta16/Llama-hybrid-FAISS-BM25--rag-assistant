I think your problem is related with \n and QMAIL , the mail function documentation state this. Note: If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some poor quality Unix mail transfer agents replace LF by CRLF automatically (which leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This should be a last resort, as it does not comply with Â» RFC 2822. so you if you header are separated by \r\n you could probably replace those by single \n . This bug report also provide a solution using a script.
