The 9-patch tool is a bit awkward to use, but it does work. I believe you need to left click and drag around the edge to paint the outside border. Alternatively, you can use any image editor and create a one pixel empty border around it, and draw in the following: Top/Left = black pixels for the area of the image that can be grown or shrunk as needed. For a typical border, it is everything except for the curved corners Bottom/Right = black pixels for the small snippet that should be repeated if the image needs to be grown in that direction.
