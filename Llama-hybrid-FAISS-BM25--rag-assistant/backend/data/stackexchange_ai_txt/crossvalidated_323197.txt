At the heart of binary logistic regression is the estimation of the probability of an event. As detailed in RMS Notes 10.2.3 the minimum sample size needed just to estimate the intercept in a logistic model is 96 and that still results in a not great margin of error of +/- 0.1 in the estimated (constant) probability of event. If you had a single binary predictor the minimum sample size is 96 per each of the levels. So your sample size is insufficient for the task at hand. Not that p-values do not help this situation in any way.
