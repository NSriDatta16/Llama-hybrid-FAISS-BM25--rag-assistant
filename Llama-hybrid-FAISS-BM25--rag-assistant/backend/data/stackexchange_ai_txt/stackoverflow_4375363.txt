EnvDTE.Expression - Getting the internal name of DataMembers programmatically

Supposing I have the C# code line: var myList = new List {1,2,3}; And I put "myList" in the Watch window, and then drag the 1st item of the list down, the watch window creates a new line with the internal name of this data member, which in this case would be (new System.Collections.Generic.Mscorlib_CollectionDebugView(myList)).Items[0] My question is, is there a way to programmatically get this internal name from an EnvDTE's Expression's DataMember? Thanks a lot!
