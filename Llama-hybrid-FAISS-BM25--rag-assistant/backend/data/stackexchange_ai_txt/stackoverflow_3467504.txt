It's probably more to do with the caching headers you're sending back on each page request. You have content that is only valid for a short time so you need to make sure you send headers back when you generate the page telling the browser not to cache it locally. Example of disabling the page caching here http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_http_header.asp : // Date in the past header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); header("Cache-Control: no-cache"); header("Pragma: no-cache");
