Configuring permissions for JNLP:

I'm trying to run a webstart demo, which ran on my friend's Windows machine, but throws an access error on my Ubuntu Linux box. javaws http://common.l2fprod.com/jnlp/demo.jnlp And I get the following error on my Linux box: java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission javawebstart.version read) I assume this is a configuration issue on my Ubuntu machine. What needs to be changed to allow access to the webstart version?
