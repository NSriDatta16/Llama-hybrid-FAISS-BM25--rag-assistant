Business related errors should not be exeptions. Exceptions are there if there is an event in the program that the program is not designed to handle or completly unforseen. To this end, if you anticipate a large number of different exceptions, by all means implement some useful numbering scheme. Here I would recommend a guid for the reason of component reuse. Every component should expose some interface to query the list of possible exception numbers (this can then be added to a data store for documentation). Also as you reuse components, error codes will not conflict. User or business data errors on the other hand almost warrant some numbering scheme. There is almost no way to anticipate all the silly things a user is capable of . However, I would strongly discourage formal language exceptions in favour of some custom error object. Language exceptions may incur significant overhead, or require specialized handling to prevent them from propogating up the call stack. A business error object may very well be a nice way to go.
