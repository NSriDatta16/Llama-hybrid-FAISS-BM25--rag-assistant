There's definitely been a trend towards leaner user interfaces with less doodahs. Context menus however are special, it is difficult to come up with good icons. Context menu commands are invariably verbs. Icons show objects, they are nouns. Suggesting action in an icon isn't easy to do well with so few pixels to work with. Personally, I never pay attention to them, usually because I can't figure out what they mean. The Visual Studio 2010 View menu is a rather good example of this. Too many, not distinctive enough.
