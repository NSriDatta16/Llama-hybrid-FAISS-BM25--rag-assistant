Error with GWT Stockwatcher tutorial

I am working through the GWT tutorial. I get through step 3 and when I go to run it I get an error with the web browser that says, "Plugin failed to connect to host mode server at 127.0.0.1:9997" In the eclipse development mode there are two errors one with finding entry point classes that says,"unable to find type 'com.google.gwt.sample.stockwatcher.client.Stockwatcher'" And another error that says, "failed to load module stockwatcher from user agent. Any ideas? Help is greatly appreciated.
