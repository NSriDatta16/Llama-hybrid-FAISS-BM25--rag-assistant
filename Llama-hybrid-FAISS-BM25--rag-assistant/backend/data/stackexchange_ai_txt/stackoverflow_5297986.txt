According to Key Storage and Retrieval , when Windows creates a Machine key store, it creates a file in the Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\Machine Keys directory. You could loop through the files and search for the file. See the example here called TryKeyContainerPermissionCheck for a way you might find the file.
