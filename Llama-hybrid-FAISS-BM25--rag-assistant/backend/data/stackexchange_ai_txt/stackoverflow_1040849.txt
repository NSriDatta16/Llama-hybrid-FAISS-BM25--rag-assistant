I propose a simple formula, that (I believe) captures your requirement. In order to have a full "quarter circle", which is your extreme case, you would use (1-cos((x*pi)/(2*100)))*100 . What I suggest is that you take a weighted average between y=x and y=(1-cos((x*pi)/(2*100)))*100. For example, to have very close to linear (99% linear), take: y = 0.99*x + 0.01*[(1-cos((x*pi)/(2*100)))*100] Or more generally, say the level of linearity is L, and it's in the interval [0, 1], your formula will be: y = L*x + (1-L)*[(1-cos((x*pi)/(2*100)))*100] EDIT: I changed cos(x/100) to cos((x*pi)/(2*100)) , because for the cos result to be in the range [1,0] X should be in the range of [0,pi/2] and not [0,1], sorry for the initial mistake.
