There is no "golden bullet" to solve such problem. Without prior knowledge about the nature of variables and their relationship with behavior the answer cannot be given. So what can be done at best. Let us think about the sources of variations in your data. The first reason is the behavior of individual. The second may be his temperament. The third - user skills, then time of day etc. I don't know the sources, since I'm not involved into problem, but you should know them. So think and write the list of possible variation sources. Then think about each your variable: what is the main factor that influence its value? Is it the kind of behavior? Or, maybe, gender (or any from your list of sources) has greater effect? Remain for analysis only that variables, where kind of behavior is supposed to have greater effect. Then do PCA. In such case the first PC (it corresponds to a source of greater variation) will incorporate the behavior. The scores of the first PC are the individuals' positions on your scale, and the loadings - relative influence of your variables on the behavior. Since the direction of PC vector is arbitrary, look where are "bad" values, and where are "good" (it may be that "good" behavior has positive values and "bad" - negative, and may be vice versa). Look on the loadings. The most of them will describe the right direction (e.g. the greater number of sessions corresponds to "better" behavior). But few can have unexpected (wrong) direction (due to chance or mistakes in your prior knowledge). Remove that variables with unexpected direction and repeat PCA once more. Now you have your behavior scores. Finish.
