You can use the regex "|" operator (meaning "or") to create a regex that will match one or more expressions. For example ... /^ [\w|\W]*? |^ ]*>/ ... should do what you're asking (based on the example you've given above). But, as other commenters have said, parsing XML with regexs is a slippery slope. You'll probably want to look into other options, like using the DocumentFragment class to parse your string for you.
