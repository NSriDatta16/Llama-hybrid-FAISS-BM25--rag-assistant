If you want to use R, loading images can be done with imager. General information, tutorials and case studies can be found here . As for neural networks in R, the basic ones which are available like nnet, RSNNS and deepnet are to probably too slow. I recommend looking into H2O for deeplearning. If you want to go with GPU support you need to look at other options, like tensorflow or mxnet. Tensorflow in R: You can use tensorflow from R with the tensorflow package. Information on how to install and use it from R can be found here . MXNET in R: follow the instructions from the mxnet github page .
