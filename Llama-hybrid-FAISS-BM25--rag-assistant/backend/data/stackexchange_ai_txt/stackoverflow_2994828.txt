Javascript may just not be able to handle what you are doing. But don't give up before trying a few things: Try to have the hover() function change the opacity immediately, and then use the fade only on the "unhover()" transition. This will then feel snappy but also smooth. I'd try that, as that will reduce your processing nearly half, and may be enough. Look at the animate() method. You can tell it to complete all running animations before starting the next animation. So on hover, have it finish all the other animations before starting the next animation. This isn't ideal, but it will reduce your "tail" from dragging. This is a little incompatible with the first suggestion, so use your judgement. The opacity functionality on IE uses a "filter". I don't know the details, but it seems to be heavier weight than raw Javascript. It is very problematic if you try to include text in the boxes. Anyway, you may need to try other approaches. You may just need to take different approaches on different browsers, losing a bit of the animation on the browsers that can't handle it. There may be some way to create an "animate gif" that does the fading effect. Not sure about this approach-- just an idea. All that being said, I have build a very similar page, with 17 images at a time, cross-fading to 17 other images. It performs well on all the browsers. Our design, though, is a little more forgiving-- the edges aren't so hard. Good luck. I'll check back if I have any other ideas.
