Azure development storgare service running as a windows service

I am working on a project that is a very large central media repository that uses Azure storage to house all of our external binaries that will be cosumed by 3rd party applications. We have the app working with azure, but are now moving forward to adding a bunch of new features and the "develop and test from you local box" form of testing is no longer sufficient. Since we have an array of external sources feed us media which needs to work in the cloud, we need a integration test environment setup. SO I have already set the environment up, the question I have is, is there a way to have the Azure development storage start and run as a windows service? Currently, I have to login, and start the azure developmet storage manually, but once I log out, it shuts down. This is not ideal, nor does it work. Since this is a development box, and most of the data is junk, we don;t want to waste our space and bandwith sending this stuff to our azure account, which costs us money. Thanks!
