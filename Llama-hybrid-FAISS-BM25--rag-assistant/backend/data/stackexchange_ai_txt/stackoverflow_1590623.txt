Q: I cannot edit the structure of this project. I can only link to it. I don't like the way the code is organized anymore than anyone else seems to, but I have to work within this constraint. Rather than spending potentially hours in the error-prone process of finding all the interdependencies and putting them in a project file, is there a way to do this programmatically? This should get you started: write a script (in your favorite "quick" language) to enumerate all the [sub-...]directories in the library directory filter the directories (for start, remove the ones that don't contain any .h files) output them either to header file as you described or directly to the vcproj file. The vs2008 vcproj file is relatively simple XML. It might even be documented, but if you just view it in a text editor, you'll figure out where and how the include paths are defined try to compile if errors, try to figure out why, adjust directory filter (blacklist specific directories etc.) and go back to 2. success Anyway, don't be afraid to write code generation scripts
