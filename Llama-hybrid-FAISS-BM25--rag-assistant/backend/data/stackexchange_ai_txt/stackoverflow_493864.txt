I can't answer for Vista, but on XP you just copy the directory. I guess that Vista has decided that the files are hidden and so do not need to be copied, or they're locked and not available for copying. In the former, make them un-hidden (with the global file options in explorer's Organise menu, under folder & Search options, view tab), in the latter, try stopping TortoiseSVN's cache which might be holding on to them. or try Xcopy from a command prompt.
