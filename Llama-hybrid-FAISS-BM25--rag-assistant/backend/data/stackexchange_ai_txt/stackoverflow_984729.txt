How can I determine how loud a WAV file will sound?

I have a bunch of different audio recordings in WAV format (all different instruments and pitches), and I want to "normalize" them so that they all sound approximately the same volume when played. I've tried measuring the average sample magnitude (the sum of all absolute values divided by the number of samples), but normalizing by this measurement doesn't work very well. I think this method isn't working because it doesn't take into account the frequency of the sounds, and I know that higher-frequency recordings sound louder than lower-frequency sounds of the same amplitude. Does anyone know a good method for measuring the loudness of a sound?
