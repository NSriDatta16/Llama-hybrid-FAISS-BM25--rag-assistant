Performance wise I believe they are very similar (see post by wvanbergen), however there are obvious differences in behaviour. I think that your current posting may not be doing what you are hoping for. In the first line if you $_error = 3 then you will have $no_errors = false. As you are checking for two conditions that both need to be satisfied maybe an and would be more appropriate. Sometimes I find the easiest way to check my logic is to actually say what I want out loud. For example, "We have no errors if the error code is not 0 and not 3" I generally find that in situation like this with only a few variables, the way I would write the sentence in English provides me with the most intuitive (and accurate) method for determining the logical operators. If you find that the code looks messy after this process then you may find this link on De Morgan's laws useful
