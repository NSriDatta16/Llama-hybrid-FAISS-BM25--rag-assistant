Regression models' results: reporting them as means or medians?

I have a zero-inflated and extremely positively-skewed outcome variable - lottery wins in dollars. Thus, I use two-part analysis, since adjusting is also needed: one for positive values (lognormal regression) and the second for non-zero probability (logistic regression/bernoulli). I have found that presenting the results of these two regressions in one plot makes the interpretation really simple: you can see the probability of winning (x-axis) together with the received amount of money (in case you won). The plot looks like this: y-axis outcome variable values come from a lognormal model x-axis outcome variable values come from a logistic regression/bernoulli model ( I report them as probabilities, not odds-ratios ). It's well known practice that crude non-normal data should be reported as median (IQR/min-max/quantiles/percentiles). However, if these values come from regression analysis, should I report them as means or medians in this graph? Does regression "convert" these variables to "normally distributed" variables?
