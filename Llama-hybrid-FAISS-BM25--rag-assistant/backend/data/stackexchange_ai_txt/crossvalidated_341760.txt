It doesn't matter. In linear regression there are no assumptions about the independent variables. (I prefer to call them "regressors" or "covariates" because they are usually dependent on things). We take the regressor(s) as fixed, given, or known, so we don't care (too much) about their distribution. The skewed values will produce high leverage observations.
