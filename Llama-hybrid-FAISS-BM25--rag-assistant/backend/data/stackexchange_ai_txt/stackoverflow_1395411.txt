Sphinx II Recognition Read and Recognize

I'm trying to implement a speech recognizer client using Sphinx II, my goal is to have the someone reading a written sentence in a text and have a confidence score for each word. So for that I'm using Finite State Grammars and limited dictionary. I got something working, but the confidence score are very low ( Also do I need to use the sphinx trainer? So far I've generated the language models/dictionary using the web tool. Your help would be much appreciated. Thanks, Boris Gougeon
