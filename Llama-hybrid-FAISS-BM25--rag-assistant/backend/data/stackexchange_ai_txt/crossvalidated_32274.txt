Rotation of extracted factors or principal components is not prohibited for binary data: it is not the data that are rotated, it is the loading matrix. By the way, your data for which loadings are computed are not seen as binary anymore since you computed tetrachoric (polychoric) correlations for it. Unlike factor analysis application, typical application of PCA involves interpretation of the components only rarely, because the components are usually seen as derivative simplifying variables which only summarize the multivariate cloud, they do not pretend to be latent essences behind the observed variables, like factors do: factors govern the covariations and always call for interpretation. Rotation aids interpretation. That's probably why PRINCOMP doesn't offer rotation and FACTOR does, as you say.
