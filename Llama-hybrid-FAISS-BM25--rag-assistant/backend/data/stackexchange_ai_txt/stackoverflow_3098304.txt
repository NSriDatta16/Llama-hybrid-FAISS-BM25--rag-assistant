includes work very simple, they just command preprocessor to add the contents of the file to where include is set. basic idea is to include headers that you depend on. in player.h you should include custvector.h and Health.h . In main only player.h , because all needed includes will be carried with player. and you don't need to include main.h in player.h at all. it is good also to make sure that header is included only once. in this question general solution is given How to prevent multiple definitions in C? in case of Visual Studio you can use #pragma once , if Borland c++ there is also a trick but i forgot it.
