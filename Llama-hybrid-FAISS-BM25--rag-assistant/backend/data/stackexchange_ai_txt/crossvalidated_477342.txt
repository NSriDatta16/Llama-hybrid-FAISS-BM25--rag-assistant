You can frame your problem as a denoising task . That is, for a given input list of "noisy" ingredient quantities, output a list of adjusted ingredient quantities. I would proceed as follow. Make a dataset of adjusted ingredient batches Make a dataset of "noisy" ingredient batches. To do so, you can use your data of ingredient batches before adjustement by baker, and augment this dataset by randomly add noise to adjusted ingredient batches Train your model at predicting the adjusted batch given a corresponding noisy one. Denoising autoencoder is a popular model for this, especially in natural language processing, for tasks like spelling-mistakes auto-correction. Though the original statement of your problem is a regression task, you can convert it into a classification problem by binning your ingredient quantities. Here is an example on how to do this.
