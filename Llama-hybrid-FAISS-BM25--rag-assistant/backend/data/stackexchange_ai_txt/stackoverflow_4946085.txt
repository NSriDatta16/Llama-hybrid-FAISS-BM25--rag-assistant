ASP.NET sample website for a SaaS model?

I'm looking to offer a software product using the SaaS model. This of course will require that I build a web site where customers can sign up, log in, manage their membership and billing options, and of course use the software over the web. Can someone recommend a good ASP.NET sample site or other type of site framework that I can use to quickly build out the software infrastructure for this site? In other words, I'm sure things like member sign up, log in, adding/editing account/billing details and all that typical account/user management stuff are common elements of web sites these days, especially those that use a SaaS model. I'd rather not reinvent the wheel. Of course the portion of the site where I deliver my software as a service would be unique. But many of the other functions are common and I prefer to leverage existing code as much as possible. I've read about DotNetDuke which sounds like it could work somewhat, but it also sounds more like a content management system. I really am not interested in a CMS type of site. Mainly I just want to build out the infrastucture parts of the web site (as mentioned above) using as many pre-made parts as possible. Can someone please point me to some resources for this? Commercial solutions are fine too.
