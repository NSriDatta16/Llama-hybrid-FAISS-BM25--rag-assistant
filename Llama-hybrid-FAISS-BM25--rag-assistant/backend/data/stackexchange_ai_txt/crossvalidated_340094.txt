I am not convinced that with random forest the importance measures are stable. Use the bootstrap to repeat the entire process and compute the importance measures a couple of hundred times, and show the variability in importance measures for each specific predictor. You can use this also to compute 0.95 confidence limits on the importance ranking of each predictor. If those confidence intervals are wide, you really can't know much about predictor importance.
