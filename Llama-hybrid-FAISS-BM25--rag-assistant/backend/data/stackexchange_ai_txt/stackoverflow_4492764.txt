That URL is incorrect for mapping to a method on the server-side code. I assume you're trying to call a method called new_class in student.aspx.vb . Is this correct? What you'll want to do is create a separate page for this request. Maybe something like student_ajax.aspx or something of that nature. How you organize it is up to you. The simplest way to go about doing what you're trying to do is to have the new_class logic be the Page_Load logic in the new page. In that method you'll generate the JSON (which I'm assuming you're doing manually and correctly, but that's for a different question if it comes up) to return to the client. Note, however, that in that page you'll need to do some trickery. First, get rid of all of the HTML in the page itself. You want to return only JSON, not wrapped in any HTML. Then, when you're generating the response string in the code-behind logic, you'll want to set the header to the proper headers and output the string: Response.Clear() Response.ContentType = "application/json" Response.Write(myJSONString) Response.End() Note that this was all freehand, so there may be a detail or two missing in this implementation. And I know there are more elegant ways to do this. I'm sure you can find a tutorial or two on Google. Essentially what you're trying to do is create a custom handler on the server for an AJAX request which returns JSON data.
