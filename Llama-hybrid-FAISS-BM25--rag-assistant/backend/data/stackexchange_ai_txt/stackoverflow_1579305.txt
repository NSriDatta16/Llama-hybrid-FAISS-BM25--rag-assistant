Is this code sample really returning the right parameterized types?

I've read the Beautiful code with Google Collections, Guava and static imports article about Java collections, and the following snippet got my attention: Map >> map = Maps.newHashMap(); The thing is, I don't understand how it's possible that the newHashMap method can return a Map >> . How did they write this code? When did it became possible? I lived under the impression that you need to explicitly declare the generics parameters in the constructor call.
