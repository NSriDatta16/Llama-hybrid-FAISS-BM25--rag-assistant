DataServiceRequestException was unhandled by user code. An error occurred while processing this request

DataServiceRequestException was unhandled by user code. An error occurred while processing this request. This is in relation to the previous post I added public void AddEmailAddress(EmailAddressEntity emailAddressTobeAdded) { AddObject("EmailAddress", emailAddressTobeAdded); SaveChanges(); } Again the code breaks and gives a new exception this time. Last time it was Storage Client Exception, now it is DataServiceRequestException . Code breaks at SaveChanges .
