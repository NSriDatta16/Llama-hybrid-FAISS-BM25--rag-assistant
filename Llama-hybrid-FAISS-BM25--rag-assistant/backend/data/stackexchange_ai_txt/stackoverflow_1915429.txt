First of all you probably want to avoid the Transitional Doctype for new content. Transitional is intended for legacy content that needs to be thoroughly altered before confirming to the strict DTDs but this isn't an issue for new documents. Furthermore, at least in my experience XHTML generates more trouble than it's beneficial. Unless you require XHTML for some things (such as allowing XML parsers to read your site [but even then chances are that it doesn't validate and therefore is unsuitable for that]) I'd recommend sticking to HTML 4 Strict. Also XHTML needs special attention with IE, even in IE 8.
