Selecting Box-Cox parameter in TBATS function in R

I am struggling to manually select the Box-Cox transformation in my TBATS function. I have a time series with multiple seasonality called belpex . I have tried the following pieces of code: belpex_Model As well as this: belpex_Model However, in both cases, the output of the model is as follows: TBATS(1, {2,2}, 0.838, { , }) From the documentation of tbats, the first output of TBATS is the parameter of the Box-Cox transformation. As a result, the model that I obtain has no Box-Cox transformation despite I explicitly say so. Another thing that I have noticed is that, despite: belpex_Model returns that no Box-Cox transformation is used, the output model is quite different that the instruction: belpex_Model Can it be that when using lambda=0 TBATS does use the proper Box-Cox transformation but that is not really reflected in the TBATS function? Any other idea/suggestions of what I might be doing wrong?
