Does combining real data with simulation data improve the performance of machine learning?

I am trying to train a machine learning model to help me classify some real data. Since the acquisition and labeling of real data can be very expensive, the training data is generated with simulation. However, the trained model doesn't perform very well on real data, my suspicion is that the simulation is not a 100% accurate representation of real data. Therefore, I am wondering will the performance be improved if I train the model with a mixture of simulation and real data (say 20% real data). I would greatly appreciate it if you could either answer the question or point me to the right reference!
