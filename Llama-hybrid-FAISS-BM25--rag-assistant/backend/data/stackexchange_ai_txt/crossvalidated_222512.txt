Bayesian Probability - Hybrid approach to calculate components?

The task The following question is from a Basic Statistics course on Coursera : In a shop, people can take chewing gum from a dispenser on the right, or the left. The dispenser on the right has 7 packets of mint gum, and 3 packets of fruit gum, and the dispenser on the left has 7 packets of mint gum and 7 packets of fruit gum. Someone buys a packet of mint gum - what is the probability that they took this packet from the right dispenser? You are required to calculate the following: P(mint | right) P(right) P(mint) And then apply Bayes law to find P(right | mint). My initial thinking My initial approach was to create a data matrix, convert to probabilities (divide by 24 - total number of packets) and simply use joint and marginal probabilities. The solution But the answer provided is: P(mint | right) = 7/10 (clearly ignore the left dispenser) P(right) = 0.5 (clearly assuming there is 50/50 chance between dispensers) P(mint) = 14/24 (seem to be making use of 24 packets, ie marginal of both right and left dispensers) Mixed approach? I can kind of understand why P(mint | right) = 7/10 . I can also (kind of) understand why there's 50/50 chance for dispenser selection. But the two seem to be based on dispenser-based probabilities rather then packet probabilities. So how come that we use 24 (total amount of packets) when calculating P(mint) ? It seems that sometimes a dispenser-based approach is taken, sometimes a packet-based approach. Does it smell? Finally, am I wrong to feel this is not the greatest of questions?
