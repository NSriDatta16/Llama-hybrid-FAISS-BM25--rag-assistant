How to get jsp file to find the bean I'm trying to use in Netbeans

I think I'm doing something horrible wrong here. I've never used NetBeans before, nor have I ever done anything with JavaServer before, though I've programmed in Java. In netBeans, in a web project, I created a package called DonationCalc, with a file DonationCalc.java, containing my bean. In a jsp file, I have the following: [...] However, I'm getting "string:///DonationCalc_jsp.java:6: package DonationCalc does not exist" I've been reading elsewhere about classes going under WEB-INF/Classes, but I have no such folder, and NetBeans insists any new packages be put under "Source Packages". What do I need to add to help my .jsp file find the bean? A directory path of some sort? Or should I be putting things elsewhere to begin with? ETA: Apparently the issue is that it was configured for glassfish instead of tomcat. Creating a new project under tomcat, however, has created such a clusterfuck of problems that I have sworn off all forms of java, including the island nation and all caffeinated beverages.
