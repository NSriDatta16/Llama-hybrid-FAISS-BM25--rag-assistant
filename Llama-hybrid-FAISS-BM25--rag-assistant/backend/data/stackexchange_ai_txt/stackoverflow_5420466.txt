Here, look De Morgan's Law: up http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan 's_laws ! It is not like you described, but NOT (P AND Q) = (NOT P) OR (NOT Q) NOT (P OR Q) = (NOT P) AND (NOT Q) Notice that AND becomes OR. Just like OR becomes AND. The negation (NOT) goes into the arguments. Therefore for !(x>5) || !(y>7) the first rule applies as it's the same as the right hand side with P as (x>5) and Q as (y>7) . First change the operator from || (OR) to && (AND), then but the ! (NOT) in front. The result is !(x>5) || !(y>7) = !((x>5) && (y>7)) which looks just like c if there were parentheses, or just like b if there was && instead of ||. With exactly these options the answer is e.
