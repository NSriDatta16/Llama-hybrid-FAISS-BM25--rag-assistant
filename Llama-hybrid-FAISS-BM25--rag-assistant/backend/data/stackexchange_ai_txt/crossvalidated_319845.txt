How to calculate confidence scores in regression (with random forests/XGBoost) for each prediction in R?

Is there a way to get a confidence score (we can call it also confidence value or likelihood) for each predicted value when using algorithms like Random Forests or Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)? Let's say this confidence score would range from 0 to 1 and show how confident am I about a particular prediction . From what I have found on the internet about confidence, usually it is measured by intervals. Here is an example of computed confidence intervals with confpred function from the lava library: library(lava) set.seed(123) n The code output gives only confidence intervals: There is also a library conformal , but I it also is used for confidence intervals in regression: "conformal permits the calculation of prediction errors in the conformal prediction framework: (i) p.values for classification, and (ii) confidence intervals for regression." So is there a way: To get confidence values for each prediction in any regression problems? If there isn't a way, would it be meaningful to use for each observation as a confidence score this: the distance between upper and lower boundaries of the confidence interval (like in the example output above). So, in this case, the wider is the confidence interval, the more uncertainty there is (but this doesn't take into account where in the interval is the actual value)
