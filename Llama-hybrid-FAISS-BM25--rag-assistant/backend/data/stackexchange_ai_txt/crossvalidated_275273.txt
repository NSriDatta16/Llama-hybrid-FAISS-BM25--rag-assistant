Dealing with missing values (inactive datapoints, NaNs or NAs) is a major challenge in machine leaning. There are two common strategies to deal with it. Imputation by deletion: In this brute force approach you can just remove all the rows and columns with any missing values. As it is apparent this approach may lead to loss of information. Imputation by substitution: Here missing values are substituted with ones inferred from existing data eg. mean or median of a feature. These strategies are very well summarised in the Sklearn documentation: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#imputation-of-missing-values . Note that the choice of the strategy would depend on the type of data and the specific objectives of machine learning.
