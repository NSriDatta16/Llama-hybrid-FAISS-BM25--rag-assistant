easy_install and rpy2 work fine together (just did it) but you need to have easy_install in sync with your specific python version. This comes down to controlling your $PATH and $PYTHONPATH environment variables so that the first Python directory that appears is the version you want and also has the easy_install version you want. Do not try to solve this by taking out the factory installed version of Python. You set your path variables in your home directory. If you are using the default bash shell, check .bash_profile for $ echo $PYTHONPATH /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ which will tell you where and in what order installed packages are searched for and $ echo $PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/bin: Rather than giving a recipe for how to set these if needed, I encourage you to consult the usual sources because a little knowledge is dangerous and rendering the shell inoperative by reasonable, but wrong, guesses is a real danger.
