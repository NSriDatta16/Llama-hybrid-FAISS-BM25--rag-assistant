Is the purpose of this call to release the current thread's device context? That is the only time passing NULL for both parameters is valid. From the documentation: "If hglrc is NULL, the function makes the calling thread's current rendering context no longer current, and releases the device context that is used by the rendering context. In this case, hdc is ignored." Further to Tarydon's suggestion of adding a glFlush , it appears this would be redundant: "Before switching to the new rendering context, OpenGL flushes any previous rendering context that was current to the calling thread." Given the API actually crashes, and does not simply result in a failure, the only suggestion I can think of is that the thread on which you are calling wglMakeCurrent to release the HGLRC is not the same thread context used to associate the HGLRC with that device context. So the driver may be looking up the wrong thread-local storage for the call, thus causing the crash. What happens if you add some logging to your code and print the current thread ID just before each call to wglMakeCurrent ? See: wglMakeCurrent reference on MSDN
