Is it appropriate to run the Error Correction Model on data which are not I(1)?

I have intraday data (frequency = 1 min.) for 6 stocks and 1950 observations per each time series. I checked stationarity for the level data and first difference and it appears that: 5 stocks's level data are non-stationary and 1 is stationary, all 6 stocks's first differences are stationary, meaning that that 1 stock is not I(1) and that 5 stocks are I(1). My question is: Is it appropriate to run Engle-Granger methodology, ending with Error Correction Model, on the data pair which includes 1 time series which is I(1) and the other one which is not I(1)?
