The performance of the classifier went bad after adding extra two features

I'm solving a classification problem using 10 features and logistic regression. The performance of the classifier is fine when I use the 10 features only, however when adding another 2 features, the performance gets a little worse. When I use the 2 features alone with the classifier I get a performance as good as using the 10 features. Now my question is why would the performance gets worse when I use the 12 features combined?! Since using the 10 features with the classifier alone and the 2 features with the classifier alone gave almost identical performance, then why combining them would cause a problem? I would expect the performance to increase or at least be the same! Edit: is it possible that this is a 'curse of dimensionality'?
