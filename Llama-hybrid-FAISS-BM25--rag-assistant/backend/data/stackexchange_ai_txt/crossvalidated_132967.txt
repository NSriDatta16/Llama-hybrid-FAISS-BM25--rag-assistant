A simple approach would be to assume the average of the ranked choices. For example, suppose you have six options, ABCDEF. Suppose Joe picks A, D, and C as their first, second and third choice. Then if there was a full ranking, B, E and F would occupy positions 4,5,6 in some unknown order. So why not pretend they all have the average of those ranks, i.e. 5, for Joe?
