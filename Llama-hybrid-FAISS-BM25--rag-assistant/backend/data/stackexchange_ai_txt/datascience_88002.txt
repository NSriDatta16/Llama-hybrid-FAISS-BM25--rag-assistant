Get data from intermediate layers in a Pytorch model

I was trying to implement SRGAN in PyTorch and I have to write a Content loss function that required me to fetch activations from intermediate layers for both the Generated Image & Original Image. I'm using pretrained VGG-19 and according to the paper I need the ReLU activations Can anybody guide me on how can I achieve this?
