A user agent string is indeed the way to go... pick any valid user agent from any common browser. In python 2.x, the following code should give you what you want: import urllib2 r = urllib2.Request('http://www.google.com/') r.add_header('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.19) ' 'Gecko/20081202 Firefox (Debian-2.0.0.19-0etch1)') html = urllib2.urlopen(r).read() Having said that, unutbu's recommendation to use the google search API (if you're looking to do searches) is by far the better way to go... avoids all that messy HTML parsing.
