(The question is too general. It is unclear what books were read by the author of the question. It seems the information from the SSA books answers this question in full.) Briefly answering your question, (1) SSA also has approximating (optimality) properties, since uses the SVD (the singular value decomposition; the same mathematical tool as PCA uses). Therefore, the choice of leading components is used in SSA for signal extraction; the same as in PCA. Thus, the understanding of PCA can help to understand SSA if one wants to extract signals, since the algorithm of SSA exactly (up to centring, which is not necessarily in SSA) coincides with PCA applied to the so-called trajectory matrix $\mathbf{X}$ consisting of subseries of $X$ of length $L$ as columns. (2) SSA uses the property of the SVD called bi-orthogonality. This property helps to extract identifiable components from a time series. Let us observe $X=S+R$ , where $X=(x_1,\ldots,x_N)$ and $S=(s_1,\ldots,s_N)$ is a component under interest (e.g. a trend). Construct the trajectory matrix $\mathbf{X}$ from subseries of $X$ and apply the SVD to $\mathbf{X}$ . If the trajectory matrices $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ (which are not observed) are bi-orthogonal (their rows and columns are bi-orthogonal), then the SVD of $\mathbf{X}$ provides an expansion, which can be divided into two groups that correspond to unobserved time series $S$ and $R$ ; thereby these time series components can be extracted. In practice, we have approximate orthogonality and approximate extraction. However, the theory of separability in SSA says that e.g. trend and seasonal components or sine waves with different frequencies are approximately orthogonal and therefore can be approximately extracted.
