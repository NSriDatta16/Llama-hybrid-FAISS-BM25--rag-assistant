How to implement YQL paging?

I've read the YQL guide, and I keep reviewing http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/guide/yql-o...entables-paging and I have been looking at a few examples, but I'm still left pretty confused how YQL paging works. The problem that I am trying to tackle is creating a YQL open data table for the Mozilla labs Jetpack Gallery's jetpacks pages http://jetpackgallery.mozillalabs.com/jetpacks You flip through the pages of jetpacks with the ?page query variable and there is an order_by query variable. You can only see 10 results per page. Questions: List item Should I use or ? How do I specify the query parameter that indicates the page? in this case it is the 'page' query parameter. I am assuming I should use: http://jetpackgallery.mozillalabs.com/jetpacks is this correct? In the execute element, I will need to extract the details for each jetpack on the page? if so how would I organize that for the response.object? Can anyone provide some help? or perhaps point to a data table that I can look at as a reference? or better documentation on how paging works?
