As far as I know there is no way to set this option through the UI. I'm not sure if this is intended to be a supported scenario or not. It definitely seems like it should be. Could you please file a bug on connect to track this issue? http://connect.microsoft.com/ In the mean time you should be able to work around this by setting the option on the QTAgent32 application. This is the process which is actually used to run the unit tests and it's located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\QTAgent32.exe Yes, extremely hacky solution but hopefully it unblocks you.
