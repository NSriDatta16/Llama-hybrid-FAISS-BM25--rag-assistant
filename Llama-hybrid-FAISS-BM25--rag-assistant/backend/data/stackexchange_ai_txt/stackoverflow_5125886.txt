Map a function over a list for each argument

I'm looking for some attractive Haskell syntax for the following I have a function that takes 4 argument. f a b c d = Something I'd like to supply a lists for each of the arguments and get back the a list of the results of each combination. Essentially a nested map function. I fell like there should be an elegant solution. But, I haven't found anything that will compile.
