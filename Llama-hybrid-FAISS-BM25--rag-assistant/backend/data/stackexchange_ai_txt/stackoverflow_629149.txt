Alignment. Your compiler is going to align variables in a way that makes sense for your architecture. In your case, char , int , and bool are different sizes, so it will go by that information rather than your bit field hints. There was some discussion in this question on the matter. The solution is to give #pragma directives or __attributes__ to your compiler to instruct it to ignore alignment optimizations.
