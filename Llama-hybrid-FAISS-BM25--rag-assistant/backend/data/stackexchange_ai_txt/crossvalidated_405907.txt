Definition of $I(0)$ and its relation to stationarity

I thought that $I(0)$ time series were simply stationary time series. But the definition on the Wikipedia page says: A time series is integrated of order 0 if it admits a moving average representation with: $$ \sum_{k=0}^\infty |b_k|^2 Therefore, all stationary processes are $I(0)$ , but not all $I(0)$ processes are stationary. Is the definition on the page correct?
