Samples from Conditional Posterior Distribution in Pymc3

Let us consider the following Hierarchical Bayesian model: $w \sim\ Beta(20, 20)$ $K = 6$ $a = w * (K - 2) + 1$ $b = (1 - w) * (K - 2) + 1$ $theta \sim\ Beta(a, b)$ $y \sim\ Bern(theta)$ The above is the example of figure 9.3 in the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis by John Kruschke. I use the pymc3 to construct the model as follows: import numpy as np import pymc3 as pm import arviz as az K = 6 D = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]) with pm.Model() as mdl: w = pm.Beta('w', alpha=20., beta =20.) a = w * (K - 2) + 1 b = (1 - w) * (K - 2) + 1 theta = pm.Beta('theta', alpha=a, beta=b) y = pm.Bernoulli('y', p=theta, observed=D) trace = pm.sample(10000, tune=3000) My question is the following: How can I compute the conditional posterior probability $p(theta|w=0.25,D)$ ? In other words how can I obtain samples from the conditional posterior distribution of $theta|w=0.25, D$ ?
