Maximum minus average?

I have some legacy code that is doing some stats that I can't figure out. It's taking the maximum value of a data set, and subtracting the average of the data set. I've tried looking into what this is doing (i.e. is it measuring some deviation?) but haven't been able to come up with an answer. Anyone know what this formula is actually measuring? Thanks.
