Be careful using autocorrection such as forcing user input to fit your format. See: Is it acceptable to normalize text box content when it loses focus? . Itâ€™s generally better to prevent invalid entries in the first place than to autocorrect them later. For example, if only integers are allowed, then you ignore any keying of the decimal point (along with all letters and most special characters). In some environments, you may want to provide a quiet audible signal that input is ignored (e.g., a dull thud). As for when you need to alert the user to an error, how about a callout? Draw a bright line from the control or point in question (field, status annunciator, button, menu, location of a drag and drop) to the margin of the window and put a brief message (two or three words, like "Unrecognized date") in a balloon. Placing the message on the margin should keep it from occluding anything of interest in a crowded table. The sudden appearance of the call-out should be sufficient to catch user attention, so it's okay to let the user move on to other cells in case they want to fix the error later. For efficiency, you may want to hold the user in the error-related field when the error originally occurs (since often the user wants to correct it right away), but then allow the next tab or mouse click to navigate the user away. On mouseover or when focus is on the control associated with the error, the line is highlighted (to distinguish it from other callout lines that may be present) and the balloon expands to a full error message, providing more details on how to fix the problem (up to two sentences). Allow the user to drag and drop the balloon to a new location in case this occludes something of interest. Include a Help button in the expanded balloon for further details. You can also include a button to fix the error (e.g., Retry, Reconnect, or set to default value). The balloon disappears automatically when the error is fixed. Undo reverts whatever caused the error (e.g., reverts the field to its original value), which should clear the error. If the user scrolls away from the place associated with the error, the balloon shrinks to an icon that remains in view so that the user is less likely to forget about it. Maybe an exclamation point in a triangle is a good icon. Place the icon beside or in the scrollbar track to indicate its relative location in the table, so the user can quickly scroll to find it later. Mouseover expands the icon to its full message. Perhaps clicking the icon can scroll to the right place in the table and put focus in the relevant control. Balloons could also shrink to icons if they start visually interfering with each other. You may even want to include a control in a balloon to allow the user to force it to assume an icon. For consistency, use for all errors, not just those associated with fields in tables.
