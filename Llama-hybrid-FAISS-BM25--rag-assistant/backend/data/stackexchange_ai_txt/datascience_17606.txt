Yes and no depending on how you define "good enough samples". You will likely end up with a chicken and egg problem: you want to use the GAN to generate training data, but the GAN doesn't have enough training data itself to generate convincing enough samples. Other techniques exist for data synthesis of training images. For example: adding noise, flipping axis, change luminosity, change color, random cropping, random distorsion.
