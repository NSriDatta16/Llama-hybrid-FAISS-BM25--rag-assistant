You could probably "simulate" it by managing the set of superclasses explicitly and using reflection to search all the superclasses for the target method. I wouldn't want to do this in production, but it might an interesting toy program. You could probably do a lot of weird stuff by leveraging reflection, creating classes on the fly, and invoking the compiler programatically.
