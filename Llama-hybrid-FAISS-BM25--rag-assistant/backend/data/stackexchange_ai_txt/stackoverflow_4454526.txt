The "old" animations are just discouraged not deceprated, this is Apples version of telling you: "If you use block based animations you'll unlikely write spaghetti code and mess things up really bad." It's just a friendly nudge into the right direction, as "blocks" were not available with the older compilers in the older SDKs programmers got used to the begin->commit style (like old opengl with glbegin, glend) but that's unneccessarily spaghettiish if you want to chain multiple animations.
