How many features can we input for a SVM to classify?

I am new to SVM classifiers. I read on the internet that SVM are binary classifiers and also many SVMs, as described in research papers, only take 2 features as the input. (e.g. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_iris.html ) My question is, does it have to be 2 input features? Can we use more than 2? If so, how do we write this code in python?
