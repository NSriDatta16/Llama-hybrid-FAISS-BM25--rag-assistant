The interpretation of confidence intervals and prediction intervals can be tricky in a linear regression modelling setting for novice learners since it requires then to distinguish between what happens in practice and what happens in theory . To illustrate this distinction, let't imagine the following scenario: We are interested in studying the relationship between height (X) and weight (Y) for students at a local university. In particular, we would like to use this relationship to estimate the average weight in kg of all students with a height of 1.60 metres. In practice , we will estimate the average weight of interest by selecting a random sample of 100 students, say, from all students enrolled at the university and measuring their heights and weights. We will then plug these heights and weights into the appropriate formulas for constructing the confidence interval we are interested in. This will yield a 95% confidence interval for the average weight of all students at that university of (60kg, 70kg), say. We will interpret this interval by saying something like: We are 95% confident that the average weight of all students at this local university who have a height of 1.60 metres ranges between 60kg and 70kg . The reason we are able to make this last statement is because we are using a statistical procedure for constructing the 95% confidence intervals which has good properties in the long run. This is where the theory comes in: If we were to perform a thought experiment and repeat what we did in practice many, many times - but each time, drawing a different random sample of size 100 from the list of students enrolled at the university - we would obtain a very, very large collection of 95% confidence intervals for the average weight of all students of the university with a height of 1.60 metres. These intervals might look like: (62kg, 73kg), (59kg, 68kg), etc., so they would have different endpoints. In our thought experiment, we could assume for a moment we are God - this means we would know what the true value of the quantity we are after actually is. For example, the quantity we are trying to estimate would be known to God to be 65kg - this quantity would represent the average weight of all students at the university who have a height of 1.60 metres. If we were to examine the 95% confidence intervals in our thought experiment one by one to see whether or not they contain the true value we are interested in, we would expect according to the theory governing the statistical procedure we used to construct these intervals, that 95% of them would include this true value of 65kg. It is because of this theoretical expectation that we could make our practical statement: We are 95% confident that the average weight of all students at this local university who have a height of 1.60 metres ranges between 60kg and 70kg .
