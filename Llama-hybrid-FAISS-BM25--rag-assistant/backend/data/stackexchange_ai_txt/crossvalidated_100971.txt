A recent paper by van Ginkel & Kroonenberg works out the details of pooling F-tests and other ANOVA results. The paper is: van Ginkel, J. R., & Kroonenberg, P. M. (2014). Analysis of Variance of Multiply Imputed Data. Multivariate Behavioral Research, 49(1), 78-91. and van Ginkel's website ( http://www.socialsciences.leiden.edu/educationandchildstudies/childandfamilystudies/organisation/staffcfs/van-ginkel.html ) has SPSS macros with instruction files. As far as I know, their formulae have not yet been implemented in R. @Brian, if you do write a function, please share!
