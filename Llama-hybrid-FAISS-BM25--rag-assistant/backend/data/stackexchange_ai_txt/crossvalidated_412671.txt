Independent and dependent variables Machine Learning

I want to start a regression model on lottery numbers, my database consist of the dates, and results(numbers). In order to do a regression model I believe you need independent and dependent variables, so my question is in my data what would be considered the dependent and independent variables. I think the results are dependent on the date but I am unsure, so someone else's opinion would be helpful. Below is the head of my data, thanks. Data Head: Date b1 b2 b3 11725 1984-09-01 9 4 8 11724 1984-09-03 1 5 3 11723 1984-09-04 8 6 6 11722 1984-09-05 5 6 9 11721 1984-09-06 2 1 9 Target is future outputs, Also would this data above need to be preprocessed.
