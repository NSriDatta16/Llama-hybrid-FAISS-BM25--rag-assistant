Efficient online (rolling window) estimation of a GARCH model

I have a time series $x_t$ of length $n$ . I would like to model it using rolling window approach with window length (width) $w$ : window $1$ : $x_1,\dots,x_w$ , window $2$ : $x_2,\dots,x_{w+1}$ , $\dots$ , window $n-w+1$ : $x_{n-w+1},\dots,x_n$ . In each window, I would like to estimate a GARCH model. I could just do it using brute force. However, this is quite expensive computationally. I wonder if I could borrow information from neighbouring windows and make the estimation more computationally efficient. Is there an algorithm available that is doing that? (E.g. if I was estimating a regression model, I could use the ideas suggested in the thread "Efficient online linear regression" ).
