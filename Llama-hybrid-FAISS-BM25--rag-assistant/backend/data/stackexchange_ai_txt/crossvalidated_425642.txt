The base estimator of RandomForestClassifier is DecisionTreeClassifier , which indeed builds a single generalized model capable of processing output correlations. To build a tree, it uses a multi-output splitting criteria computing average impurity reduction across all the outputs. That is, a random forest averages a number of decision tree classifiers predicting multiple labels. To create multiple independent (identical) models, consider MultiOutputClassifier . As for classifier chains, use ClassifierChain .
