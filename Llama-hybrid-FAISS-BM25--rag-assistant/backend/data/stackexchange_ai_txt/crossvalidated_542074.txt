Can a single GAN learn multiple probability distributions

Assuming for example to generate a sentence, I have two distributions i.e one that represents a semantic and another a syntactic structure of a sentence. This distributions are different. Can I train GAN to learn learn the two distributions. My simple question is: it possible for GAN to learn two distributions at the same time?
