I've had a lot of success with UKCrashReporter . The code is straighforward and easy to modify to match the L&F of your app. PLCrashReporter looks interesting, though. I'd stay away from Smart Crash Reporter just because many users (rightfully) don't appreciate your app injecting code into unexpected places and it strikes me as a fragile (perhaps dangerous to use in a released app) approach.
