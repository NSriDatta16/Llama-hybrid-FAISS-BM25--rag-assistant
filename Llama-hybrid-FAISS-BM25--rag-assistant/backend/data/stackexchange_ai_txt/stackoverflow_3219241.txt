WPF-MVVM: Custom Control/User Control/POCO for Paint-like Application?

So I am currently creating a Paint-like application for sports. You will some "shapes" for each type of sport (balls/baskets in basketball, pucks/goals in hockey etc.). Now my main problem is how I should go about designing these shapes. As I understand it there are mainly 3 options: Custom Control with ControlTemplate UserControl POCO-Object (ViewModel) for property storage, DataTemplate for visual representation I have the following requirements for the Shape-objects: Should be easily serializable (to save as XML etc.) Should be able to have adorners attached to them (for purposes of resizing etc.) Should be extensible/modifiable (provide different visual styles for them etc.) Should provide some default value mechanism for the properties Which option would fit my requirements best?
