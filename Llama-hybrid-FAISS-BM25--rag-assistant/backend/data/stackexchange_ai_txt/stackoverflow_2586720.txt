Please note that the category solution above has a problem in that it is subject to the locale settings on the user's device. For example, for midnight April 5th 2010 sqlLiteDateRepresentation above would return 2010/04/05 00:00:00 for most people's machines, however I have encountered a scenario where a user's locale settings caused the same function to produce "2010/04/05 12:00:00 a.m." which when used in my query does not return any rows. This seems to follow from the documentation of NSDateFormatter: "In general, you are encouraged to use format styles (see timeStyle, dateStyle, and NSDateFormatterStyle) rather than using custom format strings, since the format for a given style reflects a userâ€™s preferences. Format styles also reflect the locale setting." Although I didn't see a good way to use the timeStyle/dateStyle to get the same format as yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss that SQLite seems to need. I fear your best bet is likely a custom solution where you ensure that the time is definitely written in 24H format, don't allow locale settings to cause bugs.
