Using multinomial logistic regression to test for heterogeneity

I have been asked to use polychotomous logistic regression to test for heterogeneity or independent variable across multiple outcomes levels, and then change-in-estimate method to identify other factors to adjust for. My outcome has 4 nominal factors (let's say 1, 2, 3, 4), and my main independent variable has 2 categories (yes/no). When I run my multinomial linear regression model, say: test I get coefficients for each level of the outcome (ie. for 1 vs 4, 2 vs 4, 3 vs 4), when what I am looking for (or my boss is looking for) is a single p-value that tests for heterogeneity across the groups. I believe I am doing this wrong, and cannot find how to get this value in R. If anyone could point me towards a help resource, or explain what I have misunderstood, I would be very grateful.
