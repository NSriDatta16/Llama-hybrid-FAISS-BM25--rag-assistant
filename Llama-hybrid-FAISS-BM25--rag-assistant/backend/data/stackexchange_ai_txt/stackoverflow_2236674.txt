Even using the explorer this message is shown sometimes (at least for me). How about deleting the files first and then delete the folder? string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(some_path, "", SearchOption.AllDirectories); foreach (string pathFile in files) { File.Delete(pathFile); } Directory.Delete(some_path); you can use SearchOptions if you have subfolers but if not, then use simply string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(some_path); Hope this helps. EDIT This problem happens for many reasons(c'mon its MS), but I think the main are: because the folder is corrupted or some process is locking it and prevents the deletion. A non elegant solution could be: delete the files first, then the subfolders, and the last step delete the main folder.
