Problems with looping in jQuery

Well, heres what I mean. Go to site . Where it says latest news, there are some problems. What i'm trying to do is: Load site, see the loading bar.(image is in the HTML) The loading bar goes away, theres one paragraph that fades in. That is what this is for. // Hides the loading image and fadesin content var $latest = $(".latest") $latest .hide(); // Hide Content setTimeout(function(){ $('#loading') .hide(); $latest.fadeIn(); } , 3000); Now, what I also want to do is hide the paragraph, fadeIn another one, then the one after that. Then restart that and loop allover again. That is what this is for: $latest .hide() .first() .show(); refreshId = setInterval(function() { next = $(".latest:visible").next(); if (next.length) { $latest.hide(); next.fadeIn(); } else { $(".latest") .hide() .first() .fadeIn(); } }, 3000 ); As you can see, the two scripts conflicts with eachother and the whole thing goes crazy(That and the image keeps appearing). Is there a way to fix it?
