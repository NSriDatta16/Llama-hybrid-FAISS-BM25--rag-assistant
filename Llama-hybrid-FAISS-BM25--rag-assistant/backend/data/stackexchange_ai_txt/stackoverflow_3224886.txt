+1 to the answers suggesting ListView and RelativeLayout. For this type of situation you probably want a ListView with an item layout using RelativeLayout. (ListView will scale much better if there are many items, and if this is for a list of saved games it seems like this could grow quite a bit.) For this type of UI it's recommended to have the whole row/list item clickable rather than use a small Load button, but that's a design issue and ultimately up to you. Don't use getApplicationContext for creating your views. Activity is a Context, just pass this in your case. By default LinearLayouts try to align child views by their text baseline if present. Note that the bottom of your button's Load text aligns perfectly with the CURRENT_GAME text in your screenshot. Try gameContainer.setBaselineAligned(false) . Normally your gameInfo layout would only report the baseline of one of its children if you set a baselineAlignedChildIndex, but it looks like this behavior changed between cupcake and eclair when creating LinearLayouts programmatically. (Link to the commit that changed it in AOSP here .)
