I would suggest against using git for such purpases. For starters, Git will use extra phone storage for the revision history, and it will send entire files (not deltas) anyway because multimedia content is binary and diffing does not work on it. Just implement a method to list server-side multimedia with last-modification dates and another method to download updated files (I would suggest HTTP as it is the simplest). On the server side, you can of course use git internally for versioning the multimedia files, but I'd rather not expose the git interface.
