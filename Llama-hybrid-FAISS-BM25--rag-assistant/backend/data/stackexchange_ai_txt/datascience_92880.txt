Problem with mord library function 'Logistic AT'

I wanted to run a an ordinal logistic regression on my bag of words. I have used the code below with logistic regression but now I have modified it for an ordinal logistic regression. However, when I try to predict Y, I keep getting the error: AttributeError: 'LogisticAT' object has no attribute 'coef_' I am pretty sure the error is in the following line, but not sure how to fix it. ml_model = LogisticAT(alpha = 1.0) def train_logisticAT_regression(features, label): print ("Training the logistic regression model...") from mord import LogisticIT, LogisticAT, OrdinalRidge ml_model = LogisticAT(alpha = 1.0) print ('Finished') return ml_model ml_model = train_logisticAT_regression(tfidf_features, y_train) test_data_features = vectorizer.transform(X_test) # Convert to numpy array test_data_features = test_data_features.toarray() test_data_tfidf_features = tfidf.fit_transform(test_data_features) # Convert to numpy array test_data_tfidf_features = test_data_tfidf_features.toarray() predicted_y = ml_model.predict(test_data_tfidf_features) I'm not familiar with the mord package. How can I fix this error?
