It sounds like you're just storing information and the subjects (people) won't be users of the Drupal site. Leveraging the node and CCK modules to make this happen would remove most of the development work. For example, each of your tables (e.g. Person, Zip Code, Language) could be represented by a content type with a number of fields. The foreign keys would be represented by node reference fields. So the Person content type may have one or more node references to nodes of type, Language. The migrate module seems well used ( 626th most popular of 4000+ modules used in at least 10 distinct Drupal sites), but it may be easier to whip up your own migration script, but I'm not familiar with either your situation, your familiarity with Drupal's API, or the migrate module. Node reference fields display as links to the referenced nodes by default, but can be themed to load and display the referenced node instead (e.g. displaying Language information in a Person node). There's a handy screencast that illustrates how to go about theming node reference fields to load and selectively display the referenced nodes' contents.
