Is there a Status Machine Chart?

I find this type of chart quite often, but I don't know if it is known by another specific name: It looks like a 100% stacked bar chart, but colors repeat and it is actually different. It may be implemented with Gantt, but it still looks like a way too complex hack. What do you know about it and how can we easily emulate it with other more common chart types?
