SVM confusion matrix whose dimensions are more than two

While I am using SVM, I train it with a train data and then I try to predict a sample if its label is -1 or +1. However, I see some confusion matrice for SVM like below. Mine are 2x2 matrice but their dimesions are larger, e.g. 15x15. Do they have more than one SVM? How people do such things? It is easy to write one diagonal but how they decide other values? In the figure below, for 2, it is easy to write 38 but how they write 2? BTW, I am new to these topics.
