Pr(Z>|z|) values and the level of significance

If your logistic regression fit has coefficients with the following attributes, do you look at the values of Pr(Z>|z|) are smaller than 0.95 to determine whether that variable is needed at a 5% level of significance? ie. If Pr(>|z|) is 0.964, this variable is not needed at 5% significance.
