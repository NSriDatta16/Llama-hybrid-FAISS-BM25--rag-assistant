Android Development Missing "drawable" folder (NetBeans IDE)

I recently switched to Ubuntu and decided to use NetBeans for Java development instead of Eclipse which I used on Windows. The problem is, in the Eclipse I used on Windows, I had a folder named "drawable-hdpi" with the standard app icon in and a few other folders like "drawable-mdpi" (I think). But with NetBeans, there doesn't seem to be any folders named "drawable". Is this right, or is there something wrong that I need to fix? Thanks for reading, Alex.
