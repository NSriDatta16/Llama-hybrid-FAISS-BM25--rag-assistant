I just responded to your other question on this issue. To address your questions: Are all these three reasons valid? Are there other good reasons to include the average of a Level 1 predictor as a Level 2 predictor? Yes, they are valid. Another reason is for understanding the decomposition of variance in the outcome. When you enter in a level 1 predictor into a model, you will notice that both the level 1 and level 2 variance can be impacted. By explicitly separating these two sources of influence through either group-mean centering or adding the level 2 mean, you better understand the nature of that variable's influence on the outcome. What are some reasons to not include the average of a Level 1 predictor as a Level 2 predictor? I am not aware of any other than the potential for overfitting. If all the action is at level 1 and you include a bunch of means of the level 1 variables, then model fit criteria will likely tell you that you are not helping yourself by including these predictors. Should the average of a Level 1 predictor be routinely used as a Level 2 predictor, or only in special circumstances? I tend to think they should, but that is a personal preference. Other people might prefer to group-mean center the level 1 variables and only include level 2 variables that quantify phenomena at level 2.
