The standards process doesn’t run like this: Spec is written Browsers implement spec Everything is ponies and rainbows Like any IT project, the spec is written, then bits of it are implemented, then the spec is changed based on lessons learned during implementation. It’s a delicate dance, as Robert O’Callahan said . Doing initial implementations with vendor prefixes means that if the spec is changed later, existing code written against the existing implementations won’t break. Vendor prefixes also allow browser-makers to experiment just for the heck of it, which can result is quite nice things like Safari’s gradients.
