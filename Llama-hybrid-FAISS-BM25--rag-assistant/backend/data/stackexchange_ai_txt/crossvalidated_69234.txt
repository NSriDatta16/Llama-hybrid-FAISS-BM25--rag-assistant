This is a harder question than it initially looks. The relevant topic goes by different names depending on your disciplinary background. Economists call the topic "random effects" or "random coefficients" or even "panel data." Most social scientists call the topic "multi-level modelling." Let's index your subjects by $i$ and your staircases by $j$. Let's call the satisfaction by person $i$ after staircase $j$, $H_{ij}$ and the number of steps in staircase $j$, $P_j$. Then the regression model looks like: \begin{equation} H_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1,i} P_j + \epsilon_{ij} \end{equation} The coefficient of interest is $\beta_{1,i}$. This is the amount that person $i$'s satisfaction rises with each additional step. Most often, you are interested in the average of this effect, $E\{\beta_i\}$---the answer to the question "By how much does satisfaction rise for an extra step, on average?" What to do depends on what you believe about the statistical properties of $\beta_{1,i}$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$. For example, if you believe that $\beta_{1,i}$ is exactly the same for each subject and if you believe that $\epsilon_{ij}$ is i.i.d., then Peter Flom's comment above is right. Just run a simple regression of satisfaction on number of steps with each person-staircase as an observation. It will give a good estimator for $\beta_1$ and the usual OLS standard errors are correct. If you believe that $\beta_{1,i}$ is exactly the same for each subject and if you believe that $\epsilon_{ij}$ is correlated within staircases but uncorrelated within individuals, then your first procedure will give a good estimator, but the standard errors will be conservative. Your second procedure will again give a good estimator, but the standard errors will be too narrow. If you believe a more complicated thing about $\beta_{1,i}$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$ than either of the above ideas, then you have to learn something about multi-level modelling. Still, however, the simple OLS estimator will be a pretty good estimator of the average of the $\beta_{1,i}$. The only real issue is getting the standard errors right.
