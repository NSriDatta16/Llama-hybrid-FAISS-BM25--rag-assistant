It seems the consensus is that the emphasis should be placed on unit testing. Bug tracking is a good indicator of the product quality, but is only is acurate as your test team. If you employ unit testing it gives you a measurable metric of code coverage and provides regression testing so you can be assured you didn't break anything since last month. My company relies on system/integration level testing. I see alot of defects being introduced because there is a lack of regression testing. I think "bugs" where the developer's implementation of the requirements deviates from the user's vision is sort of a seperate problem that as Dan and rptony stated is best addressed by Agile methodologies.
