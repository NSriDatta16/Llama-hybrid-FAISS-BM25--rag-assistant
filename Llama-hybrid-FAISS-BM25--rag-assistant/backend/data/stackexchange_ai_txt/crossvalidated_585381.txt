As with any other time series method you can forecast a transformation of $z = g(y)$ instead of $y$ directly. Such that the inverse of the transformation is bounded. If your example has upper $b$ and lower $a$ limits you can use the following transformation: $$ z = g(y) = \log\left(\frac{y-a}{b-y}\right) $$ with $$ y = g^{-1}(z) = (b-a)\cdot \frac{e^z}{1+e^z} + a $$ as discussed here https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecasting-within-limits/ If it only has a lower bound $a$ (and no upper bound) you can predict: $$ z = g(y) = \log\left(y - a\right) $$ and then apply the inverse $$ y = e^z + a $$ If it only has an upper bound $b$ (and no lower bound) then $-y$ has a lower bound ( $-b$ ) and you can predict: $$ z = g(y) = \log\left(b - y\right) $$ and then apply the inverse $$ y = b - e^z $$
