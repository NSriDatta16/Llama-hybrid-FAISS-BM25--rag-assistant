Main is ommitted, since it only contains code to set up the two on-screen panels.) Well, by definition when you have a problem you don't know what code is or isn't relative until the problem is solved. So a complete SSCCE should be posted. As a wild guess I would say your component has a size of 0 so there is nothing to paint. I generally plant a JPanel object in my main window, write custom painting code, and call the repaint() method as needed You probably got lucky because you added the panel to the center of a BorderLayout which automatically gives the panel all the space available to the frame. trashgod's example shows one way to set the preferred size of a custom component. Another way is to override the getPreferredSize() method to return the proper value. You really should learn how to use layout manager rather than using null layouts and you will avoid problems like this in the future. There is no need to use a null layout unless you have a drag/drop type of application.
