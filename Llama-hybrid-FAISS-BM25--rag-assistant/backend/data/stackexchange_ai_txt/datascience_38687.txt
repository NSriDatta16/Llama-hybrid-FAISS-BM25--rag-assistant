Is it acceptable for a forecasting model to predict moving averaged version of the data?

I'm working on a project in which I'm developing a precipitation forecasting model. When I try to predict the original data, the model (LSTM neural network) is not able to predict the peaks. This is the predicted values for the original data: So, I decided to perform 1) A differencing method in which I simply subtract values of the past from current values. 2) A moving average method on the resultant data from step 1. Then I try to predict this processed version of the data. Below is the predicted values for the smoothed data: 1) Is this kind of forecasting models acceptable among academicians? 2) should I try just to predict the original data? 3) What probable usage can these types of predictive models (which forecasts smoothed version of the data) have? 4) Any suggestion on how to deal with this situation?
