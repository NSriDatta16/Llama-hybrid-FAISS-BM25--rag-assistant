Mutual WCF certificate authentication/SSL in cluster environment

I read lot of articles on WCF security but still have no clear picture on certificate scenarios. Our deployment environment has a NLB cluster (front-end) with few ASP.NET sites talking to the application server (back-end, also NLB cluster). We need to protect it with mutual certificate authentication and SSL. Am i correct that we need to do the following: Issue a certificate with CN=app-server-NLB-hostname and 'Server authentication' purpose in the domain CA. Issue a certificate for front-end boxes with 'Client authentication' purpose. Import back-end certificate's public key into front-end nodes' storages (and vice versa). Configure WCF to use net.tpc with transport security Configure the service behavior (serviceCredentials section) Configure the client endpoint behavior (clientCredentials section) My questions are: Have i missed something? Do i need to perform any additional steps to enable SSL? Which hostname frontend certificates should be issued for? The front-end nodes are in DMZ so will have no access to the domain (CA). Will this cause any problems?
