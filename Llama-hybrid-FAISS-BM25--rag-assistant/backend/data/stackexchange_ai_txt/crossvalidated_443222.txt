You can see from your diagnostic plots that you have two separate groups, which presumably correspond to the response variables unique_locality and unique_time . This occurs because you have fit a logistic regression using a binary response outcome, rather than using a multiple logistic regression that can handle the three-category outcome you actually have. I recommend that you follow your colleague's advice to use a multiple logistic regression (in the first instance), so that you have a model that allows for the three-category outcome in your data. You can fit a multiple logistic regression model in R using the multinom function in the nnet package (documentation here and here ). The multiple logistic regression model is a type of "log-linear model", which can be extended to more complex models if required. My advice would be to fit to the multiple logistic regression model in the first instance, and then see if the model diagnostics warrant any change to the model.
