Any Naive Bayesian Classifier in python?

I have tried the Orange Framework for Naive Bayesian classification. The methods are extremely unintuitive, and the documentation is extremely unorganized. Does anyone here have another framework to recommend? I use mostly NaiveBayesian for now. I was thinking of using nltk's NaiveClassification but then they don't think they can handle continuous variables. What are my options?
