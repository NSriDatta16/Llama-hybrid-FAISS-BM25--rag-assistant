How to organize GWT project with multiple modules and shared server?

I have three GWT modules that will have some code in common - typically domain classes - and also share the same server instance. My first thought was to organize it like this: app1/client/ app2/client/ app3/client/ server/ shared/ The modules would then have in their descriptors: But it seems like that the ../shared path is not working. Is this the way to go, or are there better ways?
