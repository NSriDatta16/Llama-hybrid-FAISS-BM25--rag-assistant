i'm having the problem of capturing all the coordinate value of pixels while dragging with the mouse using mousedragged event in java while i'm dragging slowly i'm able to get all the coordinate value of pixels but when i'm doing it fast i'm getting only one third of the pixel coordinate values for example if i drag it slowly i'm getting 760 pixel values but when i'm doing it fast i'm getting only 60 pixel coordinate values please help me I need all the points because i'm going to use all those points for the signature comparision... Project Description : User will put the sign using mouse in log in page, this sign will be compared with the sign which the user already put in sign up page... I'm going to compare the sign using the pixel values, so by getting all the coordinate values only i can compare the sign... pls help me...
