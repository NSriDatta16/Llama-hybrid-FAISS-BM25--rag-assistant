manual implementation of Gaussian naive bayesian returns posterior larger than 1

I try to implement Gaussian naive bayesian manually in R. I test my model on iris data set. I would like to build a predictive model. That is, I would like to consider, for each point, the correct class. My problem: I see that the posteriors for some points are larger than 1, which is wrong. What I have tried: I have divided the data into training and test datasets. Then I assume equally prior for each class ( 0.3 ) (as the prior must sum to one). I applied the Bayesian rule for the training data set. For this I do the following: to compute the likelihood for each class, I computed the density (for each point in each class). den[[1]] is the density of the Sepal.Length . den[2] is the density of Sepal.Width. den[[3]] and den[[4]] are the density for the resining variables. Then to compute the posterior for each point, I computed prior*likelihood , for each point. However, I found that some posteriors values are larger than one. I believe I did something wrong, but do not know what is my mistake? Any help, please? Here is my code data(iris) dim(iris)[[1]] ##split the data based on its class NewData $Species) ## divide the data based on their class NewDatSetosa setosa[,1:4] NewDatVersicolor $versicolor[,1:4] NewDatVirginica virginica[,1:4] ##divide the data into train and test datasets set.seed(1234) datadivision
