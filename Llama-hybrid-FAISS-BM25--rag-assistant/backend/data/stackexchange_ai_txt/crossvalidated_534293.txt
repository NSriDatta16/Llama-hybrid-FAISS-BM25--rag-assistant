Eigenvalues in PCA

When I carry out Principal Component Analysis, the outputs are the Eigen-values and Eigen-vectors for each PC. Question : are the Eigen-values directly proportional to the Variance explained by the PC? For example, for a three-dimensional data-set, my Eigen-values came out as: 0.007, 0.002, 0.001. Does that mean that the first PC captures 0.007 / (0.007 + 0.002 + 0.001) ~ 77% of the variance?
