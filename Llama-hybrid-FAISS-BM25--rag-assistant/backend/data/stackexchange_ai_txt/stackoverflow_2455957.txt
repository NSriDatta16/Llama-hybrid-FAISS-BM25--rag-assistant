My own experience writing DSLs in Ruby is quite limited but i've done the following: (1) An L-System DSL: Dragon = TexPlay::LSystem.new { rule "F" => "F" rule "X" => "X+YF+" rule "Y" => "-FX-Y" angle 90 atom "FX" } (2) An image manipulation tool: image.paint { circle 20, 20, 15, :color => :red rect 10, 20, 100, 100, :color => :green pixel 40, 40, :color => :white }
