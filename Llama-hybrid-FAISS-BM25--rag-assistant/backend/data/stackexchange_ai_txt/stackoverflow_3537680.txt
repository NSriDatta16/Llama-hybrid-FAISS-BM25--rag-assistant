how can i dynamically change the connection string

I am using vb.net and SQL server 2005 I have a project with database classes which are generated from database objects. That is I add a dataset to the project and drag and drop a database object onto it. The problem with this is that I have to give a connectionstring which is stored in the code. This is ok while developing the application. But runtime I want to use another connectionstring, both for security reasons and because each user of the application will correspond to a database user (SQL) and shall have a corresponding connectionstring. Is there an easy way to do this without having to restore to plain all datasets and do everything myself?
