How does eigenvalues work with binary data in redundancy analysis?

I am using the vegan package in R to do a redundancy analysis ( RDA , a part of canonical correlation analysis). My response data is binary and my explanatory variables contains 0, 0.5 an 1. I get quite low eigenvalues (~0.05) and my question is how is the binary data affecting the eigenvalue? Will the variability always be 'badly' explained?
