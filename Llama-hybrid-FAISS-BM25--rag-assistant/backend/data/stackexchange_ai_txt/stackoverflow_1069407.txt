first of all, an alert is perhaps the most primitive, non-elegant, un-friendly form of user interaction a programmer can turn to. you should turn to alerts as an absolute last resort. though the question is a bit vague, it sounds to me as though your logic is this while(strlen(textview) > 25) { // show alert } so of course, when you show the alert, you need to truncate the length of the string to be less than 25, no? else you have a really boring game called 'click away the never ending alert!' a more elegant solution would be to display the number of characters entered, and when it's getting close to the limit (say, over 20) then to make said display red, and instead of showing an alert to simply disallow further input after the 25th character (EXCEPTING OF COURSE THE BACKSPACE and DELETE!)
