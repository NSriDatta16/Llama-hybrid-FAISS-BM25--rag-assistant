can I use t-sne or PCA to reduce number of classes?

I wanted to know if I can use t-sne or PCA to reduce the number of classes depending on the similarity between them. For example, if I have 100 classes of 100 different animals and would like to put all the cats in a group and all the dogs in a group etc. (to get few groups of these 100 classes).
