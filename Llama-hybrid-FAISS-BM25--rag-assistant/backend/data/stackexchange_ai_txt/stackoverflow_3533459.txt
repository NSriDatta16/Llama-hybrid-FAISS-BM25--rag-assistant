Here is a blog post discussing performance issues with regards to Visual Studio, they mention that simplifying the visual tree was not something they looked into much. In your example I think having two templates for a checkbox would hinder rather than improve maintainability as modifying the look will require changes to both. Also switching the template when clicking is likely to be slower than adjusting the visibility of an element. With regards to overall performance I would pay more attention to Effects, VisualBrushes e.t.c but simplifying Templates used a lot (ItemTemplates) can be worthwhile, if the situation with the read only textbox is in an ItemControl with lots of elements and most would be disabled I would be inclined to do it. There are quite a few resources about WPF performance including some mentioned in that post.
