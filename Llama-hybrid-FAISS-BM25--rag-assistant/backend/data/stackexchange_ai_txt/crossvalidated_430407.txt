Literature on Bayesian stuff with Normal Distribution?

I am writing something on Bayesian Analysis involving the normal distribution. I know that the conjugate prior is the so-called normalized Gamma inverse distribution, I know the update rule for the hyperparameters and I know that the predictive distribution is the student's t-distribution. The only place I was able to find where these facts are at least stated is wikipedia . I have carried out the computation by myself as well and they are quite lengthy (I do not want to include them in the document I am writing). Question: Does somebody know a reliable source (like a book about statistics / probability theory) where I could refer to for the proofs of these facts? Wikipedia only mentions Murphy, Kevin P. (2007). "Conjugate Bayesian analysis of the Gaussian distribution" ( pdf ) but this seems unfinished and rather "unofficial"...
