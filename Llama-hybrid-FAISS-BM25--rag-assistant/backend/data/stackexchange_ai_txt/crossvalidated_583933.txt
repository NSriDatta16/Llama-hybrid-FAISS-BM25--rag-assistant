A regression (a.k.a. an ANOVA in this case) would be a simple and appropriate way to analyse this data. You would need to reorganise this data frame a little to analyse it appropriately, by making the measured outcome a single column (not separate columns for control and treatment), and then a new column that indicates whether the outcome corresponds to control or treatment. After that, the simplest analysis you can run is just a regression with the measured outcome as response and treatment type (control/treatment) as the predictor. In R , it would be as simple as summary(lm(outcome_vale ~ treatment_type)) . If you have much more data than you have presented here, you can try multiple regression with additional predictors (such as kind_of_environment ) in the regression formula. You will need to consider both domain expertise and the limitations of the data to choose which predictors to include in the model, whether to include interactions, and other complexities such as the functional form of the response if a predictor is continuous. The more data you have, the more power you have to detect weak or complex effects.
