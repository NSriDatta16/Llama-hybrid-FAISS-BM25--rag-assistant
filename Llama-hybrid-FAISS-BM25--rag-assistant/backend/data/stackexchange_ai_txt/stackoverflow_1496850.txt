Select XMLNode by Id using XPath

I have the below fragement of XML, notice that the Reference node holds a URI which links to the Id attribute of the Body node. 2 3 If I had the value of the URI attribute how would I then get the whole Body XMLNode? I presume this would be best done via an XPath epression but haven't any clue on XPath. Note that the XML will not always be so simple. I'm doing this in c# btw :) Any ideas? Thanks Jon EDIT: I wouldn't know the XML structure or namespaces before hand, all I would know is that the reference element has the ID of the xmlNode i want to retrieve, hope this is sligtly clearer.
