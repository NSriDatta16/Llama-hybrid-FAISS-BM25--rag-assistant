The W3C has a Participation FAQ that you might be interested in, but if your idea is development-related, does it really need to be a part of the specification? Or is it the sort of thing that developers of popular (CSS-related, web development) tools could simply add support for? Rather than going directly to the W3C, I'd suggest first trying to get some more exposure for your idea. Write up a blog post describing it, submit it to some popular sites like A List Apart , Hacker News , or Reddit -- basically, get as many eyes on your idea as you can. If your suggestion really is a good one, it'll help to gain momentum by getting a lot of attention. Or, if it's a bad idea, you'll quickly find out by having people "review" it. You'll likely get some good suggestions to improve the idea, and you'll definitely spend your time better getting peer feedback than somehow trying to singlehandedly champion it to the W3C.
