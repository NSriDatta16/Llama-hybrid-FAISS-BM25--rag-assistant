Use L1 feature selection when L2 is better fit?

I've run L1 and L2 logistic regression models on my (very large) data and L2 is notably better at ROCAUC. However, depending on the parameters (regularization, class weight) the feature coefficients vary a lot and I'm not sure which features are most relevant for a better performing model. Does it make sense to use the L1 regularization coefficient results to select top features, despite L1 being worse on the test scores? I could retrain the selected features with L2.
