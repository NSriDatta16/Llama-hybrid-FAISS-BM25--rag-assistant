Initialise 2D array pointer to char globally

I have a 2-dimensional array of pointer to char and initialising it in a header file. The problem is this: it doesn't complain getting assigned a const char[] but does not like me assigning const char* (as shown in the code). It gives me an error "initializer element is not constant". const char lang[8] = "English"; const char * langPtr = "English 1"; const char * optionPtr[3][10] = { {lang, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, }, {langPtr, 0, ...}, {...} }; I thought lang and langPtr are both pointing at the beginning of a string so should be able to do this. I want to use a pointer to initialise the 2D array. Is there anyway of doing this globally?
