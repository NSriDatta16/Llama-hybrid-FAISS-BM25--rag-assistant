asymptotic behavior of OLS estimators

Conceptually when do estimated regression coefficients converge with the true values; is it a) when the sample size of observations tends to infinity or b) when the regression with the same predictors is fit repeatedly for an infinite number of samples, and the average of the estimated coefficients in each repetition is considered? or do they converge in both of these cases?
