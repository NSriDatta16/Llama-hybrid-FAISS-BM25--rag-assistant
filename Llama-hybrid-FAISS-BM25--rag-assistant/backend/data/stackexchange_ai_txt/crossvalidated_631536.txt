It looks like you have an ordinal variable. This is sometimes used for plant species but also some microorganisms. I'd first inform R that those columns are an ordinal factor: factor(myData$free_bacteria, ..., ordered=TRUE) Then, I'd use some form of model-based unconstrained ordination method to come up with an ordination diagram, which would give you the same result as PCoA. This is because none of the dissimilarity coefficients available in vegan::vegdist can handle ordinal variables. On the other hand, gllvm can to that by using gllvm(data, ..., family="ordinal") . The package ecoCopula also has an ordinal family.
