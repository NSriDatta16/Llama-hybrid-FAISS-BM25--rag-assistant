Using Drag-and-Drop while using MTAThread

Today I came across a peculiar problem, DragDrop functions do NOT work while using MTAThread. I have searched the MSDN and I have googled various combinations of the key words. Can anyone please explain to me why this isn't allowed? Is there a way to get around it?
