You can't, really. A (binary) classification task has a small set of possible outcomes: you either correctly detect/reject something or you don't. The ROC curve measures the trade-off between these (specifically, between the false positive rate and the true positive rate). In this setting, there's no notion of "close-but-not-quite-right", but there is often a "knob" you can turn to increase your true positive rate (at the expense of more false positives too), or vice versa. Regression typically(*) makes continuous predictions. With so many possible outcomes, it's vanishingly unlikely that the model will make an exact prediction (imagine predicting Amazon's annual sales down to the penny--it's not going to happen). There also isn't a TP/FP trade-off. Instead, people measure a regression model's performance using a loss function, which describes how good/bad a certain amount of error is. For example, a common loss function is the mean-squared error: $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} (\textrm{obs}_i - \textrm{pred}_i)^2$. This penalizes large errors a lot, but tolerates smaller errors more. * In some cases, regression can be converted into a classification problem by adding a decision rule. For example, logistic regression, despite the name, is often used as classifier. The "bare" logistic regression output is the probability that an example (i.e., a feature vector) belongs to the positive class: $P(\textrm{class=+} | \textrm{ data})$. However, you could use a decision rule to assign that example to a class. The obvious decision rule is to assign it to the more likely class: the positive one if the probability is at least a half, and the negative one otherwise. By varying this decision rule (e.g., an example is in the positive class if $P(\textrm{class}=+) > \{0.25, 0.5, 0.75, \textrm{etc}\}$, you can turn the TP/FP knob and generate an ROC curve. All that said, for most regression tasks, where you're predicting something continuous, ROC analysis is an odd choice.
