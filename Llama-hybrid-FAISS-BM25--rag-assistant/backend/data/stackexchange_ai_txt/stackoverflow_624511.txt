I would argue that unit tests are a quality tool and not a productivity tool. If you want to both encourage unit testing and to give management a productivity metric, make unit testing mandatory to get code into production, and report on productivity based on code/features that makes it into production over a given time frame (weekly, bi-weekly, whatever). If we take as a given that people will game any system, then design the game to meet your goals.
