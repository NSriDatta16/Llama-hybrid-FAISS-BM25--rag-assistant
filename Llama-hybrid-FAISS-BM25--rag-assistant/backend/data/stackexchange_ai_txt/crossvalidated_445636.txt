high-dimensional multivariate regression with R

think of the following data: two z-standardized dependent variables = continuous (here, both reflect a deviation of age but in different tissues) many predictors for a rather small data set, possibly multicollinearity (here, overall n ~ 300 and around 30 predictors) Aim: Predict the value of the two dependent variables & figure out what influences the outcome on the dependent variables My very first approach was to build groups from the 2 outcomes (e.g. high value on both dimensions, low value on both dimensions etc...) and run multinomial logistic regression. Problem: I've had to build somewhat arbitrary groups. All individuals rather lie together in one cloud. My question is: What would be a good approach for analyzing this in R? So basically I want to predict where on these two dimensions an individual lies and I want to know what predictors are useful for that. I found several potential techniques, e.g. multinomial relevance vector regression (I found no R package for that, especially as I need to learn it), multivariate regression (there I am missing the combination of the two dependent variables), pls regression (problem that I don't see which predictors are important), SEM (problem because of the many predictors)... I'd be grateful for any recommendations on R packages or sites that could help me with this.
