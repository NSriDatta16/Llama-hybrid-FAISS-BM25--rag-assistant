How do make an infinite jscrollpane?

I've implemented drag scroll before, but what's the best way to go about creating an infinite scroll pane? Of course there won't be any scrollbars and I will implement drag scroll. What I am trying to do is implement dynamic loading on an infinite surface. EDIT Of course it wouldn't actually be infinite. I am asking how to fake it.
