How can i compute noise (1 sigma error) given a signal

I have a signal organized as an image, i.e. a matrix. Each "pixel" has an error $\sigma_{i,j}$ . Simplifying, let's assume that the error is the same for all the involved "pixels". How can I compute the corresponding noise associated to each pixel at 1 sigma error? Clearly, I'm assuming a gaussian distribution for the noise for each pixel.
