You are not inserting the values of the variables. You are inserting variable names. Replace stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO customer (cust_ID, sale_ID, first_Name, mI, last_Name, street_Name, city, state, zip_Code, DOB, agent_ID, home_Phone, cell_Phone, profession, employer, referrer)" + " VALUES (custID, saleID, firstName, mInitial, lastName, streetName, city, state, zipCode, DOB, agentID, homePhone, cellPhone, profession, employer, referrer)"); by preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO customer (cust_ID, sale_ID, first_Name, mI, last_Name, street_Name, city, state, zip_Code, DOB, agent_ID, home_Phone, cell_Phone, profession, employer, referrer)" + " VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"); preparedStatement.setLong(1, Long.valueOf(custID)); preparedStatement.setLong(2, Long.valueOf(saleID)); preparedStatement.setString(3, firstName); // ... preparedStatement.executeUpdate(); Please note that you shouldn't use string concatenation + to glue the variables together in a SQL string. It would be totally open to SQL injection attacks. Use PreparedStatement all the way.
