How to make C++ code draw on Java components

We are designing physics app, and we would like to have it written in Java, and also we want to use root (root is writen in C++). Root has some nice graphical features -- it is able to draw very nice 3D charts, and I'm thinking whether it's possible to embedd those charts in Java app. Is there any way to make C++ code draw on for example JPanel ? Is there a way to pass back mouse/keyboard events? - we would like to have some interactivity, like rotating a 3d chart. I asked similar question about embedding a lot of C++ code (that is not related to drawing anything) in Java app (also about root) it's here .
