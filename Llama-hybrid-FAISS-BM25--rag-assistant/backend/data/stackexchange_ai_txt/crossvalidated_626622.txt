If you do no feature engineering, that is, the input to sigmoid is simply ax+b then you will get a linear boundary such that h(x) = 1 for ax+b > 0.5 and h(x) = 0 for ax+b It is when you do feature engineering that the nature of the boundary starts to become nonlinear in the 2D plan. Let's say your input is not just x now but x,x^2, and x^3 . Now your decision boundary might look something like this, h(x) = 1 for ax+bx^2+cx^3+d > 0.5 and h(x) = 0 for ax+bx^2+cx^3+d which is non-linear.
