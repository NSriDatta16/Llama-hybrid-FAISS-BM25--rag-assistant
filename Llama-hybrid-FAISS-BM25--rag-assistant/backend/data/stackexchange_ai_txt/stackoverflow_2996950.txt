A couple of my Hudson jobs are just summaries and display information. The 'jobs' need to run for data to be collected and saved. The run could be based dependent jobs or just scheduled nightly. Some examples: One of our jobs just merges together the .SER files from Cobertura and generates the Cobertura reports for an overall code coverage from all of our unit, integration and different types of system tests (hint for others doing the same: Cobertura has little logic for unsynchronized SER files. Using them will yield some odd results. There are some tweaks that can be done to the merge code that reduces the problem) Some of our builds write data to a database. We have a once a week task that pulls the data from the database and creates an HTML file with trend charts. The results are kept as part of the job.
