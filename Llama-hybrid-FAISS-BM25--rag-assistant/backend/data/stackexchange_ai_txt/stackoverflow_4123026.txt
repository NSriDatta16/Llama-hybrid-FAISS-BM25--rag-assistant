I haven't tried it, but I don't see why you just can't mmap with MAP_SHARED, and have it JUST WORK. Provided you don't want a single segment which is too big for the 32-bit process's address space (bearing in mind fragmentation), and you don't want it mapped at the same address in both processes (which may not be possible), it should simply work. After all, mmap() is not architecture dependent in its effects (only its implementation)
