Qt Designer; difficulty placing widgets in the right parent

Using the Qt Designer I've made a couple of QFrames in each other, each having a horizontal layout. Their stylesheet predicates that they should have no margin nor a padding. This means that in the Qt Designers view as well as in the final result, no space is seen between the QFrames. Using drag-and-drop I can place widgets into the window, it shows a blue line where it will be placed (in a layout). However, it's impossible to add another QFrame to a QFrame parent I can't see (and thus drop on). There is also a tree in the right panel, but dropping on the parent makes it automatically go in one of the childs... Example, I have this setup: QMainWindow - QWidget - QFrame (parent) - QFrame (child) - QFrame (child) Adding a new frame, whatever I try, gives me: QMainWindow - QWidget - QFrame (parent) - QFrame (child) - QFrame (child) - QFrame (new child) But I really want: QMainWindow - QWidget - QFrame (parent) - QFrame (child) - QFrame (child) - QFrame (new parent) Is there any feature I haven't discovered to accurately place new widgets?
