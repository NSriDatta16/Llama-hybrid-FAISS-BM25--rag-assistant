Intercept aka zero component model means: do not fit any PLS components/latent variables but always predict the average training y. This is a baseline against which the improvement for more complex models can be judged. In your case, there is no improvement. That observation alone is not sufficient to judge what exactly goes wrong here. What does the summary tell you about explained x and y variances? What is the y range?
