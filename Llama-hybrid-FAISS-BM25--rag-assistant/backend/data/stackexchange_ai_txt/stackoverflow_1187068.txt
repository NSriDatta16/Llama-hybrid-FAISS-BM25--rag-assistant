Generate icon images in Java

I have a set of icon images of various sizes (16x16, 24x24, 32x32) and base colours (red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow). The images are pretty basic geometric patterns + drop shadow, so my gut feeling is that it should be pretty straightforward to replace the files with an icon factory that can generate images given a base colour. However, subclassing the Image class seems to be a lot of work - is there a better way? Just to clarify - I'm not interested in generating image files , I intend to use the Image objects directly.
