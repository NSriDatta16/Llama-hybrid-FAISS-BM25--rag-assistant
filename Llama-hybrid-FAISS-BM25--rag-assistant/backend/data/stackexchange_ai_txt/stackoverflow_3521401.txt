GHC will also load any .ghci file it finds in the current directory. It's very useful to do per-project configuration of GHCi. This is an example from a project I work on: :set -isrc:dist/build/autogen :set -hide-package mtl The first is there to make sure that the modules generated by Cabal are easy to import. The second hides mtl since this particular project uses transformers .
