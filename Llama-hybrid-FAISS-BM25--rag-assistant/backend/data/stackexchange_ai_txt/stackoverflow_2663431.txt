File input javascript event, is there an event fire when someone click okay on the dialog box?

When someone click on Browse for the input file below: A dialog box will appear. The user will then select a file and click 'Ok'. The dialog box will close. Is there an event fire because of that? I tried onfocus and onblur, it didnt work out. The only way I can think of is to start a timer to check the value content when it is onfocus. Not that elegant. Any solution? Cheers, Mickey
