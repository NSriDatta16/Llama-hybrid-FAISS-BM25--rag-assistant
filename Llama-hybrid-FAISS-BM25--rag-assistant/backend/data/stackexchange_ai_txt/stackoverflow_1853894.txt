I just had a quick look at the API v3 spec for Markers - it doesn't look like the 'bouncy' option is available right now but I wouldn't be surprised to see this get implemented into the v3 API at some point - it's still in Beta and bound to change quite a bit. Here is a link to the API v3 Reference on the available Marker Options If you really wanted the behavior in a V3 Map now you could tie an event to the 'dragend' method on the Marker Object. Have the function called alter the anchor point of the MarkerImage object - check out the MarkerImage object in the API too.
