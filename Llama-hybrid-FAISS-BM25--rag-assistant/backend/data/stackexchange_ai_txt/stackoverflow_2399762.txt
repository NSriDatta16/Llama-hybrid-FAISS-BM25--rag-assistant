Fast inter-thread communication mechanism

I need a fast inter-thread communication mechanism for passing work ( void* ) from TBB tasks to several workers which are in running/blocking operations. Currently I'm looking into using pipe() + libevent . Is there a faster and more elegant alternative for use with Intel Threading Building Blocks?
