A oneliner to solve the problem: find . |grep -v "test/icecream/cupcake/"| grep -v "test/mtndew/livewire/"|xargs rm -r Removed since it does not work this might get you into trouble if have file names with space in them, and it might keep more files then you want if there are other trees that match the patterns. A somewhat better solution: find . |sed "s/.*/rm '&'/"|grep -v "rm './test/icecream/cupcake/"| grep -v "rm './test/mtndew/livewire/"|sh Not actually tested, if it breaks you get to keep both parts. Edit: As Dennis points its not only two parts that it breaks into :-) corrected the typos in the second example and removed the first
