A very good resource about this is the old "Gang of Four" design patterns book. This book is very usefull for anyone developing object-oriented software. I'm personally using proxy objects for lazy loading with NHibernate. I don't use proxies with inversion of control because I resolve interfaced types only with my IoC. Charles Bretana's explanation is very good. I can't imagine the relation between proxy and AoP. Could someone explain that here?
