Logistic regression across groups

When running a logit/probit model for particular sets of outcomes on a set of participants (whether they did a certain behavior at least two times), how can one best control for differences when the individual observations began? In particular, one person may have started to participate 3 years ago, whereas another person may have joined just last year. I'm using STATA for the analysis and do know when the individuals began observations. Related to this question, what is the most effective way to refine the functional form of a the model?
