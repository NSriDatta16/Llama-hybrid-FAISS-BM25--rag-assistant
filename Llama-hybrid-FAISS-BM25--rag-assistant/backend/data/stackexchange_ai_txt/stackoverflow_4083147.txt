How to abstract common snippets of markup with ASP.NET MVC

I have a lot of content-heavy views in my ASP.NET MVC 2 site. These contain several re-occurring HTML patterns. When using ASP.NET Webforms, a class derived from WebControl could encapsulate these patterns. I'd like some pointers on the correct approach for this problem with MVC. Detailed Explanation Patterns not unlike the following HTML markup keep occurring throughout these views. The markup renders into an isolated a box of content: The title (and a small note) This is content. Some more content This is a trivial example, but there are more complex recurring patterns. In ASP.NET Webforms I would have abstracted such code into a WebControl (let's say I'd have named it BoxControl), being included on a page like this: The title (and a small note) This is content. Some more content This abstraction makes it easy to adapt the way the box is constructed throughout the site, by just altering the BoxControl source. It also keeps the static HTML content neatly together in the View Page, even when combining several BoxControls on a page. Another benefit is that the HTML used as content is recognized by the IDE, thus providing syntax highlighting/checking. To my understanding, WebControls are discouraged in ASP.NET MVC. Instead of a WebControl, I could accomplish the abstraction with a partial view. Such a view would then be included in a View Page as follows: This is content. Some more content "}); %> This is not ideal, since the 'Content' parameter could become very long, and the IDE does not treat it as HTML when passed this way. Considered Solutions Strongly-Typed ViewModels can be passed to the Html.Partial call instead of the lengthy parameters shown above. But then I'd have to pull the content in from somewhere else (a CMS, or Resource file). I'd like for the content to be contained in the View Page. I have also considered the solution proposed by Jeffrey Palermo , but that would mean lots of extra files scattered around the project. I'd like the textual content of any view to be restricted to one file only. Should I not want to abstract the markup away? Or is there maybe an approach, suitable for MVC, that I am overlooking here? What is the drawback to 'sinning' by using a WebControl?
