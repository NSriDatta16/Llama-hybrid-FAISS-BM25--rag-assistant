Average of t-distributed random variables

I have 10 t-distributed random variables that I'm averaging over. They are unlikely to be independent but for simplicity let's just assume that they are. Each random variable is parameterised by mean $\mu$ , degrees of freedom $\nu$ and scale $\sigma^2$ , $$ x_i \sim St(\mu_i,\nu_i,\sigma_i^2). $$ Is the distribution of $\bar{x}$ t-distributed? If so, what are it's $\mu,\nu,\sigma^2$ ? Based on this answer , I'm guessing that it's not t-distributed but it's not clear what it should be.
