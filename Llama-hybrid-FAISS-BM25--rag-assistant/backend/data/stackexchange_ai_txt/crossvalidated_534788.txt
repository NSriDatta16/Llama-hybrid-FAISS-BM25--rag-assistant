Is it possible to estimate parameters from data with MCMC using squared error, with no probability model of the observed data?

I am familiar with using MCMC with a likelihood to estimate model parameters. However, I have recently been in a new field which usually gets point estimates of parameters using least squares rather than likelihoods. A recent paper moved to MCMC, but did not mention any probability model of the data. I contacted one of the authors and they said that their MCMC estimates were "based on a least squares analysis", and that no probability model (i.e., no likelihood) was required to perform their MCMC. Is this really possible? My understanding of MCMC is that a likelihood (at least an approximate one) is required to perform the MH step. If it is possible to perform MCMC using least squares, could somebody point me to a basic introduction of how that works? Thank you
