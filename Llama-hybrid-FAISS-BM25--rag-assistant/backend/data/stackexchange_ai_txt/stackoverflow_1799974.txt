Elegantly override style of ComboBox's ToggleButton in WPF

I have a question regarding how to elegantly override an arbitrary element deep inside a control's visual tree. I also have attempted to resolve it in a few different ways, but I've run into several problems with each. Usually when I try three different paths and fail at each one I go downstairs, have a coffee, and ask someone smarter than myself. So here I am. Specifics: I want to flatten the style of a combo box so that it will not draw attention to itself. I want it to be similar to Windows.Forms.ComboBox's FlatStyle I want it to look the same on Windows 7 and XP. Mainly, I want to change the look of a ComboBox's ToggleButton. I could just use Blend and rip the control template's guts out and manually change them. That doesn't sound very appetizing to me. I tried using a style to override the ToggleButton's background, but it turns out that the whole ComboBox control is actually a front for a ToggleButton. So I gave up and ripped it using Blend. I found that it's actually a Style called ComboBoxTransparentButtonStyle with a target type of ToggleButton. The style sets a ControlTemplate that uses a DockPanel that has a "Microsoft_Windows_Themes:ClassicBorderDecorator" type set to the right, and that's what we're actually trying to control. (Are you with me so far?) Here's the pic: Arg. Isn't WPF a blast? So I extracted the style ComboBoxTransparentButtonStyle and dropped it into another project's application.resources. Problem is I can't apply that style to a ComboBox because the style I extracted has a targetType of ToggleButton, so the TargeTypes don't match. tl;dr how would you guys do it?
