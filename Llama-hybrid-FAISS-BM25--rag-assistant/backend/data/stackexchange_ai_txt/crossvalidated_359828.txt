How to display probabilities instead of log-odds in stata

I understand that logistic regression coefficients are to be interpreted as log-odds. i need coefficients to represent probabilities so i can say something like: "the effect of [some dummy variable] increases/decreases the probability of my binary outcome equalling 1 by ....% ceterius paribus" is there someway to get logistic regression results to be displayed in this way on stata? looking back at my undergraduate logit model notes coefficients are titled dy/dx and are bounded between -1 and +1. is there some way to covert log-odds to probabilities? thanks :)
