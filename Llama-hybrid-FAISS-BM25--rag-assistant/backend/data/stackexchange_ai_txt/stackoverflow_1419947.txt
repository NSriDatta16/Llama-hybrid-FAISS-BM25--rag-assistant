The answer from MusiGenesis is elegant, (typical in a good way), nice and clean. But just to offer an alternative using lambda expressions and an 'Action' for a different type of recursion: Action traverse = null; //in a function: traverse = (ctrl) => { ctrl.Enabled = false; //or whatever action you're performing traverse = (ctrl2) => ctrl.Controls.GetEnumerator(); }; //kick off the recursion: traverse(rootControl);
