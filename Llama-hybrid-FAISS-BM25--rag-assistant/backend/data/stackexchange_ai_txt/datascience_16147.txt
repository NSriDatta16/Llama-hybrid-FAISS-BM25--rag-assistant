I would assume you want to do this for the cleaning phase of your project. Microsoft Cognitive Services provides a spell check API https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-spell-check-api . If you are trying to group words into embedding's, then I might suggest Word2Vec or Glove. Glove is pre-trained and has a different specified number of dimensions for each vector. However, both can potentially account for misspellings as well as similarities.
