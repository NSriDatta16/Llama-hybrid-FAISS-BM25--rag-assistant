Detecting a break _region_ in regression relationships (using R)

We're given a seasonal time series $y_t$, representing a certain metric used to measure a system's performance. The measure has a positive trend, and a considerable seasonal influence. We also know that, between $t_1$ and $t_2$, a number of changes were done to the system with the goal of improving performance. Our task is to measure if there was a significant impact of said changes. As doing an $A-B$ test is not feasible, we're left with detecting if there is a significant structural change following the aforementioned interval. One approach would be detecting if a structural break-point occurs in $(t_1,t_2)$ using $R$'s strucchange::breakpoints function. My concern with this is that it is intended to detect points where structural changes occurs, whereas in our case the change (if it exists) most likely occurs in a smooth fashion in $(t_1,t_2)$. Are there are any built in functionalities that could help me in this case? Or any theoretical approach that can be programmed? Or should my initial idea of using strucchange::breakpoints be sufficient? Note : we're actually dealing with hundreds of such systems, so a computational solution is preferred, one that we can iterate through all the systems.
