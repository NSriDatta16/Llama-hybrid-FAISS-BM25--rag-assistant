OLS assumptions of uncorrelatedess

When dealing with data $(X,Y)$ that is not time series data, for example $X=\text{weight}$ and $Y=\text{height}$ , we can use OLS to estimate the coefficients $b_1$ and $b_0$ of a linear regression model $Y=b_1 X+b_0$ only if certain assumptions are met. One of the assumption is that the residuals are uncorrelated with each other. How do we check this assumption numerically? Do we simply perform the autocorrelation between the function $\text{res}(X)$ and it shifted version $\text{res}(X + \delta X)$ ? The other assumption is that the $X$ values and the residuals $\text{res}(X)$ are uncorrelated. Do we simply do the sum of the pairwise products $X\cdot \text{res}(X)$ hoping that the sum is close to zero?
