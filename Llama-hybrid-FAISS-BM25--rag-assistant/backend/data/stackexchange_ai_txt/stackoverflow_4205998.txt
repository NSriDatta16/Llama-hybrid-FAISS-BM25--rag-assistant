There isn't a great deal of difference between the two, and what there is is mostly cultural. Machine Learning came from Computer Science roots whereas Statistics is more mathematical. There's a nice blog post called "Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!" by Brendan O'Connor that talks about this. As for non-statistical approaches to machine learning, well there are several rule-based approaches (decision trees, rule induction, ILP) and there are also approaches like reinforcement learning for control problems. Those don't feel very statistical to me, but you could claim that they are... you could probably claim all of life falls under statistical decision theory if you wanted to (in fact, Marcus Hutter does).
