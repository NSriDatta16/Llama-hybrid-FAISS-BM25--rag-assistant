Use new Canvas(Bitmap bitmap) to provide a Canvas with a Bitmap which will contain the result of your drawing operations. The original Bitmap that you draw on your Canvas with drawBitmap will never be modified. After each operation done by the user you might: keep in memory a list of the operations done save intermediate results to external storage with Bitmap.compress Another approach could be to use a LayerDrawable to stack successive drawing operations on top of each other. You can imagine allowing the user to disable each individual operation done.
