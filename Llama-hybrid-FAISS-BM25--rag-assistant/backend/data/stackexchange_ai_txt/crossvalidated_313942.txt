How to use linear regression to estimate parameters for this example?

I am learning Machine Learning. and going through some videos. In that one slide came which I am not able to understand (Attached below). This is related to Linear Regression. In second image, it starts line from 0's place as value of theta0 is 0. but value of theta1 is 0.5, then why he kept points at (2,1) and (1,2)? Based on given formula, how this line is going up and how it estimates points/value.
