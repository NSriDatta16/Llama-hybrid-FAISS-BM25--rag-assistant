JPA EntityManager find with case sensitive key

I'm trying to use the JPA EntityManager find() method. My primary key is a string which corresponds to a user's name. I am using JPA / Hibernate / MYSQL. My problem is a search for user 'David' matches user 'david' due, I assume, to the case insensitive string matching in the underlying MYSQL. This causes me a whole heap of problems!! Has anybody got an elegant solution to this? I could do a native SQL call and use the BINARY operator as documented here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-binary-op.html Anyone got a better solution? Ta.
