Where to learn which ML task is most appropriate for a problem?

There is now tons of material available on how to do certain (most popular) ML tasks and what kind of output you can expect. However I found that resources on how to select appropriate ML task/approach given specific problem are very coarse and scarce. I can't find anything better than "use rnn/lstm for time series prediction" or "k-means for classification" Are there publications/Internet resources available that dedicated purely to teaching how to define you problem in a way that would suit specific ML approach select best ML model within the approach?
