You can set up your data as a contingency table, as with the following R code: yourtable Now you can do a chisquare test of independence in this table: chisq.test(yourtable) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: yourtable X-squared = 8.1389, df = 2, p-value = 0.01709 But you are only interested in whether 2020 is different from the two other years. One simple way to do it wold be simply to lump together the data for 2018 and 2019, thereby obtaining a $2\times 2$-table and proceeding as above. I will show another, more general, way, converting to the corresponding logistic regression: yourdf A logistic regression corresponding to the independence test in the above $3\times 2$-table is mod0 summary(mod0) Call: glm(formula = Group ~ Year, family = binomial, data = yourdf, weights = Freq) Deviance Residuals: 1 2 3 4 5 6 -6.554 3.151 -6.635 3.152 -10.226 5.602 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
