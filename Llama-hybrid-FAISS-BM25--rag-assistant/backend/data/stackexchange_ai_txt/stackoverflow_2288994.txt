Why does bindingSource = newBindingSource not refresh data

I have this in my form's designer code: this.referenceNumberTextBox.DataBindings.Add(new System.Windows.Forms.Binding("Text", this.clientDetailBindingSource, "ClientDetails.ReferenceNumber", true)); In a method in the form just before it gets displayed I say this.clientDetailBindingSource = passedInBindingSource; The controls that are databound to this.clientDetailBindingSource do not show any data. I have also tried doing ResetBindings() but nothing happened.
