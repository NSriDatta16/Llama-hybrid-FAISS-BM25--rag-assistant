When you say you 'inject a warning' are you using a #pragma directive? A #pragma directive is meant to be seen during compile time, not during run time. When you say the function 'testVector gets injected into SomeFile.cpp ', how is this observed? Do you get a compiler or linker error saying that the function was previously defined? Are you compiling gcc for Integrity OS or gcc for x86 Linux? Integrity works very differently from Linux, and the type of Integrity project matters. You can build a monolithic Integrity kernel or an Integrity kernel supporting dynamic download. Additionally the Integrity C and C++ runtime libraries are different from Linux.
