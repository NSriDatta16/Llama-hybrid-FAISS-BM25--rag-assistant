Issues integrating NCover with CC.NET, .NET framework 4.0 and MsTest

I'm implementing continuous integration with CruiseControl.NET, .NET 4.0, NCover and MsTest. On the build server I'm unable to run code coverage from the Ncover explorer or NCover console. When I run where vstesthost.exe from the Ncover console it returns the Visual Studio 9.0 path and does not seem to pick up .net framework 4.0. I've followed instructions from this MSTest: Measuring Test Quality With NCover post with slight modifications for .net framework 4.0, without any success. My CC.NET script looks like this C:\Program Files (x86)\NCover\NCover.Console.exe $(project_root)\ "C:\Program Files (x86)\**Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0**\Common7\IDE\MSTest.exe" /testcontainer:...\...\UnitTests.dll /resultsfile:TestResults.trx //xml D:\_Projects\....\Temp_Coverage.xml //pm vstesthost.exe $(ncover.timeout) Has anyone come across similar issue. Any help would be much appreciated.
