From Factor Analysis Vs. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Principal Component Analysis Factor Analysis Meaning A component is a derived new dimension (or variable) so that the derived variables are linearly independent of each other. A factor (or latent) is a common or underlying element with which several other variables are correlated. Purpose PCA is used to decompose the data into a smaller number of components and therefore is a type of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Factor Analysis is used to understand the underlying ‘cause’ which these factors (latent or constituents) capture much of the information of a set of variables in the dataset data. Hence, it is also known as Common Factor Analysis (CFA). Assumption PCA looks to identify the dimensions that are composites of the observed predictors. Factor analysis explicitly presumes that the latent (or factors) exist in the given data. Objective The aim of PCA is to explain as much of the cumulative variance in the predictors (or variables) as possible. FA focuses on explaining the covariances or the correlations between the variables. How much variation is explained? The components explain all the variance in the data. PCA captures the maximum variance in the first component, then in the second component, and henceforth followed by the other components. The latent themselves are not directly measurable, and they do not explain all the variance in the data. Hence, it results in an error term that is unique to each measured variable. Process In PCA, the components are calculated as the linear combinations of the original variables. In factor analysis, the original variables are defined as the linear combinations of the factors. Mathematical representation Y = W1* PC1 + W2* PC2+… + W10 * PC10 +C Where, PCs are the components and Wis are the weights for each of the components. X1 = W1 F + e1 X2 = W2 F + e2 X3 = W3*F + e3 Where, F is the factor, Wis are the weights and eis are the error terms. The error is the variance in each X that is not explained by the factor. Interpretation of the weights The weights are the correlation between the standardized scores of the predictors (or variables) and the principal components, also known as the factor loadings. For example, in PCA, the weights indicate which component contributes more to the target variable, Y, as the independent variables are standardized. The weights in the factor analysis express the relationship or association of each variable (X) to the underlying factor (F). These are also known as the factor loadings and can be interpreted as the standardized regression coefficients. Estimation of the weights PCA uses the correlation matrix of the variables, which generates the eigenvectors (or the components) and estimates it as the betas (or the coefficients). The process of factor analysis ascertains the optimal weights. Pecking order In PCA, the variables are specified and then estimate the weights (coefficients or betas) through regression. In factor analysis, the latent (or the factors) are first specified and then estimate the factor returns through regression. Use Cases and Applications of PCA The use cases of PCA are: PCA is highly used for image processing. It has wide applications in domains such as facial recognition, computer vision. Image processing is a method to perform operations on an image to either enhance an image or extract and determine information or patterns from it. It has its use in the field of investment to analyze stocks and predict portfolio returns. Also, it can be used to model the yield curves. PCA also has its applications in the area field of bioinformatics. One such use case is the genomic study done using gene expression measurements. Both the banking sector and marketing have vast applications of PCA. It can be used to profile customers based on their demographics. PCA has been extensively used to conduct clinical studies. It is used in the healthcare sector and also by researchers in the domain of food science. In the field of psychology, PCA is used to understand psychological scales. It can be used to understand statically the ineffective habits that we must have broken yesterday! Use Case and Applications of Factor Analysis Some of the business problems where factor analysis can be applied are: You may have heard of the old saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” In case you have a stock portfolio, then you know what I am referring to. Investment professionals rely on factor analysis to diversify their stocks. It is used to predict the movement across stocks in a consolidated sector or industry. In the space of marketing, factor analysis can be used to analyze customer engagement. It is a measure of how much a product or brand is interacting with its customers during the product’s life cycle. The HR managers can employ factor analysis to encourage employee effectiveness. It can be done by identifying the features that have the most impact on employee productivity. Factor analysis can be applied to group (or segment) the customers based on the similarity or the same characteristics of the customers. For example, in the insurance industry, the customers are categorized based on their life stage, for example, youth, married, young family, middle-age with dependents, retried. Another example is of restaurants that would frame their menu to target customers based on the demographics. For example, a fine dining restaurant in an upper locality will not have the same menu as a tea stall near a college campus. Schools, colleges, or universities also apply factor analysis to make their decisions as the class curriculum would be dependent on the difference in the levels of the classes. This ultimately determines the salary and staffing limits of the teachers. This technique is also handy for exploring the relationships in the category of socioeconomic status, dietary patterns. Like PCA, factor analysis can also be used to understand the psycholo
