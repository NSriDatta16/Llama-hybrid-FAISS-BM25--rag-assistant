I tried developing on the DS a while back. From what I remember, DevKitPro had an ARM library you could use. I worked mostly with Func-C, but C++ is supported. Technically, I think you can program on anything that has a compiler for the ARM architecture. I'm looking to get into it again when the DSi is launched in Canada. The faster processor, persistent storage and more memory should produce some sweet home-brew.
