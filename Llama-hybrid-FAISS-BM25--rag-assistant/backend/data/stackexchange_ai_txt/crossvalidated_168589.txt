Some assumptions need to be made to extrapolate (far) beyond the range of the data you have. These assumptions could either be parametric models or something like repeating the hazard of the last year (or last 2 years) over and over. The latter approach is quite a strong assumption (more or less extrapolation with an exponential distribution based on the average hazard rate of the last year, if the hazard rate did not vary too much throughout the year). One possibility to avoid assuming one particular model and to reflect the uncertainty about the appropriate model, is to entertain a range of plausible models and to do (e.g. Bayesian) model averaging. Another possibility is to use information external to your main dataset, because extrapolating to 30 years from just 6 years may be very challenging unless there are reasons to believe the underlying process would not change too much (or if we know how we expect it to change). It is hard to say anything about that without knowing what the unity under risk are.
