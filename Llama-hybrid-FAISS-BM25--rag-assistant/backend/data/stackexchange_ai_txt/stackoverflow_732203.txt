Access has no such concept. You can either conflate the two tables into one, or place unique indexes on both tables for the common field(s). Are there other benefits you would expect? You could I suppose create FK relationships in both directions, but I'm not sure what it would gain you except maybe query hints. EDIT: Important update note from comment - I don't see the problem. I opened a random DB on my computer, duplicated a table, and opened the Relationships editor. Dragged one ID field to another to create a relationship. http://i43.tinypic.com/2v30x7c.png One-to-one is an option. â€“ Brendan Kidwell
