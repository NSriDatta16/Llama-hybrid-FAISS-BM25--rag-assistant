Mootools Drag Slider Help

I have been doing a jQuery slider for a day or so, and we just have conflicts with other jQuery elements. So thought bugger it, let's have a play with Mootools. The issue is I am crap at Js. So here is a link to what I have, http://sitehelp.com.au/slider/ Now what I want to do is: The slider updates amount in the input element. Input box to show $0 on page load. As the slider slides along the amount in the Input element increases. Alternatively Would like to be able to TYPE into the input element, and make the slider slide to that point, along the slide rule. Also need this to be able to sit on page with jQuery stuff, I seem to recall a fix for Mootools and jQuery on page together, but cannot remmeber it. Lastly, on SUBMIT pass the value user entered . Any assistance, greatly appreciated. To See my jQuery Version. >> http://sitehelp.com.au/slider2/ ( I didnt author the jQuery version, its just one I have customized via link on Stack )
