Just a few ideas: Make sure you not only created the udev rules, but also did chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules Use dmesg shortly after plugging in the phone to verify that it's enumerating nicely as a usb device. See if you can get the adb shell up Can you do a mass storage mount? That's not a development function but would at least be a test that the usb is working.
