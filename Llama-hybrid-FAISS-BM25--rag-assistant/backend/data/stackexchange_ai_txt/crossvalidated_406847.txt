A couple of things: 1) Both the PCA and the MinMaxScaler do not have to be fit on train and test data. Only fit them on train data and use the fitted transformer to transform both training and test data. Otherwise you might be using a slightly different transformation on both sets. 2) From the comment you seem to want to use a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), but you are using Dense layers and a Sequential model and so you end up using a FeedForward NN whose layers are densely connected. I suppose your network architecture was unable to learn much from the data you fitted it on (based on high MAPE score) but it's hard to know for sure without being able to reproduce it.
