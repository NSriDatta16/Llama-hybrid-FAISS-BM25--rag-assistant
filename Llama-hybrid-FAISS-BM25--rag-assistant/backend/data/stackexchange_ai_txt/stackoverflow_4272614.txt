The User Guide has a part on this. If I understand correctly, you have to use a tag instead of a bullet point for trivial numbering (each occurance counts one up). For more complex numbering see pages 73/74. Example, as far as I understand, you put things like for bold textand inline: from reportlab.platypus import Paragraph formatted_text = "Some example text. First. Second. Third" formatted_para = Paragraph(your_formatted_text, your_paragraph_style_instance) You will have to experiment a bit with line breaks. This one won't have any.
