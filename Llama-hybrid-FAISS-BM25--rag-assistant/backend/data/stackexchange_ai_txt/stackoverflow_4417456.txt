Winforms Extended Control Properties

I'm extending a Winforms Label control. (CustomLabel). Here's the definition: public class CustomLabel: Label public CustomLabel():base() { } I'd like to change the label's default text. it's always CustomLabel1 , CustomLabel2 , etc. I tried base.Text = ... and this.Text=... in the constructor. Also tried: [DefaultValue(typeof(string), "MyDesiredText")] public override string Text { get { return base.Text; } set { base.Text = value; } } But no luck. And one more thing: It seems like Autosize property doesn't work as expected and provides 1 character less space than necessary to view the custom label control for the first time. For example, the default text is: CustomLabel1 but I only see CustomLabel when I drag the control to the form. If I change the text, the Autosize property will show the whole text correctly.
