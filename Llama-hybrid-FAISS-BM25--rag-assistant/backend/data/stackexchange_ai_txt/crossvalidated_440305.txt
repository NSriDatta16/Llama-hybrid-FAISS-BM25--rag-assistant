What is the difference between Deep Neural Network(DNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)?

This question basically focus on working of ANN and DNN. I really want to know, as both ANN and DNN may have multiple layer and also increase the number of hidden neuron. so, why DNN works better than ANN?
