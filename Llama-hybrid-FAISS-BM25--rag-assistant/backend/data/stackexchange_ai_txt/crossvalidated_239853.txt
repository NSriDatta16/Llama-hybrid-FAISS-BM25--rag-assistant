Asymptotic properties of estimates

How do the asymptotic properties of estimates depend on stationarity of time series (and other properties of underlying DGP, e.g., the distribution of errors)? For example, a lot of books and papers about asymptotics of MLE consider only the case of independent random variables (or vectors) or give a set of conditions which are hard to interpret and tell nothing about application of this theory to often used models. Can you give me any references to relevant literature or explain asymptotic properties of time series in short. Thank you in advance.
