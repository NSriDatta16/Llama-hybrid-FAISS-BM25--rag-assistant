Is it discriminant analysis?

I have samplings of one-dimensional data of two classes: $A$ and $B$. I have to predict the posterior probability of class $A$. $$\tilde{P}(A|x) \approx \frac{N_A\tilde{f_A}(x)}{N_A\tilde{f_A}(x) + N_B\tilde{f_B}(x)}.$$ $f_A$, $f_B$ are the estimation of densities of classes $A$ and $B$. I estimate the densities as normal distributions, whose $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are average values and standard deviations of all the points of each class ($A$ and $B$ accordingly). Will it be correct to say, that I'm using discriminant analysis in this case?
