Can i pursue a career in data science with a business analytics degree?

I had a question regarding about a career as a data scientist. Im pursuing a degree in business analytics with a minor computer science. Could i still become a data scientist with a bachelors degree in business analytics. Or would i have to pursue a masters degree in data science in order to become a data scientist. (I have a good programming background in data structures and algorithm in java, plus web development, python)
