Find lines that don't begin with a "<", perform action

Am using vim and have a large text file that contains some html thrown in throughout. Am trying to prepare it for the web and need to add tags to the lines that are not yet formatted. Here is an example of what I have: Paragraph text one one line [... more ... ] Other paragraph text on the next line [... more ... ] html element thrown in on its own line More paragraph text [... more ... ] There is still more text! I am looking for a way to search for the lines that don't begin with a character and, for those lines, add opening and closing tags ... so that, afterwards, my file resembles this: Paragraph text one one line [... more ... ] Other paragraph text on the next line [... more ... ] html element thrown in on its own line More paragraph text [... more ... ] There is still more text! How do I find lines that don't match a starting character?
