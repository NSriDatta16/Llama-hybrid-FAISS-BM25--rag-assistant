How do read/interact with an old ActiveX SSUltraGrid using UIAutomation

I am investigating automated testing of an old Win32 application that used ActiveX controls. I am spiking use White (from Thougthworks) that uses Microsoft UIAutomation. I can find the AutomationElement related to the control, but how do I interact with it? Spy++ sees the grid control as a single window, so I can't talk to rows, columns, or cells directly. How do I talk to the SSUltraGrid control from my test code? Cheers Nigel
