you're confounding, a bit, (1) cross-sectional regression and time series regression; and (2) deterministic and stochastic models. Equation (1) is your "core" equation; equation 2, for example, is simply its integral. All other equations are simply restatements from Newtonian mechanics using a different parameterization. So, in eq. #1, you are stating that (1) a is constant (implicitly); (2) u(0) is known; (3) and v(0) is known. It is simple physics then to determine v(t) assuming u(t) is known. In fact, if a(t) is not a constant but known functionally, that, too, can be worked in. It is a very different question to say that u(0) is known only as a random variable and u(t) is the same. (Let's assume a(t) is a constant.) Then you could use regression. To understand what is going on, you must get beyond regression alone, and learn mathematical statistics: the calculus of (formally defined) random variables. Regression can be explained via mathematical statistics, but not the other way round.
