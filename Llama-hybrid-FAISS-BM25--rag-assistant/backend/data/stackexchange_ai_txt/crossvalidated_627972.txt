Why do we choose thresholds for the logistic regression instead of sampling from a Bernoulli with p (output of the LR) probability?

I would like to know what would be the disadvantages of sampling from a Bernoulli with p probability (p being the output of a logistic regression) to generate the binary classification? Choosing a threshold to classify the logistic regression output probability p seems to be the most common approach. I can understand that using ROC to choose a threshold, for example, might help with reasoning about false positive and false negative rates. Thank you in advance for our help.
