I've only worked with LTR languages, and I haven't touched Japanese. With that in mind, here are some of my best practices off the top of my head: Put all language-specific programmatic strings and string fragments into a .resx file (I like to use one .resx file per dialog box), then call on the strings using the auto-generated classes and properties. There shouldn't be any language-specific strings remaining in your code (which means almost no strings in your code, period). A good pattern is to put formatting strings into the .resx as well, since the syntax of a language varies. Set the Localizable property to True on all your forms and make language-specific changes on there directly (use the Language property). Design your forms so that anything that displays language-specific strings will have extra space where needed (note: German is longer than English). IMO, forms should not have to be completely rearranged for a basic change in language -- it may have to be done with a language like Japanese, though. For controls such as labels that need their text dynamically set, set the text on the form so that you know it's only a marker. I use "##" for this, which really stands out. Avoid setting the text to a "sample" of the dynamic text, because you'll never remember which controls get set dynamically by just looking at the form.
