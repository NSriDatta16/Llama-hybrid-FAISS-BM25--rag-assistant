For the developer side of silverlight Visual Studio is all you need. For the designer side Expression Blend is what you will want. Basically the visusl studio designer is read only meaning you have to write all the xaml by hand, blend gives you the ability to drag drop components and generally make creating the UI easier. (When compared to hand coding XAML)
