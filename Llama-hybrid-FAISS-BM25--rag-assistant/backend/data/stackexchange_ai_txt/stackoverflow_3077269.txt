As with most things there are a number of ways of doing it; from the pure code behind which you have as your original question through to the pure client side / jquery templating. Another option would be to have a user control with the html part of the output in. This could have an associated property with the data object assigned to it. You could then access the data in the html you would put somethihng like: Where ever you want that value to appear in the html. So what I'd look to do (not tested as don't have VS installed on this machine) is the following: create a class which will store the data which you will be receiving in json format Create the user control Specifiy a property on the control which takes an instance of your class defined above Add the control onto your aspx page In the code behind of the aspx page set the retrieval and parsing of the json data in the Page_Load event. Still in the Page_Load; assign the newly created instance of the object to the usercontrol property Once this is done when the page renders the user control can access the data and display it through the mechanism (bit of code) above. Hope this helps, been doing a lot of MVC stuff recently so my Web Forms is a little rusty :-) If this doesn't make much sense, I appologise in advance and if you let me know I will try and update the post with some more code examples to try and make it make more sense :-)
