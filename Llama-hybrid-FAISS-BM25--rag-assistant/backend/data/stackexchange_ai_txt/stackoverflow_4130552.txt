How to add a library from the system folders to an Xcode project?

For example, glfw for Max OS installed the library in /usr/local/lib/. Now I want to use it in an Xcode project. I can't seem to add it because Mac Finder has hidden that folder. How do I find it to add? Ideally how do I just paste in an arbitary path somewhere without having to drag files from Finder?
