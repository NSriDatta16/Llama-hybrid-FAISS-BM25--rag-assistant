Logistic regression models dichotomic (e.g. 0/1) variables, while Cox regression models survival times. This means that logistic regression focuses on wheather a patient died within 10 years or not while Cox regression takes into account exact survival time (e.g. 11.5 years). A simple example. Imagine you have 100 men and 100 women in your sample. All men died after 9 years and 360-364 days and all women died after 10 years and 1-5 days. Logistic regression will tell you that sex is significant determinant of 10-years-survival (because all women survived and all men did not). Cox regression will (most probably) tell you that sex is not significant determinant (since women lived only a few days longer than men). Note also, that in Cox regression you have determinants of survival while in logistic regression you have determinants od X-years-survival and you have to choose X.
