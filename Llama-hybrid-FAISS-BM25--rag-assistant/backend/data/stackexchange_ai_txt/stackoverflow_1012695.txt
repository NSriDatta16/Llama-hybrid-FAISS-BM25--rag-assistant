Interactive chart with timeline for WinForms .NET

I'm looking for WinForms .NET interactive chart control that will support timeline. By interactive I mean - something that will allow user to grab a top of a bar and change the value just by dragging it up and down. In some way the bar will behave like a horizontal slider By timeline I mean something that will allow user to scroll vertically browsing back and future data. How do you think, does something like that already exists? Cheers, Stefan
