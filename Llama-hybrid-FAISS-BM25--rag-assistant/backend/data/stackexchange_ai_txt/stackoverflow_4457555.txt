UIImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth doesn't work when drawing to a quartz context

I'm drawing an image with strechable caps defined like the following: [bubbleImg stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:17 topCapHeight:12]; And that was working fine when inside a UIImageView but it doesn't work when drawing the image like the following: CGContextDrawImage(context, CGRectMake(x, y, width, height), image.CGImage); .. which I kind of suspected it wouldn't work. Is there a solution for stretchable cap images when drawing to a CG context?
