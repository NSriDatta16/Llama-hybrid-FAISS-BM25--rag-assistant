You can use bit(1) http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html BOOL is stored in MySQL as TINYINT which would take 1 full byte http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/other-vendor-data-types.html A bit(1) would normally also take 1-byte but if there are multiple bits in a single record, then they get stored in the same byte, up to 8 per byte.
