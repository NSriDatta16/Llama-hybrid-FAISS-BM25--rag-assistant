Correspondence analysis(CA), a variant of PCA, will be the best method for such an analysis. CA involves probabilistic approach. It provides a two-dimensional graphical display (biplot) containing points corresponding to every users and every movies. Same category of users will be placed together. Same movies will be placed together(may be because of genre of films). One can also find the the most liked movies by a user using the concept of inner product of vectors. Code for CA can be found on internet and is easy to use.
