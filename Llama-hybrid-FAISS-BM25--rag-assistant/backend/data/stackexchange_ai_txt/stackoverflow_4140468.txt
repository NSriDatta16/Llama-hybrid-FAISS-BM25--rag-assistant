It is likely that the tutorial you are looking at used an iPhone project template that included Core Data. When you create a new project, most templates have a checkbox option to "Use Core Data for storage". Selecting that option creates three methods in your app delegate to retrieve a managedObjectContext, managedObjectModel and persistentStoreCoordinator. You would access those methods using [self managedObjectContext] etc, like in the tutorial you mention.
