What is the different between using separate view and include all view in a xib

Maybe I clarify my question this way. I want the Window load a view. After I click the MainWindow.xib, I can drag and drop a View in it. The View can make relationship between itself and window. It loads successful. The second way is create a new view Xib. What is different between these two ways? Thz
