That doesn't seem unreasonable. I would have your Bayesian network graph object iterate through each vertex/edge and either ask each component for its XML and add it to the XML object being populated, or pass the to-be-populated XML object (say, a DOM) into the component, and let each component write in its XML If you have an object representing your complete chart, and you don't need to conform to a particular XML format, you could do worse than look at XStream , which may save you a lot of work. It will serialise a complete Java object graph to XML out-of-the-box.
