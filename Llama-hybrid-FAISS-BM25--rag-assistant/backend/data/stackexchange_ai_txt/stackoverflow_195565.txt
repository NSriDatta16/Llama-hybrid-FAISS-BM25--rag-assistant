One example of a pseudo-column is ROWID in Informix. It is a 32-bit number that can be used to find the data page more quickly than any other way (subject to caveats, such as the table is not fragmented) because it is basically the page address for the data. You can do SELECT * FROM SomeTable and it won't show up; you can do SELECT ROWID, * FROM SomeTable and it will show up in your data. Because it is not actually stored on disk (you won't see the ROWID on the disk with the data, though the ROWID tells you where to look on the disk for the data), it is a pseudo-column. There can be other pseudo-columns associated with tables - they tend to be similarly somewhat esoteric. They can also be called hidden columns , particularly if they are (contrary to pseudo-columns) actually stored in the database, but are not selected by * ; you have to specifically request the column to see it.
