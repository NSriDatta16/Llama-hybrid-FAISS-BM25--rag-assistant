You can specify multiple jars in the archive attribute: A JFrame is a top-level container, so you won't be able to add it to your applet. You can have your applet create an instance of your object and let it open its own window. A more flexible approach would be to refactor your object into a JPanel. As a JPanel, it can be added to a JApplet, or to a JFrame if you also want to support running it as an application. Also take a look at JNLP as that lets you deploy your code as an applet or as an application and also provides APIs for printing and local file access. Functionality not available to simple applets.
