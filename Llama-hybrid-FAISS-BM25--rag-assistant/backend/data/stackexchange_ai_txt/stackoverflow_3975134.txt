flex: what is the best way to create multi window web application?

I am using flex4, I am seeking the answer to create multi window web application. My application is some sort of complex, currently I only know using PopupManager to create a new window. Should I create each MXML for each window that I want to instantiate? And then load the mxml and put it into the stage? Is there any tutorial describing that? I want the program modular and easy to manager, extend. The current way I am using is use Group to group up all the controls inside a window, and if user want to open that window, I will display the group and bring it to the front. Is it the right way to do windowing? But I can't support drag. I want to know if there is any native support for draggable window, or dialog? Also till now all the controls are put inside a single mxml file, is it possible to put one window(or one group) to be a separate mxml file?
