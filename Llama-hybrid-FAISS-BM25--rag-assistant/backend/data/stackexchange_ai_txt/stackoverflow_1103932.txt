Version Control: Subversion. You can get the Visual SVN plugin for Visual Studio which is relatively cheap and gives you integration in the IDE. Testing: NUnit w/ Rhino Mocks for mocking. Does everything you need. Automation: MSBuild. It comes out of the box with Visual Studio and can be made to do everything you need. Look at the MSBuild Community Tasks for some extra good plugins. Code Coverage: Both NCover and PartCover work fine. PartCover is free. The old NCover 1.5 is free assuming you can find it, the newer one is too expensive. So try PartCover. Look at the attachments on the site for the MSBuild Task. Continuous Integration: CruiseControl.net is free and fine.
