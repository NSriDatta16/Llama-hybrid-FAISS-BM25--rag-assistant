jQuery UI Sortable and Dialogue

Is it possible to drag jQuery UI Sortable list items between two lists, one of which is in a jQuery UI Dialogue and one which is not? I am trying to create a dialogue where users can drag form fields out of a dialogue into a form which is on the page, but I can't drag the items out of the dialogue border. Thanks in advance Edit It seems that the dragging and droppings is actually working, but you can't see the item once you go beyond the dialogue. This isn't really ideal. (see redsquare's demo ) Another Edit The main div that gets created for the dialogue has overflow:hidden on it. If I disable this in Firebug the dragging works properly, so I guess I could somehow override this, but I suspect that will cause me more problems.
