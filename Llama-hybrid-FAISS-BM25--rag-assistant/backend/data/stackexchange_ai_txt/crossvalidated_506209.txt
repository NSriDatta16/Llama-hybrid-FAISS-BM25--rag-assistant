Depends on many things, but I think generally no, they are not equivalent. By design, GNNs almost always act identically on isomorphic graphs. It would be pretty strange if this wasn't the case, seeing as the point of GNNs are to exploit graph symmetries. By contract, CNNs do not act identically on flipped or rotated images. CNN filters have a notion of up, down, right, left, etc. Therefore in the most straightforward sense, they're not equivalent. Of course you can augment graphs with a notion of neighbor ordering, and maybe design a GNN which takes advantage of this, but that's not the standard use case of GNNs. Here's a quote from one of the foundational works in the area ( fast localized spectral filtering ): The gap in performance may be explained by the isotropic nature of the spectral filters, i.e. the fact that edges in a general graph do not possess an orientation (like up, down, right and left for pixels on a 2D grid).
