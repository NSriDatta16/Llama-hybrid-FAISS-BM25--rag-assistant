A couple thoughts. If you mean system configuration then you can use SMF (Service Management Facility). This provides a service for managing the configuration, inter dependencies, and the running of services. Tracking of changes is easy but I'm not so sure if versioning would be easy to manage. The next to last paragraph makes me think you want to allow the user to make ad hoc changes and have some daemon monitor and store those. That could probably be done with FAM and maybe use of ZFS versioning but that seems like overkill. As far as a better approach. I would tend to use ZFS snapshots or a like mechanism to checkpoint my configuration. And then I would use SMF to manage my configuration. Maintaining versions of the configuration of individual subsystems doesn't quite do it for me. It is the configuration of the whole box that is interesting.
