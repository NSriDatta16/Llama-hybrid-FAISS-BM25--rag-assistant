I can recommend WURFL for this. It's an XML file describing the capabilities of thousands of mobile devices, and combines with APIs available for .NET, Java, PHP, etc, which can recognise which device it is based on the request characteristics (primarily the user-agent header). The web page is a bit chaotic and in sore need of an update, but the database and APIs themselves are very sound.
