Using classification models on censored data?

I have a dataset in which I am trying to predict whether customers default on their loans or do not. One of my variables is called DURATION which indicates the length of time before a person defaulted/did not default. I understand that I can use survival trees and survival analysis to check how many months (in my case) a new loan applicant could go before defaulting. That is not my goal. My goal is to predict whether one, new observation, would default or not. My question: Can I use binary logistic regression, for example, to predict that? Would I need to include the DURATION variable or would I need to drop it? If I keep it, do I need to use an existing method to place less weight on applicants who defaulted sooner rather than later?
