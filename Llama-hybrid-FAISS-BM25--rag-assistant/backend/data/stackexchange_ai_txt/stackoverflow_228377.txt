Could a website force the browser to go into fullscreen mode?

I want to run a psychological study for which participants have to look at large images. The experiment is done on the web and therefore in a browser window. Is it possible to tell the browser to go into fullscreen, for example on button press? I know there is the possibility to open a fixed-size popup window. Do you think this would be a feasable alternative? And if, what would be the best way to do it? Are there elegant ways of detecting a popup-blocker, to fallback and run the study in the original browser window. The main concern is that the participants of this study are not familiar with technical details and should not be bothered by them.
