The HTTP/1.0 RFC 1945 says the Content-Language header field represents "the languages of the intended audience". The Content-Language entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Note that this may not be equivalent to all the languages used within the entity. HTML4 and XHTML1.x treat the meta http-equiv tag as the same information embedded in the html document rather than the HTTP header. On the other hand, xml:lang and the html lang attribute identify the language of the document, or the fragment contained within the element on which the attribute appears. So, suppose you had a document that was primarily in French for the purpose of teaching French to English speakers, the content-language would be en-GB, en-US (say), while the xml:lang attribute would be fr-FR. However , HTML 5 changes this, and the meta http-equiv="content-language" is considered non-conforming HTML which nevertheless defines the document-wide default language, and only supports a single language so is effectively identical to xml:lang on the html element. I can't say I understand the reasoning behind this change but Daniel Glazman and Ian Hickson discuss it at the thread starting at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Nov/0083.html
