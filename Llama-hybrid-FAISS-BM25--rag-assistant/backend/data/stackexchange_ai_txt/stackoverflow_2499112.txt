Flex fixed and variable height - can it be set in markup?

I've got the following Flex application markup: (top menu stuff goes here) (page stuff goes here) When I run it, it displays top panel with a fixed height, and a bottom panel with variable height. I expect the bottom panel's height to contain the remaining height, but it somehow overflows off-page. The only way I found to fix this height issue (so far) is to programmatically set the height to be fixed instead of variable: (page stuff goes here) And code-behind: package { import mx.containers.HBox; import mx.core.Application; import mx.events.ResizeEvent; // (...) public class MyApplicationClass extends Application { public var idBottomContainer:HBox; // (...) private function ON_CreationComplete (event:FlexEvent) : void { // (...) addEventListener(ResizeEvent.RESIZE, ON_Resize); } private function ON_Resize (event:Event) : void { idBottomContainer.height = this.height - idTopContainer.height; } } } But this solution is too "dirty" and I'm looking for a more elegant way. Does anyone know an alternative?
