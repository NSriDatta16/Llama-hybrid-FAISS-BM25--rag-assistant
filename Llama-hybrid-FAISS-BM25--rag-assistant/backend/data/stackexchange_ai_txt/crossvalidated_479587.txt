Interesting question. First of all, classic linear regression was developed for applications where the scatter is normally distributed. If you plot the residual distribution it should have the classic bell shape. When your data adhere to the these model prerequisites, your can just as well use linear regression. The confidence bounds for linear regression predictions are also known, it is advisable that you use these. When your predictor variables come from discrete, or multimodal continuous distributions then you can benefit from a nonparametric classifier. For example the histogram classifier or the K-nearest neighbor classifier can be used. I presuppose that training a neural network for the prediction of $y$ would be somehow 'over-the-top'. So my advice is to let your choice be given by the distributions of your data.
