Allow the user to select and copy text in a TTStyledTextLabel

I'm not sure if this is a Three20 question or general ios/iphone (I'm a noob in both areas.) I'm currently using TTStyledTextLabel in a table view to render styled content. Now I would like to allow the user to select text and copy it. Checking the source for TTSTyledTextLabel I find this: #pragma mark - #pragma mark UIResponderStandardEditActions - (void)copy:(id)sender { NSString* text = _text.rootNode.outerText; UIPasteboard* pasteboard = [UIPasteboard generalPasteboard]; [pasteboard setValue:text forPasteboardType:@"public.utf8-plain-text"]; } Which indicates that the label is ready to help with the actual copying. But I can't figure out how to make it allow for text selection. Any ideas anyone?
