You can easily put SHA-1 of file (to be more exact SHA-1 of blob, i.e. SHA-1 of contents of the file) by using $Id$ keywork and ident gitattribute . If you want to put SHA-1 of commit , there is no out-of-the-box solution, but you can use clean and smudge commands of filter gitattribute . Note that would badly affect performance, as after commit each file would have to be modified to reflect new commit made. Although as said in other answers to this question, you would do better on embedding version number in generated files when building, like e.g. Linux kernel and git project itself do it.
