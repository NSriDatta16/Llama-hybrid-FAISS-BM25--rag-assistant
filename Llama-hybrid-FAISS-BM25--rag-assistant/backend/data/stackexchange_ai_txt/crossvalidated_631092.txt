This topic has been covered to the extreme on this site. Briefly, when either class A or class B are extremely rare, classification is an inappropriate goal because as you have so rightly noted you can just classify everyone as being in the majority category and it would be hard for any classifier to beat the accuracy of doing that. The inappropriateness of classification is discussed in detail here . Instead the goal is to estimate tendencies , i.e., probabilities, using a direct probability model such as binary logistic regression. Probabilities also form the basis for optimum decision making and for withholding action if probabilities are in the gray zone. This is not a Bayesian vs. frequentist issue.
