Advantages: You can link anything to anything quite easily Adaptable relationships help accommodating unforeseen circumstances Very easy to implement relationships Great for ad-hoc systems Disadvantages: Foreign keys not practical Indexes include another dimension of complexity Relationships between tables hard to identify when using STI Database diagramming tools cannot interpret Not always practical for join models Strongly discouraged for systems where data integrity must be verified I'm a big fan of using relationships of this sort for records that are attached to a large number of things as required, for example, a comment or annotation record which may apply to a wide variety of records. It is not very well suited for situations where the relationship is exercised in a JOIN frequently. That is, the polymorphic association should not be in the middle of a relationship between records, but as something on the perimeter.
