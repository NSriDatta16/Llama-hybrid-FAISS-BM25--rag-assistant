This seems to be the paper you are looking for: Min-Ling Zhang and Zhi-Hua Zhou: Multi-Label Neural Networks with Applications to Functional Genomics and Text Categorization From the abstract: In multi-label learning, each instance in the training set is associated with a set of labels, and the task is to output a label set whose size is unknown a priori for each unseen instance.In this paper, this problem is addressed in the way that a neural network algorithm named BP-MLL, i.e. Backpropagation for Multi-Label Learning, is proposed. ... Applications to two real- world multi-label learning problems, i.e. functional genomics and text categorization, show that the performance of BP-MLL is superior to those of some well-established multi-label learning algorithms.
