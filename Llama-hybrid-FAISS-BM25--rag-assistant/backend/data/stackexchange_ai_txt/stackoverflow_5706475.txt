I don't really understand your problem. Obviously refactoring out logic and decision points out of a large method into private methods will decrease cyclomatic complexity of the large methods. This is kind of the point of extracting methods - it makes the large method shorter and simpler, thus hopefully easier to understand and to change. It's not cheating, it's simply making the structure of your program explicit. but does not decrease the effort to get full branch coverage in testing. This seems a non-sequitur to me. Why should factoring out private methods make coverage testing easier? I have never seen anyone claim that. Did you maybe misunderstand something?
