Thoughts on creating a view selector in php

I'm looking to create a nice way to separate view and controller in php. What I'd like to happen is people would go to: localhost/index.php?view=signup and they would see the whole page with a signup box.. and NOT a login box. I'm wondering if anyone has made this before.. I'm specifically looking for a elegant way of letting Javascript handle the hides and shows after php initially loads the page. So maybe something like this: ;"> The trick is that I want the default (localhost/index.php) to display everything. So if ?view=.. is not defined then show it all.. I really don't want to clutter my view with a ton of if statements with isset().. Let me know your solutions to this problem! Thanks, Matt Mueller
