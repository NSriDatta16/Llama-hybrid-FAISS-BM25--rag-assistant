Nemerle and Boo are my personal favorites for such things. Nemerle has a very elegant macro syntax, despite its poor documentation. Boo's documentation is excellent but its macros are a little less elegant. Both work incredibly well, however. Both target .NET, so they can easily interoperate with C# and other .NET languages -- even Java binaries, if you use IKVM. Edit: To clarify, I mean macros in the Lisp sense of the word, not C's preprocessor macros. These allow definition of new syntax and heavy metaprogramming at compiletime. For instance, Nemerle ships with macros that will validate your SQL queries against your SQL server at compiletime.
