This was very helpful to us but I wanted to add to those who find this useful that there is a utility that Microsoft provides with the sdk to read this file. Found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732023.aspx To open a trace file 1.Start Service Trace Viewer by using a command window to navigate to your WCF installation location (C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin), and then type SvcTraceViewer.exe. (although we found ours in \v7.0\Bin) Note: The Service Trace Viewer tool can associate with two file types: .svclog and .stvproj. You can use two parameters in command line to register and unregister the file extensions. /register: register the association of file extensions ".svclog" and ".stvproj" with SvcTraceViewer.exe /unregister: unregister the association of file extensions ".svclog" and ".stvproj" with SvcTraceViewer.exe 1.When Service Trace Viewer starts, click File and then point to Open. Navigate to the location where your trace files are stored. 2.Double-click the trace file that you want to open. Note: Press SHIFT while clicking multiple trace files to select and open them simultaneously. Service Trace Viewer merges the content of all files and presents one view. For example, you can open trace files of both client and service. This is useful when you have enabled message logging and activity propagation in configuration. In this way, you can examine message exchange between client and service. You can also drag multiple files into the viewer, or use the Project tab. See the Managing Project section for more details. 3.To add additional trace files to the collection that is open, click File and then point to Add. In the window that opens, navigate to the location of the trace files and double-click the file you want to add. Also, as for the filtering of the log file, we found these this link extremely helpful: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751526.aspx
