how to know which is the last TCP segment received by the server when data is transferring?

When transferring data in TCP, and given all the incoming and outcoming packets, how will one know if the packet received is the last of the data? TCP packets are fragmented into smaller parts. I'm transferring over the HTTP protocol.
