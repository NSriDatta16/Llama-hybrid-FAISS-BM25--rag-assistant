Pairwise exclusions

I am running a logistic model on insurance data. I have a field agent gender which matters for a channel A (say) and doesn't matter for B. I want to put null values in case of B. The only thing I risk is exclusion by SAS (as SAS excludes every missing case by default). I heard that pairwise exclusion can solve my problem. Please tell me the following: What is the difference between normal exclusion and pairwise exclusion? How to do this is SAS? What is listwise exclusion?
