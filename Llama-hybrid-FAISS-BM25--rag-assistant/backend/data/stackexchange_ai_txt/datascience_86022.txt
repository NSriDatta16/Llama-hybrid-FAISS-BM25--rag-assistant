Are there any control-flow/conditional statements in AI/ML models?

I was recently asked this during an interview. When we write a C program, it has a control-flow in the form of conditional statements like if , while , for that executes a condition, and that decides how the control flows through the application. In AI/ML models, e.g. CNNs like ResNet , I don't see any control-flow (either static or dynamic). It's just a series of consecutive convolution layers. So, where are these control-flow/conditional statements in AI domain? What do they look like? Which models have them? Any examples?
