Parser, Generator for Java with the following requirements

I am looking for a parser generator for Java that does the following: My language project is pretty simple and only contains a small set of tokens. Output in pure READABLE Java code so that I can modify it (this why I wouldn't use ANTLR) Mature library, that will run and work with at least Java 1.4 I have looked at the following and they might work: JavaCC, jlex, Ragel?
