The present does depend on, and the future will depend on, whatever is past. Without dependence, yesterday's temperature would have no possible bearing on today's and this year's sales would have no possible bearing on next year's sales. That is true more broadly on many time scales, from astronomical or geological changes to short-term issues such as predicting tomorrow's weather or next year's economy. Translated into statistical terms, the overwhelming pattern is one of dependence in time series. Naturally, it is often expected or hoped that the main structure of dependence can be caught by some fairly simple pattern of say trend, seasonality and the results of recent inputs. Conversely, time series analysis is often tricky if only because the future can be very unlike the past (qualitative changes can overwhelm quantitative changes) and because we may know little about a system beyond some data on its recent outputs and some fuzzy notions about its internal operations. Around 1900 there were many dire predictions that the increasing use of horses for transport in cities would overwhelm the means to cope with their direct and indirect consequences (stabling, feeding, accidents, waste removal, ...). Rise the internal combustion engine, and new worries emerged as the old problems faded away. There are many different mechanisms underlying this, including memory, inertia or momentum in strict or broad senses and phenomena of growth or decay or decline. Anticipatory behaviour is also important: buying presents or anything else ahead of the time you need them is standard at any scale from individual to international. In that sense the future can influence the present. Independent noise does have a part to play in time series analysis, however, largely as a way to trying to mimic detailed variability that can't be explained otherwise.
