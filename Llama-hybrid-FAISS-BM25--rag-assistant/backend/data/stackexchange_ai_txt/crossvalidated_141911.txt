PCA is sometimes used to correct problems caused by collinear variables so that most of the variation in the X space is captured by the K principal components. But this mathematical problem is of course not the same as capturing most of variation both in X, Y space in such way that unexplained variation is as small as possible. Partial least squares tries to do this in the latter sense: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression
