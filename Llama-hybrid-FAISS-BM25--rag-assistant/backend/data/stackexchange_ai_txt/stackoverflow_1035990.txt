How do I implement a real time *financial* statistics engine from SQL server data for dashboard display?

We currently use excel automation to calculate time series statistics and store the results in our SQL Server 2008 database for easy display/sorting/etc. later. I'm currently redesigning the home screen of our app to present the most important information (as identified by the team using the app) in dashboard form. I'd like the display to be realtime. Data isn't added often but does requires some serious data crunching. Once the UX is designed where do I go for implementation? Server side, client side? F# looks like a great language for this type of data crunching and I'm willing to hire a developer but have to think there are other tools we can employ before going this route. Thanks for your suggestions.
