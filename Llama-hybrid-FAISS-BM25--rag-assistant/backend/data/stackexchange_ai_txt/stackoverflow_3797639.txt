Remap RagTag Shortcuts Vim

I just switched to vim as my default editor and I am trying to remap the ragtag shortcuts for , and auto-close tag to custom shortcuts: E.g. the ragtag shortcut for is =. I tried to remap with: inoremap , = But this just prints the = sign to the current buffer. And there does not seem to be ragtag function I could call. Any ideas?
