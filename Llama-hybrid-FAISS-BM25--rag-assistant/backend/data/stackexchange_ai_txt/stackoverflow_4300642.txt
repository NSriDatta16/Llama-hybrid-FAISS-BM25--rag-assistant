YUI storage module answer is a great option. Otherwise, you're going to have to change the behaviour of the authentication logic which automatically redirects you to the login page. You would have to store the posted values in some temporary server-side location, and re-post those values after the user logs in. Another option would be to authenticate the user via a dynamic HTML login form and Ajax before actually submitting the form. Either way it changes the authentication logic of your application a lot. Actually, I think the root of the problem is that you're presenting the user with a form which requires authentication to use before they are authenticated. I think you should either force the user to authenticate before presenting them with the form, or don't require authentication for posting the form (which probably isn't a good idea).
