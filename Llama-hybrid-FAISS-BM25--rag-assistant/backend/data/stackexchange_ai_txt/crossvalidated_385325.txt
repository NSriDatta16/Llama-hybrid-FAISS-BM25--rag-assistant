ARIMA model with measurement error

I'm interested in forecasting a time series $m_t$ which is contaminated with measurement error $e_t$ , so the observed time series is $y_t = m_t + e_t$ . I can suppose $m_t$ and $e_t$ are independent and $e_t$ is basically white noise. The question is, if I fit an ARIMA model to $y_t$ , forecasts will be of $y_t$ or of $m_t$ ?
