WPF: Drag/Drop to re-order grid and jiggle

I need to implement a grid in WPF which has squares that can be dragged/dropped to be re-ordered, but I'm not sure the best way to do it. I was thinking using an ObservableCollection of squares and a UniFormGrid but although I have experience with both WPF and drag/drop, ideally I'd like to do a kind of 'jiggle' when before the user releases the mouse. Any suggestions on a good starting point?
