tl;dr The $n$ in the fluctuation interval is the number of simulations. Background The idea behind the fluctuation interval is quite simple: in every simulation, you count +1 when the test has rejected your null hypothesis. Otherwise, you don't count (+ 0). So, you keep a variable $S$ that initially is set to zero and gets incremented with each rejection of a null hypothesis. the simulations are independent of each other. as a result, the sum has a binomial distribution, $S\sim\text{Bin}(n, p)$ , where $n$ is the number of simulations, and $p$ is the probability of actually rejecting the null hypothesis. For large $n$ , like the $n=1000$ simulations, you can safely approximate the binomial distribution with a normal distribution, and assume $ S\sim \text{N}(np, np(1-p)).$ Now, you are not really interested in the sum $S$ , but in your estimator for the rejection probability, which is $\hat{p}=S/n$ . This has, in good approximation, a normal distribution: $$ \hat{p}\sim \text{N}(p, p(1-p)/n). $$ That normal distribution implies that about 95% of all outcomes for $\hat{p}$ would lie within the fluctuation interval: $$ \text{Prob}\big(p - 1.96\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}\leq \hat{p}\leq p + 1.96\sqrt{p(1-p)/n} \big) = 0.95. $$ Length of fluctuation interval The length of the fluctuation interval depends both on the number $n$ of simulations and on the true probability $p$ . This probability, in turn, depends on the nominal level $\alpha$ of the test, and on the sample size, when the simulations are from an alternative model (not the null hypothesis), and on a possibly wrong size of the test (size of test = true rejection probability under the null hypothesis). Tacit independence assumption The fluctuation interval is based on the assumption that the simulation results are independent . This is not always the case; for example, when the simulation uses MCMC output from one chain. Then the results can be positively correlated. In such cases, the $n$ in the formula for the interval should be corrected and replaced by the effective number of simulations $n_{\text{eff}}$ , if available. When there is positive correlation, $n_{\text{eff}}$ is smaller than $n$ , and the fluctuation interval using the actual number of simulations would be too optimistically short in that case.
