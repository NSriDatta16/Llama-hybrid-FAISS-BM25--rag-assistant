Arbitrary noise generation

lets say I have some noise time series and I want to sample random numbers from the same underlying distribution as this time series. An easy algorithm I have found online is basically you take the noise time series, fourier transform it, randomize the phase (by multiplying by uniform phase variation), then inverse fourier transform. Unfortunately I can't seem to find where I found this algorithm, and I don't really understand why it would work. I would think that by randomizing the phase you could distort important features of the noise time-series, such as the position of potential maxima or minima (i.e., you might be more sensitive over a certain period than another period). Any help rectifying this confusion would be greatly appreciated.
