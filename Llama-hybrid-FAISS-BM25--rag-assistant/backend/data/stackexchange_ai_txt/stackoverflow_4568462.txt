Regarding Apache and Nginx: I used Apache for almost 10 years. Then I discovered Nginx. Quickly I found Nginx appealing simple and powerful C code configuration syntax is intuitive and elegant Nginx was built with performance and efficiency in mind. It is incredibly efficient, even with thousands of connections. php-fpm works well with Nginx So, I would recommend, between the two (Apache and Nginx), Nginx.
