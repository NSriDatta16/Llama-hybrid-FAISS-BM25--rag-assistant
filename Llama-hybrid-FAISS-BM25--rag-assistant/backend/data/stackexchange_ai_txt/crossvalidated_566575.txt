(This is a very rough thought still, please take it with a grain of salt) Averaging is a viable strategy against random uncertainty, i.e. variance. OTOH, if the dominating problem of the situation is bias, a selection approach may work. In practice, the situation may be even more blurred by the additional random uncertainty/variance that stems from judging the "health" of the model with only a limited number of independent cases (for the data I work with, number of idependent cases is often I'd therefore make the arguement the other way round compared to your example (and rather go in the specification direction Frank Harrell brought to your attention): selection (for low bias) has the prerequisite that variance uncertainty must be low.
