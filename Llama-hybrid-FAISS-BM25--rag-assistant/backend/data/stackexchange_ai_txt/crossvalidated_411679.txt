You did nothing wrong ! ...you probably just didn't read the fine print or understand the assumptions underlying the statistical test you were employing. See Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? for @AdamO's wise reflection that "The correlogram should be calculated from residuals using a model that controls for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual autoregressive effect." In other words for auto.arima to be useful you needed to have the following circumstances. 1) a series with no pulses,level shifts,seasonal pulses or deterministic time structure like trends or day-of-the-week effects or day-of-the-month effects or holiday effects et al . 2) a series where the parameters for the underlying arima model are constant over time 3) a series where the error variance of the underlying arima model does not change deterministically at different time points. Your time series like most have 1 or more of these possible violations, clearly a level/step shift seems to be present BUT only your data knows for sure . If you post your data I will try and help further. More interesting reading (13) is here https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A3382+AdamO
