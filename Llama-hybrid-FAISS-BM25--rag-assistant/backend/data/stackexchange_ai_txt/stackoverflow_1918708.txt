Not 100% sure, given that I do not have your setup to make tests, but it looks like you are experiencing this issue . On comment #16 Merlin of Chaos (the author of views) provides a patch that subsequent comments seem to confirm as "working". If that is not the case, a workaround could be for you to sort nodes instead of grouping them. You could add the grouping header by passing to the template also the node type value: you then would add the header with the type of content by comparing with the previous one. In pseudo-code: $type_in_use = 'xxx' if $type_of_next_node != $type_in_use then $type_in_use = $type_of_next_node print_header($type_in_use) Just an inelegant workaround, but should work! HTH
