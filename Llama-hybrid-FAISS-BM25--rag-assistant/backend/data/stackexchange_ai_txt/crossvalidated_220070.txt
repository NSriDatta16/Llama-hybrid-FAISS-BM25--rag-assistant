Opinions about a book is always subjective. I personally liked both books Applied Predictive Modeling by Kuhn and Johnson An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie (ISL) I like ISL better since it explains more statistic knowledge than applications. In addition, the PLUS version ESL is one of the best books in machine learning. And if you are getting familiar with the notation in ISL book, you can get deeper by looking at the ESL book. The Applied Predictive Modeling seems no too much math but a lot of applications, you can play with the R CARET library to learn it quickly. My suggestion, want to go deeper? read the ISL book then ESL book. If you just want to roughly understand what are predictive models, play with R CARET library on UCI data or check some Kaggle Scripts .
