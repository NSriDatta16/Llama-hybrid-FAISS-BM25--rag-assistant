How to draw a random sample from distribution of prediction?

For my microsimulation, I want to use R to predict values and draw a random sample based on this prediction. To clarify my point: I want to simulate the number of chronic conditions people suffer from ($y_t$) at a certain point in time. I have a few waves of panel data available to estimate a relation between age, sex, number of chronic conditions in the previous observation period (plus some others that I might include in later stages). Suppose my regression model is $y_t = β_0 + β_1 age + β_2 sex + β_3y_{t-1} +u $. Since R provides me with coefficients for the betas, it is easy to predict $y_t$ given the independent variables. However, this is not what I want to do. Instead, I want my population of about 1300 individuals to resemble the variance in the possible outcomes of $y_t$ (otherwise after a few steps my simulated population won’t include those unlucky ones with much more chronic conditions than the average). I believe what I have to do is to draw a random sample from the distribution of the predicted value $y_t$, conditional on the independent variables. I further believe this can be done by drawing random numbers with mean $β$ and variance $var(β)$, multiplied by the actual values of the independent variables. So my question is: Is this the correct approach? Will this produce reliable values? Or do I need to take possible covariation of the independent variables etc. into consideration? Edit : Another point came to my mind. Does it make a difference whether $y_t$ or $y_t - y_{t-1}$ is my left hand side variable? Thank you for your ideas.
