connecting sortable lists disallowing sorting on the first list jQuery

I don't know if this is possible but I want to do a few things, I have 2 sortable lists that are connected. I don't want to sort the first list, but I need the items to be able to be dragged into the 2nd list. Here is my code $(document).ready(function() { $( "#webappsearchresults12267, #portfolio-ul" ).sortable({ helper: 'clone', connectWith: ".connect", scroll: false, tolerance: 'intersect', stop: function(){ var order = $("#portfolio-ul").sortable('toArray'); $("#CAT_Custom_196863").val(order); } }) }); item-1 item-2 item-3 item-4 item-5 item-6 I have also an option for cloning the item I pick up from the first list... "helper: 'clone'," doesn't appear to be working for me, Anyone any ideas? I might not be looking at a sortable list solution but rather drag and drop.. with a sortable list for the 2nd list. Any ideas?
