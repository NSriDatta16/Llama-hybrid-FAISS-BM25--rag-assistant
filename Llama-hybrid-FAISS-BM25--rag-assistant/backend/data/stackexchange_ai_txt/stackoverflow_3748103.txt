If you're looking to push static images and a lot of them, you may want to look at some basics first. Your application should ensure that all correct headers are being passed, Cache-Control and Expires for example. That should result in the clients browsers caching those images locally and cutting down on your request count. Use a CDN (if it's in your budget), this brings the images closer to your clients (generally) and will result in a better user experience for them. For the CDN to be a productive investment you'll again need to make sure all your necessary caching headers are properly set, as per the point I made in the previous paragraph. After all that if you are still going to use a reverse proxy, I recommend using nginx in proxy mode, over Varnish and squid. Yes Varnish is fast, and as fast as nginx, but what you're wanting to do is really quite simple, Varnish comes into it's own when you want to do complex caching, and ESI. So Keep It Simple, Stupid. nginx will do your job very nicely indeed. I have no experience with Tux, so I can't comment on it sorry.
