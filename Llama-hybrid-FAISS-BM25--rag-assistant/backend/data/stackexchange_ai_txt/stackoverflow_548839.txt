How to maintain several translations of a documentation set written with Sphinx?

I am starting a personal project and I'd like to provide documentation for my French speaking fellows as well as for the English speaking others. So how should I organize my directories? What to separate (I guess sources, some conf items like language for generated navigation links...)? What not to separate (a maximum of configuration items to avoid duplication)?
