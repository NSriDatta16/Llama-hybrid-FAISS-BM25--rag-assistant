The answer seems to me to be no. It seems as if you are associating integer with ordinal as you have stated that the number 25 is "ordinal". By counter example: > myOrganization mean(myOrganization) [1] 2.272727 That is, the mean rank is no longer an integer. Update, replying to comments I agree my above response is a triviality based on an interpretation of your representation of a (logical/mathematical) system. If you want an answer that is representation invariant you may have to move from math/statistics to formal logic. Baring my suspicion that your question is a tautological truth, you may want to look at Godel's incompleteness theorems . While I am not an expert on formal logic, I believe these theorems would support the answer is no; within any representation you choose there will be operations that are inconsistent with your described logical/mathematical system. Alternatively, It sounds like you may be asking a question about sets that are closed to group operations (in your case ordinal measurements which can be identified with the natural numbers and you are asking whether the set is closed to any "meaningful" operation on the set). In this case you may want to look at the concept of a semi-group which is the minimal algebraic structure that guarantees this behavior (groups, monoids, vector spaces, etc... are all on some level semi-groups). NOTE: Viewed in this light, my above "counter-example" associates all ordinal measurements with the set of natural numbers and then shows that the arithmetic mean is an operation that this set is not closed to (hence not a semi-group). That said, if your answer is that this is simply a non-meaningful operation, I would then suggest that your question is tautological because you are associating "meaningful" with some concept related to semi-groups. Even another option: (I am just trying to understand your question and respond appropriately). If we say myOrganization1 and myOrganization1 you may be asking are the new variables myOrganization1 and myOrganization2 "ordinal". The answer is that it depends on the operation you choose to define what ordering is. "Ordinal" refers to data that is equipped with an "comparison" operation $f: f(x,y) \rightarrow x?y$ where $?$ can take on the following values $ $ (e.g., less than, less or equal, equal, greater or equal, greater than). So again, it is a tautological question that depends on your chosen comparison operation.
