What are good options for Windows GUI toolkits for a Perl program?

I am considering doing some automation of tasks on my Windows desktop (e.g. sorting through large collections of music/text/photo files, etc...). Seeing how my main area of developer expertise is Perl on Unix, I'd prefer to stick to Perl for coding the business logic of whatever I need done, just for the sake of development efficiency. The question is, if I want to slap some GUI on top of the work (ala Perl::Tk on Unix), what are my GUI toolkit options and which one would you recommend using? Please note that I'd like this question to be a good learning opportunity to other SO users, so I would welcome ANY answers even if they don't necessarily satisfy my own limitations/needs listed below, although notes elaborating on how your solution relates to these considerations would be very welcome. My considerations are mostly driven by the fact that I want a quickly developed tool for personal use to save myself time on tasks I now do manually. Main consideration is Perlishness of development - "Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible" as a Perl slogan goes. Especially the first part :) Prefer (but not insist) to be as native as possible as far as components used. E.g. rather re-use Windows' file open dialog vs. having some custom Java dialog. I would prefer to use something that would have a small learning curve (e.g. no need to learn intricacies of OLE/COM), since the goal here is speedy development of tools I need to simplify my life as opposed to developer education which I concentrate on areas more relevant to my day job :). But I definitely would love to get exposure to something new/cool while doing this, e.g. if some nice Monad based GUI components are suggested I'm definitely curious. Performance matters (e.g. I may need to display a directory listing with >10000 files), but is not of paramount concern - I am a pretty good GUI designer and developer and can always architect my app and design a GUI to scale well if needed). I would strongly prefer (though not insist on) a framework that does not force me to compile stuff. e.g. Perl libraries are more preferable to custom Java stuff I need to compile. But if the framework is perfect in all other respects, I'm open to a compiled solution (as long as it doesn't required me to purchase Visual Studio or somesuch - I want to build a Windows GUI front-end for personal use, not invest in becoming a Windows developer). I'm pretty open and flexible outside of above constraints. Some ActivePerl/Strawberry Perl libraries, MS PowerShell based components - heck, if nothing better shows up I'll just install Apache on my PC and build a web front-end :)
