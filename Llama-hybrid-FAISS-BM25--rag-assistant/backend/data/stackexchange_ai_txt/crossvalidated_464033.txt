A single LSTM layer is typically used to turn sequences into dense, non-sequential features. These are the states at the end of the RNN loop. This step basically turns sequence data into tabular data. Sometimes, one LSTM layer is not capable to compress the sequential information well enough. In such cases, you just let the LSTM layer not only return the last state in its loop but the states at all iterations. In this case, you get a dense representation of your input for each time step . This new, sequential output can be fed into the next LSTM layer.
