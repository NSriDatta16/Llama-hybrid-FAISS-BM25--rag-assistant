Odds of Ratio of 1 in logistic regression

I'm working with a dataset from Gapminder (www.gapminder.org), and I've been running some logistic regressions. As I understand it, if you get an Odds Ratio of exactly 1, then then interpretation is that there cannot be a significant difference. However, in the model I also get a p-value of 0.0010 which suggests significance. Is this possible, or (more likely) have I misspecified something?
