Option C would be to parse access logs from the web server. No extra storage needed, all sorts of extra information is stored, and even requests to images and JavaScript files are stored. .. However, if you just want to track visits to pages where you run your own code, I'd definitely go for Option A , unless you're expecting extreme amounts of traffic on your site. That way you can create overviews per hour of the day, and store more information than just the timestamp (like the visited page, the user's browser, etc.). You might not need that now, but later on you might thank yourself for not losing that information. If at some point the table grows too large, you can always think of ways on how to deal with that.
