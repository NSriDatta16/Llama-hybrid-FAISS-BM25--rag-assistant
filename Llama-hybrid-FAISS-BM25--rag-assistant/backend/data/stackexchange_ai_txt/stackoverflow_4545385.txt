I've tested it by setting up a webserver on my mac. The difference when starting the site from a webclip is, that mobile safari sends out additional requests for the homescreen icon: GET /apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.0.2.1 User-Agent: MobileSafari/6533.18.5 CFNetwork/485.12.7 Darwin/10.4.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: de-de Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Other observed requests are: GET /apple-touch-icon-57x57.png HTTP/1.1 GET /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png HTTP/1.1 GET /apple-touch-icon.png HTTP/1.1 You could check for those GET-Requests on the server. I don't know if this happens everytime when clicking the webclip or only once.
