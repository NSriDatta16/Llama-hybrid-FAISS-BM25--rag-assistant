For a categorical variable that is not nominal, a logistic regression will output coefficients to a One Hot Encoded version of it. Therefore the logic remains the same: there will be a coefficient for "Caucasian" / "Not caucasian", another for "Hispanic" / "Not hispanic" and so on. The encoding makes it impossible to have "Caucasian" and "Hispanic" at the same time.
