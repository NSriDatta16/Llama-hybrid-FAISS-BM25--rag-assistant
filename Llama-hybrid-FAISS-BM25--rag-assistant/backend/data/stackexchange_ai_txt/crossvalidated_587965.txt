"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." Carl Sagan. The null hypothesis specifies no effect, that is absence of effect. You reject the null if the results are statistically significant, that is, when you have evidence for rejecting the null. If the results are not statistically significant, what you have is absence of evidence.
