If your goal is to show in Results your team is above average, but in Accountability you need improvement then one way would be normalization, and showing percentage. That is, the team doing 130% of the mean on Results but just 50% of the mean on Accountability. Something like that: The relation there will be team/mean - 1 Also, to see how data can be efficiently represented, check out the book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information Beware, however, that this method compresses information. As @whuber noted in comments, you lose ability to compare variability of the data. Also, you lose comparative information: how much your company as a whole performs on different metrics ("you have better conflict than accountability")
