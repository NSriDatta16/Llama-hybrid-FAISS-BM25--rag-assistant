ANOVA with two repeated measures/within subjects factors

We are working on a BOLD fMRI study with a visual stimulation block design. Participants get to see 4 visual stimuli categories in blocks. Each participant belongs to one out of three "experimental" groups. The variable of interest/DV is the peik height of the hemodynamic response measured by fMRI. This peik height value for every subject is acquired for a range of brain structures. Therefore I assume the following RM-ANOVA design : Dependent variable: peik height between subjects: group (3 levels) within subjects/repeated factors: stimulus (4 stimuli), brainstructure (regions of interest selected by literature) There are no missing values. Data is organized in wide format. My questions: Can I use an RM-ANOVA design with two repeated factors in my case? How many levels may a repeated factor have? Is there a limit based on sample size or something else? Since there is no specialised post-hoc for RM-factors: may I use the ordinary paired t-test?
