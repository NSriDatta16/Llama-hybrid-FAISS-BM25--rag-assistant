Degrees of freedom in a simultaneous confirmatory factor analysis

I am performing a simultaneous confirmatory factor analysis to check whether the items of a survey refer to intended separate underlying concepts without cross loading on the concepts. Since I am doing this in the context of a course on SEM, I am also paying attention to how this is estimated by the software. I learned that the model should not be under-identified, where there are more parameters to estimate than there is information available, i.e. the model is more complex than the data. Now what I think is, that my model is under-identified, however, the lavaan package in R has no problem fitting it, and suggests there are even 38 more degrees of freedom. My model looks like this: The variables with an asterisk are ordinal manifest variables which are turned into continuous latent response variables. This is the model specification in R: TP.cfa If I count correctly there are 25 pieces of information available: 3 for the 3 continuous manifest variables {k(k+1)/2}, and 22 proportions for the ordinal manifest variables (6 of these have 4 response categories, 2 have 3 categories, and for one ordinal variable c-1 proportions are unique information). Lavaan estimates 53 parameters: 6 covariances, 7 factor loadings, 3 intercepts, 22 thresholds and 15 variances. Now my question is, would R be able to estimate the model, even if it is under-identified? Or do I really have an over-identified model, with 38 degrees of freedom, and then where do these come from?
