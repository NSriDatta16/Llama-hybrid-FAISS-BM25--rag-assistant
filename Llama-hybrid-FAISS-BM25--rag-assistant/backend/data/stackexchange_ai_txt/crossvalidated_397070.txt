When using multiple classes in segmentation, one must pay attention to the classes' representation in the data-set. The first thing to do would be to check the confusion matrix and see if the class that's falling behind gets confused with another class. If it is confused with a particular class then the issue is probably coming for the data set. However, if the class representation seem correct, you should check out the model itself. I've worked with a similar U-net model for the same purpose and have used a manually weighted L2-loss and it seemed to do the trick. Maybe you can try that. Another thing you can try out is to load encoder weights (for resnet50) pre-trained on ImageNet (They can be found online), this will ease your model recognition of the said class. Hope this can help !
