Reason behind a JavaScript parsing error in MSIE 8

Given something like var obj = { foo: function(){ try{ doSomething(); }catch(ex){ //@TODO - report error } } } MSIE 8 would throw up a "Missing semi-colon on line #" which was where the @TODO was. After I sed'd the dozens of @TODO's to be !TODO, MSIE was able to properly parse the script and life went on. Am I missing something here, does MSIE use some sort of non-standard mechanism like //@PRAGMA ? Googling for @TODO or //@ didn't bring up anything useful.
