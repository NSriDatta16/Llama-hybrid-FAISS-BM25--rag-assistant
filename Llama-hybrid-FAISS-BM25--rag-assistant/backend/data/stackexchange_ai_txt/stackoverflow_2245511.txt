HTML Document Naming for site sub-pages in sub-directories

I'm working on a site redesign, and part of the task at hand is the structure of the site. Currently the site uses a CMS called Kintera that gives tragically unusable URLs (the site is http://www.helpcurenow.org ). Part of the initial strategy we are approaching is the structure of the redesign. Our plan is to have a subdirectory for each sub category page of the website. Such as: http://www.helpcurenow.org/hospitals http://www.helpcurenow.org/hospitals/domincan-republic http://www.helpcurenow.org/about http://www.helpcurenow.org/about/meet-the-management http://www.helpcurenow.org/media http://www.helpcurenow.org/donate etc. The question I have is how should I name the main sub-pages in each directory. The options would be something like http://www.helpcurenow.org/hospitals/index.html or instead, http://www.helpcurenow.org/hospitals/hospitals.html , keeping in mind primarily SEO and usability. FYI, the actual redesign mockup is at: http://blog.helpcurenow.org/test/redesignMockup/index.html
