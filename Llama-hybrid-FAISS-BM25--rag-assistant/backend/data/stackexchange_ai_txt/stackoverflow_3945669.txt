In this case you know it's a bug in the text view, so you'd look at gtk+/gtk/gtktextview.c and then start following the source out to other related files. This particular bug is essentially unfixable though. Each paragraph is rendered as a single PangoLayout and PangoLayout doesn't really support processing only part of a single paragraph. The best fix might be in GEdit to throw an error or insert line breaks or something.
