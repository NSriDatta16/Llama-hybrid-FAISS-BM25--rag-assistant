Displaying paragraphs in table style without tables

Quick question about some CSS. I've had this page that was coded with tables and I would now like to transition it to CSS. The table has pictures and contact info for a list of people, so it was put in a 2x2 table (there are four people). Now there are four paragraphs filled with the information that I need, I just need to lay them out in the correct order. Currently they are all of the same class, would it help to add ids to all of them?
