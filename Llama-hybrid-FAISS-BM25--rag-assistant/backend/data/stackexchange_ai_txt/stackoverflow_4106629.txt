If possible, I would try a honeypot approach to this one. It will be invisible to most users, and will discourage many bots, though none that are determined to work, as they could implement special code for your site that just skipped the honeypot field once they figure out your game. But it would take a lot more attention by the owners of the bot than is probably worth it for most. There will be tons of other sites accepting spam without any additional effort on their part. One thing that gets skipped over from time to time is it is important to let the bot think that everything went fine, no error messages, or denial pages, just reload the page as you would for any other user, except skip adding the bots content to the site. This way there are no red flags that can be picked up in the bots logs, and acted upon by the owner, it will take much more scrutiny to figure out you are disallowing the comments.
