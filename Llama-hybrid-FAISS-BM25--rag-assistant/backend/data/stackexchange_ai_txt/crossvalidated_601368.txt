What R code should be used to learn if there is a significant difference between two predictor variables in the way they affect a response variable?

I am trying to learn if Extraversion affects how people follow COVID-19 guidelines when stratified by male/female gender. The data is set up so Extraversion is the predictor variable, guideline compliance is the response variable, and the data are stratified by gender. I tried to create two models for each gender and then put them through an ANOVA (this is what ChatGPT recommended). But, R didn't like that saying "models were not all fitted to the same size of dataset". I think the issue is that there are way more females than males in the sample. Also, I would like to use another method to find a significant difference between the two model's results because each model follows the Poisson distribution and ANOVA only likes normal distributions. dplyr::filter(Q34 == "Male") dataFemale % dplyr::filter(Q34 == "Female") poisson_male ```
