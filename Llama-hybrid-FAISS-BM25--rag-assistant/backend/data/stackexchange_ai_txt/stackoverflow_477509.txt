How to use NSString drawInRect to center text?

How can I draw a NSString centered within a NSRect ? I've started off with: (an extract from the drawRect method of my custom view) NSString* theString = ... [theString drawInRect:theRect withAttributes:0]; [theString release]; Now I'm assuming I need to set up some attributes. I've had a look through Apple's Cocoa documentation, but it's a bit overwhelming and can't find anything for how to add paragraph styles to the attributes. Also, I can only find horizontal alignment, what about vertical alignment?
