There's no standard show_my_div function in PHP or JavaScript. You'd have to post the content of that function for anyone to help you with it. Outputting a div is easy in PHP: echo " content "; Similarly, it's easy in JavaScript to create a div element and append it to something. Here's raw JavaScript to append a div to the end of the page: var div = document.createElement('div'); div.innerHTML = "The content of the div"; document.body.appendChild(div); You can append elements anywhere, not just at the end. For instance, suppose I have a div with the id foo : ...and I want to add a paragraph to the end of it: var p, div; div = document.getElementById('foo'); if (div) { // (Just being defensive) p = document.createElement('p'); p.innerHTML = "The text of the paragraph"; div.appendChild(p); } These things are made easier if you use a JavaScript library like Prototype , jQuery , Closure , or any of several others to smooth out browser differences and give you some syntactic sugar.
