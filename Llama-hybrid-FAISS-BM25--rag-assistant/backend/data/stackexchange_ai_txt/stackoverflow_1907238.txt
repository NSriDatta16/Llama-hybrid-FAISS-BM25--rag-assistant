You can't avoid "deleted" messages if you delete things from a repository :-) What you should have probably done (although it would now require some fairly major tree surgery) is replaced all of the files from ProjectName with those from ProjectName v2.0. If you started v2.0 while still working on v1, then you'd need to branch at the point you started 2.0. All in all, it would be fairly awkward to try to fix, especially if commits need splitting or re-organising, and if there's no clear path between v1 and v2.
