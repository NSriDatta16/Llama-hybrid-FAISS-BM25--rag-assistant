Need a guide on Spring Front Controller and Bean Concept

I am following the spring MVC tutorial and also reading this article on mvc design patterns http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/frontman.html Hence I am trying to make an app with like this, that make use of spring mvc structures and frontController design pattern. 1. frontController with the DispatcherServlet from spring, that redirect and handles requests as setup by routing in the (servlet_name)-servlet.xml 2. setup some business logic objects that make up of Beans and TO classes. some questions there 1. as the dispatchservlet only take one controller for one form action, does it mean i need to implement each action a controller? would there be some more elegant ways? 2. I would also need pointers with setting up a security filter for authentication for all pages
