Why don't you start slightly less ambitiously? Google has a large team working on their calendar and for you to hope to replicate that without taking years will just end up with an unfinished project. 1 You said you didn't like FullCalendar but it does support 95% of the features you need from the calendar, minus actually clicking on days to add events. FullCalendar is great for displaying events, but it isn't a complete solution for event content-management. Beyond dragging an event to a different time/day, you cannot change an event's name or other associated data. It is up to you to add this functionality through FullCalendar's event hooks You get a dayClick event which you could use to add an event. I wouldn't bother though going this route though, and simply have a separate panel on the page with a text box for the name, a small icon which makes a Jquery UI calendar appear. It sounds low-tech but the pain of getting the click event working in all browsers would be a big task. This textbox displays the full event name when you click on day which gets around your long text cropping issue. Alternatively this shows you a nice static html iCal-like solution which you may have looked at already. Generating a month calendar for the year could be done statically using HTML instead of using jQuery. 2 If you stick to the iCalendar format for Outlook and Google, which both support it, then it's very easy to write a parser for that format as it's such a simple text format. This question has more details on making one, you could use an existing library for it. 3 A simple table of equivalent SQL types like below will be enough: Events Id Name Location DateTime Start DateTime End bool IsRecurring Recurring events will be the hardest part because of the calculations you have to perform to work out the next event. You don't store each occurrence in the database. Using the epoch for the calculations might help out, it's a technique Exchange uses.
