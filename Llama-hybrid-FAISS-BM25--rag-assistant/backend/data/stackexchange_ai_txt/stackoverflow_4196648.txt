Generally it only depends on selecting the right options on both sides: Plaintext character format how plaintext characters are encoded in the bit string Padding how to pad the plaintext to be an exact multiple of the block size Key length must be agreed if there is a choice Key derivation how to create the bit string to be used for the key Mode which mode of encryption to use Storage format how we store the ciphertext Please see here for a lot of information about these things. Especially the padding seems to be the root of most interoperability problems as PHP's mcrypt uses a NULL -padding by default and has no built-in support for any other padding mode, while e.g. .NET doesn't even provide an option to use a NULL -padding (as it may cause issues when encrypting binary data).
