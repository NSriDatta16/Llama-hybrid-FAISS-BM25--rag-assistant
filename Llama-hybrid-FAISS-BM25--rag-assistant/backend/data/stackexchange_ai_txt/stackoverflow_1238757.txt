Any good library or software for queue networks simulation?

I have been trying to make work EZSIM with no luck, which is a software to build discrete event simulators in a graphical DOS environment. In this software, my simulator and many others (of the other people in the course I'm taking) don't work, but teacher's simulator (and examples of the downloaded files) does work. So, I began to distrust of the software. Do you know any software that resolves the same kind of problems but really works ? It will be good if it is free, or I can download an evaluation copy or something like that. If you don't know any software, do you know any library which might work? Preferably in C#, Ansi C, Java or Delphi.
