Put a transparent UIView atop your table view, override its -touchesBegan:withEvent: etc. methods. In those overridden methods, get the UITouch objects and call -locationInView: on them to get the CGPoint values. That gives you the coordinates of a touch event. Then you just pass on those UITouch events to the underlying table view. The table view handles its usual business of passing touches on to rows, etc.
