Generate sample process with CrossSectional Correlation and autoregressive structure

How can you generate a sample multidimensional time series $X_{t,i}$ for $t \in \{1,2,...,T\}$ and $i \in \{1,2,...,M\}$ where: $E[X_{t,i}] = 0$ $E[X_{t,i}X_{t,j}] = \Sigma_{i,j}$ $E[X_{t,i}|X_{t-1,i}] = a_i X_{t-1,i}$ I can generate a process with properties 1 and 2 or 1 and 3 but I'm not sure how to generate a process with all 3 properties. Right now I am thinking about re-stacking the matrix into a giant vector and trying to generate this process but this seems really computationally inefficient. What else can I try?
