How does one treat censored data in SAS?

I have some censored data and I'm not sure how to deal with it in my regression analysis. The study was not a time series and all examples I've seen in SAS have been in the context of survival analysis. All data came from a survey or biological samples. Should I count it as missing data? Thank you!
