The intercept in a linear regression model may represent two totally different things: A) Your theoretical model may lead you to a specification with a constant term. A basic example from Economics is when one wants to estimate the parameters of a production function (a statistical relationship that links output produced with production factors used) $$Q = AK^aL^b$$ where $Q$ is output, $K$ is capital used and $L$ is labor used. $A$ is a shift factor, representing "technology", assumed constant in the short-run. To linearize this model we take the logs of the variable and we arrive at $$\ln Q = \ln A +a\ln K + b\ln L$$ Including an error term we have an econometric linear regression specification -and the constant estimates $\ln A$. B) But even if your theory does not account for a constant term, widespread advice with observational data at least, is not to omit the constant, except if you are "very sure" about the omission (and this advice holds for logistic regression too, by the way). Why such an advice? Because the existence of a constant absorbs the possibly non-zero mean of the error term . This is a recognition that our model may not include all factors that affect/are associated with the dependent variable. What we do "hope" is that any variable omitted is independent (or at least uncorrelated) with the included regressors. But even if these omitted variables are indeed independent/uncorrelated, they still create a non-zero mean for the dependent variable (which is incarnated as a non-zero mean of the error term), around which the dependent variable fluctuates with the included regressors. By including the constant, we capture this mean value (perhaps together with a constant factor that is postulated by our model), and we can make the assumption that the expected value of the error term (usually conditional on the included regressors), is zero, which we need for various results to pass through. This fact, that the constant term may essentially be the sum of totally different things, is what makes us in many cases not to try to interpret it. Regarding the logistic regression , the constant term reflects the (negative of) the possibly non-zero threshold of the latent continuous variable above which the binary dependent variable becomes unity -so again, its inclusion permits us to "safely" specify an error term with conditional zero mean.
