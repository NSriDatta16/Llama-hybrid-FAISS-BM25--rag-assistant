"Classification" is, in my view, a pretty broad term for any problem that involves sorting objects into discrete groups. These groups can be known in advance or not known. If they are known in advance, the task may be to develop a model that will be useful to predict future the class for future cases - one example of this would be models of disease, where we use cases with a known disease (or outcome) to develop models for patients who have symptoms but an unknown disease. In other cases, the purpose may be to explain why classes form. This explanation vs. prediction idea is also relevant in other areas (that is, where the problem is not classification). Techniques relevant here include various types of logistic regression and classification trees (not an exhaustive list). When the groups are not known, the problem may be to see whether groups even exist. Sometimes cluster analysis is used in this way.
