Embedding an AHAH form element into a theme_table-generated table (Drupal)

I am trying to include a Drupal form element in a table I am generating with theme_table / theme('table',..) . Specifically, I am trying to include a submit button with an AHAH attached. Currently, I am just including as one cell in each row a call to drupal_render to render my dynamically generated AHAH element. The button renders fine, but without the AHAH attached. So, my question is: is there a way to attach an AHAH to something that is just drupal_render ed? If not, how else can I attach an AJAX/AHAH call to an element in a theme_table -generated table? I need to allow users to perform certain actions on rows of data in the table but need the page to not refresh. TIA, Benjy
