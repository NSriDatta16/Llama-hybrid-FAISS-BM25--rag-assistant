I have been struggling with the same sort of task: a time series split into roughly equal segments and I want to know if each of these segments is similar. Plotting them all it is clear that a proportion are artifacts and very different from the rest (and should therefore be excluded), but getting a test to quantify and automate this process is a lot more difficult that it should be. Suggestions: Cross correlation or cross-covariance (xcorr and xcov in matlab) have the added benefit of testing a range of lags in case the segments are shifted relative to each other. Chi-squared goodness of fit test - You can use this to test if each segment is from a normal distribution, or from any arbitrary distribution that you care to define. In my case I took the mean of the segments as and tested each segment against this. Clearly, the more artifact segments the less useful this becomes as they will tend to influence the mean more and more.
