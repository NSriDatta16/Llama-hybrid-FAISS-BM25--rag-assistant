In our organization, if the user is supplying the password we allow them to use anything they want. When users are first enrolled in the system a password is generated for them. Since this password is usually mailed to them, we avoid using certain characters that could be confused particularly when using certain fonts. For example, the letter O and the number 0 (zero) are not used. The same for L, I and 1 (one), S and 5, Z and 2 and others. Before we made this change we had a lot of calls to our help desk because the characters were confusing and they couldn't log in.
