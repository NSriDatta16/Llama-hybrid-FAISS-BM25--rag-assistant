You can compute the height of a binary tree using this recursive definition: height(empty) = 0 height(tree) = 1 + max(height(tree.left), height(tree.right)) One way to empirically measure the average height of such a tree is to repeatedly create an empty tree and add 1000 random items to it. Measure the height of each trial using the above function, and average them. I suspect your task is probably to find a formula for the average height of a binary tree.
