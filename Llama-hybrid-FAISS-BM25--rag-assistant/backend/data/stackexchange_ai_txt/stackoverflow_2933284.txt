OpenCV Python HoughCircles error

I'm working on a program that detects circular shapes in images. I decided a Hough Transform would be the best, and I found one in the OpenCV library. The problem is that when I try to use it I get an error that I have no idea how to fix. Is OpenCV for Python not fully implemented? Is there a fix to the library I need for the program to work? Here's the code: import cv #cv.NamedWindow("camera", 1) capture = cv.CaptureFromCAM(0) while True: img = cv.QueryFrame(capture) gray = cv.CreateImage(cv.GetSize(img), 8, 1) edges = cv.CreateImage(cv.GetSize(img), 8, 1) cv.CvtColor(img, gray, cv.CV_BGR2GRAY) cv.Canny(gray, edges, 50, 200, 3) cv.Smooth(gray, gray, cv.CV_GAUSSIAN, 9, 9) storage = cv.CreateMat(1, 2, cv.CV_32FC3) #This is the line that throws the error cv.HoughCircles(edges, storage, cv.CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT, 2, gray.height/4, 200, 100) #cv.ShowImage("camera", img) if cv.WaitKey(10) == 27: break And here is the error I'm getting: OpenCV Error: Null pinter () in unknown function, file ..\..\..\..\ocv\openc\src\cxcore\cxdatastructs.cpp, line 408 Traceback (most recent call last): File "ellipse-detect-webcam.py", line 20, in cv.HoughCircles(edges, storage, cv.CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT, 2, gray.height/4, 200, 100) cv.error Thanks in advance for the help.
