How do I know which element is modifying in contentEditable case?

I have a little problem / question. I work on a little WYSIWYG editor. I use a div with the option contentEditable="true" and I would like to know when there is a click on a button which element in my div is modifying by the user. For example if there is 3 paragraphs on the the div, and that user modifies the second, I would like to know when he clicks on a button that he is currently to modify the second paragraph to show the text content ! In this example "P2" : P1 P2 P3 Thanks in advance for your help. Nicolas
