If you go all probabilistic, your approach to whitening would be the assumption that your data is generated from a standard normal Gaussian through some map $f$. Now, if $f$ is linear, you can use techniques such as ZCA or PCA to find the latent representations. As you already know, such $f$ cannot turn a standard normal into a mixture--you need more expressive models for that, which comes down to find some different class for $f$ which you can also estimate. One such class would be a deep latent gaussian model .
