If you are interested in alternative tools, then PivotalTracker, Rally and VersionOne are good alternatives. PivotalTracker is good for self-organized small teams, Rally and VersionOne are better suitable for larger enterprises with several teams on board. Said that, I still believe you can use JIRA very efficiently without adding an overhead into the process. In our team we use JIRA and GreenHopper and are very happy with that.
