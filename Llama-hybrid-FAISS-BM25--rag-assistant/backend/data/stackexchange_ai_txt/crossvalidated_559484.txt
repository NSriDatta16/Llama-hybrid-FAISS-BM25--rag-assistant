How do updates of parameters in bayesian hierarchical models work?

I'm starting my way in the bayesian data analysis and I'm struggling to understand one thing. Let's say we define a hierarchical model like this one: $$ y_i| \theta _{g_{i}} \sigma ^2 ∼ N(\theta_{g_{i}} , \sigma ^2), i\in \{1...50\}, {g_{i}} \in \{1,...,5\} $$ $$ \theta _{g}| \mu, \tau^2 ∼ N(\mu , \tau^2), {g} \in \{1,...,5\} $$ $$ \mu ∼ N(0, 1000) $$ $$ \tau^2 ∼ InvGamma(1, 1) $$ $$ \sigma^2 ∼ InvGamma(1, 1) $$ It's a hierarchical model for economic growth for 50 companies belonging to 5 different sectors. There is a mean for each group ( $\theta_g$ ) and a global mean for all companies ( $\mu$ ). As far as I know, it's a simple hierarchical model. My question is how parameters are updated. I mean, let's suppose that I fit the model to the dataset obtaining posterior distribution for all parameters. And let's suppose that I receive 20 observations more. Now, given that I have an updated distribution for all $\theta_g$ , should I use this distribution as an starting point? If so, the "global parameters" $\mu$ and $\tau$ won't play any role in this new update of the parameters of the model? I am very confused about this. To rephrase it, I see $\mu$ and $\tau$ only as a way of defining my prior distribution for $\theta_g$ , but once I have an updated posterior distribution for the mean across each sector, I don't see how to use $\mu$ and $\tau$ (in case I have to use them). I hope my question make sense... Thanks a lot in advance.
