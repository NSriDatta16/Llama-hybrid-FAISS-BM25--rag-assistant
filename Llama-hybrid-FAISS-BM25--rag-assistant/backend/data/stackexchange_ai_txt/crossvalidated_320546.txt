Comparing GLME fits for different data

I have a data set consisting of two behavioral response variables where each response variable is associated with a relevant physiological predictor, with many trials for each subject. The hypothesis I wish to test, which I believe is difficult if not impossible to test in this framework, is: Is ${P_1}$ a better predictor for ${B_1}$ than ${P_2}$ is for ${B_2}$ Independently, it makes sense to model each of these as a logistic regression something like ${B_1}$ ~ 1 + ${P_1}$ + (1|Subject) ${B_2}$ ~ 1 + ${P_2}$ + (1|Subject) but no a priori reason to expect ${P_1}$ to be correlated with ${B_2}$ and vice-versa. The response/predictors are related enough that it would be completely appropriate to model the difference between them with an additional fixed effect for "1" versus "2" and test the interaction. However, I don't really hypothesize that the coefficients for ${P_1}$ and ${P_2}$ are necessarily different. Rather, I expect that ${P_1}$ is a better predictor for ${B_1}$ than ${P_2}$ is for ${B_2}$: I expect larger error in the second model than there is in the first. This would be a trivial comparison if the response was the same, but it isn't. Is there a principled way to make a comparison like this in this context?
