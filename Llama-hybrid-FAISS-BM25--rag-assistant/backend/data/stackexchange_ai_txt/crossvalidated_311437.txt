Why this formula for 5 year trend?

I've opened a spreadsheet that has a 5-year trend formula that I don't understand. The sample data for $2012$ to $2016$ are: $190, 175, 160, 165, 200$. The formula in the spreadsheet is: $trend = 0.1*(-2*190+-1*175+0*160+1*165+2*200)/average(190, 175, 160, 165, 200) = 0.6\%$. My questions are: Is this formula standard practice? Why are the weights ${-2,-1,0,1,2}$ used? Why is the quantity multiplied by $0.1$?
