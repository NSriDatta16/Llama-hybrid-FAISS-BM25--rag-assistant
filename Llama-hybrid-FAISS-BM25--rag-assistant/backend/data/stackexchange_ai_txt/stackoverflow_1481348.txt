Looks like JCIFS may have a fix for this. From a coworker: "jcifs-1.3.10 released / Bugfix for SmbException: The parameter is incorrect posted by Mike, June 4, 2009 This release fixes a bug that could sporadically trigger a "The parameter is incorrect" error." "Just looked at the current hudson source, they're using jcifs-1.3.3 so they are behind and do not have this (as well as several other) update(s)." I'll see about pushing this into the upstream bug tracker, and perhaps give a shot at integrating the newer version and rebuilding locally. Update 1: filed an issue tracker entry here Update 2: we've switched over to JNLP and used that to install a service, which is set to automatically start. This has been working without offline issues for a day or two now. Will keep watching the upstream bug to see if/when any activity happens there.
