Kornel's suggestion of using QueryPerformanceCounter is an excellent one. If that doesn't work for you, and you don't mind another Windows-only solution, use the Windows "multimedia timers". Search the Visual Studio help files for "timeBeginPeriod", "timeEndPeriod", and "Using Multimedia Timers". To use the multimedia timers, you need to include the header and link with winmm.lib: #include #pragma comment( lib, "winmm" ) // need this library for multimedia timers
