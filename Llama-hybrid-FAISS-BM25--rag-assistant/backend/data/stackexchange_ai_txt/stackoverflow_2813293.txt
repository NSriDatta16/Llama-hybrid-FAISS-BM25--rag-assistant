Silverlight Toolkit Drag and Drop Target

I tried to get Drag and Drop working between two ListBox Controls. But somehow picking up an item is not possible. Maybe you have a hint for me to get it working My User Control xaml code looks like this: I am binding my first ListBox to a IList of Facebook friend users. It should be possible to drag and drop friends from one ListBox to the other. I hope you can help me. Thanks in advance
