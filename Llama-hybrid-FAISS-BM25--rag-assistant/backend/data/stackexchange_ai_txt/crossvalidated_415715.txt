Deep Learning Architecture for regression problem

I have a regression problem where I want to estimate 10 real value outputs (c1,..., c10) from 5 real value inputs (p0,..., p4). I tested many deep networks architectures such as: 5 -> 512 ->512 -> 512 -> 128 -> 128 -> 128 -> 10, which RELU activation function and Adamax optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005. However, for all the tested architectures, learning rates, activation functions... My Loss function converge to a value that I found not optimal. How can I improve the results of my regression ? Do you have any suggestions of other models or architectures to use ? On which hyperparameter I can play to not converge quickly ?
