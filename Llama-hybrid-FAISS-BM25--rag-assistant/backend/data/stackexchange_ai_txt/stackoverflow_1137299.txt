.NET has pretty solid Resource-based support for localization , so you might look into that. If you really want to invent your own resource storage format, I'd suggest you to look more closely at JSON as serialization format (there are plenty of .NET libraries to handle it) or at YAML (not sure if there are decent .NET parsers): they both are much simpler on the eye (if that's what you're after).
