write and read in file in java

I'm trying to read from a file, take the length of the each line, write the length into another file and then print the second file to see the writing result, but when I open the second file the result is not exactly the thing that I want. There are many numbers in the file after running this code: String line = null; boolean flag = false; BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("c:\\lm_giga_5k_nvp_2gram.arpa")); BufferedWriter index = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("c:\\index.txt")); int l; int counter=0; while (( line = bf.readLine()) != null) { l=line.length(); index.write( l + "\n" ); } BufferedReader bf1 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("c:\\index.txt")); String line1=null; while (( line1 = bf1.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line1); } bf.close(); bf1.close(); Please help me using this example. I close the index, but still have the same problem. Notice: Don't pay attention to arpa file you can image a txt file instead.
