What is the best way to implement input restrictions on a TextBox in C#?

What is the most elegant way of restricting the input of a TextBox control (or anything else that comes standard with .NET 3.5) to floating point numbers? Currently, I'm doing all the heavy lifting myself by inheriting from TextBox and overriding OnKeyPress . However, I can't help but wonder if I'm reinventing the wheel.
