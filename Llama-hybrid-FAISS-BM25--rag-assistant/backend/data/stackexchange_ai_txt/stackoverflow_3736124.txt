PHP Org Chart image generation

I'm trying to generate an organization chart in PHP; the classic "box" above another "box" connected by lines. I have all the employees in my organization saved in the following database structure... repots_to_table recordId (int) staffId (int) reports_to (int) type (char(1)) Currently, I recursively start at the top (#400 who reports to themself). I don't really care how "wide" the image will be since the idea is I want to generate a final "image" to print or save. Can anyone help me figure out a good way (ideally with built in PHP image libraries) to make this happen?
