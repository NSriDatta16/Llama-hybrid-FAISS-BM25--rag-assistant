Agreed, the question is "not which is better," it's "which solution or set of solutions is best for this particular situation." NoSQL covers a lot of different storage technologies such as CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra and Solr. CouchDB and MongoDB store multi-dimensional data-structures. MongoDB is also schema-less. Cassandra is a column-based storage engine for fast retrieval, and Solr helps solve other problems such as faceting. NoSQL simply refers to any storage facility which is not interacted with via SQL queries.
