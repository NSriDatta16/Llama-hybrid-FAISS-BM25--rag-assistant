Ordinal Logistic Regression with a Different Link Function

Consider an outcome variable that has four clear, ordered categories to it. This seems like a good use of ordinal logistic regression to estimate Odds Ratios for the effect of covariates on moving a subject one "step" up the ladder. But the subjects are particularly evenly spread throughout the categories, so a question arises: Is the "rare outcome assumption" for an OR to approximate a relative risk still true in ordinal logistic regression? If so, is it possible to change the link function to directly estimate a relative risk, and is it still possible to use something like a poisson approximation with robust standard errors to deal with convergence issues in such a case?
