Whether to use binomial or Poisson distribution, when events are not able to happen continuously, but an average rate is known

Let us say there are on average 15 snowy days in December. Let $X$ be the number of snowy days in a given December. Is the binomial distribution, with $X \sim B (31, \frac{15}{31})$ , or the Poisson distribution, with $X \sim Po(15)$ , correct? (My argument for the binomial distribution is that there cannot be multiple snowy days in one day.)
