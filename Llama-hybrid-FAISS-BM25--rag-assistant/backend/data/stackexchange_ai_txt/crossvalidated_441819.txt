Is moving average(sliding window) a smoothing technique or forecasting technique?

The rolling average method is mostly used to produce a smoothed series by removing noise. For ex- 3 window moving average, in general practice, the output for the fourth period is the 3 window moving average of first 3 periods. So in this process we forecast one step ahead by taking average of 3 points. But in moving average, ma function in R basically produces a smoothed series of the original series. So if if have data points from Jan to Dec 2019, then my moving average series has data points from Feb 2019 to Nov 2019. So In this case, how do I forecast for Dec 2019. By using forecast function, it produces ets model, which I don't want.
