Looks like your app is receiving a memory warning as soon as it starts up. When you receive a memory warning, you're suppose to unload as much stuff from memory as you can, e.g. stuff you can reload from elsewhere (database, storage, etc). Does your app pre-load a bunch of stuff when it starts up? Also, you could have a memory leak which is only present under certain circumstances (e.g. the user has loaded the app before, done something and then that kicks off something when it starts up in the future). You could ask your users if they ever managed to load the app at all. Have you tried running the static analyser on your code? (CMD-Shift-A) And have you tried running your app under Instruments to watch for memory leaks?
