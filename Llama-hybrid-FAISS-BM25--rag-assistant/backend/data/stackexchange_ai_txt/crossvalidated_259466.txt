I have referred to Guide to Credit Scoring in R by D. Sharma in the past and it is a good introductory reference on approaches including logistic regression and tree based methods The above guide uses the German Credit Data which has a rich set of features. If you search for the dataset, you will find other alternative approaches, analysis, and comparisons that may help inform feature selection and model choice for your dataset Neural networks is a fair choice for a binary classification problem as this one. In the real world, a credit scoring model is also expected to provide reasons for why a loan application (say) was rejected. Therefore it helps to have a model where you can identify what features in one's credit history result in a low credit score and cause an application to be denied. Features in regression and tree based approaches are easier to interpret compared to neural networks. If you are evaluating purely on fit, NN is worth a try
