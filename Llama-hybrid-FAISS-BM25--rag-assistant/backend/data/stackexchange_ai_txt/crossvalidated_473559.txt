It depends of what you call an outlier. If for you, an outlier for categorical data is a category that appear less than, say, 1% of the time then there is a really easy algorithm to detect those: just count the number of values for each category (for example with pandas value_counts ) and threshold this to find which category are abnormal in your sense. This type of outliers is not detected by one class svm or isolation forest because they are not considered abnormally large data, in short algorithms will consider that your dataset is unbalanced but it will not detect YEN as abnormal in most cases.
