Mailing list activity on say richfaces. Much similar to what is available on http://code.google.com (Low, Medium, High) + average number of emails per day | per month. You'll get these informations on markmail (check also the other lists for richfaces , e.g. the svn-commits ). Number of releases made in a year including patch, minor, major releases. We did look at the maven repositories but that wasn't very useful either. I would use Jira's Change Log for that.
