How to use the callback method with a c++ directshow sample grabber

I have a sample grabber hooked into my directshow graph, based on this example http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd407288(VS.85).aspx the problem is that it uses one shot and buffers. I want to continuously grab samples, and i'd rather have a callback than i guess polling for the samples. How do use the SetCallback method? SetCallback(ISampleGrabberCB *pCallback, long WhichMethodToCallback) how do I point pCallback to my own method?
