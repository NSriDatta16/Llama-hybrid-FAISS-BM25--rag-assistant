There is a Ruby Sesame library: http://github.com/tillsc/ruby-sesame Sesame is one of the two most popular RDF frameworks for Java. We (Ontotext) develop a triple storage + built-in inference engine called OWLIM. We provide a free version called SwiftOWLIM. Some of our users use it with Ruby through the above Ruby Sesame library.
