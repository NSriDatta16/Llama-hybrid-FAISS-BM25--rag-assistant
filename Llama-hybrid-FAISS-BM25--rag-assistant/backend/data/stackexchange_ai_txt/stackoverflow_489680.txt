I believe you're approaching this from a wrong perspective. There's little one can do in the application itself to improve what is essentially a network filesystem driver problem, perhaps except implementing the networked I/O itself. That being said, you should be better off choosing a suitable networked filesystem for your needs. Look at this on Wikipedia. Generally, your application should behave like the file is locally-stored. Don't try too hard to handle network problems. But if your choice of a network filesystem is good, then these problems can be automatically mitigated. So I'd say you should settle with checking errno in case of errors. Perhaps fallback on local storage in case writing a remote file fails (if the networked file system doesn't handle this itself).
