DevExpress XtraGrid problem setting value

I wonder if someone can help. I have a LookupEdit within a Devexpress Xtragrid which is populated from a list of filenames, as well as an empty option, and a "new" option. If the user selects the "new" option, it goes off to an upload form (which is fine), uploads to the new directory and returns to the form. The problem is that I want to set the form to the new value, but I can't get it to work. In the EditValueChanging for the lookupedit, I repopulate the lookup and then use GetKeyValueByDisplayText, but the value returned is null for some reason. Yet I've defined an object for uploadfile with a property of Filename and set both the displaymember and valuemember to Filename. If anyone can help, as I've exhausted my options.
