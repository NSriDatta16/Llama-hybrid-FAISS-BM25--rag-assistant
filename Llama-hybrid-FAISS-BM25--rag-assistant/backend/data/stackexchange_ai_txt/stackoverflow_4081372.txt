Highlight keywords in a paragraph

I need to highlight a keyword in a paragraph, as google does in its search results. Let's assume that I have a MySQL db with blog posts. When a user searches for a certain keyword I wish to return the posts which contain those keywords, but to show only parts of the posts (the paragraph which contain the searched keyword) and to highlight those keywords. My plan is this: find the post id which has the searched keyword in it's content; read the content of that post again and put each word in a fixed buffer array (50 words) until I find the keyword. Can you help me with some logic, or at least to tell my if my logic is ok? I'm in a PHP learning stage.
