Remove store code from URL in Magento

I have 2 sites on one Magento install that point to different domains. Site1 => www.site1.com Site2 => www.site2.com Each site shows the store code in the url of category, product, and CMS pages (www.site1.com/store1/category). Is there a way to remove the /store1/ from the url so that is just www.site1.com/category? My guess is that can be done with .htaccess somehow.
