Aha! 3.7.3.2/4: "... the deallocation function shall deallocate the storage referenced by the pointer, rendering invalid all pointers referring to any part of the deallocated storage. The effect of using an invalid pointer value (including passing it to a deallocation function) is undefined". Note that this says "using the value", not "dereferencing the pointer". That paragraph is not specific to this , it applies to anything that has been deleted.
