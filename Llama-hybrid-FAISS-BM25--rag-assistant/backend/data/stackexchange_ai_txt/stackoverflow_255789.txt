Actually that's why most of the interface are capabilities and not names so you have IComparable, ITestable, IEnumerable and Human, Animal, Dog, etc Anyway, as it has been already mentioned you have to be pragmatic, I've got a general rule when I'm coding: never let concepts, conventions or standard practices get on the way of getting the job done, better be pragmatic than academic. so if you're sure interfaces really fit better your design, go for it, don't worry about question such as this one.
