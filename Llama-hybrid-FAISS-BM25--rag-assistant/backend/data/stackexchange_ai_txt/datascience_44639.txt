For those who are interested, I've spent some time, finally figured out that the problem was the way one has to prepare the categorical encoding for the Entity Embedding suitable for a neural network architecture; unfortunately none of the examples provided in blogposts or Kaggle kernels were clear about this step! Here is the link to the repository containing a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a step-by-step working example. Hope some may find it useful. P.S.: I have borrowed some of the functions from other people's work, kernels, that need to be referenced properly. Hopefully I will manage to update the notebook soon adding those refs.
