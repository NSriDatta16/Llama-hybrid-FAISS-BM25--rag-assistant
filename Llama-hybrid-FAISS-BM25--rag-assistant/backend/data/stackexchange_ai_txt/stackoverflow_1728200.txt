I wouldn't call the objects that react to notifications and update their state completely passive. One other thought, if the objects simply adjust their state to reflect changes in the outside world without providing much of their own, you may slice their "functionality" and put it into other more active "components". There may be not enough reason for these objects to exist. If this organization however makes you code structure better, clearer and more maintainable, then use it and don't worry about it.
