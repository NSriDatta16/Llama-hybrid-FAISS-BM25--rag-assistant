By definition of a linear transformation (and PCA yields a linear transformation), $$ M\cdot \mu = M\cdot (\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \vec{x}_i) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i M\cdot\vec{x}_i $$ I.e. if objects are assigned to the same clusters, then the projection of the original centroid must be the same as the centroid of the projections. That means PCA did not change anything. Did it work?
