How to classify movement data (time series) in real time

I have some movement data sampled over a time series. I am trying to classify the movements in real time as either smooth or shaky. For example, as the movement is smooth it is classified as smooth until it suddenly becomes shaky and is then classified as so. I am having some serious trouble doing this. Aside from using an RNN and feeding it subsets of the time series data to classify (which I do not have enough data to train), does anybody know of any time series classification algorithms? I plan on feeding subsets of the time series into the algorithm with a single label for training and prediction. Any help is greatly appreciated.
