People will have a range of answers for these questions, but here are the approaches I would take: Resetting If you're working on a fragile layout -- one that could easily break if a few pixels aren't where you expect them to be -- consider using a reset. I would look into normalize.css . Instead of completely overwriting browser defaults, it smooths out the differences between browsers. You could also consider resetting specific elements if you find yourself adding a lot of margin: 0; to your stylesheets. Splitting up CSS documents Google recommends splitting them up so that individual pages aren't forcing users to download lots and lots of stylesheet rules that aren't actually used on the page that they're visiting. Yahoo recommends combining files to minimize the number of HTTP requestion Obviously, finding a balance is important, and this SO question weighs some of the pros and cons. Classes and IDs or long chains of selectors? I try to keep classes and IDs to a minimum (in both my HTML and my CSS). They tend to be more fragile when you're building pages that others will update with WYSIWYG editors. I add a few IDs or classes to large blocks of the page, then use CSS to target specific elements within those blocks. This is easier if you avoid deep nesting in your HTML as much as possible. Working with a CSS preprocessor such as LESS or SASS can help you write more readable stylesheets. The ability to nest style rules in both LESS and SASS has helped me avoid a lot of specificity-related issues. Still, specificity is a good CSS topic to be familiar with: CSS-tricks has a good article covering specificity The W3C's own documentation is worth reading. Additional Resources As far as additional reading is concerned... SitePoint's collection of articles and tutorials on CSS is a great resource for more advanced CSS tutorials, and they also feature some good articles covering CSS issues that are more advanced than what you'd find in many beginner-level books.
