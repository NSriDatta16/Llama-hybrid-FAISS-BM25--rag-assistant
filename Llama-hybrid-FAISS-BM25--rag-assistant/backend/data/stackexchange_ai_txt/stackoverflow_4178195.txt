C# Office2010 like backstage

I am looking for a good and free (and possibly open-source) BackStage element, based on the Office 2010 backstage. I've already found Elegant UI, but the free demo version of it does a lot of crap to my app - like replacing the icon, creating an annoying popup, etc. Here is what I would like to achieve: http://www.prof-uis.com/elegant-ribbon/feature-tour/dotnet_backstage_view.aspx Only the stage view, I don't need the ribbon. If someone knows a good solution, please share it!
