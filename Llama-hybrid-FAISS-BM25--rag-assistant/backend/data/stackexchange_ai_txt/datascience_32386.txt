Find most important inputs of LSTM-RNN for multivariate time series modeling

The question is similar to the one asked in SO , but I think it is more appropriate to be here. It remains anyway unanswered. Assuming multivariate time series , how to evaluate the importance of all inputs of an already trained LSTM-RNN ? Thus, which are the inputs that affect the output the most? I am aware of Pearson correlation (for linear relations) and Information Gain based on Entropy reduction to explore input/output relations in general, but this is not what I need. How can you infer from an already trained LSTM network, which inputs affect the output the most? Can you tell by the weights? Any suggestion or literature would be welcome.
