Can I use a subquery inside an INSERT statement?

I need to insert a row into a table, with one field value being calculated from another table. Rather than doing two queries and risking a race condition, I thought it'd be better to do it all in one statement. INSERT INTO `myTable` (`someData`, `averageAtThisTime`) VALUES ( "some stuff", SELECT AVG(`myField`) FROM `myOtherTable` ) ... but this doesn't work. Is there a way I can achieve this in one statement? If not, what's your recommendation?
