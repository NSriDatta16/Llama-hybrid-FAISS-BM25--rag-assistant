You're asking for some very specific functionality. It sounds like you are either building a scheduling app or are trying to display a log of things that have happened in the past. This is called a Gantt Chart . You can buy Gannt Chart controls for MFC on the web. Google for some. There's more to your question than just how to paint it; You cannot and should not be using a CListCtrl as your data structure. You seem to have an array of objects that are start & end times. For example: struct Range { int startTime; int endTime; }; std::vector events; Once you have put your events into this simple vector, you will have to loop through all of the elements and compare the start/end times to see if they overlap the Range that you are considering: typedef std::vector RangeVec; typedef RangeVec::iterator RangeIter; void is_between(int time, const Range& r) { return time >= r.start && time = query.end)) { matches->push_back(*it); } } You can now loop through your matches and display them however you want. If you are brave, it's rather easy to write a custom control with a subclassed CWnd::OnPaint() that just draws rectangles as long as your overlapped range representing each match.
