News sentences will have more unique tokens than normal conversations. Conversations have more stop words than news articles. I think you can use bert or normal wordvect classification to train a baseline model here. I would play aroud the pipeline of fake news classifier and news-conversation classifier. like passing the text to news classifier first and then passing it to news-conversation classifier. Try to mix and match to get the best results. Set some thresholds.
