One thing to do would be to define a "metric z-score", i.e. for each item score $x_i$ $$ z_i = \frac{ x_i - \bar{x} }{ s } $$ where $\bar{x}$ and $s$ are the average and empirical standard deviation of the full set of item scores. Then your ratings could correspond to cutoffs of the $z$ scores, say 3. This avoids the "equal groupings" problem of percentiles, and also gives a fixed interpretation to the ratings even as the underlying metric changes.
