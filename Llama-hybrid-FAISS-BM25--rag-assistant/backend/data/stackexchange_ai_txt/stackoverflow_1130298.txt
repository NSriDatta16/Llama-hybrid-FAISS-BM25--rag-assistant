What's the best FREE collaborative platform for 2/3 programmers?

first of all I searched for similar question, there are many, but does't fit my requirements or are outdated (for example Assembla seems to not be free anymore) We are two developers that would like to work on some common small projects during our free time. Our mainly need is to have a SVN repository that allows possibly to have more than 1 project and 50 MB of storage at least . It should be good have a minimal bug tracking tool or project management tool. We are probably going to release our work open source, but we have not decided yet how. Do you have any suggestions? Edit: I am asking for SVN support because we develop on Windows guest and we like a lot how TortoiseSVN integrates into Win OS
