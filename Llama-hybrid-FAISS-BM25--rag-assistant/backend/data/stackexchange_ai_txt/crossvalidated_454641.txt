You actually have two different, though related, questions: whether your customer will pick up a taxi at all, and if so, at what time. (Depending on where your data come from, you may not even know whether someone picked up a taxi, for instance, if there are multiple taxi companies operating.) I would address both problems in a similar way, with a logistic link function to model the probability that someone picks up a taxi at all. The most important driver will likely be the day of week. Other drivers may be the weather and the time of year, followed by some autoregressive behavior. My first approach would be a regression with autoregressive behavior: fit a logistic regression of whether or not someone picked up a taxi, with the day of week, the weather, the time of year (e.g., using some Fourier terms) and whether they picked up a taxi on the previous day(s). Then fit a similar model for when they pick up a taxi, using the same regressors except for the last. Here, use the last previous time they picked up a taxi, whenever that was. You could fit separate models for each customer, or use one general model with separate intercepts for each customer.
