"Non-naive" bayesian classification algorithms

Based on the problem description in this post: Relating parameters to a measured variable Based on a suggestion, I thought of studying the relationship between the parameters and a measured metric using Naive-Bayes classification. As, I was reading about it, I got to know that it assumes conditional independence i.e. P(x 1 | A,x 2 ) = P(x 1 | A), where x 1 and x 2 are parameters. This may not be true in my case. Are there similar classification algorithms that do not assume independence? I understand that I may require higher number of samples but I can get them because this data is obtained from simulations. It would be nice if I do not have to code one for myself; so please let me know if R-packages may be available?
