To make your example work you should define the siganture of the extern function as follows: [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute("myDll.dll", EntryPoint="DoSomeStuff")] public static extern System.IntPtr DoSomeStuff([MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray, SizeParamIndex=1)], int numberOfElements); The second (named) parameter of MarshalAs attaribute tells to the marshaller where the size of the array stored. Regarding the second question, C# has List class that behaves similary to std:vector . However, I don't think you can directly provide it to the marshaller. What you can do is to use ToArray() methor of the List class, to get an array.
