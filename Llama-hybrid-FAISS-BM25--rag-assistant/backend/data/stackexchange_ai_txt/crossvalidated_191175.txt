Correcting autocorrelation with MA in a regression

I would need some advice on a multivariate regression problem. I am running regressions with macroeconomic data at first difference and using a AR(1) as regressor to correct autocorrelation (it makes Eviews do iterative regressions). However some models still contain autocorrelation with this method. I tried to introduce a moving average MA(1) in the model and the regression didnâ€™t show any more autocorrelation. But am I allowed to use a MA(1) as a regressor ? For example can I estimate X = c + a*Y + MA(1) + AR(1) ? If not, would you have another method to eliminate autocorrelation?
