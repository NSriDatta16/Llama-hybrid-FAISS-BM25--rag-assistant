Creating only several hours of a day as a time series

I have many zeros in my hourly time series data but for sure I know that from 22:00-7:00 the values are all 0. So, I don't want to put these in my forecasting model. Otherwise I have a very sparse dataset that I couldn't find a good model. I want to create a time series only for the hours between 7:00 to 22:00 for each day. Can it be possible? How? Thanks a lot.
