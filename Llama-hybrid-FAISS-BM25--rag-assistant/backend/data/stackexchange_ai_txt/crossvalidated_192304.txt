An independent variable in the logistic regression has 2.2%, 2.1% and 95.7% distribution

I have one independent variable in the logistic regression with a 2.2%, 2.1% and 95.7% distribution (three categories IV). My DV has good distribution (68% and 32%). How would this IV affect my logistic regression analysis? What should I be cautious about when interpreting the results? Thanks
