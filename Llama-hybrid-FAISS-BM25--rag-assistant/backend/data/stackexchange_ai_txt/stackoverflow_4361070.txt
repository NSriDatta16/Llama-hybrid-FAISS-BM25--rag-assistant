Great question. There is a lot of value to embracing the self organization of agile and allow the teams to choose their tools. However, there are usually constraints imposed by the business. For instance, the business may not be able to support/want each scrum team rolling its own scm solution. The more established the business, the more constraints and push back. Even established businesses can change. Don't be afraid to question a constraint if the team can justify the change. Agile planning tools will follow these same rules. The business may have a full software life cycle management solution in place. This solution may or may not have an agile module. However the business may have reasons (regulated industries for example) to require that design inputs / outputs are documented in the life cycle management software solution they have. The business usually needs to balance keeping the teams happy / productive with staying in business. I don't think there will be a black or white solution (unless you are one of the first devs at a start up). Agile teams will need to embrace the open communication. If the tools are impediments the business needs to know.
