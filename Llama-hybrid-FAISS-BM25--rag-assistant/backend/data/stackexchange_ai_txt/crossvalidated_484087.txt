I would add another reason which is valid for an online setting: PCA might give you the best projection for some initial training data but it might become arbitrarily worse as time goes by and new data arrives with an "evolved" distribution. Random projections gives you a kind of probabilistic warranty against that situation. Of course, eventually k might become too low if d is increasing over time but, anyway, in this scenario of continuously learning from large streams of data, I believe random projections are a sensible and efficient approach.
