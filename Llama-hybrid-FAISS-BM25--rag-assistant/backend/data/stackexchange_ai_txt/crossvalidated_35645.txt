A Bayesian way to introduce and motivate parametric models is through Exchangeability and De Finetti's Representation Theorem. There is some discussion in this question: What is so cool about de Finetti's representation theorem? A great introduction is given in the first chapter of Schervish's Theory of Statistics . All the measure theoretic language needed for the discussion is given in his tour de force Appendix (with complete proofs!). I've learned much from this book, and I strongly recommend you to buy it. This paper studies the generality of the Bayesian construction: Sandra Fortini, Lucia Ladelli and Eugenio Regazzini SankhyƒÅ: The Indian Journal of Statistics, Series A (1961-2002) Vol. 62, No. 1 (Feb., 2000), pp. 86-109 It's available for download here: http://sankhya.isical.ac.in/search/62a1/62a17092.pdf
