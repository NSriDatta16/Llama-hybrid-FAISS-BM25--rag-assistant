You are looking for Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) : An MDS algorithm aims to place each object in N-dimensional space such that the between-object distances are preserved as well as possible. Each object is then assigned coordinates in each of the N dimensions. The number of dimensions of an MDS plot N can exceed 2 and is specified a priori. Choosing N=2 optimizes the object locations for a two-dimensional scatterplot. There are many algorithms and libraries for many common software packages. This thread discusses MDS and PCA . Or you could browse through the multidimensional-scaling tag.
