Neural Network with unknown number of Neurons in output layer

Is it possible to design a network with an unknown number of neurons in the output layer? I am trying to solve a classification problem, where I use motorcycles' exterior color, interior color, and make to predict the type of damages that are going to show on them. Since I don't know what the possible damage combinations are going to look like (ex: 2 scratches and 1 scuff or 3 scratches and 1 scuff), then it is not possible for me to know how many output neurons I have in my network. This is my first ever network. I am trying to imagine what the input and output layers look like. The output layer seems to contain "n" neurons. Is there a solution for this?
