If you look at the S3 REST object PUT documentation you will see the response that is returned from S3. When you post to S3 you know the bucket name you are putting the image into plus you know the filename. These two pieces of information should be all you need to get a url to the image. The documentation states that in addition to the PUT response header(s) you can see some of the common headers too. This implementation of the operation can include the following response headers in addition to the response headers common to all responses. For more information, see Common Response Headers . If you look at the ASIHTTPRequest Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) support you will see how to get a response from the ASIS3ObjectRequest object.
