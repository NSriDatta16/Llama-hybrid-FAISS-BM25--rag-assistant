I'd say how you order your sequences or normalize data will have much less importance than where you get features for those classifier/detection vectors (where you attach those to your base CNN network). Your idea falls into approach called "Single Shot Detector" (as opposed to region proposal/sliding windows) and I'd recommend looking at SSD (Liu et al) and YOLO (Redmon, Farhadi) models â€“ there is much more to it to get it performing well.
