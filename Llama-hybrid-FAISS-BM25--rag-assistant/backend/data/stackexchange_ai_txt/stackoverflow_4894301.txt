No, not using the framework APIs and not without a modified device. You'd need to construct a userdata.img file, which is essentially a block-level copy of the device's user-writable storage. However, you do not have block-level access to the filesystem. On top of that, your application wouldn't have permission to read much of the filesystem. Now, if you wanted to create a blank AVD, then you might be able to do that (but why?). That's because the requirements to create an AVD are pretty basic. You'd also need a system.img file, and you don't have the permission to create that from the device either. (There may also be legal issues involved here, which I will not discuss.)
