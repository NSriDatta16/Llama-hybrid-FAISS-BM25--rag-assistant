I would simply calculate odds (or risk) ratios between group A and B, between B and C, and between A and C and see if they statistically different. I don't see a reason to do a "omnibus" proportions test in this case since you only have three groups. Three chi-square tests could do the trick as well. As some of the individuals have outlined in the comments below, and logistic regression with planned contrasts would work well too.
