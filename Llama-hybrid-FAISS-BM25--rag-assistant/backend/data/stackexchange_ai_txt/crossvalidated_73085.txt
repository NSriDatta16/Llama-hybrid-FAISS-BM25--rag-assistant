One important point that many seem to be confused about is the application of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT applies to the arithmetic mean of a distributionâ€” not the distribution itself. Given an increasing number of samples, the average of those samples tends to be normally distributed with the "mean mean" equal to the overall mean and the variance of that mean estimator proportional to the variance and the number of samples. The actual distribution itself is not going to be normal. If anything, the distribution of the samples (NOT their average) will flesh out the shape of the distribution and you will have a greater chance of seeing an extreme value the more samples are generated. My hunch is that your routing score is probably an average of some values, and, as such, is the mean of some distribution. If so, as the mean of a distribution, under many conditions its own distribution will tend to the normal after enough samples are generated.
