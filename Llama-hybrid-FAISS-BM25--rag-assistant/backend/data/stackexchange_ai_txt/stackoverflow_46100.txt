Check out section 5.14.2. Moving files and folders (or check out "move" in the Index of the help) of the TortoiseSVN help. You do a move via right-dragging. It also mentions that you need to commit from the parent folder to make it "one" revision. This works for doing the change in a working copy. (Note that the SVN items in the following image will only show up if the destination folder has already been added to the repository.) You can also do the move via the Repo Browser (section 5.23. The Repository Browser of the help).
