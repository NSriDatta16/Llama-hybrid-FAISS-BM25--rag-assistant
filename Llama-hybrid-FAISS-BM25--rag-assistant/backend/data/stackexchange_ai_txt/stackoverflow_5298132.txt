PHP Whether have a database classification retrieval table

I want store some article into database. I use php and mysql. Whether have a database classification retrieval table? like: directory | keyword1 | keyword2 | keyword3 | keyword4| sport | football | f1 | nba | tennis | so that: $query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM keywordtable WHERE keyword1='$word' OR keyword2='$word' OR keyword3='$word' OR keyword4='$word' "); if some words in the article match one of the keywords, the article will insert into directory - sport. Thanks. I need a table like my example, it should be have many words which can let me reference: if my article appears these words, I can put it into the directory it should in. I know there have more and more words which can be defined into sport .
