As these are count data and there "is not really a sample size for this", a poisson model would be neat. Note however, that even a simple t-test will find significant differences in two out of four column pairs: > t.test(blackbirds$Foraging, song_thrushes$Foraging, paired=TRUE) Paired t-test data: blackbirds$Foraging and song_thrushes$Foraging t = 3.4877, df = 31, p-value = 0.001481 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 2.906607 11.093393 sample estimates: mean of the differences 7 > t.test(blackbirds$Singing, song_thrushes$Singing, paired=TRUE) Paired t-test data: blackbirds$Singing and song_thrushes$Singing t = 3.346, df = 31, p-value = 0.002159 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.7321223 3.0178777 sample estimates: mean of the differences 1.875 > t.test(blackbirds$Alarm, song_thrushes$Alarm, paired=TRUE) Paired t-test data: blackbirds$Alarm and song_thrushes$Alarm t = 1.1909, df = 31, p-value = 0.2427 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.1558696 0.5933696 sample estimates: mean of the differences 0.21875 > t.test(blackbirds$Aggressive, song_thrushes$Aggressive, paired=TRUE) Paired t-test data: blackbirds$Aggressive and song_thrushes$Aggressive t = -0.2544, df = 31, p-value = 0.8009 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.2817822 0.2192822 sample estimates: mean of the differences -0.03125 Link to Poisson regression: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bee/courses/lec/lec_jan29.pdf However, with only 32 observations and the mean number of alarm and aggressive calls well below 1, chances are, that a more complex model will not find that much more information to reveal (mean Aggressive count is .25 vs .28 in n=32!)
