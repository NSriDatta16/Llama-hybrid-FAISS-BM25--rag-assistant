Are there any machine learning techniques to identify points on plots/ images?

I have data for each vehicle's lateral position over time and lane number as shown in these 3 plots in the image and sample data below. > a Frame.ID xcoord Lane 1 452 27.39400 3 2 453 27.38331 3 3 454 27.42999 3 4 455 27.46512 3 5 456 27.49066 3 The lateral position varies over time because a human driver does not have perfect control over vehicle's position. The lane change maneuver starts when the lateral position changes drastically and ends when the variation becomes 'normal' again. This can not be identified from the data directly. I have to manually look at each vehicle's plot to determine the start and end points of lane change maneuver in order to estimate the duration of lane change. But I have thousands of vehicles in the data set. Could you please direct me to any relevant image analysis/ machine learning algorithm that could be trained to identify these points? I work in R. Thanks in advance.
