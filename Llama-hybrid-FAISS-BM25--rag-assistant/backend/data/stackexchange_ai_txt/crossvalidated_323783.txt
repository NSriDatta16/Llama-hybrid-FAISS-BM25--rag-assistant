Why do hypothesis functions with high degree or large number of features have high variance(tend to overfit)?

I was watching professor Andrew Ng's lecture on Logistic Regression and Regularisation. While teaching overfitting professor said that, "If we choose a hypothesis function with high degree then it tends to overfit and does not generalise well. This is because such a polynomial can fit almost any function and we don't have enough data to constraint it to give us a good hypothesis." My questions are: Why will a hypothesis function with high degree overfit? What actually is meant by "such a polynomial can fit almost any function and we don't have enough data to constraint it to give us a good hypothesis."? If this hypothesis function "can fit almost any function" then why does it have high variance? Since it "can fit almost any function" should it not fit unseen data points as well? So why does it fail to generalise?
