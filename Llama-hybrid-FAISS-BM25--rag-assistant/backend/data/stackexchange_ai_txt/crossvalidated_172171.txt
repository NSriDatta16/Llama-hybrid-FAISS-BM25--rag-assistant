How to report simple markov transition matrix

I have a beginners question on Markov chains. We found that a Markov chain might be a good way to describe the data we got from our experiment. Let's say we have two simple Markov transition matrix with 3 states. Markov transition probability matrix 1 1 2 3 1 0.00 1.00 0.00 2 0.50 0.00 0.50 3 0.00 0.66 0.33 Markov transition probability matrix 2 1 2 3 1 0.66 0.33 0.00 2 0.50 0.50 0.00 3 0.00 1.00 0.00 I wonder what would be the best way to report it in an article, e.g. APA. Ideally we would like to look at differences between two different Markov transition matrices. Links to good beginner's introductions would help too. Many thanks! What would be the most concise way to report the difference between two matrices?
