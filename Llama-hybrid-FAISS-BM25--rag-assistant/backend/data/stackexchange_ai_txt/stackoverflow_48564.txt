Well, it seems I cannot do that. What I should be doing is [subclassing NSAnimation]( https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/AnimationGuide/Articles/TimingAnimations.html subclassing NSAnimation). This will work on a MacOS 10.4+ app, but not on Cocoa Touch, in which I cannot find any alternatives apart from using a NSTimer.
