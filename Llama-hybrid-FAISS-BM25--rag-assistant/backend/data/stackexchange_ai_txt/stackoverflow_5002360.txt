Disable a if there is only one with jQuery

I am developing a backend for a client and I've some s that works together. Specifically, I've 3 for select country, province and city (for Spain) that works with other countries too. If the selected option in country is Spain, province will be populated and if a province is selected city will be populated. If another country is selected in the country select, province and city will remain disabled with no option but with a default value of -- Select-- . When a country/province/city is selected makes an ajax transaction to get the results. The PHP controller parse the results and if there is results (only for Spain) returns this (to populate province): -- Select -- Andalucía Aragón Asturias ... If there is no results for the country selected, the controller returns: -- Select -- My question is: how can I handle that if there is ONLY the option with value 0, add an attr("disabled", true); ? My actual JavaScript code: $(document).ready(function(){ $("select#codpais").change(function() { var codpais = $(this).val(); if (0 != codpais) { $.post(BASE_URL + 'projects/ajax/get_autonomias', { codpais: codpais }, function(data) { if (data) { $("select#codauto").attr('disabled', false); $("select#codauto").html(data); } }); } }); }); The problem is that the controller ALWAYS returns data because the site is bilingual and some users needs to see -- Select -- and others -- Seleccionar -- (if is disabled too). Thank you in advance!
