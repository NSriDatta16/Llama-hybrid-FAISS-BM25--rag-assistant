You're asking some pretty basic CakePHP stuff, I suggest you read the book , which outlines naming conventions, file structure and data retrieval to name a few things. That being said, the name categories is correct, unless you want products to have more than one category, the relationship will be Product 'BelongsTo' Category. To get category info inside the product controller you can just access it's find methods with $this->Product->Category->find(); , but again I recommend you read through the CakePHP book as you go to build up our knowledge and learn more about the framework you're using.
