What is the name of this machine learning algorithm that is based in the maximum likelihood estimation?

There is a set of random variables $x_i,i=1,2,\dots,N_x$ whose distribution depends on some parameters $p_i,i=1,2,\dots,N_p$ . The maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters based on a single observation of the random variable is just that which maximizes the likelihood function $\mathscr{L}(p)=f(x|p)$ where $f(x|p)$ is the joint distribution of the $x_i$ given the $p_i$ 's. Based on this, it is possible to construct a machine learning algorithm that receives as input a set of observations of the $x_i$ variables and the corresponding $p_i$ values. Using this information the algorithm estimates $f$ e.g. with kernel density estimation and then uses this estimations to infer the values of the $p_i$ for a never-before-seen observation of $x_i$ . What is the name of such algorithm? I have been using this for a while in an application without knowing its name. I just came up with this idea, implemented it in Python and it works fine. But now I want to use a dedicated library for the purpose to get a more efficient and faster implementation.
