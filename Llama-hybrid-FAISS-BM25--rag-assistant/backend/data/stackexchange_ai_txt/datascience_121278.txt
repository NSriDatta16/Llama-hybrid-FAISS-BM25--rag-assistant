Comparing model performance to mean value performance

I wanted to predict the ages of Titanic passengers, but I noticed that people often just fill missing age values with the mean age. I wanted to compare my model's performance with the simple mean value approach. My questions are: Is the R-squared metric a good indicator to determine if my model performs better than the average age value? If I want to calculate the mean absolute error for the average age value , should I treat it like a model? Should I calculate the mean value using the training data and then calculate its MAE score with the testing data, or should I use the whole dataset to calculate the mean? How should I implement point nr.2 in python? Create list of mean values like [age_target_data.mean() for _ in age_target_list] and insert it to scikit-learn mean_absolute_error(age_target_list,age_mean_list)
