How should I tackle this real-life hypermarket problem?

I registered myself in the payback program of the hypermarket I am going to. For every 2$ I get 1 point. I buy the same products every week (Feta 2.19\$, Milk 0.99$, ...). I visit only in weekdays. I would like to maximize the amount of points I gather, while I also maximize the times I visit that hypermarket (so buying all the stuff at once is an awful solution). How should I go about modeling this real-life situation in terms of a Data Science problem in the first place? If you feel like it, suggest an approach of tackling it as well...
