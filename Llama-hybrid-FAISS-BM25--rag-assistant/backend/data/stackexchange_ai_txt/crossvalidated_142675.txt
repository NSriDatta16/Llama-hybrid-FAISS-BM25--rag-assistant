How to make a trained neural network "forget" an instance?

I am using neural networks for predicting the behavior of a dynamic system. A neural network is trained online using snapshots from the system's past. The system changes its state at irregular intervals, and whenever this happens a part of the past training instances become invalid. I can detect the change in the state and also identify the invalid instances. The question is how can I make the trained neural network "unlearn" or "forget" some instances?
