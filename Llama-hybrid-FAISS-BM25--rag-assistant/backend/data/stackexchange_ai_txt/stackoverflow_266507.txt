How do you get child bands in ultragrid without using related tables in a dataset?

I'm using linq to pull back an object (i.e. customer) that might have a collection of other objects(customer.orders). I would be nice if I can pass this list of customers to the ultragrid and a hierarchical view of customers and thier orders displayed on databind. When I try this, I just get customers. Anyone know how to get this to work with non dataset objects?
