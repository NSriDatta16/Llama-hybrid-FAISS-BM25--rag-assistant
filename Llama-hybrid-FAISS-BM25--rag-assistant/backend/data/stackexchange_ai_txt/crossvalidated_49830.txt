How do we usually select the best combination of parameters of a machine learning model (for a given dataset)?

Am I wrong, or the standard way of optimizing a machine learning model is by evaluating the algorithm over the (initial) dataset for all possible combinations of parameters, and then pick up the one that gives the 'best' evaluation score? If we still don't get an acceptable score, we should then slice and dice the (initial) dataset and start the process from the beginning, but this time applying it on the new dataset? Does this sounds right to you or I am missing something here?
