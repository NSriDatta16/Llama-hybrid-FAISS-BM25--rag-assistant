How do I process a mouse click using Quartz events?

I have a CGEventTap and I would like to observe and process all system mouse click events. Detecting a mouse click event is easy, but I don’t want some of the clicks to get processed by the rest of the system. And I can’t figure out how. The system only sends low-level events like mouseUp , mouseDown , mouseDragged and so on. When I receive a mouseDown event, I don’t know if it’s a part of a mouse click yet, could be a drag event. I have to wait for the following event – if it’s a mouseUp , I have a click. But if I want to process the click myself and keep it from going down the rest of the event queue, I can’t simply steal the mouseUp event, as the previous mouseDown was already sent. I thought I could delay the mouseDown event and only send it later after receiving the corresponding mouseUp , but that feels wrong, I don’t want to delay all system mouseDown events just because of my application. Am I missing something?
