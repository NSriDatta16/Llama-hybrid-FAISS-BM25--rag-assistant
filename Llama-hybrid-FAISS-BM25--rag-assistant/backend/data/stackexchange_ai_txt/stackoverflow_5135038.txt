How about alloca()? (Or, more specifically, for MSVC2008, _malloca() )? Allocates memory on the stack. This is a version of _alloca with security enhancements as described in Security Enhancements in the CRT. Alignment behaviour is not standardised across compilers, but for this one ... The _malloca routine returns a void pointer to the allocated space, which is guaranteed to be suitably aligned for storage of any type of object.
