Unfortunately, there is no answer for my specific toolchain, or so says the engineers at Tensilica. They don't support #message, or #pragma message(), or know of how to suppress #warning as error in the presence of -Werror . The GCC toolchain allows the use of -Wno-error=[code] to say "this warning is not an error", but I haven't found a list that corresponds #warning to any code this would take (or even a list of codes this could be). I may try to find the time to delve into the standard GCC command lines and pre-processor source code to try to find a list of what -Wno-error= can be equal to, or whether or not there's a -Werror= code that corresponds to #warning.
