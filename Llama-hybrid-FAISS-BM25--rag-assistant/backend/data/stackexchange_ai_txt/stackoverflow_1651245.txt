You should enable GC logging and check to see where your OOM is ocurring. -verbose:gc -Xloggc:gc.log -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails You may be experiencing perm space limits, adjust via -XX:MaxPermSize=YYYm Anyway to answer your question, I start with no minimums and set the maximum relatively high. I then graph the gc log and find out where my stead state is; visually choose an above-average size for the various generations. Read it like a financial chart, you'll want to see good spread in the new generations and a consistent growth and collection in the tenured generation. As mentioned also graph your perm space to make sure you're not constantly increasing. GC tuning is an art, in no way a science.
