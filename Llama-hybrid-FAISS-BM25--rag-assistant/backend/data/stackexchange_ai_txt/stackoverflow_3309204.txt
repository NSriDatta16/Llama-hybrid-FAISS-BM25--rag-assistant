You should also be aware of integer conversion rules when dealing with NSUInteger vs. NSInteger: The following fragment for example returns 0 (false) although you'd expect it to print 1 (true): NSInteger si = -1; NSUInteger ui = 1; printf("%d\n", si The reason is that the [si] variable is being implicitly converted to an unsigned int! See CERT's Secure Coding site for an in-depth discussion around these 'issues' and how to solve them.
