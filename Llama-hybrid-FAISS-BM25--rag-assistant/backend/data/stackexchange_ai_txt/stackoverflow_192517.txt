When you need to use it: Fix SVN file ownership issue when you use svn+ssh. Somebody told me it only happens on BDB, but I had such issue in FSFS storage too. Basically when you want to keep the ownership of child files inside a directory consistent when there are other users writing stuff on it, you would have to use u+s/g+s.
