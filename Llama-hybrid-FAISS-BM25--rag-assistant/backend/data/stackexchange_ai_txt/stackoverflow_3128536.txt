pyGTK detect all window move events

I'm trying to capture the configure-event for every window to create a windows 7-esque snap feature. I know there are solutions involving compiz-fusion, but my installation is running within vmware and doesn't have hardware acceleration to run compiz. I figured a simple python script could do what I wanted, but I can't seem to find the right place to bind the configure-event to. How/to what do you bind the configure-event callback, or is there a different event I need to watch for? I've tried binding it to the screen and the root window using get_root_window() with no luck. EDIT2 Now I can capture all events, the problem is that every event returned is of type GDK_NOTHING, so I can't tell the difference between focus events, move events, close events, etc. #!/usr/bin/python import pygtk pygtk.require('2.0') import gtk, wnck import inspect def move_event(e): print e.type, e.window print inspect.getmembers(e) return gtk.gdk.FILTER_CONTINUE def bind_win(screen, win): w = gtk.gdk.window_foreign_new(win.get_xid()) if w: w.set_events(w.get_events() | gtk.gdk.ALL_EVENTS_MASK) w.add_filter(move_event) if __name__ == "__main__": screen = wnck.screen_get_default() screen.connect("window_opened", bind_win) gtk.main() One iteration of move_event(e) while dragging a window: [('copy', ), ('free', ), ('get_axis', ), ('get_coords', ), ('get_root_coords', ), ('get_screen', ), ('get_state', ), ('get_time', ), ('put', ), ('send_client_message', ), ('send_clientmessage_toall', ), ('send_event', 1), ('set_screen', ), ('type', ), ('window', )]
