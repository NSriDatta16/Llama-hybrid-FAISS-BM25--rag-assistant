class and id are good attributes to use for this kind of information storage. One thing to keep in mind though is that, by W3C standards, id cannot start with a number, so if you were hoping to store numbers as your extra info you'll either have to use class or implement some extra Javascript that pulls the number from the id , like a substr function.
