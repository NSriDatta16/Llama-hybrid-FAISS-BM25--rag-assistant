You’re using the wrong type of table. Mysql supports a few different types of tables, but the most commonly used are MyISAM and InnoDB. MyISAM (in MySQL 5.6+also InnoDB tables) are the types of tables that Mysql supports for Full-text indexes. To check your table’s type issue the following sql query: SHOW TABLE STATUS Looking at the result returned by the query, find your table and corresponding value in the Engine column. If this value is anything except MyISAM or InnoDB then Mysql will throw an error if your trying to add FULLTEXT indexes. To correct this, you can use the sql query below to change the engine type: ALTER TABLE ENGINE = [MYISAM | INNODB] Additional information (thought it might be useful): Mysql using different engine storage types to optimize for the needed functionality of specific tables. Example MyISAM is the default type for operating systems (besides windows), preforms SELECTs and INSERTs quickly; but does not handle transactions. InnoDB is the default for windows, can be used for transactions. But InnoDB does require more disk space on the server.
