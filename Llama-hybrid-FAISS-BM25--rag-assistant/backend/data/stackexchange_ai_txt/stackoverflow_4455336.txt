You can assign float: none to individual elements. That should (hopefully) override the float, though your mileage may vary. You'd probably be advised to do that to every element in the table, including thead and tbody . But, as the previous answer said, it might not be a good idea to float everything. I understand you feel it's elegant, but I think it's going to cause more problems for you than this one you're facing now. On a website of even moderate complexity, you'll have a whole lot of elements to style (including inline typographic elements, such as em ), and I can't imagine you'd want to deal with floating all of them.
