Why is "the true data generating process" similar to simulating the entire universe?

In the deep learning book by Bengio, Goofellow and Courville ( http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ ) there is paragraph in the regularization chapter. "Deep learning algorithms are typically applied to extremely complicated domains such as images, audio sequences and text, for which the true generation process essentially involves simulating the entire universe." Why is this the case?
