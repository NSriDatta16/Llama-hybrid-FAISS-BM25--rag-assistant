You can place the code in the test/test_helper.rb file. You should already find a code fragment that looks like this class ActiveSupport::TestCase self.use_transactional_fixtures = true self.use_instantiated_fixtures = false end If the code should be used in all your tests, you can add your methods in the ActiveSupport::TestCase class. Otherwise, wrap them into a Module and mix the module where required. It's a good practice to test validations not to test the validation itself (the validates_presence_of macro is already tested in the Rails codebase), but to make sure chances in your code don't affect your class business. For instance, there might be validation which needs to be triggered only in specific events. Or you might want to make sure no one removed your super-secret validation on that specific model. If you want to test your model validations, I encourage you to check out shoulda . Shoulda provides several handy methods to test your validations. class PostTest
