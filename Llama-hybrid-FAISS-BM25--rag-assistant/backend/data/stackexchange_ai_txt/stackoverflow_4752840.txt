Html Agility Pack c# Paragraph parsing problem

I am having a couple of issues with my code, I am trying to pull every paragraph from a page, but at the moment it is only selecting the last paragraph. here is my code. foreach (HtmlNode node in doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes("//div[@id='body']/p")) { string text = node.InnerText; lblTest2.Text = text; }
