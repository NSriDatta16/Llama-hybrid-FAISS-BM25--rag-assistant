if you ask google for that meta-tag, this is the first hit - describing a lot of things about meta-tags, and has also a paragraph about the robot-tags (which are instructions for search-engines). please try to ask google and the stackoverflow-seach before posting a questions thats so easy to find out yourself. in addition: "no-cache" seems to be senseless in a rotobs-metatag, there should only be "index", "follow", "noindex" or "nofollow" or a combination of these like "noindex, follow". the meta-tag to tell the browser it shouldn't cache the site is ^not "robots" ^without "-" where have you got your example from?
