Do you think functional language is good for applications that have a lot of business rules but very few computation?

I am convinced that functional programming is an excellent choice when it comes to applications that require a lot of computation (data mining, AI, nlp etc). Is functional programming being used in any well known enterprise applications or open source projects? How did they incorporate business logic into the functional design? Please disregard the fact that there are very few people using functional programming and that it's kind of tough. Thanks
