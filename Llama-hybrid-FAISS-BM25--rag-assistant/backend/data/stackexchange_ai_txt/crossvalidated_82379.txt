Null GLMM Poisson underestimate the mean of the response variable. Is it indicative of poor fitting?

I want to test the fixed and random effects of some covariates on a discrete variable with non negative values. In exploratory analysis I fitted a null Poisson GLM and an null Poisson GLMM. However, the GLMM underestimated the mean value of the response variable even after inclusion of fixed and/or random covariates. I also tried Bayesian approaches, zero-inflated models and negative binomial distributions but the "problem" remains. Response variable mean: 0.7804 GLM intercept: 0.7803772 GLMM intercept: 0.6595108 Is the estimated intercept of the GLMM an indicative of poor fitting of the model? summary(banco2$caes) Min. 1st Qu.
