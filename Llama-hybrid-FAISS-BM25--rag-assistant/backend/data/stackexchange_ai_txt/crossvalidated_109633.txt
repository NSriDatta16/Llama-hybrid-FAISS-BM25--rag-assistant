Help on small data set with correlated features

My data set is quite small and feature rich. It has 30 observations and 30 features/predictors. In addition to that, many features are correlated (often not linear). I have tried several things- Random Forest, Naive Bayes, PCA for data reduction, checked out both linear & ranked based correlations etc....but the best classification accuracy I've achieved so far is only 50% using random forest. Any suggestion regarding what else to try will be highly appreciated! Many thanks. Problem Description- The problem is to build an approximate predictor system that is able to roughly predict the Oil Production of a well (target variable), based on the predictors (like well depth, trajectory, rock brittleness, mineral content etc).
