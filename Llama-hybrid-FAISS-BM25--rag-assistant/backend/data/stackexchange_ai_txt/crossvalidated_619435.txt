Logistic regression with only 1 dummy variable

I have the following dataframe in Python: import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame({'id': [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 'group': ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b','b', 'b','b','c','c','c'], 'val':[1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1]}) print(df) id group val 0 1 a 1 1 2 a 0 2 3 a 1 3 4 b 0 4 5 b 1 5 6 b 1 6 7 b 0 7 8 c 0 8 9 c 1 9 10 c 1 I want to see if ANY of the levels of group has a significant effect on val . So I do a logistic regression as follows: import statsmodels.api as sm dummy_variables = pd.get_dummies(df['group'], drop_first=False) logit_model = sm.Logit(df['val'], dummy_variables) result = logit_model.fit() print(result.summary()) Notice the drop_first=False and I also do not add a constant in the model, due to multicollinearity. At my real data (not the dummy example) i get a p-value for dummy_a and a p-value > 0.05 for dummy_b and dummy_c . Is it right to say that a has a signifficant effect on val ?
