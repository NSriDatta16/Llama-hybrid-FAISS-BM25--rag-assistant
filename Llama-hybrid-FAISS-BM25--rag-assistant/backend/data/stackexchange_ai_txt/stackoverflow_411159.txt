Generally, you mark them with #pragma once, or the equivalent macro guard and stop caring about it. If you're using MS compiler, you can put a #pragma message (IIRC, it might be a #pragma warning or #pragma error instead) with the name of the header file at the very top of each header file and your build output will show the list of every one that's being included per file that's compiled. That would work best for your header files, as the system ones will not be included. If you want to see all included headers, edit the compile options to include /P (preprocess to a file) that will not compile your code, but instead will redirect the pre-processer to a file, you can then grep through it to see the #include statements. Be aware these files will be large.
