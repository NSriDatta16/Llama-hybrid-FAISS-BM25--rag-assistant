Time Series chart interpretation

I was using Python to do a time series analysis. I observe the following pattern. Since the ACF cuts off at lag 12 and PACF tails off, does this mean I should fit a MA(12) to this series? Well I actually fitted a MA(12) to the curve and I am getting the following: Most coefficients are actually insignificant. Besides I don't quite understand how these nans come out.
