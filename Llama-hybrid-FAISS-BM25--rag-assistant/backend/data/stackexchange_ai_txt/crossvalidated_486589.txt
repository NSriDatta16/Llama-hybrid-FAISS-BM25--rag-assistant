Computing Pairwise Distances Through PCA or SVD

What should I do to reduce an mxn (m=17, n=650,000) matrix, where m are samples and n are features of these samples, into a matrix of pairwise distances (which I will then use to generate a dendrogram)? My idea is to apply SVD (from rsvd https://github.com/erichson/rSVD with k=m) then use the v matrix to compute an mxm pairwise distance matrix. However, whenever I call dist ( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/dist ) on v, I get a matrix in which each sample is equally distant to the other. Is it possible to compute pairwise distances by using SVD and what don't I understand about v? and maybe even should I instead be using PCA?
