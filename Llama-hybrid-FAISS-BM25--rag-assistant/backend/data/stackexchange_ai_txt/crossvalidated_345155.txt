I happen to have Theil's original two conference presentations on my desk. Even though I rarely use it as an estimator, it is an important limiting case in a number of problems. So, let's begin with the simple case where all of the assumptions of ordinary least squares holds, then it has 85% relative asymptotic efficiency with ordinary least squares. This does not mean you should use Theil's estimator in lieu of OLS as a standard practice, but let us assume that when you are constructing your research and about to collect data, you come to believe that some assumption is likely to be violated. Then it is an excellent estimator, the best among those that Sen(1968) tested. Sen, Pranab Kumar. Estimates of the Regression Coefficient Based on Kendall's Tau. Journal of the American Statistical Association. Vol 63(324). December 1968. Pp. 1379-1389 Now let us move into time series. To begin with, for the simple AR(1) equation $$x_{t+1}=\beta{x_t}+\epsilon_{t+1},|\beta| If you believe, on the other hand, you have some issue that you cannot solve with a stationary series, then Theil's method of regression should be used. You should pick up the original two conference proceedings because they will help you understand what is being attempted as it is a distribution-free method for polynomial regression of any order $N.$ Autocorrelation won't be an issue either. This is because the testing process is strictly distribution-free. In a sense, the presence of autocorrelation alters the test distribution. That is not a problem here. Autocorrelation falls out the window. Now let us consider the case of $$x_{t+1}=\beta{x}_t+\epsilon_{t+1},|\beta|>{1}.$$ This is the explosive roots case. Note that Theil's regression works for all AR(N) models. In that case, you should not consider Theil's regression as the Bayesian alternative is leaps and bounds better. This is primarily due to the prior. Since $\hat{\beta}-\beta$ is a symmetric distribution, in this case, some of the solutions from any Frequentist regression will end up in the region $|\beta| There is only one special case you would consider it, and that is when you truly have a sharp null hypothesis, such as $\beta=k$. In that case, because Bayesian methods don't do well with a sharp null hypothesis, you should use Theil's regression. In that case, where the goal is not prediction, but epistemological, then you should prefer Theil's regression to the Bayesian alternative, despite the much less accurate result. Now let us consider the general case, where $$x_{t+1}=\beta{x_t}+\epsilon_{t+1},\forall\beta\in\mathbb{R}.$$ I have yet to run simulations on this. There is a Bayesian solution to this, and there isn't a distribution dependent parametric solution for this in Frequentist or Maximum Likelihood Methods. The non-existence of a solution is in the literature. Nonetheless, because Theil's method does not depend upon the distributions involved, it is free of that problem. The only question is admissibility relative to the Bayesian estimator. There are a couple of questions I have not approached yet. For example, if there is a generalized Bayesian solution to allow for flat priors, then, as a guess, Theil's method should be no less efficient. This is due to the fact that order statistics are always sufficient. My reservation is that it is not admissible in the case of $|\beta| Because the result is a distribution-free result, homoskedasticity, heteroskedasticity and askedasticity (eg. Cauchy distribution) is not an issue. Likewise, non-normality in residuals doesn't matter. Indeed, if the assumptions of OLS are strongly violated, then Theil's method has a higher relative asymptotic efficiency. In the case of regression on distributions on variables drawn from the Cauchy distribution, the asymptotic relative efficiency is infinitely better. Theil's method of polynomial regression should be in anyone's quiver of tools. It probably shouldn't be used much because the set of tools available is approaching mindnumbing levels, but it really is a great second best alternative and a first best in some special cases.
