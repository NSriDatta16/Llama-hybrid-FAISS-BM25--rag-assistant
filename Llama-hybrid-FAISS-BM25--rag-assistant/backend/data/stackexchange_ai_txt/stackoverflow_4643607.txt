jQuery show some content on radio select

I have 2 radio button (i.e., ) with values "yes","no" Now, I need to show a 2 other fields when someone selects "yes" I understand that I need to place them in , but when someone selects "yes", then div should show, with some highlight I need to achieve these 2 things (that I guess): showing up the div and highlighting it for some time (for user attention). Yes No Number Does anyone know how to achieve this? Thanks
