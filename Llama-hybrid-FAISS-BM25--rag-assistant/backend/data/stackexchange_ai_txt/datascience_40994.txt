I think that we should clarify that linear regression is a model in which a linear combination of features produce one output. This holds true if we work with a frequents approach, a Bayes Ian framework or a machine learning/AI perspective. For the rest neural network simply (or not simply) fit linear regression with an identity activation function. https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-neural-network-for-regression/amp/ https://datascienceplus.com/fitting-neural-network-in-r/
