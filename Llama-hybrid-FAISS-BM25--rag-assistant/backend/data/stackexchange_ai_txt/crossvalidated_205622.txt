Statistically significant differences and relationships for binary variables

I'm trying to conduct an analysis on whether or not there is a significant difference between two populations and different attributes. Population 1 = 81 observations Population 2 = 621 observations For both of these populations I have two variables: v1 = rating low, below, average, above, high v2 = score low, below, average, above, high For each of these variables I have made binary assumptions of 1 = yes, 2 = no such as observation 1 from population one has [0 0 0 1 0] --> v1 = above, and [0 0 0 0 1] --> v2 = high, I have this attribute for all of the 702 observations. I now want to find significant relationships/differences both within each population and between the populations. For example: In population 1 there are a significant relationship between v1 = average and v2 = high. And population 1 has significant higher v1 (high) vs population 2. The problem here is that I have different population sizes and I'm not sure how the handle the case that they aren't normally distributed. Does anyone have any idea how to construct such a test? Or do I have to few observations to actually be able to say anything about the data at all? Thanks in advance!
