I don't know what you're using for a physics model, but physics models that use fluid drag were recently addressed in another SO question . I won't repeat everything that I gave in my answer, I'll just link to it . To summarize, the OP for the question wanted to accelerate an object from rest to a maximum velocity. I went through a few derivations for modeling velocity as a function of time for two different types of drag. Your situation may be slightly different, so the integrals used may have different forms or need to be solved with different initial conditions, but hopefully my answer will point you in some informative directions.
