I'm afraid that there is not a ready made integration that does this yet. The plug-in that links CC.NET to TFS is available over at CodePlex but this just lets CC.NET use TFS for version control and doesn't allow the results of the builds to be published back into TFS. To get the data into TFS from CruiseControl.NET you have a couple of options. You could write your own custom TFS Data Warehouse Adapter which is complex but ultimately flexible or you could use a combination of the Team Build API and a little bit of vodoo to push data in to the TFS Build store that would also get pushed into the TFS Data warehouse. However, this would be limited in TFS2008 as you would only be able to push data about the build and the unit tests but not things like Code Coverage. That said, pushing data from CC.NET to TFS is something that I originally wanted to do. However in TFS2008 the built in build system was so good that I switched from using CC.NET to trigger the builds to using TFS to trigger and manage the build. This had the advantage that all the stats stuff was taken care of automatically (and the built in UI in Visual Studio). Because I moved to TFS2008 I then lost the motivation to get the CC.NET stuff built. If anyone wanted to contribute a TFS build result publishing feature to the CC.NET integration then feel free to join the project on CodePlex - I would love to have any help going.
