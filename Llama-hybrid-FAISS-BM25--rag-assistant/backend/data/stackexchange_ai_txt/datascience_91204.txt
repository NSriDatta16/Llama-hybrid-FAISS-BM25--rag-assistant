MCA and FAMD bad scores for UCI census dataset

Attempting dimensionality reduction on the Census-Income (KDD) Data Set . The dataset is a mixed dataset with continuous and categorical features. PCA works fine for continuous variables, reduced down to 2 PCA variables. [0.84686919 0.14737952] But having difficulties with categorical variables and cont/cat together. There are 2 options that are not working out. multiple correspondence analysis (MCA - for categorical variables) [0.022592513816454877, 0.022074753604733162, 0.01779832534650477, 0.01644525961669972, 0.013596646212654651] factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD - for continuous and categorical variables). Will add these later but they are also very low - not picking up variance in data Any ideas/tips ?
