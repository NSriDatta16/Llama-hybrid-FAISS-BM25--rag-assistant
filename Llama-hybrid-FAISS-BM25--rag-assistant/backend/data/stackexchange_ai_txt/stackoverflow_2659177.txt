WiX: Define made in included file not avaible from wxs-fragment-file

I have a defines.wxi -file which contains some good definitions used in all my wxs-files. When I attempt to reference the defined value from one of the -files I get Undefined preprocessor variable '$(var.IMAGE_FOLDER)' back in my face. I guess there is something trivial I am missing here... Any ideas? Edit 19:th April. Found that issue only occurs if reference from a Fragment-file. Re-wrote sample to match that. defines.wxi some-Fragment.wxs
