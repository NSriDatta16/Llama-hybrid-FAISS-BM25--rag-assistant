Let $t \in [0,99]$ be our rejection threshold value. In other words, if the value we rolled is $> t$ , then we stop. Then $p = 1 - \frac{t}{100}$ is the probability that we stop. This then means that on average it will take us $\frac{1}{p}$ rolls to finish. Note that when we stop, we received a value uniformly distributed over $[t+1,100]$ , which is on average $\frac{t+1+100}{2}$ . Thus, our expected profit is $$ \frac{t+1+100}{2} - \frac{1}{p} = \frac{101 + t}{2} - \frac{100}{100 -t} $$ Iterating over the values of $t$ gives us the maximum expected value at $t=86$ of $86.3571429 (which is consistent with Lynn's simulation which resulted in the same rule of >= 87). Ths analysis below is wrong, since the expected payout is incorrect. See my new answer for a fully probabilistic treatment Now then let's consider the case where the player has access to a supplementary source of randomness in order to make decisions. Now we define $t = i + r$ where $i$ is a whole number $r \in [0,1)$ is the remainder. And establish the following rule for the roll value $v$ : When $v \leq i$ , continue When $v > i + 1$ , stop When $v = i + 1$ , stop with probability $1-r$ Then the probability of stopping is $p = 1 - \frac{i+1}{100} + \frac{1-r}{100} = 1 - \frac{t}{100}$ . Given that we have stopped, the expected payout is the same as before. So the expression for the expected profit remains the same. Only now we can optimize over non-integer $t$ . Solving this gives $t= 100 - 10\sqrt 2 \approx 85.858$ resulting in a profit of $\frac{201}{2} - 10\sqrt 2 \approx 86.358$
