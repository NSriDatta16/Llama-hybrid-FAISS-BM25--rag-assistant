Magento: modifying the newsletter module

The newsletter table of magento comes with first and last name fields but in the default setup only the email address is being saved. I'd like to make use of the first name field but am having a bit of trouble locating where the record is saved. this is now what my form looks like: getFormActionUrl() ?>" method="post" id="newsletter-validate-detail"> __('Name:') ?> __('Name') ?>" class="input-text" /> __('Email:') ?> __('Sign up for our newsletter') ?>" class="input-text required-entry validate-email" /> __('Subscribe') ?>" class="button"> __('Sign Up') ?> There's a similar post but I think it's now outdates as I can't seem to locate an _prepareSave function. Can someone help in the right direction? Thanks, Billy
