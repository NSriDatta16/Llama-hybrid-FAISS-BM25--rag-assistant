One advantage of using a time trend is that you forecast panel-dependent variables for the future by projecting the time trend (linear or non-linear). This will be a problem with time dummies, e.g. to predict your dependent variable in 2024, what time adjustment is to use to forecast your dependent variable. This is especially interesting for the machine learning community who are more interested in prediction.
