Data transformation on PCA scores

I have 40 predictors on which I ran a PCA and shortlisted 14 PCs (explaining 95%) as my predictors. I am running a generalised additive model with 14 PCs as predictors. I check the model assumption of GAM which shows that my data violates the assumption of homogeneity. My question is this: (1) Can I do a data transformation of PCs scores so that my model does not violate the homogeneity assumption. I am confused because I have already done a YeoJohnson transformation on my actual data and scaled them before doing a PCA. Does it make sense to do another transformation on the PCA scores itself? (2) Homogeneity violation shows that my variance increases with increasing response value. How can I improve this?
