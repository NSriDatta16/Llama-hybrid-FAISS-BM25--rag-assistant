This is a very confusing question. We don't really know which process is writing which data, and how it's being transmitted, and which process is picking it up. There's some relevant code to see here, but I didn't see enough to tell the story. How did dataFromCrossing1 get its value? I think it would do good to organize your problem in such a way that you can ask an outsider a question about it. Possibly in the process of doing so you could stumble on the solution yourself. In principle, if you are changing string constants in your program yet you continue to see the same output, then what's happening is that The original program is still running; or all versions since the original have had errors, so the class files you once compiled successfully are running again and again; or you're not really running the program you think you're running.
