The place that the MVC really makes sense is if you already understand the underlying concepts of HTTP and Rest. If you are really seeking to leverage custom JavaScript and have a highly domain user optimized experience. If you like your web forms development with all your drag-and-drop controls and are comfortable with your user experience and your Atlas update panels, than you really should stick with it. MVC is for the rest of us that want to easily leverage .NET server side and a custom client side. It is for those who have web designers and folks who want to build custom HTML as we as have those who are accomplished programmers. If you are a solitary person (maybe the IT guy) throwing stuff together for your intranet for the front office, you may be better served by webforms. That is really where webforms and .NET shine. Some of the newer tools EF and MVC ad value for teams and larger scale development. So no, I think they complement each other.
