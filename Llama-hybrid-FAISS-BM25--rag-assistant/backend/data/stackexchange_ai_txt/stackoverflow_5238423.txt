Magento - How do I display only attributes that are assigned to products?

I have the following code, but it displays all attribute options. I want to only display those that have been assigned to a product. What would I change to do this? $attribute = Mage::getModel('eav/config')->getAttribute('catalog_product', $id); foreach ( $attribute->getSource()->getAllOptions(true) as $option){ echo $option['label']; }
