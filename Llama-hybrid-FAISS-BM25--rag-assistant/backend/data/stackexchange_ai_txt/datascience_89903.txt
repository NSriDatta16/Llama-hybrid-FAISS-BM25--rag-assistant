Dimensionality reduction to correlate large number of variables

So I have this dataset with about 750 variables (columns) and 50,000 rows of entries. I would like to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to say 25-50-100 dimensions and then compute a correlation matrix between these dimensions. I have continuous and discrete columns. I would also like to be able to know which dimensions represent which bundle of single variables in the original dataset. I should add that I have no output variable, I am just trying to find correlation in the data. Is there a way to do this in Python?
