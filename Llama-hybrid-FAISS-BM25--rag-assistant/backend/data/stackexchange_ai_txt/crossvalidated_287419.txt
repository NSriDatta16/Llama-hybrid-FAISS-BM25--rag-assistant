When generating a multivariate regression model, each term's coefficient pertains to its main effect when controlling for the effect of the other coefficients. In your described case of modeling cholesterol (continuous) with respect to age (continuous) and gender(categorical), a coefficient of .5 for age means that controlling for (this is different than ignoring) gender, for every year older an individual is, their cholesterol level increases by .5. Since your intercept is "female" for your gender variable, a coefficient of -.57 indicates that controlling for age, males have .57 lower cholesterol than females on average. If you're having a hard time with the controlling for vs. ignoring concept, I'd recommend reading through this answer. Edit: User has since changed and/or clarified their question
