Sample size estimation for MANOVA

I am trying to run a replication of a study which used a factorial design (2x2) with three DVs (dependent variables) and subsequently ran three ANOVAs to test their hypotheses. Given that the DVs in their study are highly correlated (they reflect different proportions and therefore add up to 1), I want to do a MANOVA instead. To calculate the sample size necessary for my replication I can use the effect sizes from their ANOVAs (around Eta squared = 0.03/0.05, so quite small) and compute an average N. Instead, I want to estimate a necessary sample size for a MANOVA design which has more power. Given that I don't have Pillai's trace to begin with this leads to guessing. Anybody know a better idea?
