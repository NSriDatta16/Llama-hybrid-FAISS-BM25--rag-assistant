WPF: Position form elements on Canvas or Grid?

I kind of prefer to drag controls around on a canvas via the visual studio designer, so that each control has an x and y coordinate. I find it alot faster than using a grid. But I still see alot of articles out there that use a grid for laying out controls, so that each control has a row, column. What are your thoughts on this, is my approach wrong?
