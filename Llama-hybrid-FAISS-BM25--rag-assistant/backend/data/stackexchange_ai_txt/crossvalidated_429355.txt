Is a null hypothesis which requires a minimum performance on a predictive model testable?

Given: A null hypothesis which requires a specific performance, which can be directly measured, is testable. Is a null hypothesis which requires a specific performance on a predictive model testable? (This class of predictive models is models utilizing data mining strategies. I know this is a broad class, so we can restrict this to the example below.) For example, can a null hypothesis be written which requires that a logistic regression model that predicts churn will predict at least one churn with at least 85% confidence? The specific construction of the logistic model is predefined, as are the input variables (in the hypotheses). Or, is it only possible to test for a significant relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, and the details must be left to the discussion of the results? The point is, can a null hypotheses, which is the foundation of a major class of research, require performance on a predictive model that is higher than merely establishing statistical significance?
