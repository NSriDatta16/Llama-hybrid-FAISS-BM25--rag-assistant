So how could this conversion happen? This conversion is merely called character encoding . The computer only understands bytes and humans (on average =) ) only understands characters. The computer has roughly said a mapping of all bytes and all characters which belongs to those bytes so that it can present the data in a human friendly manner. It's all software based (thus not hardware based). The operating system is usually the one who takes care about this. ASCII is one of the oldest character encodings. Nowadays we should be all on UTF-8 to avoid Mojibake .
