Setup version control for Dreamweaver CS3?

I have NEVER used ANY version control system before. I am currently using the check-in-check-out feature of Dreamweaver but I would like to implement some sort of version control system where I can roll back to previous versions. Also it would be great but not required if I could go back like 3 versions, fix a bug, and have that bug fixed for all the later versions. I have no experience with version control, mainly because I never knew about it until I started reading the pragmatic programmer. So I would probably need step by step directions so if there is a tutorial or something I can be pointed to that would be great too. Thanks!
