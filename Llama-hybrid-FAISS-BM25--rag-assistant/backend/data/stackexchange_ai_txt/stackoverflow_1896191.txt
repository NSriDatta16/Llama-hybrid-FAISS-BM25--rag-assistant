CSS Sprite now showing once uploadedhtr

http://www.keironlowe.host56.com/Website%20Testing/index.html At the bottom below the paragraph of text I have two images with hover effects one says Contact us and another says Jobs Available! These are there when I test the site on my local machine, but when I upload them to a server there not there when I load the page, the anchors are still there you can see that when you hover over them, just not the images. What's wrong?
