Constructing 95% confidence intervals on the average SD value

If I have one sample with repeated measurements I can construct a 95% confidence interval on the standard deviation using the Chi-Square distribution. What if I have multiple samples, each with their own SD value and I want an average SD value with 95% confidence intervals? Do I still use the Chi-Square distribution where the degrees of freedom are related to the number of SD values? The fact that I'm unable to find any examples online tells me that maybe this isn't something normally done. My goal is to summarize sample variability (SD/CV) from several biological replicates with a single parameter if possible.
