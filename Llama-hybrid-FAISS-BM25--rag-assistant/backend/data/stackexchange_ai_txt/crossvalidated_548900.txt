It’s not clear if the sex variable corresponds to being male or female. Let’s say it’s female. In that case, the effect for men is the crisis coefficient and the effect for women is the sum of crisis and the sex-crisis interaction coefficients. If sex corresponds to male, it's reversed. You are asking Stata to calculate predictions for the four combinations of sex and crisis, which it cannot do since the effect of sex is not separately identified from the FEs. You should use margins sex, dydx(crisis) , which will give you the AME for each group. Here's a reproducible example with a continuous-binary interaction: . webuse pig, clear (Longitudinal analysis of pig weights) . xtset id week Panel variable: id (strongly balanced) Time variable: week, 1 to 9 Delta: 1 unit . gen group = mod(id,2) + 1 . replace weight = weight*(1 + .029*week/9) if group == 2 (216 real changes made) . xtreg weight c.week c.week#i.group, fe vce(cluster id) Fixed-effects (within) regression Number of obs = 432 Group variable: id Number of groups = 48 R-squared: Obs per group: Within = 0.9852 min = 9 Between = 0.0358 avg = 9.0 Overall = 0.9321 max = 9 F(2,47) = 2294.34 corr(u_i, Xb) = -0.0006 Prob > F = 0.0000 (Std. err. adjusted for 48 clusters in id) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Robust weight | Coefficient std. err. t P>|t| [95% conf. interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- week | 6.179861 .1278409 48.34 0.000 5.922678 6.437044 | group#c.week | 2 | .3240612 .1874244 1.73 0.090 -.052988 .7011104 | _cons | 19.17099 .4685609 40.91 0.000 18.22837 20.11361 -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- sigma_u | 3.9891874 sigma_e | 2.1314439 rho | .77791824 (fraction of variance due to u_i) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ . margins group, dydx(week) Average marginal effects Number of obs = 432 Model VCE: Robust Expression: Linear prediction, predict() dy/dx wrt: week ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | dy/dx std. err. z P>|z| [95% conf. interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- week | group | 1 | 6.179861 .1278409 48.34 0.000 5.929297 6.430425 2 | 6.503922 .1370569 47.45 0.000 6.235296 6.772549 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ You can follow that up with marginsplot if you want to see these effects graphed.
