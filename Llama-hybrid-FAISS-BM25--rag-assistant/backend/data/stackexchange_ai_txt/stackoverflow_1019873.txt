i want to make a draggable image in jquery. first of all my experience with jquery is 0. having said that let me describe what i want to achieve. i have fixed width/height div. and the image contained inside the div is large in size. so i want the image to be draggable inside that div so that the user can see the entire image. can someone help. pls be a little elaborate about the procedure considering my jquery fluency.
