Handling drag and drop: view or business logic?

I have a TransferHandler class that is used to handle file drag and drop. It is applied to Swing components and as such interacts with the view. My question is as follows: In an MVC, where would this class be found in the controller part? In a mix of a layered architecture (data, biz, presentation) and MVC would this class be in the business logic or would there be a subpackage containing logic specific to the view?
