Here is one example of differentiation between classical and Bayesian statistics: when comparing two models $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_2$ , a statistic $S(\cdot)$ may be sufficient for both models, hence sufficient in a classical sense, but insufficient for model comparison as e.g. in Bayes factors, when the conditional distribution of the data given $S$ varies between models. The difference is due to the fact that the model index is a parameter from a Bayesian perspective but not a parameter from a classical one. (This is discussed further in our ABC model choice papers .)
