Understand abrupt jumps at the end of the score history of h2o deeplearning models

I train deep learning models on the fashion MNIST dataset using H2O with the R interface. My score history often looks strange: the end is jumping up or down as two different values are reported for the last epoch. Here is an example: How could the training RMSE be 0.38416 and also 0.39117 at the same time after 10 epochs? (Sometimes I get even more expressed differences where the last value is almost double of the previous one.) The same is true for other metrics as well. See the plot for the classification error: Could you please explain how rows 11 and 12 differ? Here is the reproducible code (you can download the data from here : library(tidyverse) library(h2o) h2o.init() fmnist_data
