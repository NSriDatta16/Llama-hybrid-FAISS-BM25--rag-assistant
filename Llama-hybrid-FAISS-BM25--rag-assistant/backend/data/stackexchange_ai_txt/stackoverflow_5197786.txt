Yes. If it does fail on a modern OS with virtual memory, it's usually because of a bug in the application (e.g., allocating an insane amount of memory) or a really bad fragmentation problem. If new fails, it will throw a std::bad_alloc exception. It's up to your application to decide if it wants to catch that exception and try something else. It depends a lot on the type of application. However, some people use a non-standard version of new that returns a null pointer instead of throwing an exception. You'd use the same criteria for that as you would for old-fashioned malloc . It depends on the type of allocation. Often, crashing is the appropriate thing to do if you cannot complete an allocation, so not checking for NULL can be an acceptable decision.
