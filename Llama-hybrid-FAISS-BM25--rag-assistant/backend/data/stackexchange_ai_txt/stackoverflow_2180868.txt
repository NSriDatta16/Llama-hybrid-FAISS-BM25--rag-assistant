Can a Java EE solution architect contribute in a .NET shop?

An organization I work with is heavily invested in .NET technology, including several high-traffic ASP.NET websites that are used by internal and external customers. We are looking into hiring a solution architect to support these applications and work on new initiatives. Several of the resumes coming in are from candidates whose entire working experience is Java EE. My question is, is it worth it to hire a Java EE architect when the environment we work in is primarily .NET? Are the skills transferrable?
