Domain scoring based on ranking

I am a computer science student working on a small information retrieval project. I have a dictionary with a domain as a key and it's ranking as value. Based on that ranking, I need to score every domains. I was thinking to do 1/ranking but the disparity is too high. For example the first domain will have a score of 1 (1/1) and the domain ranked 10th will have a score of 0.1 which does not make sense for this. I have 1000 domains in total and the last one should be close to 0.10 and the first one close to 1
