If you have mix of continous and categorical predictors you can use logistic regression. If you have only continuous predictors then Discriminant analysis can be used because Discriminant analysis can't have categorical predictors. Discriminant analysis can give better accuracy than logistics regression but it varies with the data and context etc.
