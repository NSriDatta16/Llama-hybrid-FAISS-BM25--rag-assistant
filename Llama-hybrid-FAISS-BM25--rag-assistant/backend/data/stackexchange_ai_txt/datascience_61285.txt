What do graphs of signal vs background neural network outputs represent?

For example, this image shows the output of a neural network I assume but I am not sure how the output is not symmetric. So if the neural network gives a .6 for signal it should give a .4 for background. This is my neural network output that is symmetric. However, I have not seen anyone else get a symmetric output like this. Does this mean that I'm doing something wrong or does it mean that the first graph is not the output of the neural network.
