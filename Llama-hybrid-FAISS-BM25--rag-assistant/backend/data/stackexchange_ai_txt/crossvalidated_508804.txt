Comparing paired percentages with a constraint

I would like to compare two variables, which are paired and both contain percentages. The sample size shall be large enough (>100), so I do not consider applying any nonparametric method. However, the data have a constraint: the summation of each variable across all samples is 100%. Meanwhile, the mean difference is always equal to 0, resulting in a non-significant finding, for example, when applying the paired t-test. I carefully reviewed each paired datum and can see many large differences. However, because of the constraint, mathematically the mean difference must be 0. I consider calculating an absolute difference in each sample, and then just applying the one-sample t-test to see whether the average absolute difference is different from 0. Nonetheless, I am not sure whether this way is adequate, so would like to look for better suggestions here. Any advice will be appreciated.
