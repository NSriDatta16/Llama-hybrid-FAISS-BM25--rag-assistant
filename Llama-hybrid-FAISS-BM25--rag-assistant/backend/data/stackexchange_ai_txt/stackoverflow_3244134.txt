I've generated javascript, SQL and Delphi many times. But mostly is basic substitution, (and the example in the post you mention looks the same), not really codegeneration in the "compiler" sense of the word. But there are also many real compilers in Pascals and Delphi like dialects. The biggest one I think is Free Pascal ( http://www.freepascal.org ), which is a compiler for Object Pascal (aka delphi) (added later:) Besides variable substitution, basic templating engines also fall in this category. Templates are sometimes easier maintainable than the same fragement code. Specially in html/cgi land this is used a lot.
