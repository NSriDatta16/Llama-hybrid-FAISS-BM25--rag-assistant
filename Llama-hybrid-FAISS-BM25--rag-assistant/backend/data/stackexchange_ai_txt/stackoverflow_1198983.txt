Sorry if I'm being dense, but I just went into firefox's Options->Content and removed all languages except German/Germany, and navigator.language hasn't changed - it's still en-GB (I'm in the UK). I'm told if I get the German INSTALL of firefox it will work, but I shouldn't need to do that, right? The useragent string still contains en-UK, too; but the accept-language on HTTP headers IS set correctly. Anyone know how to get to the correct setting?
