Should PCA or correlations be examined first in the context of correlated predictors in regression?

I'm looking for clarification: Do we have to run correlation analysis before carrying out principal component analysis (PCA), or is this implicitly subsumed under PCA framework? I am on my way to write a research plan: Isolate predictors with high collinear relationship to the process. Run PCA to convert correlated predictors to uncorrelated principal component variables. I am wondering if correlation analysis has to be done separately on the dataset in order to choose highly correlated predictors before applying PCA.
