That criticism of your approach is valid. Think of it this way: if the model thinkss that breast cancer is fairly common, it will not be so skeptical about someone having breast cancer. We can think in terms of Bayes' theorem, where the logistic regression models $P(Y=1\vert X=x)$ . $$ P(Y=1\vert X=x) = \dfrac{P(X=x\vert Y=1)P(Y=1)}{P(X=x)} $$ As you change the disease incidence (prior probability), $P(Y=1)$ , you change the posterior probability, $P(Y=1\vert X=x)$ .
