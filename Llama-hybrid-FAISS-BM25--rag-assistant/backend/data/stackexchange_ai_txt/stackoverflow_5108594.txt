Does Excel have any map or select functions?

I have a row of string values, which I'd like to do a vlookup on each and then compute the average of the results. If this were C#, I'd do a Select( str => VLookup(str,dict)).Average() , is there a way to do this in a single excel function? I'm using version 2010
