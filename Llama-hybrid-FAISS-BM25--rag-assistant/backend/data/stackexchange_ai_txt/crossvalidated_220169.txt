How do I add more training data to pre-trained deep learning net

Am kind of new to deep learning. I have however trained a number of face images and achieved relatively good recognition rate. Now my question is if my client will be taking a few more pictures daily or weekly, how will that be integrated. Or will they have to train again, is there any fast way of adding training data to a pre-trained net?
