Suppose we are in a simple situation. You have an unknown parameter $\theta$ and $T$ an estimator of $\theta$ that has an imprecision around 1 (informally). You think (informally) $\theta$ should be in $[T-1;T+1]$ most often. In a real experiment you observe $T=12$. It is natural to ask the question "Given what I see ($T=12$), what is the probability $\theta\in[11;13]$ ?". Mathematically : $P(\theta\in[11;13]|T=12)$. Everybody naturally asks this question. The confidence interval theory should logically answer to this question. But it doesn't. Bayesian statistics do answer to that question. In Bayesian statistic, you can really calculate $P(\theta\in[11;13]|T=12)$. But you need to assume a prior that is a distribution for $\theta$ before doing the experiment and observing $T$. For example : Assume $\theta$ has a prior distribution uniform on $[0;30]$ do this experiment, find $T=12$ Apply Bayes formula : $P(\theta\in[11;13]|T=12)=0.94$ But in frequentist statistics, there is no prior and thus anything like $P(\theta\in...|T \in...)$ does not exist. Instead statisticians say something like this : "Whatever $\theta$ is, the probability that $\theta\in [T-1;T+1]$ is $0.95$". Mathematically : $\forall\theta, P(\theta\in[T-1;T+1]|\theta)=0.95$" So : Bayesian : $P(\theta\in[T-1;T+1]|T)=0.94$ for $T=12$ Frequentist : $\forall\theta, P(\theta\in[T-1;T+1]|\theta)=0.95$ The Bayesian statement is more natural. Most often, the frequentist statement is misinterpreted spontaneously as the Bayesian statement (by any normal human brain who hasn't practised statistics for years). And honestly, many statistics book do not make that point very clear. And practically ? In many usual situations the fact is that probabilities obtained by frequentist and Bayesian approaches are very close. So that confusing the frequentist statement for the Bayesian one has little consequences. But "philosophically" it's very different.
