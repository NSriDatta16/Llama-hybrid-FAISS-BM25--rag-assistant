I would not use an XmlWriter. I'd use XSLT. If the XML file is to be displayed by itself, just embed a stylesheet PI into the XML: . But since IE does this automatically, I'll assume your goal is not to display XML in its own page. More likely the "raw" xml is to be displayed as part of another HTML page. In that case I'd use an XSL Transform on the server side to produce HTML from XML, then insert the output into a control. Like this: var doc= new System.Xml.XmlDocument(); doc.Load(xmlFile); var xsl= new System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform(); xsl.Load(Server.MapPath("RawXmlAsHtml.xslt")); xml1.Document = doc; xml1.Transform = xsl; And the markup is: That leaves the question of, what XSLT can you use? IE, since MSXML3, has included a stylesheet to format "raw" xml. It is sometimes accessible via res://msxml3.dll/defaultss.xsl . But this is not a XSLT standard stylesheet; it uses the Microsoft-specific WD-xsl format. It may not be what you want. I looked and found something that complies to the XSLT standard; produced by Oleg Tkachenko and shipped as part of his eXml web control . It's available under a BSD-style license. (You might even want the entire exml control - I don't know what it is.) Using that XSLT and the code above, the display looks like this: It's not quite perfect, because that stylesheet generates a full HTML page, with and tags, etc. You really just want a fragment. But you should be able to tweak it pretty easily, and anyway, it displayed properly for me, unmodified. Edit : regarding the issue I mentioned: I modified the stylesheet to just not inject the and tags. It works great.
