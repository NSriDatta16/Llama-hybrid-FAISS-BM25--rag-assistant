The approach you mentioned can only be used to solve a set of linear equations for example in the case of linear regression, but say for solving a set of non linear equations, in cases such as neural networks with sigmoid activations, gradient descent is the approach to go for. Thus Gradient Descent is a more generic approach. Even for linear equations, the size of the matrices given by the set of linear equations i huge, and can be hard to constrain the memory requirement.
