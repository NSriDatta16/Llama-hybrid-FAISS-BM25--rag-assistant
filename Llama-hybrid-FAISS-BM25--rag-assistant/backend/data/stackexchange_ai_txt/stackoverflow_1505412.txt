setContentOffset:animated: shows view background

I have a UIScrollView with with different view controllers for each page inside it. When I use setContentOffset:animated: to scroll to a different page I can see a white line between the pages. This white line doesn't appear when I scroll by dragging the UIScrollView. Has anyone seen this problem before? Any idea of what I might be doing wrong? Thanks!
