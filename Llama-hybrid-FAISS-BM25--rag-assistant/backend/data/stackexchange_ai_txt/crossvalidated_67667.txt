What is the min_density parameter in scikit-learn Random Forest/ExtraTrees for?

The ExtraTreesClassifier and Random Forest in Scikit learn library has a parameter "min_density". Its default value is set to 0.1. I cannot figure out what this min_density parameter means and how it affects the training (It is not in the docs and I cannot find its equivalent in the paper.) Can someone kindly explain the effect of this parameter on training and how to properly set it? Thanks.
