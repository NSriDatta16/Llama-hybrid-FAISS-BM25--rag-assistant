How do I expand the blue highlighted text in UIWebView?

After tap and hold and release, text is highlighted in UIWebView. The user can expand the text by dragging the dots, but is there a way I can automatically do it in code? For example, the user selects "Abraham" and I expand it to be "Abraham Lincoln".
