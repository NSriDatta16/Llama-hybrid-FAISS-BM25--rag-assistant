MSV08-C#: How do I stop two groupboxes from auto-parenting themselves when dragged on top of one another?

IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2008 Language: C# Background: I have one form and two groupboxes that are going to be used as preference catagory groupboxes. My problem is that everytime I drag one groupbox on top of the other (hide/show groupboxes upon listview catagory select), the base groupbox auto-parents the second groupbox I just dragged on top. Question: How do I stop the two groupboxes from auto-parenting themselves when dragged on top of one another? // Edit; Q) I assume you are trying to acheive a layout where you swap out the visible box? --Mitchel Sellers A) Yes I am. I know I could do it at runtime but I'd like to make that my last option in case there is a more appropriate solution.
