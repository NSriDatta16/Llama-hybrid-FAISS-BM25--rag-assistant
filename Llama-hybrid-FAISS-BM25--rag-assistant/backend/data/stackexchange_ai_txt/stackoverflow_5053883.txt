Try dropping all of the external .NET dll's into the bin directory of your website. When you add a reference in Visual Studio to a separate library or project, it will generally copy the DLL's from that project into your web site's BIN directory, but it won't always grab the DLL files that that project depends on. So if: yourwebsite.dll --> helper.dll --> helperComponent.dll --> widget.dll (where --> is a reference), when you build only helper.dll ends up in the bin directory alongside yourwebsite.dll. You generally want to get all of them in the same place. Then you shouldn't have to worry about your path or any of that stuff. Alternatively, if all of those assemblies are strongly named, you can add them to the global assembly cache using gacutil and reference them by their identifier instead of the file. This was a pretty good read about project organization. The section on 'Copy Local' plays into this. You can setup an xcopy in your Post Build events to put those 2nd and 3rd level references in the bin directory below your solution file. http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/partitioning-your-code-base-through-.net-assemblies-and-visual-studio-projects/
