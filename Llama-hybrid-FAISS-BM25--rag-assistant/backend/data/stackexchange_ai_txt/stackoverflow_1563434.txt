Detect Mouse leave stage while dragging in Actionscript 3

Event.MOUSE_LEAVE is great in Actionscript 3, but it doesn't seem to fire if the user is holding their left (or right for that matter) mouse button down. Is there a way to detect if the mouse leaves the Flash movie while the mouse is held down? Or if it is released outside the flash movie?
