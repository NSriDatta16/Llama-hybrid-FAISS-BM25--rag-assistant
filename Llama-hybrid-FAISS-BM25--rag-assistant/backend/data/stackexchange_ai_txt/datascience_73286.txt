How important is advanced SQL for data science?

Is advanced level SQL required to be competitive as a data scientist? Is it more important for a data analyst to be good in SQL? Is it enough to be able to extract data using simple SQL queries? I know it is faster to manipulate data in SQL than to copy data into R or Python, but are there any other advantages or disadvantages?
