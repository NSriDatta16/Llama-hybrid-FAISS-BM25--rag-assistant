Hide arrow in standard dropdown?

Is there a a way to hide the arrow in a standard dropdown select fieldset? Fiddle link I have an autocomplete system where you fill in the organisation number of a company and it finds the info based on a database. I'd like to have the select box, but without the arrow.. I need it to do this as it's a double function form, either you can fill in your ORG nr or just manually type it in, pretty simple, probably used all over the internet. Thanks :)
