The simulator (unlike the device itself) doesn't have to keep to the sandboxed locations. So when saving files from the simulator, you could try: #if TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR // save your files to a fixed location on your hard-disk // (like /Users/yourusername/MyIPhoneAppDebugStorage) #else // Save files normally // (to [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, // NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]) #endif That way, your large files are always at a fixed place on your harddisk when running from the simulator.
