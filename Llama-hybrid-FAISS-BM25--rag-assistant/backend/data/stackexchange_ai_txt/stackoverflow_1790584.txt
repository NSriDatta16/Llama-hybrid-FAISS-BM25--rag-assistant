Use a DOM parser e.g. for java check this list Open Source HTML Parsers in Java (I like to use cobra) Or if you are sure e.g. that you only want to parse a certain subset of your html which ideally is also xml valid you could use some xml parser to parse only fragment you pass it in and then even use xpath to request the values your are interested in. Open Source XML Parsers in Java (e.g. dom4j is easy to use)
