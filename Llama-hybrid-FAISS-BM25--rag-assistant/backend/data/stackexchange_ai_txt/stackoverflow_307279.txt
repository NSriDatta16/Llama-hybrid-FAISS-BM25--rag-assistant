log4net - want to create a log file per web application user

We are using log4net (replacing nLog) in our Asp.Net web application. nLog had a useful feature that would allow us to create a log file per user - which is helpful for organizing and locating the log statements. Does anyone have any ideas on how to do this with log4net?
