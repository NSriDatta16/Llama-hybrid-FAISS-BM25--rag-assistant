race condition algorithm

As an alternative implementation, it is proposed to use the following code fragment which has a shared int variable turn, initialised to 0. The two threads have the local int constant mine set to 0 and 1 respectively. while (turn != mine); critical_region(); turn = (1-mine); Explain clearly any possible problems and restrictions with this second alternative. i just dont get the part, "turn = (1-mine)" i mean initially, T1 will enter cause "mine" is 1. when it exits, turn will still remain 0. so T0, won't never be able to enter the critical region?
