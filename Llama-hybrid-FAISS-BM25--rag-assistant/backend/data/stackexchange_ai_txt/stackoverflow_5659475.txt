You can of course use the Bing maps control with other sources http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.com/2010/10/showing-open-source-maps-on-windows.html - although this may one day hit licensing issues. If you want to write your own map control, there are a few open source projects around - things like http://greatmaps.codeplex.com/ , http://wpfsharpmapcontrols.codeplex.com/ , http://bingmapscontrol.codeplex.com/ - but I don't know any of those with WP7 or touch support. Given the number of questions I've seen on SO asking for advanced features (like map from isloated storage), then hopefully one will come along soon!
