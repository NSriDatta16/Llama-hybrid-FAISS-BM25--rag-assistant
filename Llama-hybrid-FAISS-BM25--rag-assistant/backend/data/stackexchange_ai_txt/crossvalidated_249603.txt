Why periodically skip updating a parameter in MCMC?

I'm looking at the MCMC code of a professor doing Metropolis-Hastings update of $(\theta, \alpha, \beta)$. $\theta$ and $\beta$ are matrices. In his code, 1) He updates $\theta$ twice before updating $(\alpha, \beta)$ once. 2) He updates only a fraction of $\beta$ in each time he updates $\beta$. What are these techniques for? Since I don't know the name of this techniques, search has been fruitless. Any reference is welcome. for (i in 1:S) { # Start big MCMC loop theta
