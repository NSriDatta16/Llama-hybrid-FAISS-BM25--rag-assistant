What is the most elegant way to overload a constructor/method?

Overloading constructors and methods seems messy , i.e. simply differentiating them by the order and number of parameters. Isn't there a way, perhaps with generics , to do this cleanly so that, even if you just have one parameter (e.g. string idCode / string status) you could still differentiate them? using System; namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { TheForm tf1 = new TheForm("online", DateTime.Now); TheForm tf2 = new TheForm(DateTime.Now, "form1"); } } public class TheForm { public TheForm(string status, DateTime startTime) { //... } public TheForm(DateTime startTime, string idCode) { //... } } }
