jQuery draggable revert based on condition

I am having an issue related jQuery draggable and droppable. Here is description something what I want to do. First: I have two divs. One is and another is . "container" has 10 which are draggable and droppable into "selected". Here is code: 1 2 .... 9 10 Second: I want to allow any 5 s from "container" to "selected" div. If someone tries to add 6th , then it must not allow user to it. That is the 6th that is going to be inserted into "selected" must be reverted using jQuery draggable option revert . i.e. $("#container li").draggable({ revert: true }); Here is javascript code for that. $(document).ready(function(){ var total = 0; $("#selected").droppable({ drop: function() { total = $("#selected li").length; //alert(total); if (total >= 5) { $("#container li").draggable({ revert: true }); } else { // below code is not working $("#container li").draggable({ revert: false }); // this is making whole feature weird. I can drag all the anywhere } } }); }); This is working fine. Third: But when I drag an from "selected" to "container", the "selected" div will have only 4 s. So in this situation, later on user should be able to add another into "selected" div from "container" div. But unfortunately it is not working. All the s I try to drag and drop into "selected" are being reverted due to if (total >= 5 ) condition. Can anyone help me to solve this out using draggable revert option? Please...
