in ASP.NET application

I need to include a header and footer currently located in an asp page. The page takes the language ID and gives you the correct header for the page you are viewing. I was going thru this: http://forums.asp.net/t/1420472.aspx and this particular fragment seemed to explain it better tho I could not wrap my mind around it. Hi, instead of using include tags, you could compose your page this way: Your .NET application here You can then implement in codebehind remote header and footer download logic and set them in the Literals' Text. After downloading from the remote site, I would suggest to store the header and footer in the application's Cache to avoid too many connections to the remote server. If the same header-and-footer are shared from many pages in your project, moving this structure to a MasterPage could be useful. Kindly assist.
