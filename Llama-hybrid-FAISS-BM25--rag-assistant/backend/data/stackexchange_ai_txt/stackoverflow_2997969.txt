PostgreSQL and Amazon EBS Snapshots?

I found this article explaining how to run MySQL on Amazon EC2. It talks about using XFS as the filesystem and then leveraging EBS snapshots to create backups of the data. Does anyone know if I can do something similar using PostgreSQL? Are there changes to the SQL commands to FLUSH and LOCK the tables? Thanks!
