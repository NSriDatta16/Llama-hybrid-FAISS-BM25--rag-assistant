Atomic or Gigantic

If you are planning to write a very parallel application in C#, is it better to build things very small, like 20 small classes, making 40 larger classes, and together making 60 more, for a total of 120 or gigantic like: making these 60 classes individually (still with reusability in mind). So in #2 these 60 classes can contain methods to do things instead of other classes.
