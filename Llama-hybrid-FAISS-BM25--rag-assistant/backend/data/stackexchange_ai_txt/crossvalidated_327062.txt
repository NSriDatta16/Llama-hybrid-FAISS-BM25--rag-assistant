Selecting alpha and beta parameters for a beta distribution, based on a mode and a 95% credible interval

I want to a select both alpha and beta values using both mode and a 95% credible interval simultaneously. I can do select alpha and beta, using either a specified 95% credible interval, or a mode in conjunction with beta, but using both mode and 95% credible interval would be helpful to further refine my beta distribution. I am after a beta distribution with a 95% credible interval from 0.01 to 0.15, and a mode of 0.05, to set up a prior distribution. I can select parameters using mode the 95% CI with this R code: library(LearnBayes) quantile1=list(p=.025, x=0.01) # 2.5% quantile should be 0.01 quantile2=list(p=.975, x=0.15) # 97.5% quantile should be 0.15 beta.select(quantile1, quantile2) [1] 2.44 38.21 I can select alpha, for a given mode and beta, using the following R code, by reorganizing the equation mode = (α - 1) / (α + β - 2): # Select beta and mode - does not work if alpha + beta = 2 beta Note the change in value of alpha, as the mode with alpha = 2.44 and beta = 38.21 is not 0.05 (it's 0.037257439).
