C# SelectSingleNode with NameSpace issues

I am using C# (.NET 2.0) -- actually trying to have it working on Mac OS X using MONO (I don't think MONO is the issue) Given the following XML fragment which has been retrieved as a XmlNode from a bigger XmlDocument: N100 DJ Headphones I am trying to retrieve subcategoryName using SelectSingleNode but I simply cannot. This is my code: XmlNamespaceManager nsm = new XmlNamespaceManager(doc.NameTable); nsm.AddNamespace(String.Empty, "uuid:7E1158D2-DA42-4048-8513-66B4D48FA992"); XmlNodeList subcatList = doc.GetElementsByTagName("subcategories"); foreach (XmlNode subcat in subcatList) { html += " "; html += " "; html += " "; } I believe the issue is probably related to the way I am handling the Namespace but I have been stuck on this for hours. I have tried a bunch of similar AddNamespace declarations with no luck. Anyone out there would be kind enough to provide any pointers to where the issue is?
