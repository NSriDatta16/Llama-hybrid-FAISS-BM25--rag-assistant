To help interpret your DiD specification, it is helpful to consider the predicted value of $y_{it}$ for each of the 4 different combinations of the variables $post_{t}$ and $treated_i$ . First, consider $post_t = 0$ and $treated_i = 0$ . This corresponds to an observation from the period before treatment occurred and where you are looking at a unit which is never treated. Since the predictors multiplying the $\beta$ 's are all 0, your prediction for $y_{it}$ is just $\beta_0$ . This shows that $beta_0$ can be interpreted as the mean value of the outcome on that single day for units in the control group on days that occur pre-treatment. Second, consider the case where $post_t = 0$ and $treated_i = 1$ . This corresponds to the case where you are looking at the period before treatment occurred and you are looking at a unit which eventually gets treated (but not yet). Here, only the independent variable multiplying $\beta_2$ is non-zero. Thus, for this group, your prediction for $y_{it}$ would be $\beta_0+\beta_2$ , and hence, $\beta_2$ corresponds to the difference between the average per day value of the outcome when comparing treated with control units pre-treatment . Third, we have the case where $post_t = 1$ and $treated_i = 0$ . By the same logic as above, we have that $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ is interpreted as the mean value of $y_{it}$ on days post-treatment for units in the control group. Thus $\beta_1$ is interpreted as the difference between the per-day value of $y_{it}$ post versus pre treatment among control units. Finally, we have the case where $post_t = 1$ and $treated_i = 1$ . Again, we apply the same logic as before to get that $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ is the mean value of $y_{it}$ on days post-treatment for treated units. This shows that $\beta_1+\beta_3$ can be interpreted as the difference between the difference in the average day-level value of $y_{it}$ within the treated units comparing pre/post treatment. Then, subtracting off $\beta_1$ , this shows that $\beta_3$ is interpreted as the difference in this pre/post difference when comparing treated vs control units. Summarizing, we have that $$\begin{aligned}\beta_3 &= \left(\{\text{avg. }y/\text{day when post and treated}\} - \{\text{avg. }y/\text{day when pre and treated}\}\right) \\&- \left(\{\text{avg. }y/\text{day when post and control}\} - \{\text{avg. }y/\text{day when pre and control}\}\right)\end{aligned}$$ Note that this is subtly different from either of your interpretations. It is saying that the difference in $y_{it}$ between treatment and control on a fixed day post-treatment is on average $\beta_3$ more than the difference in $y_{it}$ between treatment and control on a fixed day pre-treatment.
