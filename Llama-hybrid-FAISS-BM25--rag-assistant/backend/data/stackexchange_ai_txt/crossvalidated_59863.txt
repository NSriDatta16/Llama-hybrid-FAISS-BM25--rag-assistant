Hopefully someone can give you a better answer, but I think the main point is this: the probabilities associated to each cluster decay, on average, exponentially for the Dirichlet process. Consider the stick breaking construction, where we let $\beta'_k \sim \mbox{Beta}(1, \alpha)$ and $\beta_k = \beta'_k \prod_{j What happens to the probability of landing in cluster $k$ as $k \to \infty$? For the Dirichlet process this goes down exponentially fast - as the table I'm asking about becomes more and more obscure (say) my probability of ending up there goes down exponentially. If $\alpha = 1$, for example, the class probabilities might go down like $\frac 1 2$, $\frac 1 4$, $\frac 1 8$, .... (this would occur if each $\beta'_k$ were equal to its expectation). For the Pitman-Yor process, however, the probability does not go down exponentially, but instead like a power law. If we interpret the tables as being topics in a topic model, and we know a priori that distributions of topics have power law tails, then we would like the probability of me ending up at obscure latent topics to go down like a power law, so the Pitman-Yor might be more appropriate.
