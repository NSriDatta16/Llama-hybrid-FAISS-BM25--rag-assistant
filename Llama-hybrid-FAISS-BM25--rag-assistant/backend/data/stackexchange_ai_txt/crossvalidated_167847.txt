Meaning of Dummy Variable

I am working on a case study from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-fire-peril Here, in the variables, there is a variable: "Dummy" about which the description says: (dummy: Nuisance variable used to control the model, but not working as a predictor.) What does it mean? PS: It is a regression problem. It has total of 302 variables out of which 300 variables have to be used in prediction.
