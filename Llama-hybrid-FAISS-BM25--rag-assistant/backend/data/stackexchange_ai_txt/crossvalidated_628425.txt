The variables argument accepts shortcuts like "sequential" , but also vectors of length two with the actual levels you want to compare. Please read the documentation, as this is clearly explained. Also, the hypothesis argument is a very flexible mechanism to compare the estimates in different rows of the output produced by any function in the marginaleffects package. In this example model, the reference category for gear is 4, the level of interest is 5, and we treat the variable as a factor. The grouping variable is cyl : library(marginaleffects) dat This gives us 3 average comparisons: comparisons(mod, variables = list(gear = c("4", "5")), by = "cyl") # # Term Contrast cyl Estimate Std. Error z Pr(>|z|) S 2.5 % 97.5 % # gear mean(5) - mean(4) 6 1.630 2.18 0.747 0.455 1.1 -2.65 5.91 # gear mean(5) - mean(4) 4 0.855 2.47 0.346 0.729 0.5 -3.98 5.69 # gear mean(5) - mean(4) 8 2.405 4.08 0.589 0.556 0.8 -5.60 10.41 # # Columns: term, contrast, cyl, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, predicted, predicted_hi, predicted_lo Now, suppose we can compare the 1st and the 3rd one. Just use the hypothesis argument: comparisons(mod, variables = list(gear = c("4", "5")), by = "cyl", hypothesis = "b1 = b3") # # Term Estimate Std. Error z Pr(>|z|) S 2.5 % 97.5 % # b1=b3 -0.775 2.57 -0.301 0.763 0.4 -5.82 4.27 # # Columns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high Edit: The development version of the package (0.16.0) supports multiple entries in hypothesis=c("b1=b3", "b2=b3")
