Understand Link Function in Generalized Linear Model

I am still trying to learn (may be the terminology issue) what does "link function" mean. For example, in logistic regression, we assume response variable is coming form binomial distribution. The $\text{logit}^{-1}$ link function convert a real number from $(-\infty, -\infty)$ (output from $\beta^{\top}x$ ) to a probability number $[0,1]$ . But how does it "link" to a binomial distribution which is a discrete distribution? I understand the "link" is between a real number to a probability number, but there is some missing part from probability number to binomial distribution. Am I right?
