No major Java compiler does any kind of optimizations (except for some constant value folding). That's usually reserved for the JVM to be done at runtime. To find out if a .class was generated with or without debug info, run javap on it using the -v flag and look for the LineNumberTable attribute. They should look something like this: LineNumberTable: line 7: 0 line 8: 8 If the class was compiled with full debugging info (including local variables), then it also contains a LocalVariableTable like this: LocalVariableTable: Start Length Slot Name Signature 0 9 0 argc [Ljava/lang/String; One compiler flag that actually influences the output is -encoding to specify the input source file encoding. Since string literals in .class files always use UTF-8, there's no way to detect the original source files encoding from the .class file.
