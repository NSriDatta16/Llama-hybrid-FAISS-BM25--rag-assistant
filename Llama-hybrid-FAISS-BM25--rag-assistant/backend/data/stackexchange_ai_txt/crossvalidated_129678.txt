Have you looked at Liblinear? It has a fast logistic regression module in c. There is a modification that allows sample weights http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/ search for sample weights for instances: then you can provide group data counts. (it is used in the python scikit_learn library without sample weights_ I am working on adding them)
