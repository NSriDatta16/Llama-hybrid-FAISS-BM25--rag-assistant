What happens in the sub-areas of AI? (ML, DL)

I have problems with understanding the sub-areas of AI and how it works. AI has the sub-area Machine Learning (ML), in which learning algorithms are used. Supervised/unsupervised learning takes place in this area. Learning algorithms are, for example: various regressions, SVM, neural network. ML also has a sub-area - Deep Learning (DL). Here the learning happens through Artificial neural networks (ANN) with hidden layers. BUT I thought neural networks are learning algorithms and we have already used them in the ML sub-area. Is the neural network in ML different from that in DL? Does DL always work with the neural network? If you work with SVM instead of neural network in ML, do you still work with neuronal network in DL? Or does DL ALWAYS work with neural network?
