Drag and drop column data to another column

In Flex, using AdvancedDataGrid, I'm trying to achieve a drag and drop of one row's column data to another row's column or the same row but different column. Is this even possible? I've been googling for hours and all I can find are drag and drop whole columns just to rearrange their view order.
