Regression Analysis with deterministic processes

Is it possible (theoretically) to perform regression analysis with data that is generated deterministically? I know this question does not make a lot of sense, because if you know that it is generated deterministically, you probably know the underlying mechanics and therefore do not need to estimate the influencing parameters. But are there any theoretical technical restrictions? To my knowledge, one simply assumes that the data are stochastic processes in the context of time series regression.
