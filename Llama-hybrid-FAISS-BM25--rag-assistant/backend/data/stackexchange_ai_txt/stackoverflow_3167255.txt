I'm not a C++ expert, but what you've described does not make any sense. Casting from an 8-bit type to a 16-bit type cannot result in uninitialized memory being incorporated into to the value--upcasts of this type have narrow, strictly-specified semantics, and the compiler can't just grab an extra adjacent byte and add it to your value. What you're describing sounds like a buffer overflow from some other part of the program. I suggest using a validation tool like valgrind (Linux) or AppVerifier (Windows) to check your memory accesses and find the buffer overflow at its source.
