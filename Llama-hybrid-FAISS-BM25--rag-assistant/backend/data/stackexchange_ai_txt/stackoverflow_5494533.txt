ajax sending request twice

Example URL: http://twitter.realgamingreview.com/index.php Edit : forgot to mention: use the test sign in: test/test for username/password. I am attempting to do a simple AJAX request to retrieve some data from a database. The target file, serverTime.php, seems to be working perfectly; it inserts the desired data and returns the desired responseText. However, the request seems to be firing twice. This is clear when I step through the JavaScript using Firebug. This causes the page to 'reset' (not exactly sure), such that my cursor loses focus from its current textbox, which is a new problem. The URL also says, "localhost/twitter/index.php?message=", even if my message is not actually empty. I want to fix this fairly minor problem before something major comes of it. The JavaScript is below. ajaxRequest is my XMLHTTPRequest object. Any help is appreciated! //Create a function that will receive data sent form the server ajaxRequest.onreadystatechange = function(){ if (ajaxRequest.readyState == 4){ document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = ajaxRequest.responseText; } } // build query string var message = document.myForm.message.value; var queryString = "message=" + message; //send AJAX request ajaxRequest.open("GET", "serverTime.php" + "?" + queryString, true); ajaxRequest.send(null); Thanks, Paragon
