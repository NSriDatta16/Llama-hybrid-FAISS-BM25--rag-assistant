Interpreting time series decomposition using TBATS from R forecast package

I would like to decompose the following time series data into seasonal, trend, and residual componenets. The data is an hourly Cooling Energy Profile from a commercial building: TotalCoolingForDecompose.ts There are obvious daily and weekly seasonal effects therefore based on the advice from: How to decompose a time series with multiple seasonal components? , I used the tbats function from the forecast package: TotalCooling.tbats Which results in: What do the level and slope components of this model describe? How can I get the trend and remainder components similar to the paper referenced by this package ( De Livera, Hyndman and Snyder (JASA, 2011) )?
