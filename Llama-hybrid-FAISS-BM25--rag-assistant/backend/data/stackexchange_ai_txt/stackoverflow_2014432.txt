PHP Bayesian Classifier

I'm looking for a Naive Bayesian Classifier for PHP, ideally something equivalent to the Reverend Bayes version written in Python. Does anyone know of such a library? Basically I need to be able to train it with a set of labels and words i.e. GOOD = okay, happy, fun; BAD = wrong, rubbish, awful etc and then pass it a string value and have it return a best guess. Reverend does this perfectly but unfortunately the app it now has to be used in is not Python based and making a bridge between the two isn't doable. Any suggestions will be much appreciated as most of the classes I've found seem to be medically orientated with just a few cases or set-up for spam filtering.
