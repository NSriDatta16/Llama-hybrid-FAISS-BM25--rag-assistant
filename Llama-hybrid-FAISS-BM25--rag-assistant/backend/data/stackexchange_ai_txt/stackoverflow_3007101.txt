There is no rule in the .NET Framework Guidelines that says that attributes should be exclusive to the kind of types for which it was designed or commonly used. Re-using them certainly helps the programmer having to memorize less class names, as long as s/he doesn't have to jump through hoops with using/Imports directives and assembly references. Not an issue with a Windows Forms control. Giving an attribute runtime behavior when it normally gets used to affect design-time behavior wouldn't be my choice however. It's Infragistics, what can I say...
