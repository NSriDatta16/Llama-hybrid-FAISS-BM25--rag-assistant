you could try word2vec, which has a nice implementation in Gensim library. It should end up having similar vectors for the abbreviation (or slang) and the full word, and certainly can be used with sent. analysis . You could train it on a large number of tweets if there is a financial set somewhere? You would then use a linear model like Log Reg / SVM etc to classify. this is a large tweet model, but I dont know if it would have a financial corpus within it of sufficient size, but it is pretty large! http://www.fredericgodin.com/software/ 400 million tweets 4Gb file
