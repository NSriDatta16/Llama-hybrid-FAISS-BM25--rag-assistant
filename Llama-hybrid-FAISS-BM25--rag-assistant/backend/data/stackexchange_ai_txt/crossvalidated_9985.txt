Let's build it! You mentioned: 1 moment generating function 2 law of iterated expectations 3 change of measure Adding: 4 Decompose random variable as a sum. Usually the sum of indicators of something. 5 Build a reccurence relation for E(X) (or a set of linear equations). Useful in Markov Chains. 6 Stopping time theorem for martingales: $E(X_{T})=E(X_{1})$ 6b Wald identity. $E(S_{T})=E(X_{1})E(T)$ 7 Kolmogorov forward/backward equation 8 Crofton 's method 9 General idea: Symmetry. Especially for "$n$ points are chosen uniformly on the $[0;1]$" problems.
