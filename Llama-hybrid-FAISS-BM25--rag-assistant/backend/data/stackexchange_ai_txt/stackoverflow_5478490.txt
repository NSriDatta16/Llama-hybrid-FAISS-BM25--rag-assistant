Old thread, but thought I'd add that I've had good experiences with Apache Commons CollectionUtils' collect method. It's very similar to the Google Collections method above, although I haven't compared them for performance. http://commons.apache.org/collections/api/org/apache/commons/collections/CollectionUtils.html#collect%28java.util.Collection,%20org.apache.commons.collections.Transformer%29
