Could you do something like take the innerHTML of the inner element and make it the innerHTML of the grandparent. So: var div = document.getElementById('lg_image'); var img = div.childNodes[0].childNodes[0]; div.innerHTML = img.innerHTML; This isn't pretty, but it's lightweight and works. The more elegant option might be to pare down jQuery or find a similar, lighter-weight library.
