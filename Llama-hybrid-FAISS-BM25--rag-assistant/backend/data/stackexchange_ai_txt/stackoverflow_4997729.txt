How to organize javascript file into smaller pieces?

I currently have one large external javascript file that is used on the page. I currently wrap the code in a self-invoking function because I have other sections that are loaded using ajax tabs, so I want to avoid naming clashes with those other external js files. The code in the file is organized like below. I would like to split some of the code inside the plannerTab namespace into smaller files, yet still have it be part of that namespace. How could I do this? Or, do you guys recommend a different approach? Thanks! // Document Ready $(function () { // initializes table plannerTab.plannerTable.init(); }); var plannerTab = (function () { // All the code for the page is in here. I would like to extract sections // from in here and put them into their own external files while still keeping // the namespacing }(); Update How could I separate parts from within the plannerTab variable into smaller external js files, and still maintain that they are part of the plannerTab namespace? A small example below. // Scope: plannerTab.config - Would like to store configuartion into a separate file var config = { selectors: { tableId: '#plannerTable', addTaskId: '#AddTask', editTaskSelector: '#plannerTable .edit', dateFilterSelector: '#plannerTable_TimeFilter li', deleteTaskClass: '.delete', searchFilter: '#plannerTable_filter', selectedDateFilter: 'selected-dateFilter', taskCellSelector: '#plannerTable .task-col', taskClass: '.taskId' }, urls: { addTaskFormURL: '/Planner/Planner/LoadAddTaskForm', editTaskFormURL: '/Planner/Planner/LoadEditTaskForm', deleteTaskURL: '/Planner/Planner/DeleteTask', getTasksByDateRangeURL: '/Planner/Planner/GetTasksByDateRange', viewTaskURL: '/Planner/Planner/ViewTask' } };
