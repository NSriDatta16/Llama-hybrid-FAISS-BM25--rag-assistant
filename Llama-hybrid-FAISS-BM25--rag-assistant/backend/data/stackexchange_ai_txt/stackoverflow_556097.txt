First and foremost you should familiarize yourself with TeX (and LaTeX ) - a famous typesetting system created by Donald Knuth. Typesetting mathematical formulae is an advanced topic with many opinions and much attention to detail - therefore use something that builds upon TeX . That way you are sure to get it right ;-) Edit: Take a look at texvc It can output to PNG, HTML, MathML. Check out the README Edit #2 Convert that messy Word-stuff to TeX or MathML?
