Combining p-values within statistical framework is a flourishing research area, mostly in genetics or in public health, when dealing with meta-analyses for example. Basically, p-value combination can be reached using two kind of methods, asymptotic and resampling-based approaches, respectively. I assume you are comfortable enough with these families of methods to move forward and present 2 good options for your case (3 actually, but the latter is just a combination of the two first). I will focus my attention on the ACAT (Liu et Lin, 2019) and minP (Westfall & Young, 1993) procedures, while providing more a practical guide focusing on general concepts. I strongly recommend you to read original papers if you want technical details. Aggregated CAUCHY Association Test a.k.a ACAT ACAT is a very recent method, initially proposed by Liu & Xie, 2019. Basically, the method is similar to Fisher's method since it is built upon a linear combination of weighted p-values. Following the original paper, correlation structure does not impact much the Type I error rate because of the heaviness of the Cauchy distribution tails. One other argument in favor of ACAT is to maximize the power by not adjusting any degrees of freedom of the test (unlike Fisher's method). Finally, by providing elegant asymptotic results from the Cauchy distribution (the sum of standard Cauchy random variables is a standard Cauchy), computation times are fast which is very advantageous in practice. The method can be implemented in your favorite programming language, but if you are working in R, the method is available here: https://github.com/yaowuliu/ACAT minP minP is a re-sampling procedure. minP is a two-stage method, using minimal p-value as test statistic (Dudoit & Van der Laan, 2008). Roughly speaking you need to resample your data to obtain your test statistic then resample them to obtain your p-values. Two advantages I see here, the resampling nature of the procedure respects your correlation structure observed in your original data (even if it's very strong), while maximizing the power by choosing the minimal p-value. Sandrine Dudoit has written lot of good papers on standard permutation-based approaches. It is worth noting that in presence of a large number of p-values, the method can be practically unfeasible, even though adaptations can be used in order to reach faster results (kurtosis adapted approaches for example, Lee et al., 2014). Hybrid approach , MinP-CCT-MinP This is the more recent method. Since I did not work with it, I will just mention that Chen, 2022 showed that minP is more powerful than ACAT under certain correlation structures, such as autoregressive models for example. The code is available here: https://github.com/zchen2020/Robust-P-value-combination-tests Finally I provide a short guide of good practices when dealing with combination of p-values. Good practices Generally speaking, in many cases, these approaches will be enough to deal with a large set of problems. If you have a large number of p-values and you do not expect large correlations across your p-values, ACAT should be a good option. You will obtain fast results with a good control in your distribution tail (small p-values). However, if you do expect strong correlations, ACAT should be not enough. Using resampling-based approaches seems the way-to-go. N.B: Recent methods use saddlepoint approximation to reach more control in distribution tails. From my knowledge, the method is not implemented for general purpose, but only for very specific applications. Finally, if you expect specific correlation structures, probably using hybrid technique will lead to powerful results with good Type I error control. Anyway, I could illustrate the pros and cons of the methods simulating some data. Let me know if you are interested. Hope this helps.
