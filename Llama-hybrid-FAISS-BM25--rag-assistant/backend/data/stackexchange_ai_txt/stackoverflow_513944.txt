ASP.NET MVC - Response.Write code - put it in the Controller, SingleFile or CodeBehind

If you are going to be generating a page as a string and outputting all the content via Response.Write at the last minute where should you put this code? I need to be able to dynamically write a bunch of JavaScript to the client to use some of the new Google visualization jsapi. I noticed this last release of the MVC framework "discourages" CodeBehinds on the Views. This is really presentation code. Where should it go? Whats the preferred method here... I was never a fan of the "SingleFile" thing.
