In SSRS 2005, the table control has, by default, three rows. The top one is for a header, the bottom one is for footer, and the middle one is for data. Looking at your example, it appears you dragged the records value into a new column in the middle row, and it automatically added a header for you. Instead, drag it into the bottom row. You can type "records" into the leftmost column of the footer, and whatever data set field you have for the records count into the 2nd column. In SSRS 2008, you have the Tablix control. It defaults to a Header row and a Data row. Right-click on the data row, and select Insert Row -> Outside Group - Below. Then you have a footer row that you can add to the same way was in SSRS 2005.
