if you have any intent to create something useful, that is, something more than a hobby, yes learn C first, or even better spend some time learning how modern computer architectures actually work before spending any time telling them what to do. it can be argued that javascript has little to nothing to do with C but C will force you to learn how things really work and therefore provide invaluable insight into performance, data storage and teach you what actually happens when you call some random library call that may be taking many orders of magnitude more time to execute than it needed to.
