Getting rid of CoffeeScript's closure wrapper

How can I omit the automatic closure wrappers that hides my variables from the global scope? (function() { // my compiled code }).call(this); Just playing around with CoffeeScript+SproutCore, and of course, I'd prefer to leave the scope as it is: in this case there is no need to protect anything from overwriting. I know I can use @ or this. at the declaration, but that's not too elegant.
