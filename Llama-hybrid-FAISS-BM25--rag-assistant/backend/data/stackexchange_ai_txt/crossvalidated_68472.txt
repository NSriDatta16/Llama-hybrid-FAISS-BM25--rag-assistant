LGOCV caret package R

i am learning data mining through book . During classification chapters about Neural Networks the authors have below code. I have below questions: ## pre2008 LGOCV - when do we use it? I read the post , but still not clear. the post says that it is a variant of LOOCV for hierarchical data. but my Y variable is not hierarchical :( twoClassSummary - can it be used only when we have two classes? can i used it for say Iris data? LGOCV is also known as Monte-Carlo Cross Validation. More details are available here .
