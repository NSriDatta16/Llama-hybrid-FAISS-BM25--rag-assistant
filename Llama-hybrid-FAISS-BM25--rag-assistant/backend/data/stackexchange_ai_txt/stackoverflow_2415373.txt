Small block allocator on Linux (or RedHat Linux) to avoid memory fragmentation

I know that there is an allocator for user applications than handles lots of small block allocation on HP-UX link text and on Windows XP Low-fragmentation Heap . On HP-UX it is possible to tune the allocator and on Windows XP it considers block of size less than 16 K as small. My problem is that I can't find any information about this kind of allocator for user programs running on Linux (RedHat Linux actually). If there is such an allocator I actually would like to find what maximum size of blocks it can handle. Update I have found jemalloc ( http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/ ). It handles small, large and huge blocks: http://www.canonware.com/download/jemalloc/jemalloc-latest/doc/jemalloc.html#size_classes .
