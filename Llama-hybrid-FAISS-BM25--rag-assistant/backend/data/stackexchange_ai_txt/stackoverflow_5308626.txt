Without seeing the code it is hard to know precisely, but in general terms, you need to look at the procedure which checks the session and explicitly initialise the magento session when the button is clicked. One thing to note: If the buttons are on another domain, you may have problems with the session being transferred from one to another, which will make PCI compliance a little more tricky. My advice would be to take a look at the API to see how you can connect into your Magento application in a clean way.
