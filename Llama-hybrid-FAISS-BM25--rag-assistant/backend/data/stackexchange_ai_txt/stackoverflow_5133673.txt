You need to provide different XML Layouts for different devices / screens. For Gingerbread (Android 2.3) there are a total of 8 different supported screen sizes. You can do this, by creating multiple layout folders in your res folder. Rename your current layout folder to "layout-normal-hdpi" (for WVGA800 on a normal sized screen). Create a new Folder "layout-large-mdpi" (for WVGA800 on a large screen). Both folders are for devices with a WVGA800 resolution, but with different physical sizes of the screen. Copy your layout XML file from the "layout-normal-hdpi" to the "layout-large-mdpi" and change the button positions, so that it will look the way you want it to look on a devices with a larger screen. Android will automatically choose the correct layout, depending on the hardware of the device. Please be aware, that the 2 XML files should have exactly the same name, only the name of the folder they are in should be different. For more Information on other screen sizes and resolutions that are supported, take a look at http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html .
