In Visual C# 2010 Express, how do I add dots to the forms and see how big labels are?

I'm trying to learn how to make databases, using C# as the "master language". I've installed Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express, created an application, etc. There's a bit of a problem though. The form on the GUI developer doesn't look normal. Usually on these things you'll see dots evenly-spaced all across the form. Also when you drag, let's say, labels on to the thing, it's pretty easy to gather exactly how big they are in both dimensions in most other IDEs. Lastly between the dots and the ease of visibility - and control - of the sizing of labels, you can usally line labels, textboxes, and other stuff up pretty easily. In this IDE that's not quite the case. They've taken away the "coordinate dots", they've made the positioning of everything much more precise, you can't clearly see how big a label is after you put it down, etc. My question is this: How, if possible, could I switch the thing to the more traditional style in those regards? I know my wording on this may be hard to follow. I don't know the exact terminology of some of this stuff. Thanks!
