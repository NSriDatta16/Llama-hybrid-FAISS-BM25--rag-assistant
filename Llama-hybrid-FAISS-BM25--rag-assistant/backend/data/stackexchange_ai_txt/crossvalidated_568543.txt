The same condition happened to me many times. I believe it is normal to get such results, as cross validation score is basically a "test score". It is also the average of the k-folds so it is a more stable score than just the final test score, which is a single score. So, for me it is okay to get such result. But I fear it is a little an opinion, rather than a concrete answer.
