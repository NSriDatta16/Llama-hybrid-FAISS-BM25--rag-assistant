what is the meaning of 'normality' as a difference between parametric and nonparametric method?

I'm so confused of the definition of the terminology, "normality". I mean, normality of what? According to central limit theorem, regardless of the distribution of population,the computed values of the average will be distributed according to the normal distribution, which allows us to do statistical analysis. However, lots of sources of information say that in order to do the parametric method which includes most of the statistical analysis we conduct, the data should follow normal distribution. In my view at this point, tho arguments don't agree, and they contradicts to each other. I want to specify the term, 'normality' of data.
