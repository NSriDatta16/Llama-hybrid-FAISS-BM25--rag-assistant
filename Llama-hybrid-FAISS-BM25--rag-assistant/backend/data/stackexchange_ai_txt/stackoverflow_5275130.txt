I got this problem a couple of times and done different things to fix it. When I got it this time all I did to stop getting "unable to connect to asp..." error, was rename the web app folder directory from xpCal to xpCal2. I also tried moving the web app directory to a different directory from C:users\ \desktop\ to C:\users\ \desktop\new folder and it also worked. I don't know why it worked, does VS 2010 keep information about web apps seperate from web apps folder.
