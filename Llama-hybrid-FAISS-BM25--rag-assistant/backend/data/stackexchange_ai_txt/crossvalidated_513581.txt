Decoder of variational autoecnoder

From various explanation (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaqyVS9-rM ), the decoder part of variational autoencoder corresponds to p(x|z) (or p(x_i|z_i)). However, if we fix z (sample a particular z from latent space), then the output is fixed instead of a distribution. So why does it corresponds to p(x|z)? Thanks in advance.
