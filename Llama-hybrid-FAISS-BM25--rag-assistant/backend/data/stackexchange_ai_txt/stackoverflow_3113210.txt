TypeLoadException occurred when drag-and-drop a User Control into VS Designer

I created a customized ListView class, BinableListView, which inherits from ListView. I was able to drag and drop the custom ListView into a Form in the designer window. Now, I am trying to add the custom ListView in another User Control first, and add that User Control into the form. However, VS displayed TypeLoadException when I drag and drop the User Control into the Form in designer. Does anyone has suggestion what might have happened? I am using Visual Studio 2008 targeting .NET runtime 3.5.
