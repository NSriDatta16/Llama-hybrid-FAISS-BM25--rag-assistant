Multiple objects in touchesbegan?

I am trying to have multiple objects in a touchesbegan method (2 UIImageViews) I am using the below code but isn't working. No errors but the location is just messed up. What should I do instead? - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if (image1.image == [UIImage imageNamed:@"ball.png"]){ CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; image1.center = location; } if (image1.image == [UIImage imageNamed:@"ball2.png"]){ CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; image2.center = location; } }
