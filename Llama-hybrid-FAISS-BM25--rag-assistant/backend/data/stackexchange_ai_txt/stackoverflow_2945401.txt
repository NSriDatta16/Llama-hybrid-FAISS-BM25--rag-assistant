For network sniffing, use pypcap to capture network traffic. pypcap is a Python interface to libpcap (WinPcap on Windows), which is used the popular network sniffer Wireshark (once known as Ethereal). Regarding process information, such as whether it is running and finding all of its open windows, I'm pretty sure you can do this with the Windows API. This means that you can do it in Python using the win32 library which lets you use most of the Windows API directly. So this now becomes a Windows API question, with which I can't help. Please ask just one question per, umm, question.
