Why is phase reconstruction considered hard

I am studying deep learning models for single channel speech separation. I come across several recent methods: Permutation Invariant Training Deep Clustering Deep Attractor Network All of these methods are using "masked" approach. This breaks down to: Perform STFT on mixture signal to obtain spectra, then separate phase and power spectra. Use power spectra of mixture as input feature, this drops phase information. Feed input into a deep network, obtain some masks, typically within $[0.0, 1.0]$. Multiply these masks with mixture power spectra to obtain power spectra of (estimated) separated signal. Combine obtained power spectra with phase from mixture to reconstruct separated signal. Why using masks? Why not estimate complex valued spectra directly?
