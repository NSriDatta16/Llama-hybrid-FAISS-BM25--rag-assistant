I want to know if it is possible to get the churn prediction probability at individual customer level & how by random forest algorithm rather than class level provided by: predict_proba(X) => Predict class probabilities for X. I think the predict_proba(X) is actually the correct method to accomplish your task. For each instance (person) the function will display the probability for each class label. So, if you know which class is churn, I'll just assume class 1, you just need to slice the results on that column. For example: from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from tabulate import tabulate X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=50, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=1, shuffle=False) clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=2, random_state=0) clf.fit(X, y) train_class_probability = clf.predict_proba(X) print(tabulate(train_class_probability[0:4], ['Churn', 'No Churn'])) NewData, y = make_classification(n_samples=10, n_features=50, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=1000, shuffle=False) class_prediction = clf.predict(NewData) class_probability = clf.predict_proba(NewData) print(tabulate(class_prediction.reshape(-1, 1), ['0 - Churn / 1 - No-Churn'])) print(tabulate(class_probability, ['Churn', 'No Churn'])) # Just print the first column, Churn print(tabulate(class_probability[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1), ['Probability of Churn'])) Output will be: Class Probabilities of the Training Data (First four instances) Churn No Churn -------- ---------- 0.595298 0.404702 0.620975 0.379025 0.601251 0.398749 0.610663 0.389337 Class Prediction on New Data 0 - Churn / 1 - No-Churn -------------------------- 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 Class Probability Prediction on New Data Churn No Churn -------- ---------- 0.553698 0.446302 0.602109 0.397891 0.587715 0.412285 0.423982 0.576018 0.419588 0.580412 0.419984 0.580016 0.369798 0.630202 0.572373 0.427627 0.414734 0.585266 0.40422 0.59578 Probability of Churn on New Data Probability of Churn ---------------------- 0.553698 0.602109 0.587715 So, the probability that "new customer #3" will churn is ~59% and the probability that "new customer #4" will churn is ~42%. Hopefully, I have understood your question. HTH
