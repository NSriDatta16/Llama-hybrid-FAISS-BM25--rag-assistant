Regression does not apply to data that is autocorrelated i.e. time series data or spatial data. http://autobox.com/dave/regvsbox.pdf (which I authored) discusses issues/differences/opportunities/pitfalls when dealing with time series that your possible regression solutions may be ignoring. Training and other related questions are valid questions when you are using appropriate methodology.
