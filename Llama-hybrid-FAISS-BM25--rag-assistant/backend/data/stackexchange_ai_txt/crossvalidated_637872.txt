Tightness of rejection sampling

Hello. I'm studying the Monte Carlo Statistical Method textbook by Robert and Casella. I have a question about exercise problem 30 in Chapter 2. I've already solved parts (a)-(c), but I'm having difficulty understanding part (d). According to part (a), a smaller M leads to a larger acceptance rate, so isn't that desirable? Despite a low acceptance rate in part (d), could there be a better situation? I would like to gain some intuition about the problem.
