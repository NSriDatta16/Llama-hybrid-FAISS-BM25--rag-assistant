Block based animation?

In apple documentation setAnimationRepeatAutoreverses: Sets whether the animation of property changes within an animation block automatically reverses repeatedly. Use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later. You should use the block-based animation methods instead. They mentioned like this... But my app supports from 3.0 or later. Do i need to use two separate codes( one for 3.0 and blocks above 4.0). How to accomplish this?
