How to get the overlay to display for jquery ui modal dialog?

In the demo , the overlay is displayed correctly and all elements underneath the overlay are disabled: However, when I use the code in my page, I can still access the other controls underneath the overlay. Any ideas on how to fix? I've been looking at the documentation and don't see much regarding overlay implementation. My code: $(" Error: " + message + " ").dialog({ resizable: false, modal: true, draggable: false });
