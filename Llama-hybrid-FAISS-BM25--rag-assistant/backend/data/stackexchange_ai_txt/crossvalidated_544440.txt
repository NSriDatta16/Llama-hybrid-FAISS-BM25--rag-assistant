I think it boils down to that, following your example, a count of 14 events over 400 person-years, gives a Poisson rate parameter estimate of 0.35 events per person-year. So if you were to track one person over a year, you'd have a 70% chance of observing no events, 25% of one event, 4% of two events, & so on; on average 0.35 events, but no non-integer counts. It's a consequence of the memorylessness of the Poisson process & that the sum of independent Poisson random variables is a Poisson r.v. with a rate equal to the sum of their individual rates.
