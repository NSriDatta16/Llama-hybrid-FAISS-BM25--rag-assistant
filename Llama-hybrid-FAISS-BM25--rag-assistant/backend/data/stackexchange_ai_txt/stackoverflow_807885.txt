reference DLL from app across .NET versions... possible?

Our organization's software is compiled for the .NET 3.5 Framework. We have some customers who wish to plug into our libraries, but insist on using older versions of Visual Studio (that preceded .NET 3.5), such as VS 2003. Is there a way for those customers to plug into our application, despite the fact that they're using older versions of Visual Studio (and therefore, older versions of .NET)? Currently, when they try to reference our assemblies, they get an error (which they didn't care to specify, unfortunately). Is this possible? Any experience with this?
