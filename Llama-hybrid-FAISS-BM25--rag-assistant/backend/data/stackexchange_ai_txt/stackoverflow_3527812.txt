This isn't what JUnit does. JUnit has a design philosophy that emphasizes independent unit tests. As such, it isn't a natural framework for system tests. What you want to do fits nicely into TestNG (which as a design goal tries to straddle both unit and system tests). In JUnit the @Before and @After are run before and after each test. You can shoehorn this kind of thing into JUnit using a Suite, which references all of your tests and is responsible for all setup and teardown, so the Suite's @BeforeClass and @AfterClass methods get run before and after the suite, which if you organize it correctly could be all of your system tests. There are lot of organizational challenges in the code when it gets large with the JUnit approach, so I would suggest you consider and alternative framework if this is the bulk of what you want to do.
