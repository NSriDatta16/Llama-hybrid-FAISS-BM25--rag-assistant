A weighted average is usually done something like: newRed = (curRedA * redWeight + curRedB * (1 - redWeight)); ...where redWeight is in the range [0, 1], and represents the weight (or bias) towards red values in the 'A' array. It also represents the inverse of the bias toward the red values in the 'B' array.
