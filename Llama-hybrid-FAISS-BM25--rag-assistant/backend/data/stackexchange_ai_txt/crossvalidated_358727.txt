Not a lot of data here, so you'll get a pretty generic answer. If your data is a time series (related to itself over time) then there are methods for identifying trends and seasonality or cycles to help with prediction. Check out: https://otexts.org/fpp2/ for a bunch of techniques. If your data isn't a time series (doesn't relate to itself and only to other variables), or if another variable can be used as an alias for time, then you can use a more simple technique such as simple linear regression.
