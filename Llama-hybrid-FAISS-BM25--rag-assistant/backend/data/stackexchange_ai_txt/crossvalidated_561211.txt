Mix of numerical and categorical features - to scale or not to scale?

I have the means of my features like this of an employee dataset: avg_score salary tenure bonus avg_hrs_month mean 0.651826 2.017505 6.556184 0.212055 184.661571 It is obvious to scale 'avg_hrs-month'. however, the bonus feature is binomial (0 or 1), and salary has been autoencoded as (1,2,3), and tenure is a sequence of numbers (3,4, 5,6,7,8,9,10). Is it advisable to apply autoscaling to all of them? for a linear classification model such as sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression, or sklearn.svm.LinearSVC?Â¶ for a decision tree-based model such as ensemble.RandomForestClassifier([...])? It is a a binary classification problem (yes or no). thank you very much.
