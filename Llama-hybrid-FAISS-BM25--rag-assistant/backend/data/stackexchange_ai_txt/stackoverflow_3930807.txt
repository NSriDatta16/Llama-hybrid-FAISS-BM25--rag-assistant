You use animation for a movement that has a distinct start and stop point. For example you might move the image right to left at a button push. It would slide a cross the screen and then appear back at its original position. If you wanted to move things around this way you could do so by having 2 (or more) copies of the same view.. hiding the view at the old position and showing it again at the new one. You generally won't be stopping this animation between its begin and end point. If you want some more interactive movement (say move along with the user's finger on the screen), you'll need to make use of the canvas and some touch listeners. In that case I recommend looking up drag and drop samples as they address what is needed for this to happen (and then some).
