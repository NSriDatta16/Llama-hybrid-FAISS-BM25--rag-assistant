You can already make reasonable guesses about the periods of patterns - you're looking at things like weekly and monthly. To look for weekly patterns, for example, just average all the mondays together and so on. Same goes for days of the month, for months of the year. Sure, you could use a complex algorithm to find out that there's a weekly pattern, but you already know to expect that. If you think there really may be patterns buried there that you'd never suspect (there's a strange community of people who use a 5-day week and frequent your business), by all means, use a strong tool -- but if you know what kinds of things to look for, there's really no need.
