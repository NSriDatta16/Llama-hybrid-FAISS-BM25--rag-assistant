class Organization :addressable has_many :members, :class_name => "User" end class User :addressable belongs_to :organization end class Address true end I have removed the admin association, partly because it didn't work anyway, mostly because as Jaime said it is the wrong way to go about it (most developers use some sort of roles system). See Jaime's post for a good way about creating an extendable role system. Hope this helps you out!
