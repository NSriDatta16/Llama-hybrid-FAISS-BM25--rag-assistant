R/ggplot error: too large for hashing

I'm plotting a time series graph using ggplot, however whenever the size of the data frame is greater than around 600, ggplot throws the following error: Error in anyDuplicated.default(breaks) : length 1136073601 is too large for hashing In fact, it just gave me the same error when I try to plot 400 items. The data is melted like so, except there are four variables- speed, dir, temp and pressure: time variable value 1 2006-07-01 00:00:00 speed 4.180111 2 2006-07-02 00:00:00 speed 5.527226 3 2006-07-09 00:00:00 speed 6.650821 4 2006-07-16 00:00:00 speed 4.380063 5 2006-07-23 00:00:00 speed 5.641709 6 2006-07-30 00:00:00 speed 7.636913 7 2006-08-06 00:00:00 speed 7.128334 8 2006-08-13 00:00:00 speed 4.719046 ... 201 2006-07-01 00:00:00 temp 17.140069 202 2006-07-02 00:00:00 temp 17.517480 203 2006-07-09 00:00:00 temp 14.211002 204 2006-07-16 00:00:00 temp 20.121617 205 2006-07-23 00:00:00 temp 17.933492 206 2006-07-30 00:00:00 temp 15.244583 My code to plot these is based on what I found here: http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/scale_date.html qplot(time,value,data=test3,geom="line",group=variable) + + facet_grid(variable ~ ., scale = "free_y") Any pointers and I'd be very grateful!! To massage the date from character to date i'm using: test$time class(test$time) returns "[1] "POSIXt" "POSIXct""
