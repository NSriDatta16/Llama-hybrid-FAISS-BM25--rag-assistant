Random walk on cube with condition of not returning

An ant is placed in a corner of a cube and cannot move. A spider starts from the opposite corner, and can move along the cube's edges in any direction (x,y,z) with equal probability 1/3. On average, how many steps will the spider need to get to the ant given that it will give up if it reaches back to its starting point at any point of time? This question is similar to Random walk on the edges of a cube . How do I accommodate this condition into the equations? This sort of suggests (0,0,0) being an absorbing state but I'm not sure how to tackle this question.
