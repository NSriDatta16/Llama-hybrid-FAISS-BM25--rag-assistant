How are error terms calculated for moving average model in R

For an ARIMA (0,0,1) model, I understand that R follows the equation: xt = mu + e(t) + theta*e(t-1) (Please correct me if I am wrong) I assume e(t-1) is same as the residual of the last observation. But how is e(t) calculated? For example, here are the first four observations in a sample data: 526 658 624 611 These are the parameters Arima(0,0,1) model gave: intercept = 246.1848 ma1 = 0.9893 And the first value that R fit using the model is: 327.0773 How do I get the second value? I used: 246.1848 + (0.9893*(526-327.0773)) = 442.979 But the 2nd fitted value given by R is : 434.7928 I assume the difference is because of the e(t) term. But I do not know how to calculate the e(t) term.
