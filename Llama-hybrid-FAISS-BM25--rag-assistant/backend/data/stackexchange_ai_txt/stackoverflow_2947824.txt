Swapping switch-case in extra fle/data structure (Java)

it may be a nooby question, but I've never needed it before: I have several strings and I want to compare them to given ones... At first glance it would lead to a switch/case construction in what every available entry is checked. Is there a more elegant way to swap those strings as key/value datas? greets, poeschlorn
