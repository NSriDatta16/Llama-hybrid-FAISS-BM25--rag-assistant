On the .php page handling the post ("send_form_application.php" in your case),handle all incoming form fields in the following way: 1) Create variables to store each of your incoming form fields... ... $name = $_POST["name"] $primary_org = $_POST["primary_organization"] $primary_pos = $_POST["primary_position"] .. ETC... 2) Create an email body string variable to hold all these values however you want to... 3) Then use php's mail functionality to email the info to yourself... More info here-> http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php Hope that helps!
