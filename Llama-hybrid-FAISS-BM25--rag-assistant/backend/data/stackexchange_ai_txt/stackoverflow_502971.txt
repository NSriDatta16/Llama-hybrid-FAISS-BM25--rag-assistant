Eclipse not showing images in JavaDoc view

For some reason images are not visible in my Javadoc view of Eclipse. no images visible http://shlinkr.com/images/CropperCapture-12.Png But the same Javadocs work perfectly fine in a browser: images visible http://shlinkr.com/images/CropperCapture-13.Png Has something gone a little screwy with my instance of Eclipse? Do I need to change a setting or something? Ideas? Update: In this instance I'm using 3.4.1 (Ganymede), but I just opened the same project up in 3.3 Europa and it has the same problem.
