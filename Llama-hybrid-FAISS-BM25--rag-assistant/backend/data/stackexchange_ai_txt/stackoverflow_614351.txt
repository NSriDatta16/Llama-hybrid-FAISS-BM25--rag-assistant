How to change Drupals menu alternatives for creating a page

I have a Drupal site with Organic Groups and I want one group to be able to access the menu options and place the page in the primary_links menu where ever they want. The other group shouldn't be able to access it at all. I have accomplished some of this with privileges, but the user who has access to the menus have access to all menus. I just want them to have access to the Primary Links menu. How can i make this happen?
