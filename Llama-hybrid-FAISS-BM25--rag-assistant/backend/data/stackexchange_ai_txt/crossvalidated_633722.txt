Bayesian Methods for Causal Inference with Observational Panel Data

How comprehensive is the toolkit for Bayesian inference when trying to make causal inferences with observational panel data? I can see an easy application with the incorporation of fixed effects or the ADL model, but these models have well-documented problems. I also understand that there are Bayesian applications for difference-in-differences and synthetic controls, but each methods are generally suited for very particular designs (parallel trends for DID, one/few treated units for synthetic control, one (preferably) time period of treatment for both, etc.) Two methods that I have grown fond of are panel matching and marginal structural models. However, the developers of the {PanelMatch} package, to my knowledge, have not implemented a Bayesian framework for their methodology. In addition, it seems the development of a Bayesian marginal structural model is in the works , but is not yet complete. Say that I have N > 50 units and T > 20 time periods where treatment statuses can change over time, there is no initial timing when treatment is assigned to all treated units, and I want to operate under a Bayesian framework to attempt to estimate a causal effect of treatment. What would one do under this scenario?
