If it has more than three branches, generally this means that a function or method should be broken apart, to encapsulate the branching logic in different methods. Each for loop, if statement, etc is then not seen as a branch in the calling method. Cobertura for Java code (and I'm sure there are other tools for other languages) calculates the number of if, etc. in a function for each function and sums it for the "average cyclomatic complexity". If a function/method only has three branches, it will get a three on that metric, which is very good. Sometimes it is difficult to follow this guideline, namely for validating user input. Nevertheless putting branches in different methods aids not only development and maintenance but testing as well, since the inputs to the methods that perform the branching can be analyzed easily to see what inputs need to be added to the test cases in order to cover the branches that were not covered. If all the branches were inside a single method, the inputs would have to be tracked since the start of the method, which hinders testability.
