Are you maintaining the session id in your flex application, and sending it along with new requests? Can you test & confirm that the same session id is being returned from your PHP scripts on each request inside Flex? Are you persisting the session id in a cookie outside of your flex application? If not, you will lose your session id on page refresh. You'll need to store in local storage or in a cookie, and access this when your flex application starts.
