It's very hard to give any meaningful answer without knowing why you don't like clickonce. Personally, I find that while clickonce isn't great for all deployments, it is very good for many - and in many cases it isn't adopted because developers don't know how to configure for it or get the most from it. If you really can't use clickonce, take a look at Google's project omaha , which is a neat auto-updater that is already installed on any windows machine running Chrome. And finally, if you are going to roll your own, I would probably not suggest storing it in SQL Server without first checking to see how this would affect your backup and replication strategies, at the least. I don't really see what advantage you would get over a HTTP, UNC, FTP, or similar storage area.
