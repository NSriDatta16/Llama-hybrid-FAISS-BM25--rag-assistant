AUC and Variable Selection

I am running into something I have not experienced and am a little confused. I have a set of about 60 predictor variables that I have manually picked from a large set. I have been running algorithms such as random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting, and neural networks. With the set of 60 variables I was achieving AUC values of around 70% for all algorithms. I then ran a Bourta algorithm to find important variables. After removing the variables of unimportance, I now have 26. I reran the same ML algorithms and am now receiving AUC values of 1 and .995 for logistic, gradient boosting, and random forest which I figure is not correct. However, neural networks AUC went down to 50%. I may be missing something obvious. Has anyone experienced this before or can explain what is happening?
