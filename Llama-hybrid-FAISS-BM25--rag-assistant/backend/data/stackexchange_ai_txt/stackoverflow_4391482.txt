Magento WSDL and products

So, I have a product that has custom options. In this case, its color. Now I'm going to be importing all of the stores product listings from a large xml file, so that is what I chose to use custom options, and not attributes. Now, I'm doing most of those from the magento api webservice. So I have the following. $products = $api->soap()->call( $api->session(), 'catalog_product.list' ); foreach($products as $product) { print_r($product); echo " "; } Now I can see what product has custom options from the 'has_options' field. But how do I view the custom options? The 'options_container' field has a value of "container2", what am I suppose to do with that? Also, when creating products using the magento api webservice..... $api->soap()->call($api->session(), 'catalog_product.create', product_array_values); How do I generate custom options for the products?
