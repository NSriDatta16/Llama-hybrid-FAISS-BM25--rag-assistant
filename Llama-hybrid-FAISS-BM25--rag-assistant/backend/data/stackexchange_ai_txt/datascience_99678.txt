The genetic algorithm are one the most popular evolutionary computing methods that invented by John Holland, in the University of Michigan, in 1960 but won't become popular until the 90's. Their main purpose is to be used to solve problems where deterministic algorithms are too costly. Genetic algorithm fall under metaheuristics that are high level search strategy which are problem independent and can apply to wide range of problems. These algorithm are far different from machine learning methods and mostly use to solve optimization problem in science and engineering. However, application of genetic algorithm will not limit to optimizations. Incorporation of machine learning on genetic algorithm are common practice aimed to improve the GA performance. On realm of machine learning, when ever you seek to compute an optimal value in polynomial time, always and always genetic algorithm is a viable choices due to its agile and robust search capabilities. Hence, genetic algorithm can use as computational tools in machine learning. Please let me know if my answer is clear enough.
