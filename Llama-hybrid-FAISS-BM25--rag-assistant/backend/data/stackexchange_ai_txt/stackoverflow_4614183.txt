PHP cURL loading delay

My problem is, I need to cURL-load a page that uses Ajax-based search, to get results of that search. And I need to organize a delay between curl_exec() and value returning. In other words, I need to execute curl_exec() for no less than 5 seconds. sleep() seems to stop curl execution and does not work. Will greatly appreciate any hint or clue UPD I don't know how, but on this page http://vkontakte.ru/gsearch.php?section=video&q=sample&name=1 , but it requires an account to access curl DOES capture the search made by ajax. But if page tooks too long to load, Ajax returns "action was too fast" error. So I just need to prolong curl execution. Sorry if being unclear.
