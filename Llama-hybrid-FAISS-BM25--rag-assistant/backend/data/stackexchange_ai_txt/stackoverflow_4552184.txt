Fuzzy logic is advisable when the variables have a natural shape interpretation. For example, [very few, few, many, very many] have a nice overlapping trapezoid interpretation of values. Variables like color might not. Fuzzy variables denote degree of membership, that's when they become useful. Regarding machine learning, it depends on what stage of the algorithm you want to apply fuzzy logic. It would be better applied in my opinion after the clusters are found (using traditional learning techniques) to determining the degree of membership of a certain point in the search space on each cluster, but that doesn't improve learning per see, but classification after learning.
