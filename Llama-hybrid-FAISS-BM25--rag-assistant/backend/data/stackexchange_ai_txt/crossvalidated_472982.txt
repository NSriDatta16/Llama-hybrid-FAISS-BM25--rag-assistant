Boxplot outliers (according to your 1.5 IQR rule) are characteristic of many common distributions. For example, among normal samples of size 100, there is on average about one boxplot outlier per sample, and over half of such samples have at least one outlier. nr.out=replicate(10^6, length(boxplot.stats(rnorm(100))$out)) mean(nr.out) [1] 0.924752 mean(nr.out > 0) [1] 0.521987 Here are boxplots for 20 normal samples of size 100. Same for samples of size 100 from an exponential population.
