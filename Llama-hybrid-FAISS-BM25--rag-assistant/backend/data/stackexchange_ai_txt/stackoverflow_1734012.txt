NAnt as a project is dead, or on life support (last release was 0.86 beta 1, two years ago). It was basically cut short by the release of MSBuild. NAnt was nice, MSBuild is OK I guess, but I feel more and more drawn to write code in, well, a language instead of some XML-based procedural stuff. With XML-based build frameworks the debugging experience is awful and you end up cheating by embedding "scripts" in c# which defeats the purpose of declaration over programmation. Same sad story as XSLT, for that matter. Some good XML-free build frameworks: Rake http://rake.rubyforge.org/ (Ruby-based) quite nice and some .NET specific tasks exist and I think IronRuby runs it now. PSake http://code.google.com/p/psake/ (Powershell based) - very promising Fake http://code.google.com/p/fake/ for the adventurous minds who love F# I still use MSBuild since it's the format of csproj files, but for specific stuff I shun building logic in XML (no custom MSBuild tasks).
