GLM with scores/principal dimensions from MCA

I hope someone can help me understand how to run this analysis! I have a dataset with many categorical variables (i.e. color, pattern, texture) associated to each animal in each interaction between pairs of animals (a set of categorical variables for each interaction of each animal in each pair). I want to test the effect of each variable on animal contest outcome (binomial). My sample size is really small compared to the number of variables/predictors (n = 10 pairs composed by 5 animals in total). So, I would like to perform a "Multiple Correspondence analysis" (MCA) to reduce the dimensionality and select only the most relevant predictor variables to input in a Generalised Linear Mixed Effect Model (GLMM). This would also allow me to avoid including in the same GLMM model predictors with high collinearity, is that correct? I read that you can input the scores from a PCA into a GLM with Factoextra. Can you do the same with the scores from a MCA? Could I simply input the scores from the dimensions in the MCA into a GLMM model with lma4:glmer R function? This would be the model with the original variables: glmer(outcome ~ body color + texture + pattern + (1|individual_ID) + (1|pair_ID), family=binomial(link="logit"), dataset) How would the model with the MCA scores look like? If I input the MCA scores in the GLMM model, can I still know which original variable (i.e. color) is the strongest predictor of contest outcome? I haven't found much information on how to run a GLMM with MCA scores, so any help including tutorial links or examples that you could recommend would be highly appreciated!
