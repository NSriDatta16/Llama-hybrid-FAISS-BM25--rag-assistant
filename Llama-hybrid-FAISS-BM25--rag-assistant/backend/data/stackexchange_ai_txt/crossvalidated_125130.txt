Produce a GLM intercept that does not include reference levels for categorical variables?

I realize that a similar question to this has been asked, but it was not ultimately resolved. I have tried the suggestions posted to that question here , but have had no success. I am using the following code: allinfa4.exp = glm(survive ~ year + julianvisit + class + sitedist + roaddist + ngwdist, family = binomial(logexp(alldata$expos)), data=alldata) summary(allinfa4.exp) Call: glm(formula = survive ~ year + julianvisit + class + sitedist + roaddist + ngwdist, family = binomial(logexp(alldata$expos)), data = alldata) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.6435 0.3477 0.4164 0.4960 0.9488 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.458e+00 7.117e-01 6.265 3.74e-10 *** year2013 3.680e-01 1.862e-01 1.976 0.04819 * year2014 2.136e-02 1.802e-01 0.119 0.90564 julianvisit -5.714e-03 3.890e-03 -1.469 0.14192 classb 2.863e-02 2.194e-01 0.131 0.89615 classc -2.394e-01 2.277e-01 -1.051 0.29304 classd -1.868e-01 2.479e-01 -0.754 0.45109 classe -4.500e-01 2.076e-01 -2.167 0.03021 * classf -5.728e-01 2.005e-01 -2.858 0.00427 ** classg -8.495e-01 3.554e-01 -2.390 0.01684 * classh -1.858e-01 2.224e-01 -0.835 0.40351 classi -3.196e-01 4.417e-01 -0.724 0.46932 sitedist -2.607e-04 5.043e-04 -0.517 0.60520 roaddist 6.768e-05 4.311e-04 0.157 0.87525 ngwdist -5.751e-05 9.456e-05 -0.608 0.54306 The main thing to note here is that I have two categorical variables, year and class , and R has combined the first level of each (2012 and class a) into a reference level intercept term. Not only do I need to know the intercept term for these levels individually, but I also need to know the base intercept terms itself (beta0), just as SAS produces. I have tried changing the contrasts and deviation coding to accomplish this, but although doing so allows me to extract different levels, it changes the way they are calculated and still does not produce beta0. I've also tried adding +0 and -1, but this also does not provide what I need. Is what I'm trying to do simply impossible in R? It may seem like a strange request, but beta0 is necessary to convert the results of logistic exposure (special kind of logistic regression for nest-survival data) to daily survival rates. Any help would be hugely appreciated. Thanks! Here is an example of SAS output I want to emulate (taken from a similar analysis done by my lab mate) : Parameter Estimates Parameter Estimate Standard Error DF t Value Pr > |t| beta0 7.8404 2.8479 19 2.75 0.0127 NT -3.8786 1.8831 19 -2.06 0.0534 bgdensity -0.1127 0.1614 19 -0.70 0.4935 nwh 1.3466 1.4625 19 0.92 0.3687 NRD -2.6981 1.9496 19 -1.38 0.1824 NAGW -0.4898 2.2518 19 -0.22 0.8301
