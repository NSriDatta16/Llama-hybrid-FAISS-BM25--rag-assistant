Best practices organizing a Visual Studio solution

I need some help regarding Visual Studio solution and project organization. I have a solution with several projects. All of them are written in C# and are compiled as libraries to be used by the GUI. Some of these libraries have also dependencies with others. For example, TestExecutive needs LoggingFramework, Communications needs LoggingFramework too. Which is the best way of organizing? I'm thinking on a folder assemblies to hold libraries' binaries in one place. Something like: Solution | |-- TestExecutive |-- LoggingFramework |-- assemblies There is also another problem. One of the projects uses a native C dll. Where do I have to place this library? With the librarie's assembly or with the final executable? EDIT: Ok, now suppose I have the WinForms program running. I have source code and binaries mixed. Which features do I need to generate something I can distribute? I mean, with all the libraries and configuration files, but without source code. I have done this before with Nullsoft installer, but I don't know if visual studio can help you doing that.
