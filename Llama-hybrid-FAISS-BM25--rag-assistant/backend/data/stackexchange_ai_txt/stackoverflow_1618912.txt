We needed exactly this for a project I was on. The team was more comfortable in svn, and the corporate standard was ClearCase. So I wrote a script to continously migrate trunk to clearcase, and ran it on our build server. I've put the script here: http://dvae.net/blog/2009/09/clearcase-to-svn/ What we did was to set up a job on our build server that ran periodically and did a migration using clearfsimport. We used Luntbuild as the build server, but cruise control would work fine too. Like a normal build, we set the script to be run only when svn modifications where detected. We had the job run every 20 minutes as the ClearCase server was in a different country and all operations were slow and a sync took 40 mins to run. I suggest running as often as you can. The script is based on ClearCase UCM, if you are not then have to remove the 'cleartool mkact' and at the end create a label instead of a baseline. I set the clearcase comment to be a concatenation of all SVN commits since the last sync. I found it reliable, and the only reason it would fail was if Clearcase triggers (like the 'evil twin' trigger) stopped the checkin. When that happens the build fails, Lunbuild sends an email, and I then have to manually do a reverse history merge to get rid of the evil twin problem, commit and re-run.
