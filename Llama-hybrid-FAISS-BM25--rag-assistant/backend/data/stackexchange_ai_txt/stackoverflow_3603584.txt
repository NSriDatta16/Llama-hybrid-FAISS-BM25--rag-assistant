You can do a subset of what ChillKat Java Email does with Javamail. Check out the Javamail project on Kenai, http://kenai.com/projects/javamail/sources/mercurial/show in particular the IMAP package: http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/com/sun/mail/imap/package-summary.html and the POP package: http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/com/sun/mail/pop3/package-summary.html You might also want to look at James and the way James uses Javamail for mail retrieval. http://james.apache.org/ Mailet might provide some reusable components, but I've not used it so far.
