The interpretation of the model should depend partly on the range of values of $x$ and on how it is to be applied. If most of the $x$ values are large, say more than 100, and if it is to be used to predict $y$ corresponding to such large values of $x$, then a good approximate interpretation would be: a 1% increase in $x$ is associated with an average $d/100$ units increase in $y$. For $x > 100$ the proportionate difference between $x+1$ and $x$ is small. If however the model is to be used to predict $y$ corresponding to small values of $x$ then this approximation would be unhelpful and your interpretation would be more appropriate, although as Glen_b says it's not very intuitive. If most of the $x$ values are small, then a better way to avoid the zeroes might be to add a different constant, much less than 1.
