PCA can still be applied to non-gaussian data, but you should normalize it (min/max scaling) first: normalization serves exactly the purpose of dealing with non-gaussian distributed data ( link ). As for the distance used in K-measn, I would advise you to read this article: if you scroll all the way to the end, there's a table comparison the several different distance measures, and their advantages/ disadvantages. I'm not familiar with all, but in that table it is stated that Chord distance can work with non-normalized data, so maybe it is good for non-gaussian distributions (altough I'd check that information: like I said, I'm not familiar with chord distance so I can't vouch for that). Hope it helped!
