How to justify the usage of "Radial Basis Function" as a kernel for SVM

I ran SVM with several kernels on my data. RBS has the best performing results. The task is similar to the text classification. I wonder how I can explain why RBS is actually the best kernel for my task. I can simplify the task a bit, and compare RBS with only linear. I user libsvm to train and test.
