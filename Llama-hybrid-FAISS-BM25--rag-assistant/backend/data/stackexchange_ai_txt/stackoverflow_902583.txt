I have been told by Flex folks that typically more than 90% of computers have Java installed (they were bragging that >95% have Flash). I don't know what the .NET figure is for Windows, but it's not everybody. Since nowadays it seems that at least 10% of all users are not using Windows (a growing number), it seems that you can't please all the people all the time. I'm wondering: Why not a web app? If you are manipulating local files, why not a signed applet/Webstart application? Curtisk's point about developing the best application that you can is pertinent, It's easier to hit a technology sweet spot than it is to hit a user base sweet spot. If you can build something on any platform that people actually like, then you'll know you've made the right decisions.
