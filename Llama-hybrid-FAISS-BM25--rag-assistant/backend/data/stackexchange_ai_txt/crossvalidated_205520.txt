How to specify the Bayesian version of a clustered-robust standard error OLS in BUGS/JAGS or Stan?

I am trying to reproduce a simple OLS model fitted with clustered-robust standard errors within the Bayesian framework (be it with BUGS/JaGS or with Stan). In R, my frequentist model is the following: mymodel In order to calculate the clustered-robust SE I use the following code: clusteredSE Now, in either BUGS/JAGS or Stan, I understand how to specify both simple OLS models and also Hierarchical models. However, I did not understand nor find an example of how should I proceed for estimating what in the frequentist world would be a clustered-robust standard error OLS. Could any of you point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance for your time. PS: I will be comparing that to hierarchical models, so yes, it would need to really be a Bayesian version of clustering the errors.
