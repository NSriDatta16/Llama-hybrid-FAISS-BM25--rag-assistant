Yes you can do that create this table: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ci_sessions` ( session_id varchar(40) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL, ip_address varchar(16) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL, user_agent varchar(50) NOT NULL, last_activity int(10) unsigned DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, user_data text NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (session_id) ); and change this in the config: $config['sess_use_database'] = FALSE; to $config['sess_use_database'] = TRUE; $config['sess_table_name'] = 'ci_sessions'; should match the name of your table. To clarify - by default, CI's session system uses a cookie to store the data. Don't know why, it just does. You can change this for security etc by using the database table instead. You access session values exactly the same, but aren't restricted by cookie maximum file sizes, or security risks. You can of course use normal $_SESSIONS and create your own script - remember CI is a framework, you aren't required to use all of it.
