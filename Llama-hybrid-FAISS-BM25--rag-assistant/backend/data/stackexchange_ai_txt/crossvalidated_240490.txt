There seems to be a great deal of confusion about loadings, coefficients and eigenvectors. The word loadings comes from Factor Analysis and it refers to coefficients of the regression of the data matrix onto the factors. They are not the coefficients defining the factors. See for example Mardia, Bibby and Kent or other multivariate statistics textbooks. In recent years the word loadings has been used to indicate the PCs coefficients. Here it seems that it used to indicate the coefficients multiplied by the sqrt of the eigenvalues of the matrix. These are not quantities commonly used in PCA. The principal components are defined as the sum of the variables weighted with unit norm coefficients. In this way the PCs have norm equal to the corresponding eigenvalue, which in turn is equal to the variance explained by the component. It is in Factor Analysis that the factors are required to have unit norm. But FA and PCA are completely different. Rotating the PCs' coefficient is very rarely done because it destroys the optimality of the components. In FA the factors are not uniquely defined and can be estimated in different ways. The important quantities are the loadings (the true ones) and the communalities which are used to study the structure of the covariance matrix. PCA or PLS should be used to estimate components.
