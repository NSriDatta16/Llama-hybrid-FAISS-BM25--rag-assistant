what http response code for rest service on put method when domain rules invalid

What is the most appropriate response code to return when using the PUT method to update a resource, and the request contains some data that would invalidate the domain rules? For example, a customer resource must have a name specified. If an agent tries to issue a PUT without supplying a name I don't want to update the resource, and I want to tell the caller that they need to supply a name . What HTTP response code?
