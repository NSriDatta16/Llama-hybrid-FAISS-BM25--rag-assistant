Linear Regression Model with Many Features - Real Life Example

I am learning Machine Learning (Linear Regression) from Prof. Andrew Ng's lecture . While listening when to use normal equation vs gradient descent, he says when our features number is very high (like $10^6$) then to use gradient descent. Everything is clear to me, but I wonder that can someone give me real life examples where we use such such huge number of features?
