Does this violate the assumption of independence for regression

A very basic question which I have never encountered a discussion of before. I am conducting bivariate logistic regression (although my question applies to linear models as well). I have 11,500 distinct cases that closed either successfully or not (that is the dependent variable is their closure status). My predictor is how many days of experience their counselor had when the case closed. There are about 400 distinct counselors (they handle many cases) so there are about 400 distinct levels of the predictor. Does the regression assume that each predictor is independent of each other? And if it does how would you approach, what method would you use, to address this issue?
