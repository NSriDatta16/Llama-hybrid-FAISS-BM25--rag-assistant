What is the 'order' of a perceptron

A few simple marks for those who know the answer. I'm doing revision for exams at the moment and one of the past questions is: What is meant by the order of a perceptron? I can't find any information about this in my lecture notes, and even google seems at a loss. My guess is that the order is the number of layers in a neural network, but this doesn't seem quite right.
