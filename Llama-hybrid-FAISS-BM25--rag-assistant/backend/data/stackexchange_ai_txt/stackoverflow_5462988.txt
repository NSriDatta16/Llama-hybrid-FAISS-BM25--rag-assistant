I must cautiously doubt the previously accepted answer that using a DialogFragment is the best option. The intended (primary) purpose of the DialogFragment seems to be to display fragments that are dialogs themselves, not to display fragments that have dialogs to display. I believe that using the fragment's activity to mediate between the dialog and the fragment is the preferable option.
