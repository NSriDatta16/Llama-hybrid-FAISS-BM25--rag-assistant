Double-check that you did these steps correctly (linking the IBOutlet in File's Owner to the label in Interface Builder) Now we need to wire up the Label in Interface Builder to the UILabel in the class file Reopen Interface Builder Select the Label in the View or in Document Window Click: Tools -> Connection Inspector Move your mouse cursor over the empty circle to the right of text "New Referencing Outlet" (the circle will change to a Plus(+)) Mouse Click then drag the Plus (+) to "File's Owner" in Document Window When you release select countdownLabel in the popup list Click: File -> Save then close Interface Builder
