To me, neither using boolean nor enumeration is a good approach. Robert C. Martin captures this very clearly in his Clean Code Tip #12: Eliminate Boolean Arguments : Boolean arguments loudly declare that the function does more than one thing. They are confusing and should be eliminated. If a method does more than one thing, you should rather write two different methods, for example in your case: file.append(data) and file.overwrite(data) . Using an enumeration doesn't make things clearer. It doesn't change anything, it's still a flag argument.
