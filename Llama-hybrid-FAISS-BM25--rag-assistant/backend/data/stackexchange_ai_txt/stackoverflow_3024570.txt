Subversion is for maintaining a history of changes to your source code. It doesn't have any inherent "deployment" capability, which I think is what you are trying to accomplish. That being said, you can organize your code using branches to maintain changes that haven't been deployed to stage or production environments, which will allow you to better keep track of those changes which haven't been deployed yet. You will have to set up your own deployer, which can pull the updated code out of these branches and push them to stage. When it is time to deploy to production, you can then merge the changes in the branch back into the trunk, and either tag or delete the branch, and start the process over again. That's just one suggestion; there are many ways to configure a Subversion repository to accomplish what you are trying to do. You might want to read up on SVN a bit and then ask some more detailed questions. One source I can recommend is "Version Control with Subversion."
