This is probably a case where a linear (or other) regression won't be very helpful. People will only ever go shopping at stores. If midway between store A (where your user usually spends two minutes to buy a cup of coffee) and store B (where your user usually spends two hours to buy clothes), there is only a stretch of highway, it makes little sense to predict that he will shop there for about one hour. Instead, it's probably better to use $k$-nearest neighbors, or a variant that only searches within a given maximum geographical radius. Which is pretty much a proxy for "identify the last $k$ visits to this store, then predict the average time spent there". Note that if you include the starting time stamp, you automatically make sure that only the last visits count (you may need to play around with the weights on the geographical vs. the time dimension here). If there are less than $k$ previous visits, best to use the average of those visits we do have, not include a neighboring coffee shop or supermarket, which may not be comparable (that's where the "maximum geographical radius" comes in).
