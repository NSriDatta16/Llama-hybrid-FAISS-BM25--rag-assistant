In both Rails and other similar frameworks (Play etc.) I mostly test models. That is because I find myself mostly putting logic in the model. I also find that the model testing in Rails tends to actually work, whereas when I've tried to write controller tests (functionals) they often are much more fragile and getting them to work is significantly more work than just manually testing the site. Ideally you should be testing all the code you write, but that isn't always as easy as it needs to be.
