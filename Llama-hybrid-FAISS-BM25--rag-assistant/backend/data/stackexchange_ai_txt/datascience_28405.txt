Applying machine learning algorithms to subset of attributes in dataframe

I have this huge mixed data set consisting of both numerical and categorical attributes which upon OneHotEncoding results into a data set with very high dimensionality. Is it wise to apply machine learning algorithms like K-means clustering, dimensionality reduction and regression on subsets of data set? For example applying K-means clustering to numerical columns first and join the result with categorical data set later.
