The problem I am having is I do not know how to represent the target in my training set. Can I just use random numbers as 1 for flexion, 2 for internal rotation, 3 for twist?? This depends on the software you're using. In e1071 for R, you could just read in the file as-is and work with the labels as factors. Also once the training is completed can I do the predictions based on values for x,y,z only?? without having to supply the target value. Is my understanding correct?? Yes, prediction is done without the class labels. The reason we use SVMs and similar technology to make predictions is because the class labels aren't available. If they were available, we would use the class labels.
