Not an answer, but here's some background and explanation from Jeffrey Tan, Microsoft Online Community Support (12/7/2006): Note: this is not not a code defeat but by design, since backslashe are normally used to escape certain special character. Also, this algorithm is the same as Win32 command line arguments parsing function CommandLineToArgvW. See the Remarks section below: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776391.aspx Also makes reference to the FX method Environment.GetCommandLineArgs for further explanation of the slash handling behavior. Personally I think this is a drag, and I'm surprised I haven't been bit by it before. Or maybe I have and don't know it? Blind replacement of quotes with slashes doesn't strike me as a solution, though. I'm voting the question up, because it was an eye opener.
