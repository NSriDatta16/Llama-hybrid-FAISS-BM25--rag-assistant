Well @kevin fox i think you are quite new to iphone programming. what you have to do is create a function like this - (IBAction)changeImagesWithName:(id) sender; in ur header file and implement it in your .m file. in the IB control drag the buttons to the files owner and click on that method. Create an instance of uiimageview in your viewcontroller using IBOutlet and connect that to the UIImageView in the IB. in the above method use something like this UIButton *temp = sender; [imageView image: [UIImage imageNamed:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@.png", temp.currentTitle]]]; and name the images to the title of the buttons
