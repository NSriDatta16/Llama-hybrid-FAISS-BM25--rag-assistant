Which book has the right conditional independence formula?

I'm getting crazy. I've just started to learn probability and, after it, Bayesian networks. I don't know so much about probability, that is why I'm getting crazy. I'm using this book to study a subject of my master's degree. On pages 32 and 33 (PDF's pages 44 and 45), formula (1.50), it talks about conditional independence. And it says that: $I_G(A,B|C) => P(a,b|c) = P(a|c)Â·P(b|c)$ And in the next page, in the formula (1.51) it says that: $I_G(A,B|C) => I_P(A,B|C)$ But in Learning Bayesian Networks by Neapolitan book, page 19 (PDF's page 30), it says that: $P(a|b,c)$ can be written as $I_p(A,B|C)$ when $P(a|b,c) = P(a|c)$ Clarification: $I_p$ is the conditional independence given the probability distribution $p$ (joint probability function). Which book is wrong? (or maybe both are correct because $P(a,b|c)$ and $P(a|b,c)$ are the same "thing" or I haven't understood anything).
