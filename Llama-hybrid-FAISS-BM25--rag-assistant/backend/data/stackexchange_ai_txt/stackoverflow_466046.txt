Self-translation on a .Net MVC website to support localisation

We're a startup and we built a .net website which we are porting over to MVC. All our text was added to the site using labels so that resource files could be automatically built in the future using the tool in Visual Studio. I loved the idea which Facebook introduced encouraging the community to self-translate. I wonder if anyone has tried implementing such a thing in the .Net world? The interface would have to be rich and easy to use, but I guess any complexity would be in the auditing and possibly writing to the resource file for that locale. I have no idea if the latter is possible. Any thoughts then give me a shout. Perhaps this could be an open source project in itself.
