Is there an XML standard for Ecommerce Products?

Is there a standard way of transferring product data between e-commerce web sites? I presume there are several cases where a company wishes to include another companies products inside its store. How then would this be accomplished? I presume an XML feed would the way to go, but is there a standard for something along the lines of product name, product code, stock levels, colour options, image filename, price, discount eligibility etc? I know Magento uses XML to import/export products but is this based on a recognised standard?
