Making a single decision tree from a random forest

I am using scikit learn to build a Random Forest classifier. I have heard that it might be possible to build a single decision tree from a Random Forest. The suggestion is that although the decision tree may not be as good a classifier as the Random Forest it may be better than the decision tree you would get by using the standard method. However I haven't been able to find this method online. Does it exist? My question is not about extracting one of the decision trees from a Random Forest. It is asking about a method to construct a new decision tree from the whole Random Forest, perhaps by combining the trees in the Random Forest somehow.
