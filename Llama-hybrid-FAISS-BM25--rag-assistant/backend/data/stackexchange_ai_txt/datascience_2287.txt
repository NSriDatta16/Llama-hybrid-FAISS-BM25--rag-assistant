Regression Model for explained model(Details inside)

I am kind of a newbie on machine learning and I would like to ask some questions based on a problem I have . Let's say I have x y z as variable and I have values of these variables as time progresses like : t0 = x0 y0 z0 t1 = x1 y1 z1 tn = xn yn zn Now I want a model that when it's given 3 values of x , y , z I want a prediction of them like: Input : x_test y_test z_test Output : x_prediction y_prediction z_prediction These values are float numbers. What is the best model for this kind of problem? Thanks in advance for all the answers. More details: Ok so let me give some more details about the problems so as to be more specific. I have run certain benchmarks and taken values of performance counters from the cores of a system per interval. The performance counters are the x , y , z in the above example.They are dependent to each other.Simple example is x = IPC , y = Cache misses , z = Energy at Core. So I got this dataset of all these performance counters per interval .What I want to do is create a model that after learning from the training dataset , it will be given a certain state of the core ( the performance counters) and predict the performance counters that the core will have in the next interval.
