Silverlight 3 IncreaseQuotaTo fails if I call AvailableFreeSpace first

The following code throws an exception... private void EnsureDiskSpace() { using (IsolatedStorageFile file = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForSite()) { const long NEEDED = 1024 * 1024 * 100; if (file.AvailableFreeSpace But this code does not (it displays the silverlight "increase quota" dialog)... private void EnsureDiskSpace() { using (IsolatedStorageFile file = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForSite()) { const long NEEDED = 1024 * 1024 * 100; if (file.Quota The only difference in the code is that the first one checks file.AvailableFreeSpace and the second checks file.Quota. Are you not allowed to check the available space before requesting more? It seems like I've seen a few examples on the web that test the available space first. Is this no longer supported in SL3? My application allows users to download files from a server and store them locally. I'd really like to increase the quota by 10% whenever the user runs out of sapce. Is this possible?
