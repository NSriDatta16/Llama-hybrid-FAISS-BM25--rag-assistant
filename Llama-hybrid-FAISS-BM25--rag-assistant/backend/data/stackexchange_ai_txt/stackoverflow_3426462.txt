For situations like this, I usually recommend looking first to Core Animation and only going to OpenGL ES if you can't get the kind of performance you need. Redrawing a wheel frame-by-frame using only Quartz will result in abysmal performance, so that's not really an option here. Using Core Animation, you can perform complex animations, such as your rotation, without requiring much code. You also can leverage UIViews and other UIKit components to provide touch interaction easily. You don't even necessarily need to step down to using layers, as every UIView is layer-backed and they tend to be pretty lightweight. OpenGL ES will give you the best possible performance, but I wouldn't think you'd run into a limitation when simply spinning a wheel using Core Animation, even on older devices. OpenGL ES will require a lot more code to achieve the same effect, and will be more difficult to integrate with any touch interaction you may wish to do.
