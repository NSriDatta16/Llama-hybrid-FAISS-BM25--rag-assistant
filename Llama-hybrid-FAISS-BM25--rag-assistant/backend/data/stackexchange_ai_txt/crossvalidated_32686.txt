How far ahead are you predicting compared to the timescales that trend or cycles operate on? Zhang, Qi 2005 - 'Neural network forecasting for seasonal and trend time series' find de-seasonalising and de-trending (DSDT) beneficial, but their prediction timescales are similar to their trend/seasonal timescales. In contrast I've been working on data where I make short timescale predictions (e.g. 1 day) and trend/seasonality only act over much longer timescales. DSDT does still improve my predictive accuracy to some degree, but the ML can cope reasonably well on its own without DSDT as trend/seasonality is effectively irrelevant for the last few data points.
