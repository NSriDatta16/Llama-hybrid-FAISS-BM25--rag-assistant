SQL group by syntax

I have the follow select: SELECT COUNT(a.int_re_usu) AS qtd, a.txt_resposta, b.txt_marca, ( SELECT CASE WHEN a.txt_resposta IS NULL THEN CASE WHEN a.bit_opcao = 1 THEN 'Sim' ELSE 'NÃ£o' END ELSE a.txt_resposta END ) AS Answer FROM tb_questionario_voar_resposta a INNER JOIN tb_questionario_voar b ON a.int_id_questionario = b.int_id_questionario GROUP BY b.txt_marca, Answer As you can see,ive a select case that deal with two columns. When i try to run this query i get an error saying: Invalid column name 'Answer'. My question is how to run this query group by the "Select case" column named "Answer".
