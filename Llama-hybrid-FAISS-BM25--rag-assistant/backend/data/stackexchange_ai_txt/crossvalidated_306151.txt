Model choice using approximate Bayesian computation using different sets of summary statistics

I would like to know if it is possible to do a model-selection under the approximate Bayesian computation paradigm and using particular sets of summary statistics (e.g., S1 and S2) that differ for each model (e.g., M1 and M2). Sets S1 and S2 are obtained from the same data (i.e., S1(D) and S2(D)) but the composition in summary statistics could differ between the two sets S1 and S2. The two models have different numbers of parameters. In other words, this is the worst setup for model-selection under approximate Bayesian computation.
