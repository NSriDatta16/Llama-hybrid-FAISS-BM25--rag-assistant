Having one test case for each scenario is ideal. However, in some cases it is more convenient (efficient from implementation effort point of view) to test more than one scenario in one test case. If you use a framework that doesn't stop on first failure, but tries to execute as much as possible in a test case, that framework is appropriate for multiple scenarios per test case. I prefer to spend as less time as possible on unit testing, and still get as most coverage as possible in that time. In the end, it matters less how you implement the unit test, but more the correctness of those tests.
