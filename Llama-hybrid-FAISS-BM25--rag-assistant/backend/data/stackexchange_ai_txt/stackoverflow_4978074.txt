The base directory for a relative file path is the current directory . For standalone Java applications, this is the directory from which you started Java (if you don't give a -Duser.dir=... option). What it's in your Web-App-Container, is completely unspecified, I think. Do you want to save the file on the server or the client? If client , you'll have to use a applet or Webstart application, and then would probably use a FileChooser to let the user determine the directory, or better use the javax.jnlp api (FileOpenService, FileSaveService or PersistenceService). If server , then you'll use the mechanisms of your container to get the right path (or directly store/retrieve the data). (I don't know any details about this, sorry.)
