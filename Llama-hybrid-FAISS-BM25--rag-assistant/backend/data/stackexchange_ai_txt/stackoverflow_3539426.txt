The Config Admin implementations cannot do this, at least not in a portable way via the specification. Instead you need a "management agent" that pushes configuration data into Config Admin via the API; it can derive that configuration data from any source it wishes. FileInstall is a very simple example of a management agent. If it does not do exactly what you want then it is not too difficult to write your own. The ManagedServices will still need to perform validation of incoming configuration data and dynamically react to new configuration data. OSGi is a dynamic platform and Config Admin is designed to allow for on-the-fly reconfiguration of a running system.
