I think the confusion can be resolved by considering that the concept of "regression to the mean" really has nothing to do with the past. It's merely the tautological observation that at each iteration of an experiment we expect the average outcome. So if we previously had an above average outcome then we expect a worse result, or if we had a below average outcome we expect a better one. The key point is that the expectation itself does not depend on any previous history as it does in the gambler's fallacy.
