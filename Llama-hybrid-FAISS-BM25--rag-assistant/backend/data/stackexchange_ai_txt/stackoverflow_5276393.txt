Command inside if statement of bash script

I have the following line as part of a much bigger bash script: if [ `packages/TinySVM-0.09/bin/svm_learn 2>&1| grep TinySVM | wc -l | cut -c0-7 | sed 's/^ *//g'` -eq 1 ] upon running the script, I get: ./install.sh: line 219: [: -eq: unary operator expected Where line 219 is the line above. Any suggestions for a fix?
