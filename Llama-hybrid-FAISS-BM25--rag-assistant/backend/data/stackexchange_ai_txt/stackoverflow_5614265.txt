Simple library for Natural Language Processing in C#

I am working on a project which requires simple sort of NLP. The features that I need include: Sentence splitter Phrase splitter (not word splitter) Phrase nature identifier (common noun, proper noun, verb etc.) I am aware of libraries like SharpNLP, NLPTK and Antelope but all of them are too big and fancy for my project. Can someone suggest a simple one that provides only the above mentioned features. If it is a bit bigger and provides other features that's ok but I guess having a 139MB large library for this simple stuff might not be a good idea, especially when this project is already going to be complex in other areas. Thanks in advance for any ideas.
