Short answer: It depends on what notation are you using. Longer answer: Let's say you have a dummy variable Z1 for your categories, and 3 continuous variables X1, X3, X3. If you build your model as Y ~ a0 +a1*Z1 + a2*X1 + a3*X2 + a4*X3 you will be able to estimate following thing: holding x1,2,3 fixed, group two will have, on average, values of Y higher by a1 compared to group one. But you will not be able to judge the different impacts of X1, X2 and X3. So what should you do? You should include also multiplicative terms between Z1 and Xs! Using Y ~ a0 + a1*Z1+a2*X1 + a3*X2 + a4*X3 + a5 * Z1* X1 + a6 * Z1 * X2 + a7 * Z1 *X3, you will be able to say, what happens to individual groups when variables X1,2,3 change. Note that a5, a6 and a7 will contribute to the Y only when the observation falls into category 2 (so that Z1 = 1).
