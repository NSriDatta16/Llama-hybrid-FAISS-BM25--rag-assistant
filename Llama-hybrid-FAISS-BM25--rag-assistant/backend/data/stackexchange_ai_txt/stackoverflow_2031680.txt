Aptana won't generate phpdoc blocks for functions within classes

In Aptana, I have somehow broken the functionality to auto-generate phpdoc comments for functions within classes. It appears to only affect my current project. Normally I can type /** on the line before a function and press enter, and Aptana will create a phpdoc comment with the correct @param values, etc. For some reason when I do this now Aptana creates 2 comments, one within the other. e.g. /** * /** * */ */ public static function getByLogin($loginID, $ip, $userAgent) { } It works normally if I try this for global functions. It also works for class variables and classes themselves.
