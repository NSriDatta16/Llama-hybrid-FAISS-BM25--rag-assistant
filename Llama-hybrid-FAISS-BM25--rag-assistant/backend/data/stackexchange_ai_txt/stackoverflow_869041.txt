In the Microsoft Windows and office organizations, product development teams (mostly) consist of people in three roles, program management (PM's), testers and developers. Of course, developers are responsible for developing. The test team is responsible for developing functional and related tests and infrastructure; and running the tests to find bugs. Very little testing is done by hand - we spend a lot of time automating things. This includes designing things to make them more easily testable. The program management role is responsible for communication, coordination and planning. This will mean different things to different teams. But they are the glue that holds everything together. From an org chart perspective, things are very conventional. Most mangers have between 3 and 9 people reporting to them - not too flat, but not too deep. A very flat org tree would not work well at Microsoft (this doesn't mean the are bad, but from a cultural standpoint, having more than 9 direct reports is challenging).
