Store them in FileSystem, store the file path in the DB. Of course you can make this scalable and distributed, you just need to keep the images dirs synched between them (for JackM). Or use a shared storage connected to multiple web frontend servers. Anyway, the stealing part was covered in your other question and is basically impossible. People that can access the images will always be able (with more or less work) to save them locally ... even if it means "print-screen" and paste into photoshop and saving.
