Unable to estimate standard error after freeing first indicator in SEM model - Why is it so?

I'm new to SEM + posting on this forum; do let me know if I'm being unclear in any way, and I'll do my best to clarify. Background I'm working on a SEM assignment to estimate the fit of a model, with 6 indicators loading on to a latent variable. I'm using the following packages for the assignment: require(lavaan) require(semPlot) My dataset is loaded into a dataframe named my.df The model that I'm specifying is as follows - this model automatically fixes the first factor loading of GeneralMotivation to x1 to the value of 1.0: my.model1 I know there's no need to do so, but for the sake of better understanding how SEM works, I specified the following model as well, freeing the first indicator. problematicmy.model1 Problem I then ran sem on the two models, as shown below: my.fit1 When I specify the model using the default parameters on lavaan in my.model1 , where the first indicator of the model is fixed to 1.0, there weren't any problems. The issue comes in problematicmy.model1 , where I see the following error: Warning message: In lav_model_vcov(lavmodel = lavmodel, lavsamplestats = lavsamplestats, : lavaan WARNING: could not compute standard errors! lavaan NOTE: this may be a symptom that the model is not identified. I've also attached the output for the offending model: lavaan (0.5-17) converged normally after 14 iterations Number of observations 400 Estimator ML Minimum Function Test Statistic 112.214 Degrees of freedom 8 P-value (Chi-square) 0.000 Model test baseline model: Minimum Function Test Statistic 360.443 Degrees of freedom 15 P-value 0.000 User model versus baseline model: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) 0.698 Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) 0.434 Loglikelihood and Information Criteria: Loglikelihood user model (H0) -3181.787 Loglikelihood unrestricted model (H1) -3125.680 Number of free parameters 13 Akaike (AIC) 6389.574 Bayesian (BIC) 6441.463 Sample-size adjusted Bayesian (BIC) 6400.213 Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: RMSEA 0.180 90 Percent Confidence Interval 0.152 0.211 P-value RMSEA |z|) Std.lv Std.all Latent variables: GeneralMotivation =~ x1 0.826 0.765 0.672 x2 0.571 0.528 0.534 x3 0.829 0.767 0.694 x4 0.191 0.176 0.215 x5 0.301 0.278 0.308 x6 0.295 0.273 0.322 Variances: x1 0.709 0.709 0.548 x2 0.701 0.701 0.715 x3 0.632 0.632 0.518 x4 0.640 0.640 0.954 x5 0.740 0.740 0.905 x6 0.643 0.643 0.896 GeneralMotvtn 0.856 1.000 1.000 I've also attached the graphical model below for problematic.myfit1 : Steps taken to understand the error I first thought "okay, maybe the model is underidentified", and calculated the pieces of information I have + the number of parameters to be estimated. Correct me if I'm wrong: There should be 21 pieces of information (6 variables, therefore [(6)(7)]/2 = 21). However, I cannot, for the p understand why the model is underidentified if I'm simply freeing the first indicator x1 . From what I'm understanding, I'm only estimating a total of 13 parameters (6 residuals for the observed variables x1 to x6 , 6 factor loadings, and the variance of the latent variable GeneralMotivation ). Shouldn't my model be overidentified in this case? My guess is that Although the graphical model doesn't say this, I'm actually estimating the covariances of between the residual of indicators (i.e. x1 ~~ x2 , x1 ~~ x6 etc.). If x1 is fixed at 1.0, I'm actually trying to estimate 21 parameters (5 residuals from x2 to x6 , 10 residual covariances from x2 to x6 , 5 residual variances from x2 to x6 , 5 factor loadings from GeneralMotivation to x2 - x6 , and one variance of GeneralMotivation ), making the model just identified (df = 0). By freeing up x1 , I have to estimate an additional 7 parameters (residual of x1 , residual covariances of x1 ~~ x2 to x1 ~~ x6 and the factor loading from GeneralMotivation to x1 ), resulting in an underidentified model The issue isn't underidentification, but something else altogether SEM and RStudio hates me - not likely, but I'm not ruling it out. Closing Can anyone help me understand why the error from lavaan is popping up? Please let me know if you need more information from me. Thank you!
