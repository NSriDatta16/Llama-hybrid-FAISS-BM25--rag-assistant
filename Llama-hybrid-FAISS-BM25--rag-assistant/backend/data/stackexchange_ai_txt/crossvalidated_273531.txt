Plot two y's against each other with the same confounders

So I was advised to use a GLM to adjust for confounding factors, but I have two variables I want to plot against each other and both are influenced by the same confounders. Can I use GLM for this, and if so how? If I use a GLM twice, once for each variable, can I combine them (how)? There are large numbers of covariates and I was going to reduce them with a PCA, but if I do will I still be able to combine the results of two GLMs (how)? [Sorry if this is Q is too complicated] If content is useful: we're combining studies from different sites and want to control for climate, soils, etc, and plot yield against various environmental impacts, each impact has it's own dataset. [it will be easy to lose me over 1st yr undergrad stats. Thanks!]
