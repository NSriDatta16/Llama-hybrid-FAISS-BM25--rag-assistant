I am not 100% sure about this one, but I think your contrast "AvsAvg" is producing a column in your design matrix that is exactly the same as the column for group A. This design matrix will then be singular and so cannot be inverted to obtain a solution for your fixed effects and contrasts. You get output because the redundant variable "AvsAvg" is automatically dropped. I suspect your contrast "AvsAvg" is meant to be A versus the average, and perhaps this has been coded incorrectly?
