C++: Counting total frames in a game

Not a very good title, but I didn't know what to name it. Anyway, I am counting the total frames (so I can calculate an average FPS) in my game with a long int . Just in case the game went on reallly long, what should I do to make sure my long int doesn't get incremented past its limit? And what would happen if it did go past its limit? Thanks.
