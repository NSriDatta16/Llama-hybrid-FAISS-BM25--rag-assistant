I would think the combination of database mirroring and database snapshots will solve your issues. First, database mirroring is very easy to setup and I have never had any problems with it (using it for the past 4+ years). Second, creating a database snapshot on your failover server will allow you to run reports. You can setup a sql agent job to drop and re-create the snapshot on whatever acceptable interval you like. Of course this is all dependent on if you need your reports to run on real-time data or if they can be delayed somewhat.
