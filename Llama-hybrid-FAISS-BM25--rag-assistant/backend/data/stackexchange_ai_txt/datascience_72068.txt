How do I use matrix math in irregular neural networks such as those generated from neuroevolution (NEAT)?

I understand how to structure the matrix when every node in a layer is fully connected to every node in adjacent layers and I understand that in "irregular" neural networks I can just process each node individually. However, there are no explanations or examples online of how to structure a matrix for an "irregular" neural network. How would I handle recurrent connections? Would I just fill in the "gaps" in the matrix with zeroes? Take the irregular neural network in this diagram: Could I somehow combine (or get the dot-product of): [i0 i1 i2] and [[w0 w1 0 w9 0 ] [0 w2 w3 0 0 ] [0 0 0 w4 0 ] [0 0 0 w5 w7] [0 w8 0 w6 0 ]] to find [o0 o1 o2] ? Would I need to give the input vector an additional two values of 0?
