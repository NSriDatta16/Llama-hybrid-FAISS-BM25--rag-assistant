How to derive the $\ nR^2 $ form of the LM test statistic?

Several lagrange multiplier (LM) test statistics = $\ nR^2 $ ~ $ \chi^2 $ , where the LM test statistic is generated from regressing the square of residuals on some function in an auxiliary equation. The test statistic may only have a $\ \chi^2 $ distribution asymptotically. White's heteroskedasticity LM test statistic is one example: $\ nR^2 $ is asymptotically $ \chi^2_k $ , where k is the number of regressors in the auxiliary equation. Breusch-Pagan's heteroskedasticity and Breusch-Godfrey's autocorrelation LM test statistics are further examples. I'm having trouble understanding how this form of the LM test statistic is derived. I've been looking through some of original papers, but I find the derivations difficult to understand. If that's the best there is, I'll have to slog through them. But does anyone have a more concise, easier to understand derivation for any of these LM test statistics? Thanks.
