Dynamically setting themes in ASP.NET

Ive got an application that different domains are connected to, instead of copying and modifying each application i use same physical location on hard drive but separate application pools and websites on IIS. Basically i want to change a theme based on hostname. ie. user comes to "websome.com" gets "websome" theme and user comes to "jamessome.com" gets "jamessome" theme. I set the theme in web.config "pages" attribute which applies the theme globally to whole website. Is there any way i can modify that setting on fly based on domain use entered from? It is probably possible but what are downsizes and what do you suggest to do with little code in order to simplify solution. As i understand if i edit web.config each time user comes in it will take lots of time which is not that elegant... So any ASP.NET gurus out there can write two lines of code so magic will happen ? There are few solutions for these problem on the website but this will require me to add code to Page_Init event of every page on the site which is unrealistic.
