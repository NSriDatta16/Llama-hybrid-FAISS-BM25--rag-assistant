As most people have said, the rendering style of form widgets is left pretty much up to the browser. You can style them a bit, but fundamental changes to them are unreliable at best. As another commenter mentioned, you'd be best using a bit of javascript to achieve this effect. I've given a bit of jQuery that will do this. It's not ideal though - it relies on the user clicking the "Print this page" links, and not using the browser's own Print functions. For the following markup: print this An Option Another Option This jQuery will append a paragraph containing the content of the currently selected item from the drop-down, and hide the form element before printing the page. $(document).ready(function() { $('a.print').click(function() { var selected = $('#mySelect option:selected').text(); $('#mySelect').after(' ' + selected + ' '); $('#mySelect').hide(); window.print(); }); });
