I think you may be misunderstanding the incentive to use K-fold CV, I will explain my understanding of it. K-Fold CV is usually employed to improve the validity of your test data set. In cases where you may have a limited size data-set it's important to maximize the amount of data you train your network with; the more data your network trains with the more variation it has experience dealing with. This, however, limits the size of the portion of your data-set put aside for testing. The issue with this is that if your test data isn't representative of you entire data-set then your neural networks performance with it also isn't really representative either. The performance you get from a small test set is now down to 'luck of the draw'. That's an issue. Enter K-Fold CV. The idea here is to split your small data-set up into K chunks and run your neural network K times using a different chunk for testing each time. The other K-1 chunks are used for training. Now for that particular network architecture you have K different sets of results which, combined, have been tested across the entire data-set. These results can be averaged and errors can be calculated to produce an accurate range for the performance of your network. So in essence K-Fold CV helps to relinquish the difficulties created by a undersized data-set. Hopefully you have understood me, we're speaking the same language, and we can tackle the question you've asked. Firstly, when you say you've trained your networks on the 'full data-set' does this mean you didn't put aside a fraction of that data-set to be tested on? If that were so I'm afraid you'll have to either find some more data that matches your data-set or you'll have to retrain your networks from scratch with a fraction of the data left to test on. Secondly, with this in mind, how big is your data-set? Is it necessary to perform K-Fold CV as it's a costly, but sometimes valuable, process. If you think you have a smaller data-set then the answer would be a YES to the last question you've asked. You WILL need to perform K-Fold cross validation during the training process. Lastly, you may also want to look into reserving what is called a validation set of data. This answer can give you some insight into why that may be of interest to you. Good luck!
