You could either Determine a function or set of function to map the longitudinal data to a fixed size. For example, take the mean, max, min, sum, count of a time series. Then, concatenate those values into vectors and cluster the vectors. Learn an embedding that represents the time series, which is similar to the first method except you learn the functions that are used to produce the vector representation, and then cluster the embeddings. To create this embedding you could use a time series model that handles variable-length input (e.g., an RNN).
