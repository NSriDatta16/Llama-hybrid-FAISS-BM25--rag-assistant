Non-linearity of neural network classification

Why is it that logistic regression is considered a linear classifier, but a neural network with a sigmoid activation function and sigmoid output layer is considered non-linear? I am aware that logistic regression is considered linear because its inputs are a linear combination of the original inputs, but couldn't the same be said of the neural network example?
