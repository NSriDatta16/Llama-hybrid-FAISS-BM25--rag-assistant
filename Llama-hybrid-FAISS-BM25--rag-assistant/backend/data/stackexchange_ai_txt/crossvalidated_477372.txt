I have no experience with modeling CTRs, but one thought that comes to mind is to use the flexibility of gradient boosting trees to handle missing values . As I understand it, the model building assigns directions at each node to missing values, even if there aren't any missing in the training set. CTR could still be predicted based on the other characteristics of the listing but without values for the list position. So if all of the new candidate listings that you want to rank are treated the same in this respect, that would provide a way to rank them for the initial ranking. You would have to do a good deal of testing, however, to see if this approach gives reasonable results for your application. As the page I linked above puts it: Be careful if your scoring data has its missing values distributed differently from your training data. xgboost's missing handling is convenient but doesn't protect against masking.
