PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase::$name gets set in the TestCase constructor, so you could try this: $suite->addTest(new SimpleTest('simpletest')); edit1: I don't know your code, so i don't know if this helps. What I usually see is this (as a replacement of the above, not addition): $suite->addTestSuite('SimpleTest'); edit2: phpunit documentation: Chapter 7 - Organizing Tests
