Bayesian posterior and prior distribution question

Here is my question: You want to find proportion x of phones from a given company is defective. You are sent a box of 10 samples, and you find that two are defective. Compute the posterior distribution for x using a uniform prior distribution. 2.Some time later, you are sent a second batch of 10 phones from the same company, but a different model. You find that three examples are defective in this new batch. Compute the updated posterior distribution. (One the includes the estimate obtained from the first batch). I am not sure how to calculate the exact value of the first question since I got a beta(3,8) on question1. Also, for question2, how can I use the posterior distribution(beta(3,8))in question 1 to update the new posterior question? (I am also not sure whether using binomial distribution or beta distribution for this question)Thanks.
