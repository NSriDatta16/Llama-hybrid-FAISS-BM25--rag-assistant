You can use logistic regression. The dependent variable would be "success" and the independent variables will be technique and task. Task could be coded as three 2-level dummy codes plus interactions. Or, you could code it as one categorical variable with 8 levels. These are equivalent. The former is easier to code but the latter may be easier to understand.
