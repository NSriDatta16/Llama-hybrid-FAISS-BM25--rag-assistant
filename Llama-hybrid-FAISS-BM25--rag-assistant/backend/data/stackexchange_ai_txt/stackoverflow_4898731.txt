If you're looking for a PHP-only solution, you can put an index.php or simmilar file at the root folder of the domain containing: That would enable a redirection from http://www.currentsite.com/ to http://www.currentsite.com/current . The drawback is that you'd have to stick with "current" in your path, so I'd go for the more elegant .htaccess solution. EDIT Oh, and if you already have an .htaccess file in the root folder doing similar rewriting tasks, chances are this approach won't work as index.php won't ever be reached. You'd better check for that first.
