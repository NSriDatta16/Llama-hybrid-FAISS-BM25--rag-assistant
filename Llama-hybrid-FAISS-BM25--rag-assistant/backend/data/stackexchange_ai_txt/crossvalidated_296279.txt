I'm not fully across this implementation, but I think I understand what you're asking. If we randomly skip words in the context window, we're still going to see all of them, on average. We loop through the dataset multiple times so we're going to train on the same example many times. Each time we'll probably see a different subset of the words in the window, but on average we'll see all of them. Hope that's clear / I understood what you're asking.
