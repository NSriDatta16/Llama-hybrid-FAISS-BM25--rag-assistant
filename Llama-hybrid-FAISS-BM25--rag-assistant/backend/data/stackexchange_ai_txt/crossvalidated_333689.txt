Logistic regression can be viewed as a model output probabilities, not just a classifier. As @Matthew Drury mentioned, adjusting the boundary is used very frequently in real world to make trade-off between true positive and false positive rates. Details see [ROC curve] for details ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic ) In addition to optimizing the logistic loss, which is the view from the machine learning perspective. There are very rich literature in statistics about logistic regression can answer your question perfectly and give more interpretation of the probability produced from the model. These literatures also establish the relationship between max likelihood and binomial assumptions of logistic regression. (Note, not any number between 0 and 1 is a probability number. When we talk about probability we also want to think about the distribution.) The link function (sigmoid, $\text{logit}^{-1}$) is carefully designed with rigorous math behind. I would strongly recommend you to re-learn logistic regression from statistics literature in addition to machine learning. Here are some starting resources: FAQ: HOW DO I INTERPRET ODDS RATIOS IN LOGISTIC REGRESSION? LOGIT REGRESSION | R DATA ANALYSIS EXAMPLE And some related topics in CV What is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression? Is there i.i.d. assumption on logistic regression?
