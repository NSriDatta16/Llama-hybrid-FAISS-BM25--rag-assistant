Use levels ( not first differences) as an input for the Johansen cointegration test. If you suspect a deterministic trend in the time series, you may account for that using a specific version of the Johansen cointegration test. For example, in "urca" package in R, the function for the Johansen cointegration test is ca.jo . You may choose to specify the presence/absence of a deterministic time trend via the argument ecdet . There are more options controlled by other arguments, see here . However, it seems you do not need to use the Johansen test in the first place. You indicate that the series are stationary at levels if a constant and a trend is allowed for (I suppose this relates to the specification of the augmented Dickey Fuller unit root test). Unless you have a good argument against the presence of a deterministic trend (that is, the deterministic trend is not spurious but real), the series are trend-stationary, and there is no need to proceed with cointegration analysis.
