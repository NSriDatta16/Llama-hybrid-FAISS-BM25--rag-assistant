This is called the coupon collector problem . You are correct that you can write the number of draws as a sum of geometric random variables ("events" means something else) with success probabilities $7/7, 6/7, 5/7, ... 1/7$. By the linearity of expectation, the average number of draws is the sum of the average values of those geometric random variables, $7/7 + 7/6 + 7/5 + ... + 7/1 = 7(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/7) = 363/20 = 18.15$. For $n$ cards in the deck instead of $7$, the average number of draws needed to collect all examples is $n \log n + \gamma n + 1/2 + o(1)$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant $0.577$ by comparing the sum $\sum_i^n \frac 1i$ with the integral $\int_1^n \frac 1x dx$.
