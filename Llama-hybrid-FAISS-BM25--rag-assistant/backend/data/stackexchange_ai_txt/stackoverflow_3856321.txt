If you are using the SqlCommand control (drag-dropped onto a page) instead of the SqlCommand object (code), your best bet will be to add a page-level error handler (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ed577840.aspx). Most likely, the problem is that your connection string uses SSPI for authenticating to the SQL Server (integrated/domain security). That would allow you to connect via Visual Studio, but not once it is deployed. You might want to look at this article (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bsz5788z.aspx). The answers in that article are not ideal, but they will get you moving along. The better approaches can get pretty complicated. Read-up on those once you get your app working again.
