What happened was that the header files for the symbols in question were never being included in a cpp file anywhere. The only explanation I have for why it worked is that maybe one of the other compilation units included the headers in question indirectly, but when it changed in the rewrite, the symbols were no longer being included anywhere. Believe it or not this problem was easy compared to the next one I hit - boost::thread causing the assembly to throw an exception on load because of conflicts relating to DLL initialization and thread-local storage.
