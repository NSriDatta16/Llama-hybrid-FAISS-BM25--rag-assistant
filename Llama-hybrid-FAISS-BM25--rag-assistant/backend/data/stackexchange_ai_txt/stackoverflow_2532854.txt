If you only want to store the user's user ID in the cookie (presumably so you can look their record up in the datastore), you don't need 'secure' or tamper-proof cookies - you just need a namespace that's big enough to make guessing user IDs impractical - eg, GUIDs, or other random data. One pre-made option for this, which uses the datastore for session storage, is Beaker . Alternately, you could handle this yourself with set-cookie/cookie headers, if you really just need to store their user ID.
