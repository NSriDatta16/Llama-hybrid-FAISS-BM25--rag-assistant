How do you add sample (dummy) data to your unit tests?

In bigger projects my unit tests usually require some "dummy" (sample) data to run with. Some default customers, users, etc. I was wondering how your setup looks like. How do you organize/maintain this data? How do you apply it to your unit tests (any automation tool)? Do you actually require test data or do you think it's useless? My current solution: I differentiate between Master data and Sample data where the former will be available when the system goes into production (installed for the first time) and the latter are typical use cases I require for my tests to run (and to play during development). I store all this in an Excel file (because it's so damn easy to maintain) where each worksheet contains a specific entity (e.g. users, customers, etc.) and is flagged either master or sample. I have 2 test cases which I (miss)use to import the necessary data: InitForDevelopment (Create Schema, Import Master data, Import Sample data) InitForProduction (Create Schema, Import Master data)
