Biasing SkLearn Algorithms to Positive Outcomes

I am trying to run multinomial naive bayes on a series of examples in python using sci kit learn. I am consitently getting all examples classified as negative. (The ratio of positives to negatives in my training set is ~1:3) Is there a way in sklearn to bias toward positive examples? I have coded it as follows: from sklearn.datasets import load_svmlight_file from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics import recall_score from sklearn.metrics import precision_score X_train, y_train= load_svmlight_file("POS.train") x_test, y_test = load_svmlight_file("POS.val") clf = MultinomialNB() clf.fit(X_train, y_train) preds = clf.predict(x_test) print('accuracy: ' + str(accuracy_score(y_test, preds))) print('precision: ' + str(precision_score(y_test, preds))) print('recall: ' + str(recall_score(y_test, preds)))
