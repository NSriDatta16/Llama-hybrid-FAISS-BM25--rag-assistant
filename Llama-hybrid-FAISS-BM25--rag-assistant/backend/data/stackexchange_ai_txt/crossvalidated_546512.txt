How to find 'influential points' in multivariate data with weak covariance

Part-1: I have used PCA and Mahalanobis distance to find outliers. But in both cases, only the highest or lowest values are detected as outliers. I am looking for a way that any data point that does not follow a certain correlation between output and 3 inputs can be identified as an outlier. I have multivariate data (3 independent, 1 dependent variable). I am trying to define the outliers based on not only their values being very high or low, but rather the points not 'behaving' similar to other data points. Part 2 (Edit): I came across the concept of 'points with large residuals'. I searched for this term and figured that it should actually be called an 'influential point' rather than an outlier. So, I came across Cook's distance method, which seems to work at least for data fitted with linear functions. Now I am trying to figure out what can I do when the function describing the data is very complex. Any help in this direction is appreciated!
