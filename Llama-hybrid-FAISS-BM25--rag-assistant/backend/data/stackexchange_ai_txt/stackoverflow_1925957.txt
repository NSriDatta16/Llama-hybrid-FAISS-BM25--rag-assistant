Well... what are you doing this for ? The reason I ask is that there's this hyper useful Unit Testing method called CollectionAssert.AreEquivalent . From the remarks section: Two collections are equivalent if they have the same elements in the same quantity, but in any order. Elements are equal if their values are equal, not if they refer to the same object. It looks like it does exactly what you want, and throws AssertFailedException if the two are not equivalent, which may also be what you want. Is there any way to leverage it? One method call is certainly far greater than a triple-nested loop -- even if that's what the method does under the covers.
