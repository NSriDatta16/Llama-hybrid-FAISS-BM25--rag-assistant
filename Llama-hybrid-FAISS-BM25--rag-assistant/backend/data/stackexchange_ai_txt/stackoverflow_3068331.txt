I don't know how to achieve this in V8 Js engine exactly, but as in the Python world, you can just do as following. your Image class: class Image { public: Image(int w, int h); int Width(void) const; }; write some wrapper functions and expose these functions to the Js world: Image* Image_New(int w, int h) { return new Image(w, h); } void Image_Delete(Image* pImage) { delete pImage; } int Image_Width(const Image* pImage) { return pImage->Width(); } add the following codes to your js file: var Image = function (w, h) { this.image = new Image(w, h); this.Width = function() { return Image_Width(this.image); }; }; and now you can get you code work. Additionally, the codes above haven't take the Garbage collection mechanism into consideration, so pay some special attention to it.Sorry for my borken English!
