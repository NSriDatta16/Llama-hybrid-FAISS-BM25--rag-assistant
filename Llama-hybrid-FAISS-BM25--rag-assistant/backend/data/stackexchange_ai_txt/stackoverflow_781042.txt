Multi language: asp:label aganist html:label with asp:Literal

I'm adding multi language support to a prototype web site. The site was developed using html lables which I could multilanguage using asp:literal or I could change them all to asp:labels as shown below. ' /> "> Web stuff isn't my area of expertise and the guys here don't think there is any advantage one way or the other. What would you choose and why?
