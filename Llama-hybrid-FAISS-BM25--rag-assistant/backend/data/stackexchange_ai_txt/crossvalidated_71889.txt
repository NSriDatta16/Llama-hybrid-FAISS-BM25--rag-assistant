It is possible to cancel the common factor as in algebra because it is possible to prove it that it works. The idea is to to start with the series $\sum_j \psi_j X_{t-j}$, where $X_{i}$ is the time series and show that this series converges if $\sum_j |\psi_j| So you have relation between the the polynomials and time series and hence the rules of algebra are "transferable". So if you have $\phi(B)X_t=\theta(B)Z_t$ you can write $X_t=\psi(B)Z_t$, where $\psi(z)=\frac{\theta(z)}{\phi(z)}$. If $\theta(z)$ and $\phi(z)$ have common roots, they cancel themselves in the fraction as in usual algebra. Note however that the cancelation is possible when the remainder (after cancelation) $\frac{\theta(z)}{\phi(z)}$ is well defined, i.e. $\phi(z)$ must not have roots in the unit circle, as only then the equation $\phi(B)X_t=\theta(B)Z_t$ has a well defined solution. If you want more details I would recommend reading these excellent lecture notes by A. Van der Vaart. My answer can be thought as a condensed summary of the first pages of chapter on ARIMA processes.
