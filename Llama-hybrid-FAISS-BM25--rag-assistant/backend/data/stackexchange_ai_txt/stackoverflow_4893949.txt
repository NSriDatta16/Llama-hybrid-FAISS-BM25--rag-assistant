How to save a file without prompting the user for a name/path?

I'm trying to open a stream to a file. First I need to save a file to my desktop and then open a stream to that file. This code works well (from my previous project) but in this case, I don't want to prompt the user to pick the save location or even the name of the file. Just save it and open the stream: Stream myStream; if (saveFileDialog1.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK) { if ((myStream = saveFileDialog1.OpenFile()) != null) { PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, myStream); Here's my code for the newer project (the reason for this question): namespace Tutomentor.Reporting { public class StudentList { public void PrintStudentList(int gradeParaleloID) { StudentRepository repo = new StudentRepository(); var students = repo.FindAllStudents() .Where(s => s.IDGradeParalelo == gradeParaleloID); Document document = new Document(PageSize.LETTER); Stream stream; PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, stream); document.Open(); foreach (var student in students) { Paragraph p = new Paragraph(); p.Content = student.Name; document.Add(p); } } } }
