This seems like a multi-class analogue of the problem addressed by King and Zeng (2001). As is mentioned in the comments, class imbalance is much less of a problem than many believe. After all, if an event is rare, the predictive model should be skeptical of such an event occurring. However, when it comes to collecting data, it can become a nightmare to have to slug through so many cases to get to a point where you have enough observations of the minority classes to do quality work with reasonable estimates. Thatâ€™s where King and Zeng (2001) come in. Their paper addresses how to sample in situations where events are rare so that you do not waste your time on the majority cases; then you account for the artificial balancing. King and Zeng (2001) address the binary case, but this philosophy makes a lot of sense and might lead somewhere useful. (A crucial difference between King and Zeng (2001) and other artificial balancing like downsampling is that King and Zeng (2001) operate at the phase of data collection instead of data modeling. In that regard, they treat class imbalance as an issue for experimental design and how to be efficient in collecting data that might be time-consuming and/or expensive to acquire, rather than discarding data like downsampling does once imbalanced data have been collected.)
