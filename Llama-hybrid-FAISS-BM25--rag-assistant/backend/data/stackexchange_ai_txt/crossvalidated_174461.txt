As far as I can see from your code, you may only be accepting a proposal when the target density is greater at the proposal value than at the previous value (if ap > 1: current_state = next_state), but you should also accept with probability ap when 0 When you use a proposal function that is not optimal (in this case the standard deviation for a N(0,1) distribution is much larger than for the target distribution so that you would get a low acceptance rate of moves), this may show up in MCMC diagnostics (e.g. trace plots, autocorrelation plots, effective sample size, Geweke diagnostic, Gelman-Rubin diagnostic etc.). Did you check any of those? A simple plot of the value of your chain over time (trace plot) could be very helpful. There are some ways of tuning the proposal distribution during an initial stage, but in simple cases like this it might be enough to just generate a longer chain and to only retain every 10th or 100th or 1000th sample.
