Specific version of System.Configuration.dll for my add-in DLL when the host application targets a different version via its app.config?

I'm writing a .NET DLL (C#) that is an add-in for a 3rd party product. That product includes this in it's application.exe.config file: My DLL targets .NET v3.5, and my app.config file includes this: When I use the Settings object (derived from ApplicationsSettingsBase) to save a setting, the save works - and the data is saved to the user.config file of the host application. However, it is saved with this in it (note the Version=4.0.0.0): With these settings saved, my DLL will not load the settings on subsequent runs of the host application. The supportedRuntime of the application.exe.config has an impact on this - changing or deleting it will mean that the user.config file is saved with a different Version=X.X.X.X in it. With Version=2.0.0.0 my settings load just fine. How can I get my settings to load/save without a problem without updating the host application.exe.config file? Or do I need to consider using an alternative storage location for my application settings, such as my own XML config file or registry?
