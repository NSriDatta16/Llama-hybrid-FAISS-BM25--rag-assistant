Export a .Net Panel Control to an Image

I'm developing an application in VB.Net (VS2008) which allows the creation of classroom layouts. The layout is a panel and has child panels (seat objects) the seats are then populated using drag and drop and show a preview of the person sitting there. I would like to export this panel to a printable format such as jpeg, pdf etc. I have tried using the CopyFromScreen but I can't get this to only output the layout panel. (some of the panel could be off the screen at the time of export) I have also considered using HTML outputting each seat as an absolutely positioned div container. Then printing the HTML page. What do people think is the best solution? And could you provide examples to back up your choice?
