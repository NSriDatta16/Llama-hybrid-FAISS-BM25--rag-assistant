Hard file on the server or binary for sound and image files in SQL with ASP.Net application

I am building an ASP.Net C# web application that will be using lots of sound files and image files. Considering performance, would it be best to store all files in SQL as image data type and retrieve from the database or store/archive the hard file on the server and store the path in sql? Im curious about the pros and cons - other than the obvious of storage space and manageability.
