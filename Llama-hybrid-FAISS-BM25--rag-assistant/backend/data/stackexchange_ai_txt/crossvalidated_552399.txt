Change shape parameters in a beta distribution based in each datapoint

I am new to Bayesian statistics and I have been trying to implement a Beta Binomial model from a PhD thesis in rjags. The thesis describes prior distribution for the variables but I am stuck in how to implement the following part of the model: $p_{j k} \mid \alpha_{j k}, F_{k} \sim \begin{cases}\operatorname{Beta}\left(\alpha_{j k}\left(1-F_{k}\right) / F_{k},\left(1-\alpha_{j k}\right)\left(1-F_{k}\right) / F_{k}),\right. & \text { if } G_{j k}=0 \\ \text {Uniform }[0,1], & \text { if } G_{j k}=1\end{cases}$ Depending on the value of $p_{j k}$ (an observed variable), we assume either a Beta or a Uniform distribution: if the value falls within a standard deviation from the mean we consider that it was drawn from the above Beta, otherwise we consider it an Uniform-drawn value. I reckon that the Uniform is a special case of Beta distribution, so I guess the key is to code JAGS to test the fit of each value of $p_{j k}$ to the Beta and then change the shape parameters to (1,1) if the input value falls outside that range ( $G_{j k}$ is actually indicating the result of this test, with 0 signing success). In short, I would like to add an if statement before the prior distribution of $p_{j k}$ , if that is possible, or something equivalent, and then change the Beta shape parameters accordingly. I could not find a solution in JAGS manual or anywhere else, any help is welcomed. Edit So far, I could think of the likelihoods as follows (I've set alpha to 1, Fk to 0.5 and sum 1 to parameter beta when $p_{j k}$ is beyond alpha $\pm$ SD the so that I can get a Beta(1,1), that is, a Uniform(0,1)). But I am not sure this translates to the model and if will work properly in JAGS. library("rjags") set.seed(8361289) model_string = "model { for (j in 1:length(SNP)) { #iterate though SNPs alpha[j] alpha[j]+(alpha[j]*Fk[j]*(1-alpha[i])), 1, alpha[j]) alpha[j] alpha[j]+(alpha[j]*Fk[j]*(1-alpha[i])), 0.5, Fk[j]) Fk alpha[j]+(alpha[j]*Fk[j]*(1-alpha[i])), 1, 0) G[j] Detailed model description (in: Detecting signals of selection in the genomes of Native Americans and admixed Latin Americans.
