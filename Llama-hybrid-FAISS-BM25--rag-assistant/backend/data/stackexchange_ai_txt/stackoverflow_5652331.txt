Your question is very well answered here: How send raw ethernet packet with C#? Using Pcap.Net sort of a library, you can easily modify individual data packets in any way you want (as it uses the underlaying WinPcap implementation which is very powerful). You can also completely skip the IP layer and send to MAC addresses as in: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/sendrawpacket.aspx where I used a similar approach to communicate with a micro-controller (Atmel ATmega) over Ethernet which provides almost realtime communications.
