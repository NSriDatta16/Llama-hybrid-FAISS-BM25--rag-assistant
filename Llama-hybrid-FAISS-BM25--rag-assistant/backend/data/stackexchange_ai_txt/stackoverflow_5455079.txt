Any Java Code Coverage Tool for Solaris

I am not able to see the similar post so adding new. Please suggest any free Java Code Coverage tool: Tool must be free/Open source. I want to run it in Solaris-10 server Code Coverage tool should not have any build/compile time dependency. I want to run this Code Coverage tool on the Solaris server where my Application has deployed. Tool should have capability to merge reports/snapshots. Thanks in advance.
