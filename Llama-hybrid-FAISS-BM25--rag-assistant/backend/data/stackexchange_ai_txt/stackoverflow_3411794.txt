Since Cassandra is a mix between Amazon Dynamo and Google BigTable I suggest you go ahead and read the research papers about these systems: Dynamo: Amazonâ€™s Highly Available Key-value Store Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data Read the Dynamo paper first. Concepts like Quorum, Read Repair, Eventual Consistency , etc. are explained very well there. After that read the Big Table paper. If you don't understand some of the terms used in these papers go ahead an google for them.
