What are some statistical principles that need to be applied to bucketing chart points by time?

I am taking the average of points by time range. There aren't an equal number of points per time bucket. Is this an acurate representation when simplifying/minimizing points on a line chart? i.e. 5-minute time spans would result in averaging 3 items and 2 as follows 17:00, 100 17:01, 200 17:04, 150 -------------- 17:05, 100 17:09, 200 The reason for the reduction is the amount of data. The density is higher than can be easily viewed on a line chart. These integer values are percentages of a sensor level (0-100).
