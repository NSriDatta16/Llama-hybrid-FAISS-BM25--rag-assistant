How to find if the means of multiple groups are significantly different when the data is of non-normal distribution: Kruskal-Wallis?

I have dive data from ten shark tags. The tags recorded depth every 10 seconds while at liberty and returned a combined total of >900 k depth records. I would like to see if there is a significant difference in the mean dive depth depending on the size of the shark. There are five size categories. Ideally, I would like to apply a 1-way ANOVA, however, ad.test() indicates that the dive data is on a non-normal distribution (the sample size is too large to test via shapiro.test() ). I attempted to log(y+1) transform the data (results below) but it still failed ad.test() . I read that a Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to a 1-way ANOVA, e.g. here which should be followed by post-hoc analysis. However, although sources recommend a Kruskal-Wallis test as a non-parametric alternative, they also say that it tests the median rather than the mean, e.g. here . Am I using an incorrect test? If so, how can I find out if there is a significant difference between the mean dive depths for each shark size category when my dive data is of a non-normal distribution? For reference, I have included the script below. Depth $Depth Size Size) library(lattice) kruskal.test(Depth,Size) library(pgirmess) # ad-hoc kruskalmc(Depth ~ Size, probs = 0.05)
