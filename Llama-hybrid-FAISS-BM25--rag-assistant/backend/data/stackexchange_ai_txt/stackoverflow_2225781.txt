ASP.NET Web Method that accepts a List is failing with "Web Service method name is not valid."

I want to create a web method that accepts a List of custom objects (passed in via jQuery/JSON). When I run the website locally everything seems to work. jQuery and ASP.NET and everyone is happy. But when I put it on one of our servers it blows up. jQuery gets a 500 error after the ajax request with the response being: System.InvalidOperationException: EditCustomObjects Web Service method name is not valid. Here's the web service method: [WebMethod] public void EditCustomObjects(int ID, List CustomObjectList) { // Code here } And my jQuery code (which I don't think matters, since the error seems to be happening on the web service level): var data = JSON.stringify({ ID: id, CustomObjectList: customObjectList }); $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "/manageobjects.asmx/EditCustomObjects", data: data, contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", async: false, dataType: "json", success: function(xml, ajaxStatus) { // stuff here } }); The customObjectList is initialized like so: var customObjectList = []; And I add items to it like so (via a loop): var itemObject = { ObjectTitle = objectTitle, ObjectDescription = objectDescription, ObjectValue = objectValue } customObjectList.push(itemObject); So, am I doing anything wrong here? Is there a better way of passing an array of data from jQuery to an ASP.NET web service method? Is there a way to resolve the "Web Service method name is not valid." error? FYI, I am running .NET 2.0 on a Windows Server 2003 machine, and I got the code for the above from this site: http://elegantcode.com/2009/02/21/javascript-arrays-via-jquery-ajax-to-an-aspnet-webmethod/ EDIT: Someone requested some more info on the web service, I'd rather not provide the whole class but here is a bit more that may help: [WebService(Namespace = "http://tempuri.org/")] [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)] [ScriptService] public class ManageObjects : Custom.Web.UI.Services.Service { } Bara
