Let me give you an answer that is a bit more explicit and general than you directly need, but that could nevertheless be useful. The true conditional variance $\sigma_t^2$ of a time series is unobservable, just as any other theoretical moment of the data generating process (DGP). $\sigma_t^2$ is a property of the DGP that we try to estimate. GARCH models (including EGARCH) assume $\sigma_t^2$ follows a deterministic process where $\sigma_t^2$ is completely determined by the past values of itself ($\sigma_{t-1}^2,\dotsc$) and the past values of shocks ($\varepsilon_{t-1}^2,\dotsc$). Shocks may or may not coincide with returns depending on the conditional mean specification for the model for returns. An outcome of an estimated GARCH model will be a series of fitted conditional variances $\hat\sigma_t^2$. If you have a series of realized volatilities $\tilde\sigma_t^2$, you should probably not treat them as perfect estimates of $\sigma_t^2$. Realized volatility is probably conditional variance measured with error, so $\tilde\sigma_t^2 \neq \sigma_t^2$. Now getting to your questions: Can I estimate an EGARCH model using the observed volatilities without using the underlying returns? I'm using R and I think in the input the program expects returns instead of volatilities. and Does this procedure make sense, or should I do something else? You are right that the expected input is returns (if the conditional mean model is empty). Therefore, you would not substitute $\varepsilon_t$ or $\varepsilon_t^2$ with $\tilde\sigma_t^2$ directly. Instead, you would have to code the model estimation (an optimization problem) yourself. If you assume the true DGP is EGARCH and treat realized cond. variances $\tilde\sigma_t^2$ as estimates of the true cond. variances $\sigma_t^2$, then you could specify the optimization problem corresponding to an EGARCH model that uses $\tilde\sigma_t^2$ in place of $\varepsilon_{t-1}$ as inputs. That would be something like errors-in-variables models where the regressand and the regressors (lagged realized cond. variances) would be measured with error.
