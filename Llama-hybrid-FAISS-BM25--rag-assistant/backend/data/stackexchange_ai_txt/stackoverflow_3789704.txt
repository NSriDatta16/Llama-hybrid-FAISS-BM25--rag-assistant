How best to update the age of a cookie?

In an application I'm working on, a cookie is created for a new user when they visit the site. The cookie stores an ID no and is set to expire in a year. It is possible to reset the age of this cookie upon the user revisiting the site at all? I would rather not delete and recreate the cookie. Or can I create an 'immortal' cookie? Mr Morgan.
