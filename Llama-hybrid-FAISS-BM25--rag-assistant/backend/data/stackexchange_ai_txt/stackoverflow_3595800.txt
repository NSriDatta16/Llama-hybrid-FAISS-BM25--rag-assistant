List of strings to binary and back again

I've stumbled on a quite irritating problem; I'm trying to generate a binary of a string-list and back again. Eg erlang:binary_to_list(erlang:list_to_binary(["hello", "world"]) This will return "helloworld" and not a list with two different elements. Does anyone have any ideas of how to solve this? One solution might be to encode every element, but there might be a more elegant solution for this?
