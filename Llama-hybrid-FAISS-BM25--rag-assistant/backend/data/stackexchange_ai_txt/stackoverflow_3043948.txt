The implementation you describe in your first paragraph sounds like the conventional way of implementing a server using select . If you want to be able to write to the client in the "main server loop", by which I assume you mean having code that looks something like: request = socket.recv() response = process_request(request) socket.send(response) then you'll need to have a separate thread per client.
