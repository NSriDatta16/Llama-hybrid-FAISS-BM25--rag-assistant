Can NSAlert Be Used to Create a Floating Window?

I have a Cocoa application that displays an application-modal alert using the NSAlert class. I'd like the alert window to float above all other applications' windows. Can this be done with NSAlert , or do I need to implement my own window? I don't know if any of this matters, but the application is an agent application ( LSUIElement is true) implemented as an NSStatusItem . (For more info about the app, including source code, look .) Here is the code that displays the alert: - (void)showTimerExpiredAlert { [NSApp activateIgnoringOtherApps:YES]; NSAlert *alert = [[NSAlert alloc] init]; [alert setAlertStyle:NSInformationalAlertStyle]; [alert setMessageText:NSLocalizedString(@"Menubar Countdown Complete", @"Expiration message")]; [alert setInformativeText:NSLocalizedString(@"The countdown timer has reached 00:00:00.", @"Expiration information")]; [alert addButtonWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"OK", @"OK button title")]; [alert addButtonWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"Restart Countdown...", @"Restart button title")]; NSInteger clickedButton = [alert runModal]; [alert release]; if (clickedButton == NSAlertSecondButtonReturn) { // ... } } I've tried putting this before the runModal call: [[alert window] setFloatingPanel:YES]; I've also tried this: [[alert window] setLevel:NSFloatingWindowLevel]; But neither of those makes the window stay above others if I click another application's window. I suspect runModal just doesn't honor either of those settings.
