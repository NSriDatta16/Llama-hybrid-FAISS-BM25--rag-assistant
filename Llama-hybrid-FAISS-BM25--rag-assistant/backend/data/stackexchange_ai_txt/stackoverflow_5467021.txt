How can I take a network buffer and pass it into a function that is expecting a FILE in C

I am looking to be able to download a file over a network socket from an HTTP server (A jpeg). I then need to pass the downloaded file into c-jpeg-steganography http://code.google.com/p/c-jpeg-steganography/ . I can use libcurl to download the file and then pass the filename into the library, but I would prefer to not do that if I don't have to. Can I download the file and then pass it directly into c-jpeg-steganography easily? Is there an easy way to modify the c-jpeg-steganography libraries to work? Is the writing to a temporary file not a bad way to do this? I am very much a C noob... please go easy. Most of my experience is with languages that let me cheat and do all the work for me.
