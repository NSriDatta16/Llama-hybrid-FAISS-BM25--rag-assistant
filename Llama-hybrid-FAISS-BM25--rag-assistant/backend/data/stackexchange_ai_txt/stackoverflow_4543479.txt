so how does passing by reference in php REALLY work?

Really simple question but rather than asking for an academic explanation I want to keep it as pragmatic as possible: when will PHP create a copy of my huge class I'm passing into a function and when will it simply create a pointer to the relevant data? And if it creates pointers all the time, what's the use of specifying & (aside from closures, obviously)? I guess I don't know enough about the guts of the interpreter.
