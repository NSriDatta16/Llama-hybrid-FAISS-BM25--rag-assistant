How to use variables derived from factor analysis as predictors in logistic regression?

Context I have a survey that asks 11 questions about self-efficacy. Each question has 3 response options (disagree, agree, strongly agree). Nine questions ask about self-esteem. I have used a factor analysis of the 11 self-efficacy items and extracted two factors. $x_1$ to $x_{11}$ denote the 11 self-efficacy questions in the survey, and $f_1$ ($x_1$ to $x_6$) , $f_2$ ($x_7$ to $x_{11}$) denote the two factors I got from the factor analysis. $y$ is a Dependent variable. Then I created two new variables: f1=mean(x1 to x6); f2=mean(x7-x11). So the logistic regression would looks like this: y=a+bf1+cf2+.... My question: Can i use these two factors as predictor variables in my multivariate logistic regression model? Should I calculate the mean of each items in each factor and use this mean as a continuous variable in my logistic regression model? Is this an appropriate use of factor analysis?
