IPv4 specifies a minimum supported MTU of 576 bytes, including the IP header. Your 4 byte UDP payload will result in an IP packet far smaller than this, so you need not fear fragmentation. Furthermore, your desired outcome - "peer will receive whole message at once or peer will not receive message at all" is always how UDP works, even in the presence of fragmentation. If a fragment doesn't arrive, your app won't recieve the packet at all. The rules for UDP are "The packet may arrive out-of-order, duplicated, or not at all. If the packet does arrive, it will be the whole packet and error-free.". ("Error-free" is obviously only true within the modest limits of the IP checksum).
