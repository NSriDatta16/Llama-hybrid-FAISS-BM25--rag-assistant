In general partial plots are the average of a series of hypothetical predictions. For continuous variables, partialPlot selects a series of n.pt values along the variable of interest. It creates a test data set identical to the training data, and sequentially sets the variable of interest for all observations to a selected value. It then takes the average value of the predicted response for each test set and plots the results against the select value. For a binary categorical predictor, this process would result in only two values. It is helpful to use partial plots in combination with variable dependence and interpret them together. The variable dependence figure is generated by plotting the forest predicted value against the variable of interest for each observation.
