As you say, it depends on a lot. Not just the site you want to host, but who, specifically, you're comparing it to. To give you a rough idea, I host a site that gets from 20k to 30k pageviews a day on App Engine, and it costs me 17c a week. That's for extra storage over the default quota - all other quotas are well within the free zone. As far as specific comparisons go, if we look at Linode , for example, their base plan is $20 for 12GB of storage and 120GB transfer per month. At App Engine prices, that would cost you at most $16.20 per month - assuming it was all outgoing traffic. If you do less than that in a month, it costs you less. Obviously, you don't have all the versatility on App Engine that you have with a VPS, but you also have better scalability and reliability. The comparison is fairly easy to other hosting services. I think App Engine will generally come out ahead, so mostly the decision comes down to if your app is suitable for App Engine.
