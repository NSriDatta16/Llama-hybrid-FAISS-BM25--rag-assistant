For years programmers had their app settings stored in config files. Then the times changed, and for years they used the registry instead - many of them used it badly, and it caused issues when Vista and its UAC came on the scene. Nowadays, especially in the .Net world, Windows developers are moving back to storing stuff in config files again. Personally i think that is the best way, if you need to move your app to another machine, or reinstall your OS, all you have to make sure you do is save your config file to retain your settings. There are things that you may still want to store in the registry though, such as (encrypted) licencing info. For everything else, config files are good. Do pay attention to UAC and file virtualisation though, so that you don't run in to trouble further down the track.
