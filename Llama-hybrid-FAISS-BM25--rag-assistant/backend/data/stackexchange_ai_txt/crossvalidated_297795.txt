Will something bad happen if different covariates are used to estimate the probability of class membership in multinomial logistic regression?

Copying the definition of multinomial logit regression equations from wikipedia , the probability that the $i$-th observation belongs to class $k$ (out of $K$) is: $$ \begin{align} \Pr(Y_i=1) &= {\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\boldsymbol\beta_1 \cdot \mathbf{X}_i} \\ \Pr(Y_i=2) &= {\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\boldsymbol\beta_2 \cdot \mathbf{X}_i} \\ \cdots & \cdots \\ \Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= {\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\boldsymbol\beta_{K-1} \cdot \mathbf{X}_i} \\ \end{align} $$ with $$\Pr(Y_i=K) = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{K-1}{\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\boldsymbol\beta_k \cdot \mathbf{X}_i}$$ and $$\boldsymbol\beta_k \cdot \mathbf{X}_i = \beta_{0,k} + \beta_{1,k} x_{1,i} + \beta_{2,k} x_{2,i} + \cdots + \beta_{M,k} x_{M,i}$$ for the vector of covariates $(x_{1,i}, x_{2, i}, \dots, x_{M, i})$ associated with the $i$-th observation. As written, this seems to imply that in the Wikipedia definition the same set of covariates are used to predict class membership probability. What would happen if the we allowed the set of covariates to be different for each regression equation, i.e.: $$\Pr(Y_i=k) = {\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\boldsymbol\beta_{k} \cdot \mathbf{X}_{k,i}}$$ Is this useful? Would it cause problems in model fitting? Or does the original definition already include this case, whereby $\mathbf{X}_i$ is just the union of all $\mathbf{X}_{k,i}$, with some regression coefficients fixed at zero? EDIT : This is made in response to Tim's answer which I do not get, because of the following example. Let $Y | X$ be categorically distributed with three classes. Then, the generative model is: $$\begin{split} \Pr(Y = 3) &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{\alpha x_1} + e^{\beta x_2}}\\ \Pr(Y = 2) &= \frac{e^{\beta x_2}}{1 + e^{\alpha x_1} + e^{\beta x_2}}\\ \Pr(Y = 1) &= \frac{e^{\alpha x_1}}{1 + e^{\alpha x_1} + e^{\beta x_2}} \end{split}$$ Under what kind of regression modelling framework can the original $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients be recovered?
