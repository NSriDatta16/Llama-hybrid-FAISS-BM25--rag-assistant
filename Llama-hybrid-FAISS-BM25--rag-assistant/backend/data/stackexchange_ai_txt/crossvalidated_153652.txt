Welcome to the party!!! Yay :-) There are plenty of competitions on kaggle, physionet, etc.. and data science jobs are everywhere (the world needs more data scientists), granted that you are a capable data scientist you may get an internship or job. Publishing your projects on github is also a good idea.
