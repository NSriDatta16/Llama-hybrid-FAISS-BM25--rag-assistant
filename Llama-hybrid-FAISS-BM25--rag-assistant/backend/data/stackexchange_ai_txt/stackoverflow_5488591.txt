Set up HTTPS/SSL Certificate for our website on another server

I'm pretty new to the https world, so bear with me. There are 2 web-servers involved: Webserver1 has been in the organization a few years and is hosting/running multiple websites with https encryption (app1.ourcompany.com, app2.ourcompany.com, etc). It has a valid, signed certificate. Webserver2 is a new server, for which I am responsible. I am tasked with setting up https and getting the certificate, etc. It has a web app running on it, but it does not have a domain name (only has an IP address)...which as I recently learned, is a requirement for a signed certificate. What I'd like to know is this -- is it possible to set up a site on Webserver1 that points to the site I'm hosting on Webserver2 (ie SiteOnWebserver2.ourcompany.com) which also utilizes the Webserver1's signed/verified certificate? Thanks for your time, SO gurus! --Dan
