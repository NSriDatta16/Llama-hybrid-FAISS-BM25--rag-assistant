I realize the original question is quite old now, but one little trick I came up with to refresh the position of draggable elements without much overhead (AFAICT) is to disable and immediately re-enable them wherever appropriate. For instance, I noticed that resizing my browser window would not refresh the position of my draggable table rows, so I did this: $(window).resize(function () { $(".draggable").draggable("option", "disabled", true); $(".draggable").draggable("option", "disabled", false); }); I hope this helps someone out there!
