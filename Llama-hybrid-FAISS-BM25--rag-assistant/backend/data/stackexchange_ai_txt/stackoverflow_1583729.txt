You could use the Robot API to write a messenger/relay robot. The robot might record all updates to the Waves to which it is subscribed, and then push the data to your desktop program. Similarly, the robot could respond to a Wave as a proxy for your Desktop client. This is not elegant, efficient, or future-proof. It might, however, satisfy your desires. This robot probably could be hack together in a two days or so, and updated as needed. Once Google publishes the client/server protocols it will be much easier to write such a client.
