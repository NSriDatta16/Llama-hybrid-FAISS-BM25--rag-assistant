Since you are uncertain about what may be the true conversion rate of the ad, you should consider using bayesian approach: Let $X$ be an r.v such that $X=1$ if the ad is successful. So $X \sim Be(p)$ , where $p$ is the conversion rate of the ad and let's assume further that $p \sim U(0,1)$ . So basically you have a no prior belief about how efficient the ad might be (this of course can be changed by changing the prior distribution). Further for $n$ independent $X_i$ , $Y \equiv {\sum_n X_i} \sim Bin(n,p)$ From Bayes' theorem: $$f(p| Y=y) = \frac{Pr(Y=y|p)f(p)}{Pr(Y=y)}$$ From distribution of $Y$ , we know that $Pr(Y=y|p) = {n\choose y} p^y(1-p)^{n-y}$ and $f(p)=1$ Unconditional probability of $Y=y$ : \begin{align} Pr(Y=y)&={n\choose y}\int_0^1 p^y(1-p)^{n-y} f(p)dp \\ &= {n\choose y}\int_0^1 p^y(1-p)^{n-y}dp \\ &= {n\choose y}\frac{y!(n-y)!}{(n+1)!} \\ &= \frac{1}{n+1} \end{align} See this for the proof of above integral. So we have: $$f(p| Y=y) = {n\choose y}(n+1)p^y(1-p)^{n-y}$$ So you now have a full posterior distribution of conversion rate. You can simulate this distribution and/or sample from it to construct your credible interval , preferably a highest posterior density interval, to get an estimate of upper and lower bounds of your estimate for a given level of confidence. EDIT: Embarrassingly, didn't notice that the posterior is beta distribution. So, $$f(p| Y=y) \sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)$$ where $\alpha = y+1$ and $\beta=n-y+1$ Therefore for credible interval at 5% significance can be calculated using R: > n=1000 > y=10 > a=y+1; b=n-y+1 > qbeta(0.025,shape1 = a,shape2 = b) # p_lower [1] 0.005498084 > qbeta((1-0.025),shape1 = a, shape2 = b) # p_upper [1] 0.01829503 So for your sample: $$Pr(0.0055 \leq p \leq 0.0183 | Y=10)=0.95$$
