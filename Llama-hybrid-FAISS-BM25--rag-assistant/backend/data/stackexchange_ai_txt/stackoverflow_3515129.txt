You need to define the behavior for getPath() for folder as it gets called internally in File class. You can do it as: File folder = Mockito.mock(File.class); when(folder.getPath()).thenReturn("C:\temp\"); File file = new Agent().createNewFile(folder, "fileName"); It will work only till you don't really create a new file but only calling new File.
