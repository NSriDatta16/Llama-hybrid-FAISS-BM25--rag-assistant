GAMM with Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial - Looking for a package in R

I am looking for an R package to fit Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) with ZINB distribution. ZINB is not available in the mgcv package nor in the gamm4 package. I read here that it might be possible with the brms package, but I have never worked in a Bayesian framework. Do you know any other frequentist package that would allow fitting a GAMM with ZINB ?
