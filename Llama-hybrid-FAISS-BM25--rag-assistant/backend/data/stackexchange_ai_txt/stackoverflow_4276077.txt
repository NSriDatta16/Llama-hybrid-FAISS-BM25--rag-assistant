How to replace an Paragraph's text using OpenXML Sdk

I am parsing some Openxml word documents using the .Net OpenXml SDK 2.0. I need to replace certain sentences with other sentences as part of the processing. While iterating over the paragraphs, I know when I've found something I need to replace, but I am stumped as to how I can replace it. For example, lets say I need to replace the sentence "a contract exclusively for construction work that is not building work." with a html snippet to a Sharepoint Reusable content below. a contract exclusively for construction work that is not building work. PS: I got the docx to Html conversion worked out using xslt, so that is kind of not a problem at this stage The InnerText property of the Paragraph node gives me the proper text, but the inner text property itself is not settable. So Regex.Match(currentParagraph.InnerText, currentString).Success returns true and tells me that the current paragraph contains the text I want. As I said, InnerText itself is not settable, so I tried created a new paragraph using outerxml is given below. string modifiedOuterxml = Regex.Replace(currentParagraph.OuterXml, currentString, reusableContentString); OpenXmlElement parent = currentParagraph.Parent; Paragraph modifiedParagraph = new Paragraph(modifiedOuterxml); parent.ReplaceChild (modifiedParagraph, currentParagraph); Even though I am not too concerned about the formatting at this level and it doesn't seem to have any, the outerXML seems to have extra elements that defeat the regex. ..."16" /> a contract exclusively for construction work that is not building work. So in summary, how would I replace the text in a Paragraph of OpenXml with other text. Even at the expense of losing some of the formatting.
