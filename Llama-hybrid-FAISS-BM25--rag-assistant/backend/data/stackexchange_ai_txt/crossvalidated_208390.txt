What you could do is use Multiple Factor Analysis . This method allows for factor analysis in which you consider multiple groups of variables. If you set up your analysis so that each group is a depth then it garantees that all your depth will be 'preserved'. EDIT : Maybe explaining a bit more would be useful In MFA, as in PCA, you have coordinates for your individuals and your variables. But what's new with MFA is the groups of variables for which you can compute coordinates too so you can extract coordinates for all of your groups (depth) on the first few dimensions, effectively reducing variable number and keeping all your depths. If you consider your individuals, you will have several sets of coordinates, one for each of the groups of variables (a description of the individuals by each group of variable if you will) and a set of coordinates which is the centroid of all groups coordinates (partial representations), that last set of coordinates could be interpreted by how the individuals are described overall
