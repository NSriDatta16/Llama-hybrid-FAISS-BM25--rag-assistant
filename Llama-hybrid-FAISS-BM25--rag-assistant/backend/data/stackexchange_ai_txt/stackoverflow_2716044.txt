Hey dude. Unfortunately, I've never seen or done this with javascript and I say with a little trepidation it may not be possible using true javascript. There is a way to do with with CSS(3), but it differs slightly from browser to browser. -moz-transform: rotate(-45deg); and / or -webkit-transform: rotate(90deg); Dragging is pretty simple, difficult to build from scratch but simply googling will come up trumps. If your using something like jQuery or Prototype, both these should be easy enough to plugin. Hope it helps.
