I believe there are quite a lot of assumptions made and confusions. So first, you have assumed the data $x$ is normally distributed, therefore, $$ x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2), $$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are the mean and the variance. But such an assumption is very likely to be wrong, and I would encourage you to make a histogram and see how are the data distributed. And based on that you want to obtain the 95% interval of $x$ in the coming year. With the distribution of $x$ assumed, it can be inferred as follows . If assuming the distribution is normal, the final distribution for $x$ is given by (using Bayesian approach) $$ \begin{aligned} p(x_{n+1}\vert\{x_i\}) &= \int d\mu d\sigma^2 \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)p(\mu, \sigma^2\vert \{x_i\}), \end{aligned} $$ where $p(\mu, \sigma^2\vert\{x_i\})$ is the posterior on the mean and the variance with all the previous samples given, which is given by $$ p(\mu, \sigma^2\vert \{x_i\}) \propto \prod_i \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)(x_i)p(\mu, \sigma^2), $$ where $p(\mu, \sigma^2)$ is the prior. With that calculated, the 95% credible interval can be inferred. One last thing, the equation you quoted is regrading the confidence interval of the mean $\mu$ based on the sample mean $\bar{x}$ , not an interval for $x$ .
