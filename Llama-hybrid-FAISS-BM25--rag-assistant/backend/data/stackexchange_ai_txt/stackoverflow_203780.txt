What is the best datatype to use for storing moderate amounts of text in SQL Server (2005)?

What is the best datatype to use for storing moderate amounts of text in SQL Server (2005)? For example, imagine a table, storing information on downloads available on a website. I want a title for the download which is brief, say varchar(20). A path, say varchar(255) then I want to store some user friendly text about the download - a description. In some cases it could be as short as the title, other times you may need a few of paragraphs of explanation. What's best? A varchar with a size of say 4000, or a varchar(max) or something else?
