Failed to resolve include text for file:SQLServer.ttinclude

I updated to the version 3.0.0.3. Dragged the new ActiveRecord directory in VS08, and added the newer dll. I'm not sure whats going on yet. When I try to compile the project I get that error. My SVN server just lost my old version, so I'll have to download the older Subsonic version and see if that fixes the problem. I have no clue what I did wrong in the configuration as I updated to 3.0.0.3. (still a new users so I couldn't post a photo, but here a link to the error) link text
