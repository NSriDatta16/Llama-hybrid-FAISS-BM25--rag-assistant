What are the best ways to use a time series data for binary classification

I have large number of csv files and each of them are timeseries based csv files sampled at Avery 5 seconds for 2-3 mins. I have 20k such files with 200-300 variables in each file. I am aggregating the data by mean over the entire 2-3 mins window are using it for binary classification. Currently I am using mean of each column in the .CSV file to represent that file, so basically I am summarizing the csv's using one scalar value per column. so each file is one sample represented by its respective mean value. Could anyone suggest me some better ways to summarize the timeseries data. Thanks for your time.
