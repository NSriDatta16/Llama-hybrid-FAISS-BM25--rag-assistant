How to make a single user app to a multiuser app?

A few years ago I created a simple app to track my daily status. Nothing fancy, you just add a row, it sticks in the date, I would put start time, end time and what I did. Everyone laughed but I kept at it for 3 years. Now the boss sees how 'organized' I am (it's just a long spreadsheet view) and wants me to extend the app for the rest of the team. He would also like to see the list view we have so this would require making it a shared db somehow. I am using SQlite now since it's all on my machine so how do I extend this app. I am looking for ideas so all are welcome. Update: I guess my question is more about having a db server rather than the embedded db I have now. Won't I need to manage concurrency, etc?
