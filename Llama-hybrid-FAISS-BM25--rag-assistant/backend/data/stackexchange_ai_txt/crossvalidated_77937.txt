The regression does what you ask, and quite well in regression terms. The real question to me is why you think it interesting or useful. You simulated a time series which is one regime with small fluctuations followed by another regime with small fluctuations, with a short transition between the two. More precisely, if I decipher your code correctly, it is one autoregressive scheme with mean 0 followed by another with mean 20 with a steep ramp in between. (As like myself many people here don't use R routinely, a verbal explanation would have been helpful.) That being so, $x_t \approx x_{t-1}$ is a good overall approximation and that's essentially what your regression reports. But you've discovered, indirectly, what you invented in the first place. Otherwise put, it is inevitable that your data are two big blobs plus transitional values, so a straight line is a fair descriptor, but that just follows from the simulation rule.
