How do I add seasonal & trend components to the final prediction when using neural networks?

I've got a question about stationarity: let's say I've made seasonal & trend adjustment for my time series input, scaled it and then passed this data to some NN model (e.g., LSTM or windowed-MLP), how do I add seasonal & trend components to the final answer?
