Propel custom Setter with SQL-specific stuff

I am using Propel 1.2 in a Symfony 1.0 project, with PostgreSQL db. I can use Criteria::CUSTOM in SELECT statements in order to use Postgres functions, like this (fulltext search): `$c = new Criteria(); $c->add(MyTablePeer::FULLTEXT_COLUMN, MyTablePeer::FULLTEXT_COLUMN." @@ to_tsquery('english', 'text to search')", Criteria::CUSTOM);` That's ok for selecting records, but what about INSERTing? I'm using raw SQL queries at the moment, but I would like to do it in a more elegant way. I saw this snippet on the Symfony website but it's a lot of code and it does not fit my needs. Performance is very important so maybe there isn't any solution better than writing raw SQL. How can I write a custom setter like $object->setFulltextColumn($parameters)? Thank you in advance
