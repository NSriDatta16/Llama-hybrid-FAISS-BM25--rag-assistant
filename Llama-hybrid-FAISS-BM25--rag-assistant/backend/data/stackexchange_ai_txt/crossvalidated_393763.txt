No. As @mdewey implied in a comment, you have quasi-complete separation. All of your A's have pos = 1. The model breaks down. Paul Allison wrote a very good paper at SAS Global Forum 2008: Convergence Problems in Logistic Regression. Some key points from that paper: a) The maximum likelihood estimate does not exist b) the EXACT option in SAS PROC LOGISTIC does not use maximum likelihood and the p value it prints is accurate and based on simulations. c) The parameter estimates are either conditional ML estimates or median unbiased estimates. See Allison's paper for the details.
