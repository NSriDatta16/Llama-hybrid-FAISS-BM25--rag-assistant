You can do something like this: for(var i = 0; i For developers afraid from eval This is one of good articles talking about eval and how it is not an evil: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/06/25/eval-isnt-evil-just-misunderstood/ I’m not saying you should go run out and start using eval() everywhere. In fact, there are very few good use cases for running eval() at all. There are definitely concerns with code clarity, debugability, and certainly performance that should not be overlooked. But you shouldn’t be afraid to use it when you have a case where eval() makes sense. Try not using it first, but don’t let anyone scare you into thinking your code is more fragile or less secure when eval() is used appropriately.
