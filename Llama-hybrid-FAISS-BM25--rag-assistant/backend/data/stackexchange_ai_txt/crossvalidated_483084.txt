Can Random Forest be considered as a Frequentist method?

I am very new to machine learning so I apologize if this is a silly or even a repetitive question. I am running a Random forest model in R and was just wondering whether this is a frequentist method and why. I have looked everywhere but still haven't found a proper full answer. One of the sources I was looking at, Are random forests Bayesian? . Thank you in advance.
