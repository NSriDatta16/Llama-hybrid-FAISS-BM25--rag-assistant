I'm not sure what is the best practice but I can comment that we have a similar situation with AzureWatch and are definitely using pre-aggregated values in tables. Mostly for performance reasons -- table storage is not instantaneous even if you query by single partition-key and a range in row-key. The time it takes to download the records is somewhat significant and depending on the records might spike the CPU up, because it needs to de-serialize the data into objects. If you get to travel to the table storage multiple times because of the 1000 record limit, you'll be paying more as well. Some other thoughts to consider: Will your aggregated totals ever change? If no, the this is another nudge toward pre-aggregation Will you need to keep aggregated values after raw data is gone or will you ever need to purge raw data? If yes, then it is another nudge toward pre-aggregation
