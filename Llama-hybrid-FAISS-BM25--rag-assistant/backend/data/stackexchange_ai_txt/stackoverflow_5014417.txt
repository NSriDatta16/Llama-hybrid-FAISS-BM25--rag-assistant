Try: Sub Test() Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection Dim canConnect As Boolean Dim rs As New ADODB.Recordset Dim strSQL As String cnn.Open "DSN=blah;Uid=blah;Pwd=blah" strSQL = "select job_start_dttm, job_end_dttm from c_job" rs.Open strSQL, cnn ActiveCell = rs(0) End Sub You seem to be mixing up a little DAO with your ADODB. You could have used Execute, but the above should suit.
