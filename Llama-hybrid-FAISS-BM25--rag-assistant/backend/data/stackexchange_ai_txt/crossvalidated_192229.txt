A principled solution would be to model your outcome variable as a mixture distribution where one component is zero. CausalImpact doesn't currently implement such mixtures. I would set the values in question to NA . Covariates in X are time series that are predictive of the outcome time series y , and whose relationship with y is stable and not influenced by the intervention. Typical examples are sales in unaffected markets, stock market indices, or the GBP.
