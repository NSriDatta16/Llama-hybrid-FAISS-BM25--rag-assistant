VAR model with AR(p) and ARMA(p,q) data?

I want to estimate a VAR-model with 6 variables, all of them are stationary. But when I analyse the time series by examining ACF, PACF and auto.arima in R. auto.arima confirms that two of the time series are ARMA(2,2), two AR(2) and two AR(1). Now I wonder if estimating a VAR-model is the correct method in this case? Are there any objections?
