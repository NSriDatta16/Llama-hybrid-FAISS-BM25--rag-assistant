May be the "text file encoding" triggers some kind of recompilation which makes that issue visible. In any case, could you try first to disambiguate the DataInput usage, by: adding for example " java.io. "(in front of DataInput ) everywhere in that source where it is actually a java.io case (leaving a simple DataInput for businessObject usages) not using import java.io.* (but using CTRL + SHIFT + O for reorganizing the imports ) would that solve the problem, whatever the "text file encoding" is?
