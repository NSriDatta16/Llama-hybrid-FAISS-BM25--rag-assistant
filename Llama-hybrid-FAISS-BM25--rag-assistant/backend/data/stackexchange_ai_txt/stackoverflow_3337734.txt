iPhone: Handling touches transparently

I have a UIViewController and an associated with it UIView. The UIView has a number of subviews. How to handle touch event inside a specified rectangle in my UIViewController subclass? This handling should be transparent: UIView and its subviews should still receive their touch events even if they intersect with the specified rectangle. P.S. Overriding touchesBegan in the view controller doesn't work. Inner views doesn't pass events through. Adding a custom button to the end of UIView subviews list also doesn't work. Inner subviews doesn't receive touch events.
