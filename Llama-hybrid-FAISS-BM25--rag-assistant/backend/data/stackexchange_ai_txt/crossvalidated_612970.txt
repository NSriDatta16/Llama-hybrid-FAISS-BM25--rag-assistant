Spline basis explicitly including a linear term; basis functions generated by the default call to "s()" function of mgcv package

I'm curious about the basis functions generated by the call to "s()" function with default parameter values, but even more specifically I'm curious about a smoother for a single variable varname that would explicitly have a linear term for that variable (a term perfectly correlated with that single variable on the entire real line). I'd like that linear term for the purposes of leveraging certain penalized regression techniques later on that would allow to determine whether the variable is best modeled linearly (via that one linear term) or non-linearly (via the entire spline). I know that, by default, s() delivers a thin plate spline. Presume I use k=4 for the dimension of the spline, then it gives me 3 spline terms (the "s(varname).1", "s(varname).2", "s(varname).3"). I don't fully understand how these are calculated, but I picked up on the fact that the last term (in this case, "s(varname).3") is perfectly correlated with the original variable varname . This tendency repeats itself for different k value (e.g. for k=6 it would be "s(varname).5" that's perfectly correlated with varname ) and for other variables. Would sincerely appreciate if someone could: Confirm that the last term of a thin plate spline generated by default " s() " function call for a single numeric variable will always be perfectly correlated with that variable Shed more light on precisely how these basis functions are calculated in case of a default " s() " function call for a single numeric variable Provide examples of other, non-default, spline types - among those provided by s() function - that explicitly include a linear term for the original variable (if any)?
