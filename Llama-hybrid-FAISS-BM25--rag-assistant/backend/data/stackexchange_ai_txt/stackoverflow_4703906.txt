php://input <> $_POST?

I'm experimenting with Firefox's Content Security Policy. Basically it's a special header for the webpage that tells the browser which resources are valid. When some resource is invalid because it's breaks the policy, Firefox sends a report to a given URI in json format. This is a typical report array(1) { ["csp-report"]=> array(4) { ["request"]=> string(71) "GET http://example.com/?function=detail&id=565 HTTP/1.1" ["request-headers"]=> string(494) "Host: example.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b10pre) Gecko/20110115 Firefox/4.0b10pre Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: es-ar,en-us;q=0.8,es;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Charset: UTF-8,* Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://example.com/index.php?function=search&query=Pata+de+cambio+ Cookie: the cookie " ["blocked-uri"]=> string(4) "self" ["violated-directive"]=> string(30) "inline script base restriction" } } The content type is application/json; charset=UTF-8 Now. I would expect this to be avaliable in $_POST as REQUEST_METHOD==POST but post is always empty. I can access it from php://input, but the question is: Why the request isn't avaliable in $_POST? I can't even use filter_input and $_REQUEST is empty...
