Programming language or tool for web-based Visio-like drawing as applied to product configurator

I have extensive experience with MS Visio Solution development, and have a need to provide similar functionality in a web interface in the context of a heavily visual product-builder or "configurator". Visio functionality that I hope to reproduce: Visual shapes stored in a sidebar, from which the user drags and drops onto a drawing area Shape creation on the user's end is probably not necessary... just arrangement, sizing, changing parameters etc A back-end for extracting the parts the user has dropped onto the drawing area, including the parameters they've changed, dimensions, relations between components etc In the most general sense, I just need an interactive interface. Given the above parameters, is Flash a good option? Is there a development environment that might be better?
