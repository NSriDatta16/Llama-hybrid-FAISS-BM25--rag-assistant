I don't think there is a standard way to choose a range (there are some heuristics for choosing a gamma value). I would look at the libsvm practical tutorial on getting started with SVMs. http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf Generally, I don't think you usually see C values that are so low. I would start with 2^-3 to 2^10 for C values and keep the gamma range the same. I would then run a coarse to fine grid search. It looks like you're using steps of 4? I would then search the area around the most accurate parameter set at a smaller step size, like 1. Hope this helps.
