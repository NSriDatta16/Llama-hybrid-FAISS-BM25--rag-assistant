Display Price Once on Magento Product Page

I want to show the product price only once on the Magento product page. Currently, it is displayed twice. I tried to change app/design/frontend/base/default/template/catalog/product/price.phtml , but didn't get it. I also tried app/design/frontend/base/default/template/catalog/view.phtml , but when I edited price.phtml the price is not up. So how can I do it? Any ideas? Thanks.
