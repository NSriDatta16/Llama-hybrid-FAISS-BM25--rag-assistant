Facebook app with an iframe on rails

I'm attempting to create a facebook app and went through the book http://pragprog.com/titles/mmfacer/developing-facebook-platform-applications-with-rails . Everything works fine on my development machine when I have my canvas render method set as fbml. But, for various reasons I want to build an app with an iframe. When I set my app to use an iframe I am unable to connect to my development machine. I went through a lot of different articles about creating an iframe app, but none seem to work. That includes http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Cross_Domain_Communication_Channel http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/XFBML and any other site found googling any combination of facebook, iframe, rails and others. I have the xd_receiver.htm file in my public directory and my layout looks like : FB_RequireFeatures(["XFBML"], function(){ FB.Facebook.init("my api key", "xd_receiver.htm"); }); My question is, what am I missing that is preventing facebook from connecting to my rails development machine when I set the canvas render method to iframe? Since my development log does not show any attempts of a connection, I'm guessing that it has something to do with the cross domain stuff, but I can't find a good answer about it anywhere.
