To MVVM or not to MVVM that is the question

I am rewriting my windows forms based application and I am going to use WPF. The application relies heavily on drag and drop techniques, in a very graphically environment. The uses "Design" reports etc. by dragging elements onto a grid, moving them, right click setting properies etc. all of which is saved to a database. Also control program flow by drawing flow charts, with routing and desicion making, all drawn on the form, and again save to a database. Does MVVM lend itself to this kind of application, or am I trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. Your thoughts are appriciated.
