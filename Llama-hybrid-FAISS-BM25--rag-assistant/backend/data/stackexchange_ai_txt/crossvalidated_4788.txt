The general sense in optimization is that if you have a convex function and no constraints, you want to use the "powerful stuff", gradient descent, Newton, etc. Without constraints interior point methods are not very good (competitive). In particular for the problem you're studying (binary logistic regression) you should consider trying simple stochastic gradient descent. Nothing really stops you from applying constrained optimization techniques to unconstrained problems. The same way nothing stops from pushing (instead of riding) your car to work. But you should definitely try interior point methods w/o constraints and convince yourself about it. Finally you mention that you want to try linear programming-based methods presumably without constraints, what you plan to do in this case I don't quite understand.
