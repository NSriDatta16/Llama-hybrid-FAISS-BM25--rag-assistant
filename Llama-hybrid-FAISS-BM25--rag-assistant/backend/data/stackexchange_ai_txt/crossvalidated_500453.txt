For GARCH-Student- $t$ model, the likelihood is available in MathWorks page "Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Conditional Variance Models" which references several sources. The relevant one is probably Bollerslev (1987) . For ARCH(m)-Student- $t$ model, the likelihood is available in Hamilton (1994) Chapter 21 Time Series Models of Heteroskedasticity, p. 662. For GARCH(p,q)-Normal model, the likelihood is available in Francq & Zakoian (2010) Chapter 7 Estimating GARCH Models by Quasi-Maximum Likelihood, pp. 142. For ARCH(p)-Normal model, the likelihood is available in Tsay (2010) Chapter 3 Conditional Heteroskedastic Models, pp. 120. References Bollerslev, T. (1987).
