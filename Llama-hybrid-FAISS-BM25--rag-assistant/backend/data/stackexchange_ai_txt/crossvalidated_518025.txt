An intuitive way to compute this $E(\hat{\mu})$ is to consider the following alternative, but equivalent, sampling process. Step 1: determine $n_1$ independently based on a binomial distribution (with probability $p$ equal to $pr(X>1)$ ). Step 2: draw $n_1$ variables $Y_1,\dots,Y_{n_1}$ from a normal distribution truncated on the left at 1. The variable $\bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n_1}\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} Y_i$ has the same distribution as your $\hat\mu$ . In this example we see that $E(\bar{Y}\vert n_1) = E(Y_\text{truncated})$ independent* from the sample size $n_1$ and so we also have $E(\bar{Y})= E(Y_\text{truncated})$ This means that the expectation value of your $\hat\mu$ does not equal the expectation of the normal distribution but instead the expectation value of a truncated normal distribution. Thus the estimator is not unbiased. Your equation $$\mathbb{E}(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{1}{n_1}\sum\limits_{X_i>1}\mathbb{E}(X_i)=\frac{1}{n_1}n_1\mu=\mu$$ Should have been $$\mathbb{E}(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{1}{n_1}\sum\limits_{X_i>1}\mathbb{E}(X_i|X_i>1)=\frac{1}{n_1}n_1E(Y_\text{truncated}) = E(Y_\text{truncated})$$ The parameter $n_1$ is a variable, as Michael M, mentions in the comments, so it is problematic to eliminate it. But because you get the term $n_1/n_1$ you do not have this problem. The expectation of the average of $n_1$ i.i.d. variables is independent from the sample size $n_1$ . *A tricky thing is what your expression means when $n_1 = 0$ . It is undefined in that case because you have a division $0/0$ .
