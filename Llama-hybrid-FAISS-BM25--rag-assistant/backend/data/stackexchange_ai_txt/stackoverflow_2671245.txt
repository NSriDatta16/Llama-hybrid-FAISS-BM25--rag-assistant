By going so large your strings are moved to the Large Object Heap (LOH) and you run a greater risk of fragmentation. A few options: Use a StringBuilder. You will be re-allocating less frequently. And try to pre-allocate, like new StringBuilder(100*1000*1000); re-design your solution. There must be alternatives to keeping such large strings around. A List for instance, that is only converted to 1 single string when (really) necessary.
