TCP RTT calculation timestamp

i have a simple question here, how to calculate the round-trip time in a tcp connection. I got the communication packets using tcpdump. In tcp packet, there are timestamp options, including TSval & TSecr. RFC 1323 says it can be used to calculate RTT. However, it didn't say how, or I didn't find it. Anyway, I am confused about this. Anyone can explain this to me? I just want to know how to calculate rtt for a single sent msg and it's ack, not the average rtt.
