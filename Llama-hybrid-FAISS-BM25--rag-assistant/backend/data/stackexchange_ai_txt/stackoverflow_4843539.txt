You would not do this in a single function nowadays. The 70's are over. You would define a function read-problem-set , which returns a list of rows, each of which is a list of characters. Then, you would define a function transpose , which transposes that to a list of columns. The "meat" of the calculation would be done by a function cost , which reads in a column and returns its cost. Finally, you can write a function output-column-costs , which writes a list to the specified file in the required format. Connect all the pieces in a function solve-problem : (defun solve-problem (in-file out-file) (output-column-costs out-file (mapcar #'cost (transpose (read-problem-set in-file)))))
