What does "Difference in AUROC significantly shifted from zero at the 0.05 level as compared to that of a random forest." mean?

As a starter, I am coming from an electronical engineering background with heavy signal processing focus. Due to our new funding in the lab, I have just started to read some papers regarding biomedical data analysis and I would like to learn the general lingo that is used in the tables or at least a guideline paper (or a book). As an example, I know what AUROC is but I did not understand what is meant by the sentence "*" below the Table 2. In addition, do the values in parenthesis on the right side of cell values indicate p-value or something else? Sorry for the newbie questions. EDIT: Link for the original paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101570/
