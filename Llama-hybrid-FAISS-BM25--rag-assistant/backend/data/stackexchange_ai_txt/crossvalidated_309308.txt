What's a "patch" in CNN?

By reading around, a "patch" seems to be a subsection of an input image to the CNN, but what exactly is it? When does a "patch" come into play when solving problems using CNN? Why do we need "patches"? What's the relation between a "patch" and a kernel (i.e. the feature detector)? I would appreciate if you can systematically answer to all those questions.
