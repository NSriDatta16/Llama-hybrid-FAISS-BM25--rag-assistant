If you are interested also in Machine Learning I will suggest : Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach . After said that is important to ask you to which field of biology you'd like to approach as a computer scientist. Since genetic is very popular I can suggest for now Introduction to Computational Biology . When you say 'I do not have a good experiece with biology' you mean you had some trouble with it in the past or you do not know a thing about it? (in the last case you'd better start to a common biology book for high schools)
