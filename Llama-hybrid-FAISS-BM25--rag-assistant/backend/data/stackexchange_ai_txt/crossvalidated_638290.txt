If it's overidentified IV (more instruments than endogeneous regressors), the second-stage $t$ -test can be severely distorted when instruments are weak (see for example Stock & Yogo (2005) p. 28 about the $F$ >10 rule). Recent research (Angrist & Kolesár, 2023), however, has shown that if you're using a single instrument, you can interpret your second-stage $t$ -test fairly reliably regardless of the first-stage $F$ -statistic unless there is extreme endogeneity. Our setup has two free parameters: the correlation between structural and first-stage residuals (henceforth, “endogeneity”), and the population first-stage $F$ -statistic. This fact lends itself to the construction of easily-interpreted rejection contours characterizing conventional second-stage $t$ -tests and confidence interval coverage rates. We see, for example, that for endogeneity less than about 0.76, 95% confidence interval coverage is distorted by no more than 5% for any population $F$ . This is explained by the fact that, even as median bias increases when the first stage gets weaker, second-stage precision falls (we focus on median bias because the conventional just-ID IV estimator has no moments). In contrast with the over-identified case, conventional just-ID IV standard errors reflect this, and confidence intervals widen accordingly. This fact keeps interval coverage high unless endogeneity is extraordinarily high. (Angrist & Kolesár, 2023) So, if both the first stage and the reduced form are significant and your results are robust to whatever checks you have devised to assess their credibility, I wouldn't worry too much about $F$ REFERENCES: Angrist, J., & Kolesár, M.
