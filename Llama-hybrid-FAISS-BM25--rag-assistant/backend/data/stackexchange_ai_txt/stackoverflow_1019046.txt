This is the Euler totient function , phi. It has the exciting property of being multiplicative: if gcd(m,n) = 1 then phi(mn) = phi(m)phi(n). And phi is easy to calculate for powers of primes, since everything below them is coprime except for the multiples of smaller powers of the same prime. Obviously factorization is still not a trivial problem, but even sqrt(n) trial divisions (enough to find all the prime factors) beats the heck out of n-1 applications of Euclid's algorithm. If you memoize, you can reduce the average cost of computing a whole lot of them.
