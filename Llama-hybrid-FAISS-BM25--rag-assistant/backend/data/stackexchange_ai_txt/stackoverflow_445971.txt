I would say try to use an OO framework (zend framework, cakephp, symphony) and create a configuration (xml based) to tell the loader which class should be loaded) that mean you can redifined class when you need to add a functionality to an existing feature or load new class. Magento for instance use this approach to allow plugins. But without more informations that's hard to tell.
