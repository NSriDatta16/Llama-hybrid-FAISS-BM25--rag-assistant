WebGL: Texture access in a vertex shader?

Is it possible to read from a texture in a vertex shader with WebGL? I wrote a WebGL page (just to try it out) and used Chrome 7 to test it. As soon as I upgraded to Chrome 8, it stopped working. I double checked that webgl is enabled. The error is: 'texture2D': no matching overloaded function found When I replace the call to texture2D with a constant, it works. Texture access in a fragment shader using the same texture also works. Anyone have any ideas? I'm particularly thrown by the fact that upgrading Chrome caused it to break. Update: It works in firefox 4 beta. I reported a bug with Chrome - issue 65340 Update 2: It now works in Firefox and Chrome
