The MLE estimate $\hat{\alpha}$ could be used as location parameter of a Normal distribution with scale parameter $\sigma$ used as prior distribution of the scaling parameter. Then, such a prior distribution can be updated into a posterior via Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, i.e. a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method used to obtain a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult. On the left: posterior distribution of the scaling parameter; light blue dotted lines represent the 90% High Density Interval, whereas the red solid line indicates the MLE estimate, which coincides with the median of the posterior distribution itself. On the right: the MCMC trace of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with 50,000 iterations and a burn-in of 5,000. Hereafter the R code: bayesian.estimate 0] ox
