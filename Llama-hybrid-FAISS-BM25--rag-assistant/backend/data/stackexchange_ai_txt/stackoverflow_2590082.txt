what's the best practice to config Hibernate-Spring for multiple database relationship?

We have a main mysql database which all of the applications within our organization need the data within this database. How can I config my java web application to use this database with it's specific database when I use Spring and Hibernate within my application? How can I config JPA annotations for example between CONTRACT table within my database and COUNTRY table within our main database? what's the best practice to do this?
