After upgrading the C++ standard library from GCC 3.3 to GCC 3.4 you must recompile all libraries linking against it if your program uses them and at the same time also links directly against the standard C++ library. In your case, considering your follow-up, libdb_cxx-4.2 is at fault, so rebuild Berkeley DB 4.2. Basically, mysqlTest links against both the new C++ standard library and Berkeley DB, but Berkeley DB links against the old one. The linker will pull in symbols from both libraries, but the inline storage class for some of them probably changed, and the Berkeley DB will get confused. To check what libraries you use, run ldd against your binaries, then run ldd against each C++ library in the list.
