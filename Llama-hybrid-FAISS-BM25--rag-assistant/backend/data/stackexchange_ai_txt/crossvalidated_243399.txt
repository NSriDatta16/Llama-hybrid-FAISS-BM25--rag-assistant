How can I execute an out of sample on step forecast in the forecast package using and xreg argument in the stlm function?

I am trying to program time series cross validation with the stlm function. The stlm function has the modelfunction and model arguments in order to hold the modelling constraints applied after stl decomposition constant. This should allow for me to test my model on multiple test sets. I cannot however get it to work with modelfunction = Arima whe I am also using an xreg argument. Below is a reproducible example. What am I doing wrong? library(fpp)#contains sample data library(forecast) #Training data milkUse
