You can create a list of primes using list comprehensions in a fairly elegant manner. Taken from here: >>> noprimes = [j for i in range(2, 8) for j in range(i*2, 50, i)] >>> primes = [x for x in range(2, 50) if x not in noprimes] >>> print primes >>> [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
