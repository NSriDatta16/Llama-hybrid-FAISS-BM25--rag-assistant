The short answer is no since a single character takes the same storage space as an integer. The long answer is it depends on how your application is written. I wrote an app once that had a gender field in the database with 0 or 1 because in the application layer I had an enum that mapped Gender.Female and Gender.Male to the 0 and 1 values, respectively.
