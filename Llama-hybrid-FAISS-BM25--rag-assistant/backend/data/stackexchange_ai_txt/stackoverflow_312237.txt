For the storage, you probably want a LinkedList of HashSets: LinkedList > l; For the problem: This is the SubSet problem, which is NP-Complete, so I don't think there's a known, fast way to do it. I haven't taken any optimization theory, so the best I could do is to just search through the powerset of your input and see if any of their sums match the output.
