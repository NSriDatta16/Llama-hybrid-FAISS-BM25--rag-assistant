A Bayesian point estimator is a summary of the posterior used for a specific purposed and justified by an optimisation principle associated with a utility function $U$ . The point estimate $\hat\theta(\cdot)$ is the function that maximises the posterior expected utility $$\mathbb E[U(\hat\theta,\theta)|x]=\int U(\hat\theta,\theta)\,\pi(\theta|x)\,\text d\theta$$ The posterior mean and the posterior median are associated with L² and L¹ utilities for instance. The posterior mode is not clearly associated with a utility function and its qualification as a Bayesian estimator is disputed .
