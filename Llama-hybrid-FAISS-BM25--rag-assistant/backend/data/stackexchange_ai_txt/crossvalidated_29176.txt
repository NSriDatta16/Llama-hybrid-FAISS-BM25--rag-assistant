Power analysis for observational study of secondary data

I am involved in a project that is attempting to measure the impacts of person-level, county-level and medical service area-level predictors on individual probability of returning to a hospital within a year window. I see this as a 3 level random effect logistic regression model. There are lots of predictors, probably 10 at the person level, 10 at the county and probably 5 at the hospital level. There are nearly 300,000 individuals nested withing 3000 counties and 154 hospitals. I would think that I should have good statistical power to detect differences in my outcome. My question, is: since the sample is already determined and I'm not collecting data (this is all secondary data), is a power analysis even appropriate? If it is appropriate, but my PI can't specify the effect size they are looking for, then what? I would appreciate any input the list may have on this problem. Best, Corey
