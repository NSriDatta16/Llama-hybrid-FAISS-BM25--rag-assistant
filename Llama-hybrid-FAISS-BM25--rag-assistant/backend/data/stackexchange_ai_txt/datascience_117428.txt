I don't recommend using PCA before clustering because it makes labelling clusters very difficult. PCA groups different features together and while this does reduce number of features, the resulting features are very different from the original and will likely make your cluster center naming very difficult. I think using simple statistical based filtering would suffice: check variance-covariance matrix to see if there are features that highly correlated and decide which to keep based on business knowledge check the variance of features. Features with very low variance will likely not contribute meaningfully to clustering. if there are categorical features that have many components, consider condensing the sparse components into "other" to avoid creating too many features when performing encoding. For auto selecting k in K-Means, there are actually quite a few ways you can auto select best k. One way is by silhouette score (select highest) or you can create an adjusted inertia formula that adds a penalty term for clusters. link to some post with their different approaches: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-determine-the-optimal-k-for-k-means-708505d204eb
