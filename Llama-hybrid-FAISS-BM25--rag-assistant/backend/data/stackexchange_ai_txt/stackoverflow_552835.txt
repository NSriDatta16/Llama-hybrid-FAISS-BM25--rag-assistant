Creating XML from SQL Server Data that Conforms to a Specific Schema

I've got data in a SQL Server 2005 table that I need to insert into an application using a SOAP web service that takes in an XML fragment. I'm looking at different options for this and I would like to know if it is possible to get SQL Server to return me XML that conforms to a particular Schema. If it is possible, how do I do it?
