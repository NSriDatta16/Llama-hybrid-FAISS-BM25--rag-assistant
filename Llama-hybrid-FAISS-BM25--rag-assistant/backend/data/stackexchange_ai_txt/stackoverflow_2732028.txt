How is a h264 idea bitstream organized? / header start codes

I was trying to learn a bit about h264 by looking at the bitstream of a video file with a hex editor. I found here the start codes for a video object planes (0x000001b6) and for i-frames (0x000001b600). But I can't find many of those bytes in video files. Most of the time those start codes appear at the beginning of a file with only a few bites in between. I expected them to show up very regularly, in equal distance all over the file!? Is is even ok to look at a file with a hex editor this way? What other start codes exist and how is a h264 file organised?
