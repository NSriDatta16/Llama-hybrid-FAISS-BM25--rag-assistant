Way to dealing with missing input values for each group

I am facing to a problem: I have tried to solve a binary classification problem and have a data set in which there are very many missing input values for its features. The training data looks like following; 0 X123474229,X51578397,X420128991,X174205309,X773579,X62718521,X773545,X51769735,X44092910,X41787959,X79805718,X344420902,X40087738,X374616379,X56982947,X62716332,Y2,Y1132,Y2267,Y2257,Y1080,Y1555,Y1222,Y1238,Y1702,Y2680,Y1705,Y1367,Y1353,Y2321,Y1486,Y1522,Y1940,Y977,Z4,Z15,Z25 0 X123474229,X302743259,X48786947,X89474323,X283926738,X62718521,X277692318,X315340932,X44092910,X417167762,X137608184,X216091985,X79805718,X147204623,X104964213,X236398246,X127436348,X367227997,X344420902,Y3269,Y3250,Y3232,Y3141,Y3143,Y2680,Y1705,Y2684,Y1725,Y2641,Y1690,Y2949,Y3021,Y2307,Y2321,Y1940,Z4,Z15 0 X123474229,X18006172,X564074277,X48786947,X442767451,X337793919,X277692318,X315340932,X104923833,X524837224,X44092910,X417167762,X551805107,X103413307,X216091985,X79805718,X147204623,X104964213,X127436348,X367227997,X344420902,X538427688,Y3269,Y1132,Y3250,Y3233,Y1080,Y3232,Y1555,Y1222,Y1238,Y3145,Y3143,Y1702,Y2680,Y1705,Y1725,Y2641,Y2170,Y1690,Y3021,Y2557,Y2307,Y1478,Y2321,Y1486,Y2024,Y1522,Y2817,Y3346,Y1940,Y977,Y1468,Z4,Z15,Z22 1 X773579,X344420902,X56982947,Y2,Y1478,Z4,Z15,Z27 1 X344420902,Y2,Z4,Z13,Z22 The first number in each line is an output (0/1) and the others in the same line are input data. As you can see, the number of data is inconsistent and the data looks to possibly be grouped/indexed by X, Y and Z for a batch of input. I am thinking of using logistic regression for this. Could you please advise me on what kind of methods can be utilized to deal with this data set as input? Thank you so much. Best regards.
