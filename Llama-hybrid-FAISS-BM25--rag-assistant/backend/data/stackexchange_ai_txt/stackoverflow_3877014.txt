Create common context menu in WPF

In my app I have many grids (Infragistics). I would like to create a context menu that will implement many of the common functions ie: delete, save layout, etc. and if a specific grid needs more than the common functions be able to add to the menu for that grid. I would like to create one context menu and not have to repeat the same code throughout project. I have no idea on how to accomplish this. Possible? Example xaml and/or code will be helpful. Thanks a bunch, Rick
