You would need to build a set of functions that compute the probability of a particular transform between two images f(A,B). A number of transforms have previously been suggested as answers, e.g. Fourier. You would probably not be able to compute the probability of multiple transforms in one go fgh(A,B) with any reliability. So, you would compute the probability that each transform was independently applied f(A,B) g(A,B) h(A,B) and those with P above a threshold are the solution. If the order is important, i.e you need to know that f(A,B) then g(f,B) then h(g,B) was performed, then you would need to adopt a state based probability framework such as Hidden Markov Models or a Bayesian Network (well, this is a generalization of HMMs) to model the likelihood of moving between states. See the BNT toolbox for Matlab ( http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/BNT/bnt.html ) for more details on these or any good modern AI book.
