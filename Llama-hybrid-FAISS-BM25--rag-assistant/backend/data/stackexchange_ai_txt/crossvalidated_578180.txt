I know this is an old post but I just had the same question as to the OP. Thanks to/based on @rapio's description, this is how I would say the same thing: Both a learner and a classifier refer to the same thing: a machine learning model. It's just that an ML model has aspects to it while in the training phase which are hidden and taken away when the model is being used for inference. For example, in the training phase, we have an optimizer that guides the backpropagation algorithm on how to update the model weights. Or the learning rate. These parts of the model are stripped away once the model is done training. In other words, the model that you'll have at inference is not exactly the same concept when you are training it. That's why in some literature, they are referred to by different names. Basically, when you say "learner" you are putting an emphasis on the aspect of the model that exists only in the training phase. Personally, I wish people would stop nitpicking so much and just call it a model. In my opinion, this level of differentiation is not helping anyone.
