Feed enough examples into a learning algorithm. In pseudocode: L = learn_plus_one() L.teach("12","13") L.teach("3","4") L.teach("99","100") after being taught enough examples, it should figure out that 73 plus one is 74, even though it really knows nothing about addition, its just discovered the pattern from the examples. So what does learn_plus_one look like? Well that could be a neural network, or any other machine learning system really. Your question is quite vague so I cant be specific.
