Get the distance from the given number by subtracting and using the abs function: select top 4 Number from NumberTable where number <> 1009 order by abs(Number - 1009) Edit: As you now mention that you have a very large table, you would need a way to elliminate most of the results first. You could pick the four closest in both direction and then get the correct ones from that: select top 4 Number from ( select Number from ( select top 4 Number from NumberTable where number 1009 order by number ) ) order by abs(Number - 1009) If the numbers are evenly distributed so that you are sure that you can find the numbers in a range like for example +-100 numbers, you can simply get that range first: select top 4 Number from ( select Number from NumberTable where number between 1009-100 and 1009+100 ) where number <> 1009 order by abs(Number - 1009)
