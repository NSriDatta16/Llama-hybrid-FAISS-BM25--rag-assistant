The first data frame includes multiple $i$ students and their associated test scores measured at two distinct time periods $t$ . The before-and-after scores (i.e., pre- versus post-test) are juxtaposed side-by-side, giving the data frame a wide display. You then propose the following model which I reproduced below: $$ Y_i = \alpha + \beta T_i + \gamma A_i + \delta (T_i \times A_i) + \epsilon_i, $$ which includes the appropriate variables but the wrong subscripts! For instance, every variable is $i$ -subscripted, indicating you observe individual grades in one time period . $T_i$ is appropriately subscripted; it should index students in your treatment group, 0 otherwise. $A_i$ , on the other hand, is devoid of a $t$ -subscript despite denoting the post-intervention period. It should equal 1 in the "after" period in both treatment and control groups. The $i$ -subscript appended to $A$ does not account for the simple passage of time between tests. If applied to your first data frame which only includes one observation per student, then a linear model run in standard software cannot disambiguate between pre- and post-test grades unless it is stacked. It will not return a difference-in-differences estimate. Here is the appropriate model, which is estimable if used on your second (stacked) data frame: $$ Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta T_i + \gamma A_t + \delta (T_i \times A_t) + \epsilon_{it}, $$ where you observe students $i$ in time periods $t$ . By stacking observations, you do not lose the second time period as your question suggests. $A_t$ is a column vector and distinguishes between pre- and post-test values. In most software packages, the data must be formatted in this manner (i.e., long format). I hope it is obvious how the wide display might become unwieldy in settings with serial observations before-and-after treatment. Suppose you sample multiple $i$ students at a university and observe a series of outcomes for each student over 100 consecutive days. Now suppose you also adjusted for a series of time-varying covariates at the student level. Would you organize your data in a wide display in this setting? In my opinion, the stacked display is the way to go. Even though I don't particularly advise it, you can certainly structure your data where each row corresponds to one student. In the classical case with two discrete groups (i.e., treatment group versus control group) and two discrete time periods (i.e., pre-treatment versus post-treatment), simply organize your data in a 2x2 table. Calculate the average grade in both groups before-and-after your exposure of interest. You can then perform the basic difference-in-differences calculation by hand. But again, I wouldn't recommend the extra effort. If you have many $i$ students and the data is stacked, simply estimate the foregoing regression. It is easier and you also obtain your standard errors—for free. In the psychological sciences, it is common to observe applied researchers use the change score approach: $$ Y_2 - Y_1 = \gamma + \beta T_i + \epsilon_i, $$ where the differences between two grades (i.e., $t_2 - t_1$ ) is regressed on a treatment dummy. This is yet another approach where you can keep your data in your desired structure (i.e., one individual $i$ per row). Your estimate of $\beta$ in the foregoing example should equal the coefficient on your interaction term in the stacked difference-in-differences regression. For more information on this approach, peruse this paper by Lüdtke and Robitzsch (2020), or review this post which also references the paper. To conclude, you correctly note that swapping two students' grades in your treatment group should not affect your estimate in the simple 2x2 case with four cell means. I hasten to add that you shouldn't use a regression model on your "grouped" data frame which only includes four observations. Even though software may spit out coefficients, you have no residual degrees of freedom! Thus, you have no hope of calculating statistics in this setting. As a final word, I encourage you to stack your observations and estimate the second model outlined above. Let software do the work for you! This structure is handy once you start adding more students—and more time periods.
