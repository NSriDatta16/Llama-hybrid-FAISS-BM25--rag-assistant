If you need to log the values you can use reflection to build a string description of your objects. Lots of platforms have ready-made libraries that can do things like this for your. I really can't see many sensible use cases for logging from inside the domain model. Actually with good test coverage there's not many good technical use cases for logging at all . I suppose there may be some nice legal ones.
