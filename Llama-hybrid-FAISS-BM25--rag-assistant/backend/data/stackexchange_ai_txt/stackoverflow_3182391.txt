XamlWriter/Reader -> multiple constructor calls resulting in duplicate elements

i'm kind of stuck here. i'm using a dragndrop-library which serializes the dragged UIElements via XamlWriter.Save(). now i'm trying to dragndrop some instances of a class extending Grid. in the constructor i push some elements into the visual tree. the constructor gets called when the object is deserialized and the elements get added again (and again and again depending on how often i dragndrop). sadly Children.Count tells me there are no child elements if i retrieve the value from within the constructor. if i retrieve it from outside (by myGrid.Children.Count) it gives me the higher (unwanted) amount. is there any other function i should use to initialize the visuals? or any other way to prevent those duplicates? thanks and cheers
