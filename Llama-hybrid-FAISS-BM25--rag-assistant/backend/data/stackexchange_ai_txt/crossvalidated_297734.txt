Bayesian update of normal distribution given noisy binary search response

How do we go about calculating a posterior with a prior given N data points of the form greater than X or less than Y , when those data points are noisy (that is, greater than X can be incorrect)? Example: We start with the posterior normal distribution of variable X with mean 1 and variance 1. We do series of tests with the following results: test x=1: less than X test x=2: less than X test x=5: greater than X test x=6: less than X test x=4: greater than X test x=10: greater than X test x=12: greater than X Given such results, I'd think that that mean of X variable is not 1 - probably something around 5 . But how can I derive this mean and variance?
