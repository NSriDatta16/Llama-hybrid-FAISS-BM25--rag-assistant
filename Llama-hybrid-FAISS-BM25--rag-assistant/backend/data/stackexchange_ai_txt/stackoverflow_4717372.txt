choose_devices is your named route. Rails automatically generates two methods per named route as route helpers for you. They are always named in the following convention: named_route_path named_route_url You can use either (although path is usually encouraged). Using choose_devices_path will return /account/devices/choose whereas choose_devices_url will return something like localhost:3333/account/devices/choose or it actually may error out if you do not set your host appropriately in config files (it's been a long time since I explicitly used a _url named route helper, so not sure on that part). You can also read up on these specifically at the rails routing guide.
