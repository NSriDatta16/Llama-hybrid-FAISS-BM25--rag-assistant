Try looking at other large organization to see what they're using. MS's proof of concept for very large databases is TerraServer , which is running a database that is several terabytes in size. Any database will have problems with a small dataset if you are doing table scans, cartesian products, expensive calculations for each row, etc. To really stress a relational db with a table of 2 million rows, you'd have to be doing cross tabs while doing a large number of inserts and updates and then you'd want to switch to an olap datastore. Do you have anything else to describe the expected workload? Is this mostly readonly, read write, etc?
