Variational Autoencoder and Covariance Matrix

Why does the encoder from a variational autoencoder map to a vector of means and a vector of standard deviations? Why does it not instead map to a vector of means and a covariance matrix ? Is it because we want our latent vectors to have zero covariance between components?
