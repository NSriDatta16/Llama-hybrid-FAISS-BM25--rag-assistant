Distribution Cert has no private key. Valid signing ident matching profile cannot be found

I've been able to generate and use my development cert & provision for some time. I did have some problems after upgrading xcode, in that the login certs where getting trashed/removed, but I fixed that. I'm trying to create my distribution cert & provision. I've noticed that the distribution cert doesn't have a private key - you can't expand the cert when clicking on it. Not sure if that's an issue or not. When I drag the distribution profile into Organizer, it comes up with the error message, "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain". I've tried putting the distribution cert in both login and system. I also DO have the WWDRCA cert installed. Any ideas - A real pain ...
