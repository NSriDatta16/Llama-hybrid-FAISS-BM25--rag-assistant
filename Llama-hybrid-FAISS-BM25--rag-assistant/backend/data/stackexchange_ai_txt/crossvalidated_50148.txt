How to set up a posterior predictive test quantities (Bayesian context) to check for independent Poisson distributions?

Suppose we are given data $y_j \sim \text{Poi}(\lambda)$ and assume $y_j$ are iid. We can assume the prior distribution for $\theta$ follows $\text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$, The posterior distribution of $\theta | y$ is also Gamma while the posterior predictive distribution is Negative Binomial. My question is that after deriving everything above, how would you go about setting up a posterior predictive test quantities to check for independent Poisson distributions? Notice that test quantity is a function of parameters and data in a Bayesian context. It is similar to a test statistic in classical statistic.
