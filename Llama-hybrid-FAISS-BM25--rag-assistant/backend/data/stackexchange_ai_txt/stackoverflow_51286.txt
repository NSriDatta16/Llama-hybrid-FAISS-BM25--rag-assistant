Multiple identity storage per application? Might not be a single sign on solution, but have you try looking into something that is more targetted solution like MS Identity Lifecycle Manager? It will simplify identity synchronization between applications and it's pluggable as well, meaning you can hook up your own code to do the synchronization between different system. So if you change the identity info (i.e. login info) in ILM portal, you can propagate those to the different systems. Same thing for provisioning and deprovisioning identity. Single point of entry. I supposed you can use biztalk also for similar thing. As for truly single sign on solution where you just logged in once and you don't have to login again to different applications. I've yet to find one. I supposed if your legacy apps has a pluggable identity provider module, it's doable, meaning you can customize the login system to hook up to your single identity source of truth whatever that maybe.
