Sure. Heck, you can replace arithmetic with LINQ queries . But you shouldn't. The purpose of a query expression is to represent a query operation . The purpose of a "for" loop is to iterate over a particular statement so as to have its side-effects executed multiple times. Those are frequently very different. I encourage replacing loops whose purpose is merely to query data with higher-level constructs that more clearly query the data. I strongly discourage replacing side-effect-generating code with query comprehensions, though doing so is possible.
