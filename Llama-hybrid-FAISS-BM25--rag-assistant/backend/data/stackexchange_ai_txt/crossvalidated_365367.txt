The two older answers already give you a good sense, yet I would like to add some points about the nature of unit-roots and unit root testing. Please refer to the following question in order What is the difference between a stationary test and a unit root test? Here is the part of my answer which matters for you: How unit-root test and stationarity-test complement each other If you have a time series data set how it usually appears in econometric time series I propose you should apply both a Unit root test: (Augmented) Dickey Fuller or Phillips-Perron depending on the structure of the underlying data and a KPSS test. Case 1 Unit root test: you can’t reject $H_0$ ; KPSS test: reject $H_0$ . Both imply that series has unit root. Case 2 Unit root test: Reject $H_0$ . KPSS test: don`t reject $H_0$ . Both imply that series is stationary. Case 3 If we can’t reject both test: data give not enough observations. Case 4 Reject unit root, reject stationarity: both hypothesis are component hypothesis – heteroskedasticity in series may make a big difference; if there is structural break it will affect inference. Power problem: if there is small random walk component (small variance $σ^2$ u ), we can’t reject unit root and can’t reject stationarity. Your data does not reject a unit root or reject stationarity. Certain hypothesis tests reject a unit root or reject stationarity. Maybe you can go deeper into hypothesis testing for unit roots and stationarity and there won't be any contradiction between unit roots and stationarity anymore. If your data has a structural break it means that a pattern in the data "breaks" exactly one time. If your data has a unit root it means that a pattern in the data "breaks" in every time period. However there are various possibilities between "one break" and a "break in every time period". The paper Multiple Trend Breaks And The Unit-Root Hypothesis by Lumsdaine and Papell examines the possibility of having more than one structural break in the data. They also show a test for testing for more than one structural break.
