The first thing to note is that you don't use logistic regression as a classifier. The fact that $Y$ is binary has absolutely nothing to do with using this maximum likelihood method to actually classify observations. Once you get past that, concentrate on the gold standard information measure which is a by-product of maximum likelihood: the likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ statistic. You can produce a chart showing the partial contribution of each predictor in terms of its partial $\chi^2$ statistic. These statistics have maximum information/power. You can use the bootstrap to show how hard it is to pick "winners" and "losers" by getting confidence intervals on the ranks of the predictive information provided by each predictor once the other predictors are accounted for. An example is in Section 5.4 of my course notes - click on Handouts. If you have highly correlated features you can do a "chunk test" to combine their influence. A chart that does this is given in Figure 15.11 where size represents the combined contribution of 4 separate predictors.
