XgBoost Simulation Relative Importance

I am using Xgboost to find the relative contribution of features to the dependent variables. I am running a simulation wherein I'm generating a simulated data-set based on a prespecified mean and variance. There are 6 independent variables X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6. The dependent variable dep is an average of these 6 variables. Therefore, XGBOOST should output a rel contribution of 1/6 for each variable. However, this is not what I am getting when I am running the code. I have attached the code for your reference. Can anyone tell where am I going wrong? #Creating the data set set.seed(123456789) cov_sim1 # Setting parameter and tuning xgb_trcontrol #Fitting the model and extracting feature importance d $dep, trControl = xgb_trcontrol, tuneGrid = xgb_grid, method = "xgbTree", nthread = 10, verbose = FALSE, metric = "RMSE", verbosity = 0 ) bestfit bestTune nrounds_bestfit $dep, max.depth = max_depth_bestfit, nround = nrounds_bestfit, eta = eta_bestfit, min_child_weight Feature),] ac I have tried to standardize the variables as well. That does not change the output by much? My initial thinking is that it depends on the variance of the dependent variables. But, not sure.
