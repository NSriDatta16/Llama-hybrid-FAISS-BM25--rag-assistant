Personally, I've found that I have an element or two and I would put an inline style in, go back and see that I need more than that element, so I'd change it to a class or forget about it and be not able to change it. You could also try putting a certain div / page class, and write descendent styles for that in the stylesheet instead of inline elements. Also, if you ever decide to add javascript, you won't already have a well-labeled class there and you'll need to change it. Usually this isn't much problem with dynamically generated websites, but it can become a large problem when you go overboard and have tons of inline tags to switch out. It also can make it harder for people if they wish to disable styles for accessability etc-- you usually can overcome this by using a class. Say, using bold instead of body.products div b {color:red}. I'm personally a fan of selectors, not using too many classes. They are more reusable, and you can edit the whole site in one place with the stylesheets. But this is overkill Indented Bold Paragraph so it this text instead you can do or `` .
