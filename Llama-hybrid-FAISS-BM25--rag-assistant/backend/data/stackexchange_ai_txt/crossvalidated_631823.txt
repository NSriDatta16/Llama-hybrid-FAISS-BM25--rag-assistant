I mean is it ok to dig for significant interactions once my effect initially fails to show significance, given no expert / literature knowledge exists about the existence of such interaction effects. In a word, "No". Digging for statistical significance increases the probability you find at least one statistically significant result, even if there are no true effects to be found. You should pre-specify all analyses and stick only to those analyses you intend to perform. If you do go ahead with this sort of "digging", I would encourage you to report those analyses exploratory, refrain from reporting p values, and be very modest in conclusions made therefrom.
