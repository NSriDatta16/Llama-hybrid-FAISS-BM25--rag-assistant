count the occurrences of a specific character in the input

Possible Duplicate: How do I count the number of occurrences of a char in a String? I am looking to count the occurrences of a specific character, for example "i" that occurs in the input. Example, from standard input: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. This returns 6 , because there are 6 occurrences of the letter "i" (case matters). This could be accomplished with a loop stepping through the string with charAt(i) . Is there a more elegant way to accomplish this?
