How to have a "None of the above" category in a Logistic Regression?

I have a Logistic Regression supervised classifier that is trained on n=365 observations and m=179 attributes with c=5 classes . It's performing at 94.9% accuracy using a very robust cross-validation procedure. The model naively assumes that each of the new observations will fall into one of those categories but there may be an instance where there is a completely unknown class. Is there a way to model a None of the above category? I was going to look at the probabilities but the probabilities are very high for predictions even if the model predicted it incorrectly.
