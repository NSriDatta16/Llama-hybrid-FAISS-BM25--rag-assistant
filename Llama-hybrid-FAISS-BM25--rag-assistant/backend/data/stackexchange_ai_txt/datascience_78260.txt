For somebody new to ML you're starting with a quite complex problem! Your first job is to formalize the problem: what exactly do you want to predict and from which information? Do you want to predict whenever a specific signal will occur, or whenever any one of several specific signals occurs, or detect any unusual pattern...? In the first two cases your task is supervised classification, detecting unusual patterns would probably be unsupervised outlier detection. In the case of supervised classification, which seems more compatible with your description, you're going to use the specific signal to detect as target variable: your features are made of a sequence of data until time $t$ , and the target variable is 0 or 1 depending on whether the signal occurs in the next 30 mns. There's a lot of good advice that you can use in the related question you mention. You could consider sequence labeling methods, but there are certainly a lot of other options. I'm not so sure you will need dimensionality reduction in your case: the signals you're using as features are binary so your features are much less complex than in the related question.
