Should the logistic regression equation always result in a value between 0 and 1?

I am a medical scientist but an amateur statistician (not even amateur). I have a simple question. Here is the output from a logistic regression examining a number of variables which may predict if a doctor will perform a biopsy in a patient or not. So the dependent variable is "biopsy or not". It's been run in 24240 doctor-patient consultation. What I want to do is evaluate the relationship between these variables and biopsy decisions in each INDIVIDUAL doctor-patient consultation using the logistic regression equation and these coefficients. My primary question is: If apply: age * -.02742 + dlco * 0.0053058 + pioped_intermediate * 1.244477 + pioped_ipf_intermediate * 0.172851 + .6047641 to an individual doctor-patient consultation, am I correct in thinking I should get a result between 0 and 1? If I am getting values that range from -1.6 to +1.5 does that indicate there is a mistake in my calculations? I hope this makes sense (and its acceptable to upload a screenshot).
