How to find what events cluster together?

I have a data set that looks at a five-year timespan of peoples' lives and indicates if specific events have occurred (Divorce, Birth of Child, Health Shock, etc.). # Sample data in R n First thing I did was simply show a correlation matrix. cor(exampleFrame) And it gives an idea of what items follow each other, so next I ran a logistic regression to see how events are likely to improve odds of occurring together. glm(Event1 ~ . - Person,family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = exampleFrame) And this is interesting, but I feel like I'm missing something more compelling. Am I chasing a phantom? Does anyone know a better way to demonstrate which life events occur together in this five-year span?
