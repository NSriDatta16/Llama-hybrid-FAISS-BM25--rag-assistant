I don't believe you can do this reliably (signatures used to begin with '--' but I don't see that anymore). Perhaps you're better off asking people to reply inbetween text headers and then simply strip the reply from this ? It's not elegant, but perhaps more reliable. e.g. REPLY BETWEEN HERE --> AND HERE --> so you'd simply look for the required headers above and take what's inbetween.
