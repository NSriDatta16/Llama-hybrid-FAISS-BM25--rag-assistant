My first, and unfinished, project in Silverlight was started in November 2007. I was designing a poll map of the US in which the user could see realtime vote count, hover over a state and get a detailed breakdown. Similar to John King's Magic Map. My newborn twins were three months old at the time, so I didn't have a chance to finish it but it was great experience. Silverlight is great for very visual applications. Some more ideas: Anything geographical, like the polling stuff. There is a free XAML USA map available, Google "XAML USA map". Graphs, charts, etc. There are some third-party controls available for this or you could experiment with rolling your own. Drag and Drop type interfaces can really pop with Silverlight. Games! (My personal favorite)
