How to mimic DropBox functionality with Ruby script?

I would like to upload documents to GoogleDocs every time the OS hears that a file was added/dragged/saved in a designated folder, just the way DropBox uploads a file when you save it in the DropBox folder. What would this take in Ruby, what are the parts? How do you listen for when a File is Saved? How do you listen for when a File is added to a Folder? I understand how to use the GoogleDocs API and upload things once I get these events, but I'm not sure how this would work. Update While I still don't know how to check if a file is added to a directory, listening for when a file is saved is now dirt simple, thanks to Guard for ruby.
