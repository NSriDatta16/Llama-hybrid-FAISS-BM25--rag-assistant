What exactly would be a perfect map in this situation? Is a perfect map a distribution which has the same independence assumptions?

I am currently studying Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning by David Barber , the 4th chapter exercise 4.7 (p 80). The exercise is the following: Consider the following belief network: Write down a Markov Network of $p(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ Is your Markov Network a perfect map of $p(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ ? I have done 1. It was simple - just sum over $h_1$ and $h_1$ and then $x_1,x_2,x_3$ are coupled and my solution is the same as in the solution manual. I didn't know how to do (2) so I looked at the solution manual and didn't quite understand their answer: This is not a perfect map since in $p(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ we have $x_1 \perp\kern-5pt\perp x_3 | \emptyset$ , which is violated by the Markov Network representation. I don't fully understand 2 things: What exactly would be a perfect map in this situation? (an example of a perfect map would be great) Is a perfect map a distribution which has the same independence assumptions? Isn't the independence $x_1 \perp\kern-5pt\perp x_2 | \emptyset$ also violated?
