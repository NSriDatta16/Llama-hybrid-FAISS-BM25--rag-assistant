Implementing random forest to predict the success rate and time of completion

I have a large dataset with more than 120 columns for which I'm trying to classify whether the order will be successful or not. There are two parameters that I need to figure out. One is the probability of survival for each row in the dataset, and the other is the time it'll take to reach the state of 0 or 1. I am implementing random forest classifiers to predict the success rate, but not sure how to predict the time of completion. Can you please guide me to some resources that can be useful with this issue. Edit: I guess it is more of trying to predict the individuals survival rate, giving an estimated number of days left until completion.
