I'm not aware of licensing so I can't answer your question officially. But I know now that Sharepoint 2010 uses SQL Express 2008 R2 (not that different windows database) that does have database limit of 10 gb however blobs are now stored with filestream that changes the storage game. in Summary: I Believe you can change the auth to mixed mode, however you will not be able to connect through it remotelly due to a sql express restriction.
