Weights of random sets of random 32-bit strings

I have random sets of $N$ random 32-bit strings, where all bits are i.i.d. with $\mathbb{P}(0) = \mathbb{P}(1) = 1/2$. Define $\ \ \ \ $weight( 32-bit x ) = number of 1 bits in x, i.e. Hamming distance to 0 $\ \ \ \ $minweight( set $X$ ) = min$_{\text{x} \in X}$ weight( x ) How does the average minweight( $X$ ) vary with $N$, the size of $X$ ? My $N$ is small enough that it doesn't matter whether $X$ has duplicates, or not. A back-of-the envelope estimate would be fine. (A harder question is to analyze the algorithm for bit-string-nearest-neighbour-searching on stackoverflow, but that seems rather specialized. If anyone could suggest another forum or reference, I'd appreciate it.)
