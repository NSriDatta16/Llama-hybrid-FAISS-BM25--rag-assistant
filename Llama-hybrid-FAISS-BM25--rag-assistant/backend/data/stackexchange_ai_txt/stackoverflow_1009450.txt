I typically organize my folders based on my namespaces. For example, classed in the namespace "Company.Project.DataAccess" would be stored in company/project/dataAccess directory. I admit that this is still slightly painful to manage opening files. However, Resharper 's "Go to type" feature has eliminated all of my searching in Solution Explorer.
