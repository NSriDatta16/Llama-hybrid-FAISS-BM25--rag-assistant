Is Faster RCNN the same thing as VGG-16, RESNET-50, etc... or not?

My understanding is that Faster RCNN is an architecture for performing object detection. It finds objects in an image and classifies them. My understanding is also that VGG-16, RESNET-50, etc... also find objects in images and classify them. Are VGG-16, RESNET-50, etc... object detection architectures in the same way that Faster RCNN is? I often see VGG-16, RESNET-50, etc... as the "backbone" for Faster RCNN and am seriously confused by the literature. Thanks in advance!
