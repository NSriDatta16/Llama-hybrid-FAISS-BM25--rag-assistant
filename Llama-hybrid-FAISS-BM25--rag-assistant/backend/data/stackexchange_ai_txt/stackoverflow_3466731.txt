I believe I have found the mistake, and it wasn't actually in the code above. When I set up the storage array, I did like so: @storage = [Memory_location.new] * 1000 Believing it would create 1000 different objects. What I think actually happened, was that it created 1000 references to the same object, so when I changed one of them, I changed all of them. I could prove this by using the puts method on two different array locations, with both of them returning: #{Memory_location:0x2bc8b74}
