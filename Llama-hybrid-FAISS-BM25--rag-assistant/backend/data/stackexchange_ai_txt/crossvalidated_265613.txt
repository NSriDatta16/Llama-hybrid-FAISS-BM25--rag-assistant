Bayesian Data Analysis Problem 4 b: normal approximation of football point outcomes

The problem is as follows (Ch 1, problem 4 b, p. 27, 3rd edition): There were twelve games with point spreads of 8 points; the outcomes in those games the point difference was −7, −5, −3, −3, 1, 6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 20, and 21, with positive values indicating wins for the favorite after including the point spread. Use a normal distribution to approximate the distribution of (outcome - point spread) The solution models the distribution as $N \sim (0, 13.86^2)$. How do we know that the mean is centered at 0? Are we assuming that the point spread is an unbiased estimate of the outcome? Why is the standard deviation 13.86? The (population) standard deviation is 10.1 instead. sd(c(-7, -5, -3, -3, 1, 6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 20, 21) - 8) # 10.1 Reference: Gelman, Andrew, et al. Bayesian data analysis. Vol. 3.
